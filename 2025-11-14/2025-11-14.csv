            Three Chinese astronauts landed back on Earth on Friday, according to state media, more than a week later than their scheduled landing, capping an extended stay in space after a suspected debris hit left their spaceship with a cracked window.
    


            After the capsule hatch opened medical teams found that the astronauts were in good physical condition, Chinese state media outlet CCTV reported.
    


            The crew of the Shenzhou-20 spaceflight had been due to finish their mission at China's Tiangong space station last Wednesday; they'd even handed the keys to the space station to a new crew who had just arrived for their own six-month mission.
    


            But instead, their journey home was postponed “due to a suspected impact from tiny space debris” to their ship, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.
    


            After a nine-day wait, they finally headed home on the Shenzhou-21 spacecraft that transported the incoming crew, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).
    


            The damaged Shenzhou-20 ship had “a slight crack” in the window of its return capsule, likely caused by debris impact, making it unsafe for the crew to return in, according to the CMSA. The ship will stay in orbit to carry out experiments instead, the agency said.
    


            During their extra week in space, the crew continued working and living alongside the newly arrived Shenzhou-21 astronauts, as the space station has enough capacity to support two crews in orbit, according to Xinhua.
    


            The Tiangong station is only one of two operating space stations, alongside the International Space Station. Since it was completed in 2022, the biannual launches of China's Shenzhou program have been a source of national pride.
    


            Recent advances have seen China break an American-held record for the longest spacewalk, with a nine-hour sortie, and it's about to open the doors of the Tiangong to foreigners for the first time, with plans to welcome an astronaut from Pakistan next year.
    


            The new crew on board the Shenzhou-21 – who are now without a spaceship to return in – include China's youngest astronaut to be sent to space, 32-year-old Wu Fei.
    


            The Shenzhou-22, due to launch sometime next year, will include one astronaut who stays more than a year for a “long-duration residency experiment,” Xinhua reported.
    


            China's rapid development in space exploration has raised alarm bells in Washington, which is racing to put an astronaut on the moon again. The Trump administration placed bans on Chinese citizens with US visas participating in NASA programs.
    


            The US space agency is familiar with the difficulties of retrieving astronauts stuck in space. What was meant to be a short stay on the International Space Station stretched into a more than nine-month mission for two American astronauts earlier this year after their spacecraft malfunctioned. They eventually returned home in March.
    


            Both countries are also competing in nascent institution-building efforts, with the US-led Artemis Accords on lunar exploration matched up against the Chinese- and Russian-led International Lunar Research Station.

            More than half a million people in South Korea sat for the country's grueling university entrance exam on Thursday as police mobilized to ensure they made it to the test sites on time and all flights were halted for half an hour.
    


            The number sitting the test, essential to secure a place at the country's top universities, was the highest in seven years. Most of the candidates were born in 2007 when there was a surge in births because it was considered an auspicious time to have a baby.
    


            Flights at all airports, including Incheon International Airport, were banned from landing or takeoff between 1:05 p.m. and 1:40 p.m. to ensure there was no disturbance while the students sat for the listening comprehension section of the English test.
    


            The decision affected 140 flights, including 65 international arrivals and departures. Flight trackers showed aircraft circling near airports as the Transport Ministry restricted aircraft from altitudes below 3,000 meters (9843 ft).
    


            Financial markets and offices opened an hour later than usual to ensure test candidates arrived on time for the nine-hour exam that is seen as crucial for success in the hyper-competitive society.
    


            “This exam has been a goal for nearly 20 years and also a new beginning,” said Yeseon Kim, who was waiting outside a test site where her daughter was sitting the exam.
    


            A total of 554,174 people registered this year, up 6% from last year and the highest since 2019. Some 496,000 babies were born in 2007 in a jump that paused a steady decline since the mid-1990s.
    


            South Korea is one of the world's fastest-aging societies, although its birthrate rose to 0.75 in 2024.

            The Israeli government identified the deceased hostage whose remains were handed over by Hamas on Thursday as Manny Godard, 73, an Israeli resident of a kibbutz near the Gaza Strip.
    


            Godard and his wife Ayelet were killed during the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israeli communities near the Strip. His body was then taken to Gaza.
    


            During the attack, Godard and his wife hid in the safe room of their home in Be'eri Kibbutz. They later fled after their house was set on fire, and the attackers “ambushed them outside,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement Thursday. After the father of four was killed, “Ayelet hid in the bushes for several hours before she was also murdered,” the forum added.
    


            Godard spent his childhood on Israeli beaches alongside his father, who was a lifeguard, the forum said. Later, Godard also became a lifeguard, the group said.
    


            Israel's National Center of Forensic Medicine confirmed his identity after his remains were released by Hamas to the International Committee of the Red Cross and then turned over to Israeli authorities. The handover leaves three remaining deceased hostages in the Gaza Strip.
    


            Israel is “determined, committed and tirelessly working to bring back all of our fallen hostages for a proper burial in their homeland,” the prime minister's office said in a statement announcing the identification of Godard.
    


            In a transfer that was part of a US-brokered ceasefire agreement, Israel earlier said it received a coffin containing the remains via the Red Cross in Gaza and transported them to Israel's national forensics laboratory for identification. Hamas did not identify which of the last few deceased hostages it was handing over.
    


            Hamas' military wing said earlier Thursday that it would hand over the body of an Israeli found near Khan Younis in southern Gaza.
    


            This release of remains comes after a series of such transfers last week, including that of the longest-held deceased hostage in Gaza. On Sunday, Hamas handed over the remains of Lt. Hadar Goldin, who was killed in the final days of a 2014 conflict between Israel and Hamas. The transfer of Goldin's remains was the fifth such occurrence in little more than a week, bringing Hamas down to the final few deceased hostages still in Gaza.
    


Israeli intelligence has assessed that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza. But Hamas has continued to search for remains in different parts of Gaza.
    


            The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has continued to organize rallies in Tel Aviv and elsewhere across Israel calling for the release of the remaining deceased hostages.
    


            Eitan Horn, who was recently freed after 738 days in captivity, said in Hostages Square last weekend: “I cannot begin my journey of healing and recovery as long as I know there are families who are not with me on this journey. We have no future without the return of all the hostages.”
    


            Other freed hostages have expressed the same sentiment, saying they cannot begin to heal until all of the hostages – living and deceased – have returned home.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro has denounced the US strikes on alleged cartel vessels in the Caribbean Sea as the Pentagon announced a new operation to fight drug traffickers.

Colombia has historically cooperated with the US on security matters, particularly in dealing with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government and fighting drug trafficking, although their policy alignment has recently shifted under Petro, a former M-19 Marxist guerrilla. 

In an interview with NBC News, Petro did not mince words when criticizing US President Donald Trump. “He's a barbarian,” Petro said in excerpts aired Thursday. “He wants to frighten us,” he added.

The Colombian president did not rule out that some of the vessels hit by the strikes were linked to cartels. “Maybe or maybe not. We do not know,” he said, adding that, “According to due process, the civilized treatment of people, they should be seized and detained.”

Petro described the victims as “poor boatmen” hired by cartels. “Then when one of those missiles arrives [it] kills that boatman. It doesn't kill the drug trafficker,” he said. He previously said that at least some of the victims were ordinary fishermen not involved with organized crime.

The US imposed sanctions on Petro last month after Trump labeled him “a drug leader.” Colombia restricted intelligence-sharing with the US this week, although Interior Minister Armando Benedetti later clarified that Bogota would continue cooperating with US federal agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration and the FBI.

The US has hit at least 20 boats since September, killing an estimated 80 people. US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth announced Thursday the launch of Operation Southern Spear against “narcoterrorists” in the region.

CNN reported that as part of the operation, Trump had been briefed on target options in Venezuela; he has accused Maduro of helping cartels smuggle drugs into the US.

LONDON, November 14. /TASS/. The British intelligence services and the military have stopped providing the United States with intelligence on the movement of ships in the Caribbean on recommendation of Attorney General for England and Wales Richard Hermer, The Times reported citing sources.

According to them, Hermer fears an international lawsuit against the UK over its involvement in the US strikes on ships in the Caribbean. Earlier, the British shared with the Americans the coordinates of the boats, on which drugs were allegedly transported, as well as data on the number of people on board. CNN was the first to report on November 12 that the United Kingdom had stopped providing the intelligence.

According to the newspaper, the recommendations indicated that the UK had signed up to stricter rules of conduct in international waters than the United States, and could be considered complicit in what the UN called ""extrajudicial executions.""

The government declined to comment saying only that the United States remains Britain's closest partner in defense, security and intelligence matters.

Washington accuses Venezuela of not actively fighting drug smuggling. The US Navy has deployed eight ships, one nuclear submarine, and more than 10,000 troops in the Caribbean Sea and is destroying high-speed boats in international waters, allegedly involved in drug smuggling from Venezuela.

According to The New York Times, US President Donald Trump has authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela. The American media has repeatedly reported that the United States may soon begin attacking drug cartel facilities in Venezuela. However, on October 31, Trump said he was not considering attacks on Venezuelan territory.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

STOCKHOLM, November 14. /TASS/. Swedish TV channel SVT, like the British broadcasting corporation BBC, edited Donald Trump's speech of January 6, 2021 to create the impression that he was calling for riots, Kvartal newspaper reported.

According to the newspaper, last year SVT used an excerpt from Trump's speech, which spliced several parts in one of the reports in such a way that it appeared to the audience that Trump was in favor of storming the Capitol. Like in the BBC version, a fragment where he calls on his supporters to peacefully and patriotically express their opinions was dropped.

In the first response to Kvartal's request for comment on how the speech was edited, SVT responded that the TV channel's owners were ""confident in SVT's publications dedicated to the storming of the Capitol."" But later SVT changed the text and the clip, where black frames with pauses between different parts of the performance were added. Executive producer Karin Ekman said that SVT has updated the text of the clip ""to make it clearer to the audience in what context it was published."" She does not believe that the scandal with the BBC will affect SVT's credibility.

Norwegian TV channel NRK has also changed the story about Capitol storming previously presented similarly, explains SVT.

The BBC was at the center of a scandal over a Panorama program, which the broadcasting corporation aired last October. In it, Trump's speech was doctored in a way that it can be concluded that he is calling for the seizure of the Congress building. The scandal forced CEO Tim Davey and head of news Deborah Turness to resign. Trump demanded that the BBC remove the program by November 14, apologize and pay compensation, threatening to sue for $1 billion. The corporation apologized, but refused to pay compensation.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

SEOUL, November 14. /TASS/. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui has denounced the appeal of the foreign ministers of the Group of Seven (G7) states to denuclearize calling it hostile machinations, according to the Central Telegraphic Agency of Korea (KCNA).

""I express my complete dissatisfaction and regret over the outright hostile machinations of the G7 foreign ministers, which are a direct encroachment on the constitution of our state,"" she said, referring to a joint G7 foreign ministers' statement issued after their meeting in Canada.

North Korean nuclear status is specified in its constitution.

She called the G7's desire for denuclearization a manifestation of ""inertia of thought"" because the international community ""understands its impossibility.""

""No one has the right to force us to violate the constitution, and no one can try to change it,"" Choe Son Hui said.

""The current status of the DPRK will not change under the influence of external rhetoric and insistence, in today's harsh geopolitical environment, the possession of nuclear weapons is the most accurate choice to deter the most dangerous states.""

Choe Son Hui called on the international community to pay attention to the threat to peace and security from the Group of Seven, which she called a ""nuclear alliance."" She reiterated that North Korea will possess nuclear weapons until ""the nuclear threat from external forces is put an end to, as long as there are forces that consider nuclear weapons to be a means of their tyranny.""","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Investigation by Guardian and Carbon Brief finds just a fifth of funds to fight global heating went to poorest 44 countries

China and wealthy petrostates including Saudi Arabia and UAE are among countries receiving large sums of climate finance, according to an analysis.

The Guardian and Carbon Brief analysed previously unreported submissions to the UN, along with data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), that show how billions of dollars of public money is being committed to the fight against global heating.

The investigation found a broadly functioning system that shifts capital from rich polluters to vulnerable nations, helping them clean their economies and adapt to a hotter world.

But it also found that because the distribution of the largest part of the funds had no central oversight and was entirely at the discretion of individual countries, it was subject to political interests and not always directed where it was most needed.

Although official data is not extensive enough to trace all the recipients of climate finance, the Guardian analysis found that about a fifth of the funding in 2021 and 2022 went to the world's 44 poorest countries, known as the least developed countries (LDCs). Much of that was in the form of loans, rather than grants.

Some LDCs received more than two-thirds of their climate finance in the form of loans, whose repayment terms can push governments further into debt traps. The share of loans rose to 95% or more in the cases of Bangladesh and Angola.

Most of the world's developed countries provide finance to support climate action in developing ones, bilaterally and through multilateral organisations such as development banks. At a UN summit in Copenhagen in 2009, rich countries promised to mobilise $100bn (£76bn) a year by 2020 in recognition of their greater responsibility for climate breakdown and ability to fund solutions.

But the analysis of the most recent submissions, covering more than 20,000 global projects during 2021 and 2022 – the year in which the Copenhagen target was belatedly met, found that vast sums were going to petrostates, as well as to China, the world's second-largest economy.

UAE, a fossil fuel exporter with a GDP per capita on a par with France and Canada, received more than $1bn in loans from Japan that were logged as climate finance. The projects include $625m for an offshore electricity transmission project in Abu Dhabi and $452m for a waste incinerator in Dubai.

Saudi Arabia, which is one of the top 10 carbon emitters thanks to its giant oilfields and majority-ownership of Aramco, received about $328m in Japanese loans, including $250m to its electricity company and $78m for a solar farm.

Six countries in the Balkans that hope to join the EU received more than $3.5bn in climate finance. The bulk of the money went to Serbia, which on a per capita basis received 10 times more money than the LDCs.

European recipients of climate finance included an EU member state, Romania, which received an $8m grant from the US for an engineering study to build a small modular nuclear reactor.

Joe Thwaites, a climate finance advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said overall flows of climate finance were increasing but “not enough” was getting to the poorest and most vulnerable communities, with debt-distressed countries needing more grants and concessional loans.

“This is not charity,” he said. “It is a strategic investment that addresses the root causes of many of the crises we see daily: cost of living, supply chain disruptions, natural disasters, forced migration and conflict.”

Over the two years under consideration, about $33bn was committed to the LDCs, which include Haiti, Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Yemen.

A much larger sum of money – about $98bn – went to developing countries, a broader group that includes lower middle-income countries such as India and upper middle-income countries such as China. Another $32bn could not be classified. India was the single largest recipient of finance over the reporting period, receiving about $14bn, while China received $3bn, mostly from multilateral banks.

The analysis suggests the underrepresentation of the LDCs reflects their smaller population size, but the makeup of the developing country group is a growing source of tension at climate negotiations.

China's economy, for instance, has boomed since the UN classified it as developing in the 1990s, and its emissions have surpassed European levels on a per capita basis. China is thought to be a significant provider of finance to foreign climate projects but has resisted efforts to formally count its contributions. The UN's development categories have not changed since they were drawn up in 1992.

“That allows countries such as Israel, Korea, Qatar, Singapore and UAE – all of which have become wealthy nations with large carbon footprints over the last 30 years – to shirk their international responsibilities,” said Sarah Colenbrander, climate director at the Overseas Development Institute. “It is absurd that such nations remain in the same category as countries like Togo, Tonga and Tanzania.”

Some of the world's poorest countries receive more than two-thirds of their climate finance in the form of loans, despite warnings that many cannot afford the terms and interest repayments.

“The hidden story of climate finance is not in the volume of commitments, but in their forms,” said Ritu Bharadwaj, climate finance director at the International Institute for Environment and Development.

“Climate finance is increasing the financial burden on poorer nations. Even if the money donated is a concessional loan, those loans do also come with conditions which might benefit the lender more than the recipient.”

Data from the World Bank shows that over the same period, LDCs have together repaid almost $91.3bn in external debts – three times their climate finance budgets. Over the past decade, repayments of external debts of the poorest nations have trebled, from $14.3bn in 2012 to $46.5bn in 2022.

“Conventional thinking is that taking on more debt isn't bad if it is being used to fund growth-enhancing expenditure,” said Shakira Mustapha, a finance expert at the Centre for Disaster Protection. “My concern is whether countries are just taking on new debt to repay old debt and we are just kicking the can down the road.”

The foreign ministries of China, Japan, Saudi Arabia and UAE did not respond to a request for comment.

The Guardian and Carbon Brief analysis on climate finance includes the bilateral and multilateral public funding that developed nations have committed for climate projects in developing countries. The analysis excludes other types of funding that contribute to the $100bn target for climate projects such as private donations and export credits.

Data for the multilateral funding comes from the OECD. The bilateral funding comes from the Biennial Transparency Report each country submits to the UN framework convention on climate change. Due to the lag in official reporting, the most recent figures go up only to 2022.

As only annex II countries (23 industrialised nations and the EU) are responsible for contributing to the $100bn target, the analysis of the bilateral files was restricted to these nations. Likewise, using OECD methodology, we calculated the share of multilateral climate finance which is attributable to this group.

We also calculated the shares of multilateral finance that can be attributed to individual donor countries, based on shareholdings in multilateral development banks and cumulative contributions to multilateral climate funds. This is based on a methodology that has been used by analysts at the World Resources Institute and ODI.

The analysis classified the recipients of the bilateral projects using the UN country classification. But many projects remain unclassified because the recipients are not specified, are reported as “multi-country”, or are part of a group of countries for which the funding cannot be disaggregated.

These projects have not been included when calculating the amount of finance that individual developing countries received, but they are included in the total figures.

A spokesperson for UN Climate Change said: “The inequities revealed in climate finance flows highlight why a shift in the global financial system is urgently needed. Treating climate finance as charity has held back the progress the world needs, as has treating it purely as a cost and ignoring the massive human and economic dividends it pays.”

The original $100bn target is being replaced this year with a new target for developed countries to provide $300bn a year by 2035, with a wider goal of mobilising $1.3tn a year. Last week, the heads of the two most recent UN climate summits published a report that explored ways of sustainably raising the cash that included taxes on fossil fuels and climate-resilient debt clauses. It also called for an expansion of concessional and grant-based climate finance.

“Climate finance must be accessible, affordable, and fair,” the UN Climate Change spokesperson said. “The fact that many of the world's lowest-income countries face barriers and still rely on high-interest loans for climate finance underscores the urgency of reform.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Reaction follows Wall Street's worst day in a month and unprecedented slump in investment in China

Business live – latest updates

Global markets have fallen after a tech sell-off that fuelled Wall Street's worst day in a month and weak economic data in China showing an unprecedented slump in investment.

Japan's tech-heavy Nikkei fell 1.8% on Friday, South Korea's Kospi plunged 2.6% and there was a 1.5% fall in Australia, after a torrid day on Wall Street as Nvidia and other tech companies tumbled over valuation concerns.

Nvidia, the $4.5tn (£3.4tn) tech company, led a wider sector decline, falling 3.6% as investors reassessed the value of companies involved in the AI sector after Japan's SoftBank sold its entire stake in the company.

SoftBank and SK Hynix, a Chinese chipmaker for mobiles and computers, fell more than 6%, Samsung Electronics dropped 4% and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company dropped 1.8%.

Global markets also reacted to fears of a slowdown in the Chinese economy after data showed that activity cooled more than expected at the start of the final quarter of the year.

Figures showed that fixed-asset investment shrank 1.7% in the first 10 months, a record decline, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.

China's CSI 300 fell 0.7%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.9% and Taiwan's Taiex slumped by 1.4%.

US markets were also jittery over the impact on the economy of the world's largest market over the longest federal government shutdown in history.

The shutdown has forced the government to put the release of data on inflation and jobs on hold.

A growing number of officials have also signalled caution over the prospects of a US rate cut next month.

Jim Reid, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said: “It's certainly been a volatile week in terms of sentiment, with relief over the end of the shutdown vying with concerns over AI valuations and whether the Fed will cut rates again after several speakers have struck a more cautious tone this week.

“The S&P 500 posted its worst day in over a month with a December cut probability falling sharply from about 59% at Wednesday's close to 49% last night.”

Kyle Rodda, a senior financial market analyst at Capital.com, said: “The weakness in Asian markets wasn't quite as profound as what was experienced on Wall Street. It stands to reason. There's more air in US valuations and the locus of the sell-off is a combination of dialled back Fed rate cut expectations and a loss of momentum behind the AI trade amid fears of inadequate return on investment.

“But there was still a high degree of sluggishness in Asian risk assets, notwithstanding a brief pop in Chinese stocks after underwhelming data, including extraordinarily weak investment figures, raised hopes of more stimulus from Chinese authorities.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Editor's Note: This is a developing story. 

Ukrainian drones struck the Russian port city of Novorossiysk, Krasnodar Krai, on Nov. 14, damaging an oil terminal and sparking a large fire, multiple Russian Telegram channels and local officials reported.

The attack hit the Sheskharis oil complex, where infrastructure facilities were damaged and a blaze broke out. The facility is a major oil export terminal that serves as the endpoint for pipelines run by Russia's state-run Transneft, the world's largest oil pipeline company.

The Krasnodar Krai operational headquarters reported the hit at the oil terminal and said several coastal facilities had been damaged in the attack. Officials claimed the fire at the Sheskharis complex had been extinguished. 

Russian state media RIA Novosti also resported that a civilian vessel in the port was hit during the mass UAV strike, leaving three crew members injured.

Russian air defense units shot down 66 drones over Krasnodar Krai overnight, the Russian Defense Ministry said. 

The Kyiv Independent could not confirm these claims at the time of publication.

Andrii Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation, commented on the attack on social media. 

""This is the oil terminal in Novorossiysk after the strike,"" he wrote on Telegram. ""Meanwhile, Russia is hitting residential buildings and energy infrastructure.""

The strike on Novorossiysk came as Russia pounded Kyiv with waves of drones and missiles during a massive attack that left at least 14 people injured and a dozen apartment buildings in flames.Novorossiysk, a key hub for Russia's Black Sea logistics and energy infrastructure, has been repeatedly targeted in Ukrainian strikes. Kyiv considers Russian oil refineries and petrochemical facilities to be valid military targets as they help fund Moscow's war efforts.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story. 

Ukrainian drones attacked the Russian city of Saratov overnight on Nov. 14, striking the local oil refinery, residents claimed. 

If confirmed, this would mark the fourth time Ukraine has hit the Saratov oil refinery in fall 2025.

Saratov Oblast Governor Roman Busargin confirmed that drones attacked the region overnight and said that ""civilian infrastructure"" in Saratov had been damaged. Emergency services are operating at the site, he said. 

Locals, however, said that the drones struck the Saratov oil refinery — a frequent target of Ukrainian long-range attacks. Photos and videos of explosions circulated on social media amid the attack. 

The Russian Defense Ministry reported that air defense units shot down 45 drones over Saratov Oblast during the night. 

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims at the time of publication. 

The Saratov refinery lies in southwestern Russia, roughly 150 kilometers (100 miles) from the border with Kazakhstan and nearly 600 kilometers (370 miles) east of the front line in Ukraine.

The facility, owned by the Russian oil giant Rosneft, has a processing capacity of 140,000 barrels of crude per day. It produces over 20 different petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel, fuel oil, and bitumen.

The refinery has been hit several times this fall. Previous attacks forced the facility to temporarily halt oil intake in August, Bloomberg reported.

Ukraine regularly launches long-range drone attacks on industrial and military facilities in Russia. Oil refineries, which fund and fuel Moscow's war machine, are frequent targets.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he told President Volodymyr Zelensky that the number of young Ukrainian men coming to Germany should be reduced, AFP reported on Nov. 13.

Following a phone call with the Ukrainian leader, Merz said that young Ukrainians should remain to ""serve in their own country.""

""They are needed there,"" the chancellor added.

Close to 1.3 million Ukrainian refugees have been recorded in Germany as of October 2025 after fleeing Russia's full-scale invasion. This represents the highest number among all EU countries.

Commenting on the phone call, Zelensky said he briefed Merz on the situation at the front and thanked Germany for its military and political support, without mentioning the issue of Ukrainian refugees.

Military-age men have faced strict travel restrictions under martial law, instituted when Russia launched its all-out war in 2022.

Germany said that young Ukrainian men began arriving in large numbers after Kyiv eased travel rules for those aged between 18 and 22 in August.

As a result, the number of Ukrainian men in this age group registering in Germany went from 100 a week to almost 1,000, according to the German Interior Ministry.

The development comes as Kyiv struggles with a continued manpower shortage on the front as Russia sustains offensive operations in the east and south of Ukraine.

Around 490,000 Ukrainians of working age staying in Germany are receiving unemployment benefits, a point of criticism from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.

AfD, Germany's leading opposition party, which has consistently criticized Berlin's military and economic support for Kyiv, suggested that unemployment benefits for Ukrainians should be replaced with lower-level payments for asylum seekers.

Facing political pressure, Germany's ruling coalition is preparing a bill that would reduce benefits for Ukrainians who arrived after April 1, with the aim of incentivizing them to seek employment.

The US is launching a military operation called ""Southern Spear"" to target ""narco-terrorists"" in the Western Hemisphere, according to Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth.

United States Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has announced a new US military operation that is aimed at targeting so-called ""narco-terrorists"" in the Western Hemisphere.

""Today, I'm announcing Operation SOUTHERN SPEAR,"" the Pentagon boss declared on social media platform X on Thursday.

""Led by Joint Task Force Southern Spear and @SOUTHCOM, this mission defends our Homeland, removes narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere, and secures our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people,"" he said.

The Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) is one of the US military's eleven unified combatant commands which is tasked with contingency planning, operations and security cooperation for 31 countries in Central America, South America and the Caribbean.

Last week, the USS Gerald R Ford — world's largest aircraft carrier — arrived in the waters of the Caribbean and Latin America, adding to an already massive naval build-up in the region.

Washington said that its military presence in the area is aimed at reining in transnational criminal gangs in order to protect the US from illicit drugs.

As part of its campaign against drug trafficking, the US has carried out military strikes against a number of vessels in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, claiming that they are ""drug boats."" Dozens of people have died in the strikes.

The US action has heightened tensions in the region, particularly with Venezuela.

Washington claims that the smugglers have links to Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro.

Maduro denied the accusations and, in turn, claims that the US is ""fabricating a new war.""

He alleges that the US military buildup is to oust him from power.

According to Maduro, the US naval deployment in the region is ""the greatest threat our continent has faced in the past 100 years.""

The US State Department announced it would classify four European left-wing groups as terrorist organizations. In addition to Antifa Ost in Germany, one group is based in Italy and the other two are in Greece.

The US State Department said on Thursday that it was moving to designate four self-styled ""antifa"" (anti-fascist) groups as terrorist organizations, citing Germany-based Antifa Ost by name. 

It also said it was pursuing three other violent antifa groups in Italy and Greece.

The Italian group is known in English as the Informal Anarchist Federation/International Revolutionary Front, or as FAI/FRI, to use its Italian language acronym.

The State Department translated the two Greek groups' names as Armed Proletarian Justice and Revolutionary Class Self-Defense.

The State Department intended to designate all four groups as Foreign Terrorist Organizations as of November 20, it said. 

""The designation of Antifa Ost and other violent Antifa groups supports President Trump's National Security Presidential Memorandum-7, an initiative to disrupt self-described 'anti-fascism' networks, entities, and organizations that use political violence and terroristic acts to undermine democratic institutions, constitutional rights, and fundamental liberties,"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio was quoted as saying.

""Groups affiliated with this movement ascribe to revolutionary anarchist or Marxist ideologies, including anti-Americanism, 'anti-capitalism,' and anti-Christianity, using these to incite and justify violent assaults domestically and overseas,"" he said.

Among other things, the designation makes it illegal for US citizens to seek membership or to support the groups, for instance by donating funds.

President Donald Trump has been vocal in his criticism of ""antifa"" organizations in the US and beyond in recent years.

The US also designated Antifa as a domestic terror organization in September.

The US government did not mention specific incidents or reasons for the Antifa Ost designation but noted attacks in Germany and Hungary, and Hungary having designated the group as a terrorist entity.

""Antifa Ost conducted numerous attacks against individuals it perceives as 'fascists' or part of the 'right-wing scene' in Germany between 2018 and 2023 and is accused of having conducted a series of attacks in Budapest in mid-February 2023,"" the US State Department said. 

One high-profile court case involving the group in Germany in recent years was the 2023 prison sentence for Dresden student Lina E., deemed the ringleader of a group of people who would seek out and attack individuals or groups they considered far-right extremists.

Another suspected member, Johann G., believed to be the leader of a group within Antifa Ost that calls itself the ""Hammer Gang"" (Hammerbande), was arrested late last year. Prosecutors are seeking to try him and several other suspects on charges including attempted murder.

Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin launched its New Glenn rocket, carrying two NASA Mars orbiters into space, while the booster successfully landed back on an offshore barge.

Blue Origin, the space tech company owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, successfully launched its huge New Glenn rocket on Thursday, carrying with it a pair of twin NASA spacecraft bound for Mars.

The 321-foot (98-meter) rocket, named after former US astronaut John Glenn, blasted off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida four days later than planned due to inclement weather.

After releasing the Mars orbiters, the rocket booster also successfully landed back on an offshore platform in a manner similar to that used by rival company SpaceX — but which was a remarkable first for Blue Origin.

The recovery and then re-use of the powerful rocket booster is seen as an essential part of cutting costs and making space flight more financially feasible.

An ecstatic Bezos watched the action personally from Launch Control, where employees chanted ""Next stop, moon!"" following the booster's bull's-eye landing. NASA officials conveyed their congratulations, as did SpaceX's Elon Musk.

Twenty minutes after separating from the booster, the rocket's upper stage then completed the mission's main objective by deploying the two Mars orbiters in space.

The twin NASA craft, collectively known as Escapade, will remain around a million miles (1.5 million kilometers) away from Earth for a year until the planet aligns with Mars again, at which point they will set off towards the red planet with the help of a gravity assist.

Upon arrival at Mars in 2027, the spacecraft will map the magnetic fields and solar winds in the planet's upper atmosphere, observations which should shed light on how the planet became so dry and dusty.

""Escapade is going to bring an unprecedented stereo viewpoint because we're going to have two spacecraft at the same time,"" said lead scientist Rob Lillis of the University of California, Berkeley, ahead of the launch.

Scientists also want to continue studying how best to protect astronauts against Mars' harsh radiation environment on potential future flights to the red planet — although a return to the moon is planned first with NASA's Artemis program.

Musk's SpaceX outbid Blue Origin for the first and second crew landings using its Starships, which are nearly 100 feet (30 meters) taller than Bezos' New Glenn. But Blue Origin holds a NASA contract for the third Artemis moon landing.

Twelve astronauts walked on the moon during NASA's Apollo program in the 1960s and 70s, more than a half-century ago. The space agency is pushing to get astronauts back on the lunar surface by the end of the decade — and before China.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

DENG YUWEN was Deputy Senior Editor at the Chinese Communist Party's Central Party School from 2002 to 2013 and worked as a political affairs consultant at Eurasia Group from 2023 to 2025.

 Why Party Elders Can't Save the Country From Xi

 Deng Yuwan

For the past year, an increasing number of rumors about Chinese leader Xi Jinping have been swirling around Beijing. Some sources privately claim that Xi has lost real power and been sidelined. Others whisper that Xi's health has deteriorated; the politician appearing in public, they say, is merely a lookalike, while a group of the party's most venerable elder statesmen are actually calling the shots. Still other stories even imagine an alliance of unlikely bedfellows—once powerful liberal political reformers and conservative generals from the People's Liberation Army, for instance—who are teaming up to admonish Xi or to replace him.

Such fanciful rumors are common in authoritarian systems, especially in the lead-up to major political events—such as the Chinese Communist Party's fourth plenum, which took place in October, and whose outcomes are expected to set the country's developmental direction for the next five years. With few clear signals about who has influence and how decisions are made, the halls of power in Beijing are fertile ground for political conjectures. The shared thread in all these rumors is the idea that a powerful group of party elders with access to insider information—leaders and high-level cadres who have usually stepped back from active political roles but remain influential behind the scenes—still hold enough clout to overrule Xi and shape China's political course.

This particular idea has gained traction in part because such elder statesmen have, in fact, played a central role in the party's history. Citizens disillusioned with Xi's rule hold out hope that a group of hidden arbiters might intervene, just as Deng Xiaoping did to steer China away from radical politics in the late 1970s and to overrule more conservative leaders and insist on market-oriented economic reforms in the 1990s. Elder politics provides a convenient way to interpret and analyze the opaque inner workings of the country's most powerful elite.

But in truth, in today's China elders have largely lost their power. Xi has systematically dismantled the channels of influence through which elders previously operated, including the ability to appoint personnel and their ties within the military. Moreover, the current crop of party elders does not carry the moral authority that the first generation of elders earned from fighting in the communist revolution. The institutional checks on power that have replaced party elders cannot constrain incumbent leaders as effectively as the elders once did, leaving little to rein Xi in as he remolds the party and country.

During the first 30 years of communist rule in China, Mao Zedong had unrivaled revolutionary stature, a firm grip on the military and propaganda systems, and control of the party hierarchy. He was the supreme elder statesman. After Mao died, in 1976, however, the party faced a leadership vacuum. Cadres who had survived war and political upheaval alongside Mao but who had been purged or sidelined during the Cultural Revolution returned to the center of politics. These leaders included Deng; Chen Yun, a senior economic planner; and Ye Jianying, a founding marshal of the People's Liberation Army.

The authority of these political figures derived from seniority and from their direct contributions to the communist revolution. They were not merely leaders but also founders of the state. They had powerful patronage networks, including deep ties to the military. And as the custodians of the party's history, they could define the party's official narrative and frame how and why the party was pursuing its policy choices.

In the early 1980s, to formalize their role, party leaders under Deng's initiative established the Central Advisory Commission, a kind of upper chamber that gave elders an institutional platform to influence personnel and policy decisions. Party leaders chose who was on the commission, and they limited membership to veteran officials who had a long record of serving the party.

Yet elders' real power lay in how they leveraged their unimpeachable authority in informal spaces throughout the rest of China's political system. These elders privately consulted with leading officials, military commanders, and senior bureaucrats to guide their decision-making and, at times, signal their disapproval. They also released public statements that were timed to influence current leaders at critical moments, including debates about who should lead the party and what policies they should pursue. In 1979, the first generation of party elders, including Deng Xiaoping, pushed aside Hua Guofeng, Mao's chosen successor, by exploiting widespread discontent with Hua's insistence on preserving Mao's political direction. A decade later, these same elders supported the decision to deploy military force against protestors in Tiananmen Square. These were not ceremonial gestures; they were acts of real power.

The conditions that empowered these elders also eventually led to their marginalization. Their role arose to provide balance during the transition from Mao's personal rule to a more collective style of leadership. In that transitional stage, which lasted roughly from the late 1970s to the early 1990s, elders stabilized Chinese politics by checking the power of the top leaders. They could halt dangerous policy experiments or dismiss leaders who they felt were pursuing the wrong priorities or failing to recognize shifting political winds.

As communist China's revolutionary generation grew old and passed away, no new elders had the historical prestige or military leverage to inherit their authority. The party elders who succeeded them—the second and third generations—were mainly administrators whose authority derived from their former positions of power, not from revolutionary credentials. The Central Advisory Commission was quietly abolished in 1992. Party leaders also established clear term limits and retirement ages for cadres, curtailing the political options available to leaders who wanted to remain influential after they aged out of office.

Changes in the military further eroded elders' influence. Many of China's early revolutionaries were soldiers who had trained their own protégés. Administrative reforms such as the 1985 reduction in troops, however, weakened the entrenched networks through which elders exercised their power within the military hierarchy. In 2015, Xi carried out another round of sweeping reforms, which, by reorganizing the armed forces into regional commands, effectively severed the ability of any senior military leaders to build their own coherent internal factions. Xi also concentrated authority in the Central Military Commission, which he directly controls.

But what fully ended elders' power was Xi's systematic attack on personal networks. Xi's anticorruption campaign, which he launched soon after taking the reins of the party, in 2012, cut the informal bonds that once linked current and retired elites. He methodically dismantled alternate power centers in the security services, the military, and strategically important sectors such as energy and finance. At the same time, Xi increased oversight of retired senior cadres and introduced new rules prohibiting them from publicly commenting on the country's leaders or their policies. Xi even reclassified dinners among elders as potential matters of political security, which meant that they could no longer visit one another freely. If elders wished to influence Xi, their avenues of influence dried up.

Party elders have not vanished from public life in the Xi era. They still appear at national ceremonies, occupy front row seats at important meetings, deliver anodyne remarks when called upon, and receive briefings behind closed doors. But they lack power. With Xi's consolidation of control and the natural evolution of China's political system, elders no longer have the capacity to mobilize a coalition that fuses personnel leverage, military clout, procedural know-how, and moral authority in a way that could seriously check the current leadership.

Without powerful elders, China's party-state must rely on other mechanisms to constrain top leaders. A more institutionalized bureaucracy can slow decision-making and resist the personal whims of individual leaders by subjecting them to lengthy formal processes. For instance, some universities and research institutes have pushed back on Xi's attempt to relocate their campuses to a brand-new, futuristic metropolis in Xiong'an, about 75 miles south of Beijing, and the project has proceeded far more slowly than was laid out in original plans. Elites also still have self-preservation instincts, which means that they tend to avoid risky decisions that could jeopardize their careers. And external shocks that shape domestic politics, such as financial stress or trade pressure, can limit leaders' choices. Yet none of these checks is as direct, swift, or effective at balancing personal power as elders' intervention once was.

The difference lies in the logic of power symmetry. In prior eras, elders and incumbent leaders often stood on roughly equal ground. The admonitions of the first generation of revolutionaries carried the weight of superiors addressing subordinates. Even the second generation of elders could still counterbalance the sitting party secretary. After Jiang Zemin, Deng's successor, stepped down, in 2002, and handed the reins of the party to Hu Jintao, he continued to wield influence behind the scenes. Jiang effectively diluted Hu's authority and cemented his own power by expanding the Politburo Standing Committee, the party's top decision-making body, from seven members to nine, and installing several of his protégés in key positions.

The new arrangement under Xi presupposes the absence of rivals. Stability is maintained not through horizontal checks but through vertical, one-way channels of power. The bureaucracy can stall Xi's directives, but it cannot veto them. Economic officials can advise, but they cannot compel leaders to change course. Generals may express concern, but they cannot voice public dissent. Interactions that were once equal deliberations are now more like a pipeline in which information flows up and orders flow down. Elder politics was opaque and personalistic, but its power symmetry made it possible for other elites to address the top leader as an equal and speak candidly about the problems that the party faced.



China's troubled response to the COVID-19 pandemic reveals the dangers of this new situation. A group of powerful elders could not have prevented the outbreak. But it might have limited the damage by making it easier for information to flow to decision-makers. Elders could have pushed leaders to heed early warning signs when the virus first started spreading, in 2020, and forced Xi to relax his draconian policies sooner as the pandemic dragged on into its second and third years. The presence of elders creates space among the party's upper echelons that allows internal debate in times of crisis and makes it possible for more experts to convey their knowledge to top leaders.

Of the partial substitutes that have emerged to replace the ballast once provided by party elders, only external pressure—chiefly the impacts of U.S.-Chinese competition and confrontation—has significantly limited Xi's power. Aggressive tariffs and export controls have forced Xi to adapt his economic approach by diversifying China's trade partners and even embracing some domestic private-sector companies that can contribute to Xi's goal of technological self-reliance. Internal stressors, such as high unemployment and financial fragility, may also constrain Xi's options to pursue his goals, but so far they have merely slowed, rather than stalled, his agenda. Yet overall, Xi's decision-making is getting more insular as he relies ever more on a tight inner circle of confidants, heightening the risk of misjudgment that could turn manageable challenges into systemic risks.

Many outside observers who recognize that elders have lost power treat that fact as a footnote to Xi's consolidation of power. But it is much more consequential. A system that relies on the fusion of rigid bureaucratic rules and strong personal leadership is much more fragile than one that relies on an unwritten balance of power because it lacks substantive ways of constraining leaders. And even if a future leader after Xi sought to rule more collectively, party elders will still lack the stature or the networks necessary to act as a check on power. Far removed from the halcyon days of revolution, China must hope that a combination of imperfect substitutes—and some good luck—will limit Xi and stop preventable crises before they spin out of control.

 How Washington Should Manage Its Most Complicated Relationships

 Rebecca Lissner

During his successful 2024 U.S. presidential campaign, Donald Trump assured voters that he would end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, perhaps even before taking office. But both conflicts dragged on at great human cost, and diplomacy proceeded only in fits and starts. Nine months into his presidency, Trump finally brokered a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas—but only after presiding over the breakdown of the truce he inherited from President Joe Biden and an escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The war in Ukraine, meanwhile, continues unabated.

These challenges are not unique to Trump; they bedeviled Biden, too. Indeed, the difficulty of bringing both wars to an end illustrates the strategic dilemmas facing the United States in managing a small but critical subset of its partners: so-called quasi allies. Quasi allies—which, since the end of World War II, the United States has cultivated as it has built its alliance system—are more than partners but less than treaty allies. They have special status in Washington, but they lack the feature of an alliance that matters most: a formal U.S. security guarantee.

The recent wars in Ukraine and the Middle East have put quasi allies at the center of U.S. foreign policy. The United States has supported Ukraine in resisting Russia's attempt at subjugation, sending billions of dollars' worth of advanced weaponry to its armed forces. Ukraine has maintained its sovereignty and political independence, whereas Russia has suffered more than a million military casualties and significant materiel losses—results achieved without direct conflict between Moscow and Washington. In the Middle East, the United States has enabled an Israeli-led campaign that set back Iran's nuclear program and broke its regional network of armed proxy groups, even as those operations also deepened the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. This record points to the advantages of supporting strong quasi allies at the frontlines of geopolitics: these relationships allow the United States to advance its interests in consequential regions through indirect, less costly means.

But the United States' attempts to manage its role in these wars have also highlighted strategic dilemmas endemic to quasi alliances and particularly pronounced in wartime. If Trump is to fulfill his goal of bringing peace to the Middle East and Europe, his administration needs to better manage these dilemmas. And Washington's experience with Ukraine and Israel should inform planning for a high-stakes contingency involving Taiwan, another quasi ally in a perilous neighborhood.

Within its vast network of relationships around the globe, the United States categorizes most of its friends as either allies or partners. Washington is bound to its allies by legally codified treaties featuring mutual defense clauses. This pledge that an attack on one is an attack on all backstops allies' security and extends the U.S. nuclear umbrella. Partners, by contrast, may receive security assistance from the United States but do not presume that the U.S. military would come to their aid if they were attacked.

Quasi allies represent an awkward third category. These are countries through which the United States sees opportunities to advance its interests. They may receive significant military training and assistance, host a large U.S. troop presence, and coordinate closely with Washington. Some even enjoy a confusing designation, conferred by the president, as a “major non-NATO ally,” which does not entail a security commitment. And unlike partners, the scope and scale of Washington's investment in their security creates ambiguity around whether and to what extent the United States would intervene to defend quasi allies if they were attacked. Indeed, the United States has occasionally come to the defense of its quasi allies, as when it helped Israel defeat Iranian aerial attacks twice in 2024 and again during the Iran-Israel war in June. But there tend to be good reasons why the United States stops short of extending the kind of mutual defense commitment that would cement a treaty alliance—including concerns about becoming entangled in a turbulent region, provoking an adversary, or pledging to defend a partner that may not pursue Washington's preferred policies. This ambiguity makes quasi alliances weaker tools of deterrence and reassurance than formal alliances, and it helps explain why quasi allies are more vulnerable to external aggression than treaty allies.

Despite Washington's deep investment in these relationships, quasi allies often have interests that diverge from those of the United States. Quasi ally leaders have their own agendas and domestic politics, especially when their country is at war. The United States has repeatedly experienced these dynamics with Ukraine and Israel, a challenge I witnessed firsthand as a senior official in the Biden White House. In both cases, U.S. policy sought to enable quasi allies to pursue common objectives while managing disagreements over diplomatic and military strategy.



During Ukraine's 2022 counteroffensive campaign against Russia, Ukrainian and U.S. military leaders jointly developed a strategy to punch through Russian defensive lines in Kherson and take territory that would enable Ukrainian forces to break the land bridge connecting Crimea with occupied Ukraine. Yet this plan foundered when confronted with Ukraine's understandable loss aversion—breaching Russian defenses would have been an exceptionally bloody endeavor—and distracting rivalries among Ukrainian commanders and political leadership. Despite careful joint planning, U.S. policymakers could do little to compel Ukraine to see the campaign through. Domestic political imperatives have similarly prevented Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky from taking the painful but necessary step of lowering the draft age from 25 to 18 to address manpower shortages, which in turn has exacerbated demand for military materiel from the United States and Europe.

The dilemma of divergent interests has also challenged U.S. policymaking toward Israel since October 7, 2023. Hamas's heinous attack came at a moment when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was politically vulnerable and facing serious corruption charges. He has deftly managed to stay in power, often by taking steps opposed by Washington: restricting humanitarian aid into Gaza, expanding West Bank settlements, and escalating attacks on Iran and Hezbollah, its Lebanese proxy militia. The past two years have thus exposed real policy differences, as well as the limits of U.S. influence over Israeli decision-making.

The United States may also diverge from its quasi allies on how to assess or manage the risk of escalation. Although Washington may have a strong strategic interest in the outcome of wars involving quasi allies, it can choose to calibrate its involvement. For the quasi ally, the stakes are always higher and often existential. They may be more willing to gamble on steps that could lead to significant escalation, including actions that could draw their sponsors into direct conflict. And in some cases, entanglement is the point.

Kyiv's greater risk tolerance has created friction in the U.S.-Ukrainian relationship from the early months of Russia's invasion. During the Biden administration, Ukrainian leaders had a perennial wish list of ever more capable weapons systems. Long-range missiles known as ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile System) topped the list, and unlike some other sophisticated systems the Ukrainians requested, these promised real military utility. But Biden officials believed that providing these missiles carried risks in terms of U.S. military readiness and the potential for escalation. The subsequent years-long push and pull between Kyiv and Washington distracted from other policy debates and Ukrainian military imperatives. By the time Biden authorized the shipment of a limited number of ATACMS to Ukraine in April 2024, with clear restrictions on their use, the weapons provided tactical benefits but did not generate a strategic breakthrough. A similar dynamic played out, albeit less publicly, as Ukraine repeatedly sought permission to use U.S. equipment to strike Russian territory. Ukraine ultimately won the United States' limited acquiescence.

In both cases, Ukraine was willing to gamble to score military or even morale-boosting wins and would likely have welcomed direct U.S. military intervention, whereas Washington sought to both meet Kyiv's military needs and avoid the kind of escalation that would draw the United States or NATO directly into the war. Attempts to resolve this tension resulted in suboptimal policies for both sides: Washington accepted more risk than it wanted to, but not enough to deliver Ukraine a decisive boost.

The United States has managed similar tensions with Israel in its recent wars with Hezbollah and Iran. In the days immediately following October 7, Biden dissuaded Israel's leadership from launching a preemptive strike on Hezbollah and parried Netanyahu's request for U.S. military participation in the strike by arguing that it would trigger a regional firestorm at a time when Israel was ill prepared for a multifront war. In April 2024, after Iran launched its first aerial attack on Israel, Biden told Netanyahu that the United States would not support an Israeli counterattack against Iran, urging him to take the unsuccessful nature of the Iranian salvo as a win, thanks to joint defensive operations. Netanyahu partially accepted this advice, hitting a strategic air defense site inside Iran without claiming public credit for the strike.

When Trump took office, he clearly signaled a strong preference to address Iran's nuclear program via diplomatic means. Israel nevertheless launched a military campaign against Iran. The fact that only the U.S. military had bombs capable of penetrating Iran's nuclear facilities meant that Netanyahu was betting on Washington's ultimate involvement, a gamble that paid off in June, when Trump authorized U.S. strikes. Of all the points on which interests diverge between the United States and its quasi allies, escalation and risk tolerance are the highest-stakes areas because the danger of entanglement is the greatest.

If relative power and material dependence translated neatly into influence, the United States would have overwhelming leverage over its quasi allies, resulting in an ability to manage tension through coercive means, such as withholding weapons, and to dictate wartime decisions. But the reality is more complicated. The relationship between the United States and its quasi ally is itself a center of gravity, especially during wartime: if the relationship frays, the break advantages the adversary.

When quasi allies fight enduring wars, the most effective way for the United States to secure its desired outcome is either to help its partner win the war outright or to convince the adversary that support will continue to flow until a favorable negotiated settlement is reached. These dynamics make it difficult to withhold vital military support as leverage in shaping how a quasi ally fights and what peace it will accept. And it makes wars involving support to quasi allies challenging to end.

In his bid to end the war in Ukraine, Trump calculated that Ukraine's dependence on the United States meant that he could browbeat Kyiv into a negotiated settlement that heavily favored Moscow. Trump tested this hypothesis by publicly berating Zelensky in the Oval Office, then cutting off military and intelligence assistance. Rather than coercing Ukraine into war-ending concessions, however, this gambit only spotlighted the frailty of the bonds between Kyiv and Washington under the Trump administration and led the Kremlin to double down on its strategy of diplomatic recalcitrance and intensified military pressure.

Biden took the opposite approach. In 2022, the United States and its G-7 allies declared their intent to support Ukraine for “as long as it takes.” This commitment and the consistent support that followed bolstered Ukraine's will to fight and telegraphed that time was not on Russia's side. But it obscured two difficult realities: that Congress would not indefinitely sustain billions of dollars in support to Ukraine and that ending the war would inevitably require pressuring Kyiv to step back from its unattainable near-term objective to restore its pre-invasion border.



The United States' efforts to use its leverage to moderate Israel's maximalist war aims and to end the war in Gaza were always fraught and only grew more so as the humanitarian calamity in Gaza deepened. The Biden administration continually wrestled with the question of whether and how to condition military support to Israel at a time when Israel remained under threat from Iran and Hezbollah. It came closest to doing so in May 2024, in anticipation of major Israeli military operations in Rafah. Concerned that this move would endanger nearly a million civilians and undermine prospects for a cease-fire, Biden proclaimed he would not supply the weapons for the offensive and paused the delivery of 2,000-pound bombs. Biden officials ultimately succeeded in persuading Israel to downscale its Rafah operation, one of several modest successes in using pressure to improve humanitarian outcomes in Gaza, and never resumed the delivery of 2,000-pound bombs. But the administration's concern about limiting support to Israel while it faced other regional threats constrained the options for further restrictions.

Trump has taken a very different approach. During his first nine months in office, he largely gave Israel free rein to conduct its Gaza operations as it wished, effectively backing its decision to restart the war in March after a cease-fire, stop humanitarian aid deliveries, and push into Gaza City. But after Israel attempted to kill Hamas negotiators with a September airstrike in Qatar, Trump changed tack and pressured Netanyahu to agree to a cease-fire. With a credible, if seemingly nonspecific, threat of abandonment, Trump compelled Netanyahu to accept elements of a peace plan he had previously opposed and pause the war. Although the United States' relationship with Israel is the most politically charged, the United States will always face tradeoffs between the strategic benefits of fulsome support to quasi allies and the temptation to parlay that support into meaningful influence over military and diplomatic decision-making.

The strategic dilemmas that quasi alliances pose are endlessly frustrating to policymakers. But they are here to stay. Ending the war in Ukraine on favorable terms and preserving a fragile truce in Gaza will require deft navigation of these dilemmas. Several lessons emerge from the United States' recent experience with Ukraine and Israel. First, leaders face a temptation to paper over differences and exaggerate the convergence of interests, especially when helping to defend a close partner against brutal aggression. But Washington should commit to support quasi allies in wars only if they have clearly defined objectives that closely correspond with its own. Once the United States decides to undertake such support, it should build mechanisms to align priorities and privately manage disagreements. Models include U.S.-Ukrainian military planning channels and the national security adviser–led U.S.-Israeli strategic dialogue on Iran. And clear leader-level communication is paramount.

Policymakers should also design credible forms of leverage to shape quasi allies' behavior. Security assistance should be strategically calibrated—a reframing that emphasizes U.S. interests rather than the coercive connotations of aid conditionality. Such a process begins with conveying clear expectations in writing, such as end-use restrictions on U.S. military equipment. Even minor violations should be addressed early to create an expectation of enforcement. If the White House keeps up a regular cadence of reviews of U.S. arms deliveries, it can better ensure that the pace and content of these transfers are aligned with policy objectives and legal requirements, not conducted on autopilot. Congress is an essential partner: it can legislate restrictions itself as well as help preserve leader-level relationships by deferring blame to Capitol Hill.

Careful public messaging can make all of this easier. It is crucial to project strong support for quasi allies and explain that support to the American public without creating commitments that become politically costly to walk back. Too often, critics of Biden's sound Ukraine policy seized on the difference between his soaring rhetoric and his well-founded escalation concerns. Adhering to a policy that there should be “no daylight” between the United States and its quasi ally is a mistake because it creates an impossible choice between burying disagreement and absorbing the political blowback associated with a public break.

An even more consequential conflict involving a quasi ally could be lurking on the horizon: war between China and Taiwan. The United States could quickly become a direct combatant in such a conflict, assuming far more risk but also exerting much greater influence over the course of the war and its outcome. But even if the United States intervenes outright on Taiwan's behalf, quasi-alliance dilemmas would resurface: divergent interests and domestic-political incentives, especially given Taiwan's highly polarized politics; escalatory steps by Taipei that could undercut Washington's efforts to carefully manage risk; and the difficulty of finding a mutually acceptable endgame. These challenges all place a premium on quiet peacetime coordination between Washington and Taipei to build alignment on notional military plans and war aims, procedures for escalation management and signaling to Beijing, and conditions for terminating a war.

Leaders cannot wish away close friends such as Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine that straddle combustible geopolitical fault lines—nor would it benefit the United States to do so. But to advance U.S. interests, Washington needs better answers to the strategic dilemmas inherent in managing quasi alliances. Only by grappling with recent successes and failures can policymakers develop a better playbook.

            Los Angeles Dodgers two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani is once again adding well-deserved hardware to his growing collection and further securing his reputation as a generational talent.
    


            The Japanese pitcher-slugger was again unanimously voted the National League's Most Valuable Player on Thursday, the second year in a row he has been named the league's best player. New York Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge took home honors in the American League for a second consecutive year.
    


            Ohtani, sitting next to his wife, Mamiko Tanaka, and their dog, Decoy, when his name was announced on MLB Network, gave a lil smooch to his pup to celebrate the occasion.

            The 31-year-old is now the first player in Major League Baseball history to win the award twice in both leagues. The five-time All-Star was named the AL MVP in 2021 and 2023 with the Los Angeles Angels before leaving for the cross-town Dodgers after signing a reported $700 million contract.
    


            Ohtani yet again proved why he is considered an all-time talent, leading the Dodgers to their second straight World Series win.
    


            The Japanese star hit 55 home runs, 102 RBI with a .282 batting average this season, highlighted by a magical postseason run that saw him hit three home runs on the way to the Fall Classic victory.
    


            Ohtani also made an impact on the mound for LA, making his return to pitching in June after an almost two-year layoff, following two procedures, including one to repair the right ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow and his left shoulder last offseason. In 14 starts, he went 1-1 with a 2.87 ERA and had 62 strikeouts.
    


Shohei Ohtani is having an October unlike any other. Tuesday night's game will be yet another for the history books



            The second-straight MVP award comes after posting a historic season last year in which he became the first player in MLB history to hit 50 home runs and steal 50 bases in a single campaign.
    

3 straight MVPs, 4 total, and all of them UNANIMOUS.Shohei Ohtani is superhuman 💥 pic.twitter.com/7CjePY120c


            Ohtani beat out award finalists New York Mets outfielder Juan Soto and Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber, getting all 30 votes to win unanimously.
    


            Ohtani gave a “shout out” to Soto and Schwarber for “bringing out the best” in him this season.
    


            “Biggest thing is winning the World Series,” Ohtani said via his translator on MLB Network. “That's first and foremost, it's icing on the cake to be able to get an individual award – being crowned MVP. But I just really want to appreciate the support from all my teammates, everybody around me, my supporting staff.”
    


            He joins Barry Bonds as the only player in MLB history to win four MVPs. Bonds, MLB's all-time home run leader, has won the award seven times.
    


            The 33-year-old Judge proved his value for the Bronx Bombers, hitting 53 home runs along with a .331 batting average, now winning the award for the second straight year and third time in his career.
    


            Standing at an opposing 6-foot-7, Judge became just the third player to hit at least 50 home runs and win a batting title in the same season, joining Yankees great Mickey Mantle and Jimmie Foxx.
    


            Judge called it “pretty wild” when asked about all the silverware he's won.

            “You try not to think about it during the season. I try to keep my head down through all 162,” Judge said with his family and two dogs beside him. “Just do whatever I can in today's game to help the team win. Do what you can, give it your all and you wake up the next day and do it again.”
    


            Judge beat out Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh and Cleveland Guardians third baseman Jose Ramirez with 17 first-place votes. Raleigh, affectionately known as the “Big Dumper,” came in second with 13 votes.
    


            The seven-time All-Star congratulated Raleigh and Ramirez for having “two incredible seasons.”
    


            “It's always fun playing against those two,” Judge said. “Especially when we play Seattle, the main objective is making sure Cal (Raleigh) doesn't beat you. He can beat you from both sides of the plate.”
    


            With the MVPs awarded, the league year is now complete, with the Winter Meetings scheduled to begin next week.
    


            On Wednesday, Detroit Tigers ace Tarik Skubal won his second straight AL Cy Young award, while Pittsburgh Pirates' 23-year-old phenom Paul Skenes was named the NL Cy Young winner.
    


            Earlier in the week, Athletics first baseman Nick Kurtz unanimously won the AL Rookie of the Year. Atlanta Braves catcher Drake Baldwin was named the NL Rookie of the Year.
    


            Milwaukee Brewers manager Pat Murphy was named the NL Manager of the Year and Guardians manager Stephen Vogt won AL Manager of the Year for the second consecutive year.

By the time Jeffery Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, he had established an enormous network of wealthy and influential friends. Emails made public this week show the crime did little to diminish the desire of that network to stay connected to the billionaire financier.

Thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday offer a new glimpse into what Epstein's relationships with business executives, reporters, academics and political players looked like over a decade.

They start with messages he sent and received around the time he finished serving his Florida sentence in 2009 and continue until the months before his arrest on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019.

During that time, Epstein's network was eclectic, spanning the globe and political affiliations: from the liberal academic Noam Chomsky to Steve Bannon, the longtime ally of President Donald Trump.

Some reached out to support Epstein amid lawsuits and prosecutions, others sought introductions or advice on everything from dating to oil prices. One consulted him on how to respond to accusations of sexual harassment.

Epstein was charged with sex trafficking in 2019, and killed himself in jail a month later. Epstein's crimes, high-profile connections and jailhouse suicide have made the case a magnet for conspiracy theorists and online sleuths seeking proof of a cover-up. 

The emails do not implicate his contacts in those alleged crimes. They instead paint a picture of Epstein's influence and connections over the years he was a registered sex offender.

Epstein emailed current and former political figures on all sides, sending news clips and discussing strategy or gossip often in short, choppy emails laden with spelling and grammatical errors.

In several emails in 2018, Epstein advised Bannon on his political tour of Europe that year after Bannon forwarded Epstein a news clip that the German media underestimated Bannon and that he was “As Dangerous as Ever.”

“luv it,” Epstein responded. 

Epstein wrote that he'd just spoken to “one of the country leaders that we discussed” and that “we should lay out a strategy plan. . how much fun.” 

Several months later, Epstein sent some advice: “If you are going to play here , you'll have to spend time, europe by remote doesn't work.”

“its doable but time consuming,” Epstein continued in a follow-up email, “there are many leaders of countries we can organize for you to have one on ones.” 

Just a few months earlier, Epstein was insulting Trump — whose movement Bannon was a representative of — in emails to Kathryn Ruemmler, the former White House counsel under President Barack Obama. 

Ruemmler sent a message to Epstein calling Trump “so gross.” A portion of that message was redacted, but Epstein replied, “worse in real life and upclose.”

In other emails with Ruemmler, Epstein detailed a whirlwind of well known people he appears to have been meeting, hosting or speaking with that week, including an ambassador, tech giant, foreign business people, academics and a film director.

“you are a welcome guest at any,” he wrote.

Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokesperson for Goldman Sachs, where Ruemmler now works, declined to comment.

The financier emailed often with people in the upper echelons of wealth around the world, brokering introductions and chatting about politics and foreign affairs.

That included Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, who Epstein sent an email to in 2014 saying “that was fun , see you in 3 weeks.”

Four years later, Epstein asked if Thiel was enjoying Los Angeles, and, after Thiel said he couldn't complain, replied “Dec visit me Caribbean.” It's unclear if Thiel ever responded. 

In emails with Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, an Emirati businessman, Epstein complimented Bannon, saying in 2018 that “We have become friends you will like him.”

“Trump doesn't like him,” responded Sulayem.

A year earlier, Sulayem asked Epstein about an event where it appeared Trump would be in attendance, asking, “Do you think it will be possible to shake hand with trump.”

“Call to discuss,” Epstein wrote back. 

In January 2010, biotech venture capitalist Boris Nikolic was attending the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and Epstein emailed to ask, “any fun?” 

Nikolic replied that he had met “your friend” Bill Clinton, as well as then-French President Nicholas Sarkozy and “your other friend,” Prince Andrew, “as he has some questions re microsoft.”

But then Nikolic said he was getting sick of meetings. Later, he wrote Epstein that “it would be blast that you are here.” He mentioned flirting with a 22-year-old woman.

“It turns out she is with her husand. Did not have chance to check him out. But as we concluded, anything good is rented ;)” Nikolic wrote.

The theoretical physicist and cosmologist Laurence Krauss was among them. In 2017, Krauss reached out to Epstein via email for advice on responding to a reporter writing a story about allegations of sexual harassment against him.

“Is this a reasonable response? Should i even respond? Could use advice,” Krauss asked Epstein.

In an explicit exchange, Epstein asked Krauss if he'd had sex with the person in question and then suggested he should not reply to the journalist. 

“No. We didn't have sex. Decided it wasn't a good idea,” replied Krauss, who has previously denied all allegations of sexual harassment and assault.

In an August 2015 email exchange, Epstein told Chomsky, the famed linguist and social scientist, to only fly to Greece if he feels well, joking he previously had to send a plane for another “lefty friend” to see a doctor in New York.

In the same exchange, which dipped into academic arguments about warning signs on currency collapses, behavioral science models, and Big Data, Epstein offered his residences for Chomsky's use.

“you are of course welcome to use apt in new york with your new leisure time, or visit new Mexico again,” Epstein wrote. 

The emails also show that Epstein kept up a friendly relationship with Larry Summers, who was the treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and former Harvard University president, and bantered about the 2016 presidential race and Trump.

Other emails showed a closer relationship. In 2019, Summers was discussing interactions he had with a woman, writing to Epstein that “I said what are you up to. She said ‘I'm busy'. I said awfully coy u are.” 

Epstein replied, “you reacted well.. annoyed shows caring. , no whining showed strentgh.” 

Summers issued a statement saying he has “great regrets in my life.” 

“As I have said before, my association with Jeffrey Epstein was a major error of judgement,” the statement said.

Chomsky, Thiel, Bannon, Krauss and Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem did not immediately respond to requests for comment, which were sent through email addresses available on their own or their organization's websites.

Shohei Ohtani likes winning Most Valuable Player awards. He loves winning the World Series even more.

The two-way Japenese star did both for a second season in a row for the Los Angeles Dodgers, earning his fourth career MVP on Thursday night while unanimously earning the National League honor. He's just the second to win four MVPs after Barry Bonds with seven and the only player to win unanimously more than once.

Considering Ohtani is 31, overtaking Bonds doesn't seem out of the question. Especially if it leads to more Fall Classic opportunities.

“If I'm playing well as an individual that means I'm helping the team win, so in that sense, hopefully I can end up with a couple more MVPs,” Ohtani said through an interpreter. “But at the end of the day, it's all about winning games.”

In the American League, Aaron Judge became the New York Yankees' fourth three-time winner, edging Seattle's Cal Raleigh with 17 first-place votes to 13 for the switch-hitting catcher. The vote was the closest for an MVP since the Los Angeles Angels' Mike Trout topped Houston's Alex Bregman by 17-13 in 2019.

Judge, who won the AL award in 2022 and 2024, joined Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra and Mickey Mantle as three-time MVPs with the Yankees. The 33-year-old outfielder led the majors with a .331 batting average and 1.144 OPS while hitting 53 homers.

When asked about his place in MLB and Yankees lore, Judge acknowledged he's in rare company.




“It's tough for me to wrap my head around,” Judge said. “It's mind blowing from my side of things, because I play this game to win, I play this game for my teammates, my family, all the fans in New York.”

Later he added: “You've got to pinch yourself every single day. It's truly an incredible honor.”

Ohtani won a MVP for the third straight year, his second in the NL with the Dodgers after two in the AL with the Angels. He became the first to win in each league twice after getting the AL honor in 2021 and 2023. Ohtani signed with the crosstown Dodgers the following offseason and won NL MVP in 2024 during his first season in Chavez Ravine. He's also won the World Series in both his seasons with the Dodgers.

Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber finished second in the NL with 23 second-place votes and New York Mets outfielder Juan Soto was third with four.

Ohtani hit .282 and led the NL with a 1.014 OPS. He also had 55 homers, 102 RBIs and 20 stolen bases. 

The right-hander returned to pitching in June after missing 1 1/2 seasons on the mound because of an elbow injury. He struck out 62 batters over 47 innings, slowly increasing his workload while preparing for the postseason. 

Ohtani continued to shine in October with arguably the greatest single game in MLB history. He hit three homers while striking out 10 over six dominant innings on Oct. 17, leading the Dodgers over Milwaukee to finish an NL Championship Series sweep.

Schwarber, who earned a $50,000 bonus for finishing second, hit an NL-best 56 homers and led the big leagues with 132 RBIs for Philadelphia.

Soto overcame a slow start to the season to have his typically stellar offensive output. The four-time All-Star — who signed a $765 million, 15-year deal last December — had 43 homers, 105 RBIs and an NL-best 38 stolen bases. He received a $150,000 bonus for finishing third in the MVP voting.

Judge is the first AL player to win back-to-back MVPs since Detroit's Miguel Cabrera it in 2012 and 2013.

Raleigh, nicknamed “Big Dumper,” led the big leagues with 60 homers, the most for a player primarily a catcher. He started 119 games behind the plate and another 38 at designated hitter.

The 28-year-old also had a career-high 125 RBIs, leading the Mariners to one of their best seasons in franchise history. Judge said he got to know Raleigh a little during the All-Star break and the catcher asked for some leadership tips.

“Cal's a special player,” Judge said. “I could sit here and talk all night about the player he is, but really the kind of leader and person he is really stuck out to me at the All-Star Game.”

Cleveland's José Ramírez finished third in the AL. 

Arizona's Geraldo Perdomo was fourth in the NL voting, earning him $2.5 million annual salary increases in 2028 and 2029 along with the price of Arizona's 2030 club option.

CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — The yearslong case against six Nevada Republicans who were accused of submitting a bogus certificate that falsely declared President Donald Trump the winner of the state's 2020 presidential election has been sent back to Clark County, where a jury is more likely to rule against them. 

The opinion released Thursday from the Nevada Supreme Court reverses an earlier decision from a state judge who dismissed the case after ruling Clark County was the wrong venue for the case because the alleged crimes had occurred elsewhere in the state. Clark County is home to Las Vegas and leans Democratic. 

The higher court's decision to let the case move forward marks a rare win for swing-state efforts to prosecute so-called fake electors who tried to keep Trump in the White House after he lost to Joe Biden in 2020. In Michigan, a judge recently dismissed charges against 15 Republicans who had been charged by that state's Democratic attorney general, Dana Nessel. The dismissal came after a judge in Arizona sent the fake electors case there back to the grand jury for fuller instructions about what federal law requires. 

“Today the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed what we have maintained all along — that Clark County is the proper and lawful venue to prosecute our case, and I am pleased with the court's decision to overturn the District Court's dismissal of our case in Clark County,” Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford said in a statement.

Electors declined to comment Thursday.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




After the 2020 election, the six electors gathered outside of the Nevada Legislature to sign certificates giving the state's six electoral votes to Trump, despite former President Joe Biden winning the state by more than 30,000 votes. The ceremony was broadcast online, and the video footage was used as evidence in the case.




Criminal cases were also brought against Republican electors in Michigan, Georgia and Arizona. On Monday, Trump pardoned his former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others accused of aiding his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.

The defendants have called the case political prosecution. They say they were exercising their First Amendment rights to criticize the state's election processes.

The six Nevadans, who had pleaded not guilty, include Michael McDonald, the chairman of the Nevada Republican Party, and Jesse Law, the former Clark County Republican Party chairman who was recently ousted in a July election.

A main argument in the case focused on where the alleged crimes occurred. After that ceremony, one of the electors mailed the documents from Douglas County to the archivist of the United States and the president of the Senate in Washington, D.C. It was also sent to the Nevada secretary of state in Carson City and a federal judge in Las Vegas.

Ford argued the case belongs in Clark County because the envelope was sent to Las Vegas, however one of the electors argued that the envelope was redirected to the judge's chambers in Reno.

The Nevada Supreme Court justices sided unanimously with the attorney general's office, saying in its Thursday opinion that Nevada law does not preclude a venue from being appropriate in multiple counties for the same offense. 

As a precaution, Ford filed a separate case in Carson City in December 2024 to avoid the statute of limitations expiring while the Nevada Supreme Court made its decision. In the Carson City case, he charged the defendants with “uttering a forged instrument.” That case will likely be withdrawn. 

Ford, a Democrat, is running for governor in 2026.

SEATTLE (AP) — First-term Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell conceded his reelection fight to progressive activist Katie Wilson on Thursday, handing another victory to leftist Democrats around the country frustrated with unaffordability, homelessness, public safety and the actions of President Donald Trump's administration.

Harrell, a centrist Democrat who previously served three terms on the City Council, led in early results. But Washington conducts all-mail elections, with ballots postmarked by Election Day. Later-arriving votes, which historically trend more liberal, broke heavily in Wilson's favor, adding to a progressive shift to the left nationally.

In a concession speech at City Hall on Thursday afternoon, Harrell said he had congratulated Wilson in a “delightful” call.

“I feel very good about the future of this country and this city still,” he said.

Wilson, 43, is a democratic socialist who has never held elected office. She told a news conference later Thursday that it was hard for her to believe she had been elected mayor, considering that at the beginning of this year she had no intention of running, and she acknowledged concerns about her lack of experience: “No one saw this coming.”

But she also spoke to the resonance of her volunteer-driven campaign among voters concerned about affordability and public safety in a city where the cost of living has soared as Amazon and other tech companies proliferated. Universal child care, better mass transit, better public safety and stable, affordable housing are among her priorities, and she said she would take office with a strong mandate to purse them, though she acknowledged the city also faces a significant budget shortfall.




Wilson called herself a coalition builder and community organizer, and said she would also work with those who questioned her qualifications to lead a city with more than 13,000 employees and a budget of nearly $9 billion: “This is your city too.” 

“When I say this is your city, that means you have a right to be here and to live a dignified life — whatever your background, whatever your income,” Wilson said. “But it also means that we all have a collective responsibility for this city and for each other. ... We cannot tackle the major challenges facing our city unless we do it together.”

She will be working with a relatively new City Council: Only two of the seven council members have served more than one term.

Harrell was elected mayor in 2021 following the chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic and racial justice protests over George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police. With crime falling, more police being hired, less visible drug use and many homeless encampments removed from city parks, the business-backed Harrell once seemed likely to cruise to reelection.

But Trump's return to office — and his efforts to send in federal agents or cut funding for blue cities — helped reawaken Seattle's progressive voters. The lesser-known Wilson, a democratic socialist, ran a campaign that echoed some of the themes of progressive mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani in New York. She trounced Harrell by nearly 10 percentage points in the August primary and quickly became favored to win the mayor's office.

Wilson studied at an Oxford University college in England but did not graduate. She founded the small nonprofit Transit Riders Union in 2011 and has led campaigns for better public transportation, higher minimum wages, stronger renter protections and more affordable housing. She herself is a renter, living in a one-bedroom apartment in the city's Capitol Hill neighborhood, and says that has shaped her understanding of Seattle's affordability crisis.

Wilson criticized Harrell as doing too little to provide more shelter and said his encampment sweeps have been cosmetic, merely pushing unhoused people around the city. Wilson also painted him as a City Hall fixture who bore responsibility for the status quo.

Harrell, 67, played on the Rose Bowl champion University of Washington football team in 1978 before going to law school. His father, who was Black, came to Seattle from the segregated Jim Crow South, and his mother, a Japanese American, was incarcerated at an internment camp in Minidoka, Idaho, during World War II after officials seized her family's Seattle flower shop — experiences that fostered his understanding of the importance of civil rights and inclusivity. 

Both candidates touted plans for affordable housing, combating crime and attempting to Trump-proof the city, which receives about $150 million a year in federal funding. Both want to protect Seattle's sanctuary city status. 

Wilson has proposed a city-level capital gains tax to help offset federal funding the city might lose and to pay for housing. Harrell says that idea is ineffective because a city capital gains tax could easily be avoided by those who would be required to pay it.

NEW YORK (AP) — Lawyers representing OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, branches of the Sackler family that own it, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others across the U.S. are expected to deliver a nearly unanimous message for a bankruptcy court judge Friday: Approve a plan to settle thousands of opioid-related lawsuits against the company.

If U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane abides, it will close a long chapter — and maybe the entire book — on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the U.S. since 1999, including deaths from heroin and illicit fentanyl.

Closing arguments were expected Friday in the third day of a hearing over a bankruptcy plan for the company, which filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars.

The saga has been emotional and full of contentious arguments between the many groups that took Purdue to court, often exposing a possible mismatch between the quest for justice and the practical role of bankruptcy court.

The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a previous deal because it said it was improper for Sackler family members to receive immunity from lawsuits over opioids. In the new arrangement, entities who don't opt into the settlement can sue them. Family members are collectively worth billions, but much of their assets are held in trusts in offshore accounts that would be hard to access through lawsuits.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




This time, the government groups involved have reached an even fuller consensus and there's been mostly subdued opposition from individuals. Out of more than 54,000 personal injury victims who voted on whether the plan should be accepted. just 218 said no. A larger number of people who are part of that group didn't vote.




A handful of objectors spoke Thursday at the hearing, sometimes interrupting the judge. Some said that only the victims, not the states and other government entities, should receive the funds in the settlement. Others wanted the judge to find the members of the Sackler family criminally liable — something Lane said is beyond the scope of the bankruptcy court, but that the settlement doesn't bar prosecutors from pursuing.

A Florida woman whose husband struggled with addiction after being given OxyContin following an accident told the court that the deal isn't enough.

“The natural laws of karma suggest the Sacklers and Purdue Pharma should pay for what they have done,” Pamela Bartz Halaschak said via video.

A flood of lawsuits filed by government entities against Purdue and other drugmakers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains began about a decade ago.

Most of the major ones have already settled for a total of about $50 billion, with most of the money going to fight the opioid crisis.

The Purdue deal would rank among the largest of them. Members of the Sackler family would be required to pay up to $7 billion and give up ownership of the company. None have been on its board or received payments since 2018. Unlike a similar hearing four years ago, none were called to testify in this week's hearing.

The company would get a name change and new overseers who would dedicate future profits to battling the opioid crisis.

There are also some non-financial provisions. Certain members of the Sackler family would be required to give up involvement in companies that sell opioids in other countries.

Family members would also be barred from having their names added to institutions in exchange for charitable contributions. The name has already been removed from museums and universities.

And company documents, including many that would normally be subject to lawyer-client privilege, are to be made public.

Unlike the other major opioid settlements, individuals harmed by Purdue's products would be in line for some money as part of the settlement. About $850 million would be set aside for them, with more than $100 million of that amount carved out to help children born dealing with opioid withdrawal.

About 139,000 people have active claims for the money. Many of them, however, have not shown proof that they were prescribed Purdue's opioids and will receive nothing. Lawyers expect that those who had prescriptions for at least six months would receive about $16,000 each and those who had them more briefly would get around $8,000. Legal fees would reduce what people actually receive.

One woman who had a family member suffer from opioid addiction told the court by video Thursday that the settlement doesn't help people with substance use disorder.

“Tell me how you guys can sleep at night knowing people are going to get so little money they can't do anything with it,” asked Laureen Ferrante of Staten Island, New York.

Most of the money is to go to state and local governments to be used in their efforts to mitigate damage of the opioid epidemic. Overdose death numbers have been dropping in the past few years, a decline experts believe is partly due to the impact of settlement dollars.

The U.S. Coast Guard announced Thursday it detected a Russian military spy vessel operating near U.S. territorial waters Oct. 29, and personnel are continuing to monitor the ship.

Officials said the Vishnya-class intelligence ship was about 15 nautical miles south of Oahu, prompting a response by the Coast Guard HC-130 Hercules from Air Station Barbers Point and the Coast Guard Cutter William Hart.

The Coast Guard responded to the Russian Federation Navy Auxiliary General Intelligence ship, Kareliya, by conducting a safe and professional overflight and transiting near the vessel, according to a news release.

Acting in accordance with international law, the Coast Guard said personnel are monitoring the vessel's activities near U.S. territorial waters to provide maritime security for U.S. vessels operating in the area.

Coast guardsmen will also monitor the vessel to support U.S. homeland defense efforts.

""The U.S. Coast Guard routinely monitors maritime activity around the Hawaiian Islands and throughout the Pacific to ensure the safety and security of U.S. waters,"" Capt. Matthew Chong, chief of response for the Coast Guard Oceania District, wrote in a statement.

""Working in concert with partners and allies, our crews monitor and respond to foreign military vessel activity near our territorial waters to protect our maritime borders and defend our sovereign interests.""

The Vishnya-class is a group of intelligence collection ships built for the Soviet Navy in the 1980s, according to the U.S. Army website. There are seven ships still in service with the Russian Navy. 

They are large, purpose-built vessels designed for signals intelligence gathering via an extensive array of sensors, according to the site. Data can be transmitted to shore via satellite link antennas.

While the ships are designed for intelligence gathering, they are armed with two AK-630 close-in weapon systems and SA-N-8 surface-to-air missile (SAM) launchers, for last resort self-defense, according to the Army.

Coast Guard Oceania District works in conjunction with U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and interagency partners to constantly monitor the activity of foreign military vessels operating near U.S. territorial waters to ensure homeland security and defense.

Under customary international law, foreign military vessels are permitted to transit and operate outside other nations' territorial seas, which extend up to 12 nautical miles from shore.

Witnesses say anti-Israel agitators violently stormed an event in Toronto, breaking glass and attacking attendees Nov. 5, 2025.

Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) Director Daniel Rogers, during a rare public appearance Thursday, said nearly one in 10 of the agency's terrorism investigations include at least one person under the age of 18, an alarming trend driven by online extremism.

Since 2014, there have been nearly two dozen violent extremist attacks in Canada resulting in 29 deaths and at least 60 injuries, according to Rogers.

Worryingly, he said, nearly one in ten terrorism investigations at CSIS, the country's domestic spy agency, include at least one ""subject of investigation"" under the age of 18.

In August, a minor was arrested in Montreal for allegedly planning an attack on behalf of the terrorist group Daesh, according to Rogers.

THE NEW MAFIA: TRUMP, CIVIL RICO AND THE GLOBAL INTIFADA

Just a few months earlier, a 15-year-old Edmonton-area minor was charged with a terrorism-related offense, after Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) investigators feared the teen would commit serious violence related to COM/764, a transnational violent online network that manipulates children and youth across widely accessible online platforms.

Rogers also noted two 15-year-olds were arrested in Ottawa for allegedly conspiring to conduct a mass casualty attack targeting the Jewish community in Canada's capital in late 2023 and early 2024.

""Clearly, radicalized youth can cause the same harms as radicalized adults, but the societal supports for youth may help us catch radicalization early and prevent it,"" Rogers said. ""These tragic numbers would have been higher if not for disruptive actions taken by CSIS and our law enforcement partners.""

The CSIS joined the RCMP and intelligence partners from the U.S., United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand in releasing a joint public report in December, highlighting the evolving issue of young people and violent extremism. 

The report provides advice to parents, guardians and others with information to help them identify early concerns and address youth radicalization before it's too late. 

""Since 2022, CSIS has been involved in the disruption of no fewer than 24 violent extremist actions, each resulting in arrests or terrorism peace bond charges,"" Rogers said. ""In 2024, CSIS played an integral role in the disruption of two Daesh-inspired plots. 

""In one case, a father and son were allegedly in the advanced stages of planning an attack in the Toronto area. In another, an individual was arrested before allegedly attempting to illegally enter the United States to attack members of the Jewish community in New York. In these examples, and in many others I can't discuss publicly, our counter-terrorism teams have partnered with law enforcement and saved lives.""

Canadian officials said they also blocked potentially 'lethal threats' by Iran. (Mert Alper Dervis/Anadolu Agency)

He attributed the radicalization to ""eroding social cohesion, increasing polarization and significant global events,"" which he said ""provide fertile ground for radicalization.""

""Many who turn to violence radicalize exclusively online, often without direction from others,"" Rogers said. ""They use technology to do so secretly and anonymously, seriously challenging the ability of our investigators to keep pace and to identify and prevent acts of violence.""

Rogers also noted the CSIS collects intelligence and defends against transnational repression, previously focusing on transnational repression by the People's Republic of China, India and others. 

""In particularly alarming cases over the last year, we've had to reprioritize our operations to counter the actions of Iranian intelligence services and their proxies who have targeted individuals they perceive as threats to their regime,"" he said. ""In more than one case, this involved detecting, investigating and disrupting potentially lethal threats against individuals in Canada.""

Shohei Ohtani spoke with Tom Verducci after the Los Angeles Dodgers' Game 3 win over the Toronto Blue Jays in the World Series. 

The MLB Most Valuable Player Awards for the 2025 season are official, and while one league had a tight race, it wasn't close in the other. 

After winning his second World Series in as many years with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Shohei Ohtani also has back-to-back NL MVP Awards under his belt after a unanimous vote from the Baseball Writers' Association of America.

The two-way Japanese superstar was named the 2025 NL MVP, giving him four over his MLB career. He won his first two in the American League with the Los Angeles Angels. In fact, he has won an MVP Award in each of the last three seasons, having won the 2023 award in his final year as an Angels star.

Now, Ohtani has just Barry Bonds to chase for the most MVP Awards in MLB history. Bonds won seven NL MVPs, a feat some believe is still untouchable. Ohtani was tied with 10 other players with three over their careers, but the 31-year-old is in a new position now and only looking up at Bonds. 

The Philadelphia Phillies' Kyle Schwarber and New York Mets' Juan Soto were the two remaining finalists in the NL. Schwarber received 23 second-place votes to Soto's four. 

Ohtani, a five-time All-Star, led the National League in runs scored (146), slugging percentage (.622) and OPS (1.024), while mashing 55 home runs with 102 RBIs and a .282 average. Ohtani also sported a .392 on-base percentage with 20 intentional walks, which also led the NL. 

And after not being able to pitch in 2024, Ohtani was back on the mound this season with a 2.87 ERA in 14 starts (47 innings) with 62 strikeouts and nine walks. 

PAUL SKENES, TARIK SKUBAL WIN CY YOUNG AWARDS AS TRADE RUMORS SWIRL AROUND STAR PITCHERS

The award is based strictly on the regular season, but Ohtani played a major part in the Dodgers' retaining their World Series title in an epic seven-game series against the Toronto Blue Jays. Over 17 postseason games, Ohtani slashed .265/.405/.691 with eight homers, three doubles and 14 RBIs. 

While it was virtually a lock Ohtani would be named the NL MVP, one of baseball's biggest debates revolved around the AL MVP. Was it going to be New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge going back-to-back, or would Seattle Mariners switch-hitting catcher Cal Raleigh's dream season end with the award?

The baseball writers chose Judge.

Judge received 17 first-place votes to Raleigh's 13, which the BBWAA said was the closest MVP race since 2019.

Judge has won the MVP three of the last four years in the American League.

While Raleigh had Judge beat in the home run department, the Yankees slugger won his first career batting title, leading MLB with a .331 average. He also led all of MLB with a .457 on-base percentage, .688 slugging percentage and 1.144 OPS and was the leader in the American League with 137 runs. 

Judge tallied 114 RBIs, and he was intentionally walked 36 times, blowing away Ohtani's NL-leading total.

BACK-TO-BACK, TWICE: PAT MURPHY, STEPHEN VOGT REPEAT AS MLB MANAGERS OF THE YEAR

This was Judge's seventh All-Star season as he continues to be arguably the best pure hitter in MLB. Unfortunately for him and the pinstripes, they were unable to make the run Ohtani and the Dodgers did. The Yankees were beaten by the AL pennant-winning Blue Jays in the ALDS, though Judge had a memorable moment in Game 3 with a clutch home run off the foul pole to keep the Yankees' season alive. 

Raleigh was one of the greatest baseball stories of the season. It just seemed Raleigh couldn't be stopped, and he couldn't stop breaking records in the process. 

Raleigh hit 60 home runs, which not only led MLB, but set the league record for the most ever by a catcher, a switch-hitter and a Mariners player. He finished with 125 RBIs while slashing .247/.359/.948 in 159 games.

Raleigh played in all but three games this season, which includes 128 games at the league's most demanding position as a catcher. 

Those pulling for Raleigh during the season pointed to how he was consistently breaking records for a position that usually gets overlooked for this type of award. He was a clear factor in the Mariners securing the AL West title for the first time since 2001, and they made a strong run in the postseason, too, before ultimately succumbing to the Blue Jays in Game 7.

Influencer Isabel Brown on findings that Gen Z prefers hybrid or in-office work to fully remote options in the post-COVID era.

Democratic National Committee employees were mercilessly mocked this week after news came out that staffers were very unhappy with a recent directive from DNC Chairman Ken Martin  end to remote work for employees who will now be required to show up to the office five days a week.

Leadership of the union representing DNC employees put out a statement following news of the new directive, describing it as ""callous."" Reports from those on the staff-wide call also described an immediate flurry of thumbs-down emojis and other signs of anger upon news of the new requirement.

""It was shocking to see the DNC chair disregard staff's valid concerns on today's team call,"" they wrote. ""D.N.C. staff worked extremely hard to support historic wins for Democrats up and down the ballot last Tuesday, and this change feels especially callous considering the current economic conditions created by the Trump administration."" Martin reportedly told employees that if they don't like the new policy, they should go find a job elsewhere. 

And Martin wasn't the only Democrat who had some harsh and pointed words for the Democratic Party staffers. Neera Tanden, former President Joe Biden's domestic policy advisor, had a similar message for DNC staffers, suggesting there were many eager folks waiting in line who would likely be more than willing to go into the office.

""If you think democracy is on the line – working in the office is not a big ask,"" Tanden wrote in a post on X. ""And there are plenty of other people willing to step up. Get yourselves together people.""

A left-wing group, the Center for New Liberalism, echoed the view that the staffers ""should look elsewhere"" if working from home is a ""must-have.""

""When you accept a job on a campaign, or with an org like the DNC, DCCC, etc, your single purpose is to win the election. It is a demanding job that requires long hours & sacrifices,"" the group wrote on X. ""The other part of this is that I suspect [work from home] staff are probably losing opportunities for themselves by not being in the office. Campaigns require a lot of personal sacrifice, but the people who are good at their job and work to make themselves noticed in the office usually tend to go on to do big things!""

One Florida-based Democratic strategist, Steve Schale, who led Barack Obama's statewide efforts in Florida in 2008 and returned to help his campaign in 2012, said the DNC should implement a ""requirement"" to ensure those who want to work at the DNC really have what it takes.   

""There should be a requirement that to work at the DNC that you've done at least two cycles on an actual battleground campaign, where terms like flex hours & hybrid work don't exist,"" Schale wrote on X.

Meanwhile, Republicans did not spare the opportunity to slam Democratic Party staffers as well.  

""You can't make this up -- the DNC union is pissed that the Chairman is calling staff back into the office 5 days a week,"" former Trump White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said after learning of the anger. GOP strategist, Matt Gorman, quipped that the image of DNC staffers logging onto a Zoom call in their pajamas amid all the chaos of Biden's reelection ""is hilarious.""

""The best part is that they still get two full months before they actually have to get out of bed 5 days week,"" GOP National Press Secretary Kiersten Pels said. ""Is this a political committee or a daycare?""

Martin reportedly told his employees that the work-from-home policy the DNC implemented during COVID was never meant to be permanent, describing it as a ""Band-Aid"" that has long needed to be ripped off. He did say that remote work would still be allowed on a case-by-case basis, however.

The staffer's union said it is considering all options in terms of challenging the measure. The group previously ratified a collective bargaining agreement with the DNC over the summer that ""reaffirms its commitment to making hybrid work available,"" but also includes language that allows for a full return to in-person working as long as there is a 60-day notice period, according to the New York Times.     

Earlier this year, the Congressional Progressive Staff Association sent a letter to top House and Senate leaders proposing a rotating 32-hour work week for congressional staffers, arguing it would be a more ""sustainable approach to work on a national level.""

The proposal was widely mocked, however. 

""Why not be bold and ask for a 0-hour workweek?"" quipped Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., at the time. ""I wonder how blue-collar Americans would feel about white-collar workers demanding a 32-hour workweek.""

Fox News correspondent Brooke Taylor reports on ICE's joint operation with Florida law enforcement targeting illegal sexual offenders and convicted murderers on ‘The Story'.

Locals in San Francisco, California, have begun passing out whistles to communicate and coordinate against ICE deportations.

Activists and organizations have started distributing whistles for local residents to coordinate against the federal government's immigration enforcement efforts, SFGate reported. 

""By following the same whistle code, locals can communicate from afar: Three short whistles signal that ICE is nearby, and one long whistle means that somebody is being detained,"" SFGate reported. 

Frameline, the nonprofit behind San Francisco's LGBTQ+ Frameline film festival, has been stocking ""whistle stops"" in the city, where people can pick up free whistles and join anti-ICE efforts. The organization explained in a post on Instagram that it was inspired by efforts in Chicago.

In an email to SFGATE, Roxie Theater manager Gabriella Siaton, whose venue is one of multiple participating whistle stops, said the theater's initial supply of whistles was gone within a day of arrival.

""Prior to this, I had not heard about the whistle code,"" she wrote. ""I knew there were different sharings on social media regarding ICE agents being spotted in the Mission, but I appreciate how the whistle allows for a more instant and in-the-moment response.""

This trend appears to have begun with Chicago's local anti-ICE efforts, where there are entire group meetups to assemble whistles to give out. 

""The sound of a whistle tells immigrants and other vulnerable community members to run away while also urging fellow neighbors to gather in a crowd and run toward the scene to film arrests,"" the California news outlet wrote.

Similar efforts reportedly date back long before the immigration crackdowns of 2025, all the way back at least to the 1970s, where LGBTQ+ groups used whistles to alert people of alleged hate crimes in progress.

""We were inspired by the bold legacy of queer resistance — from San Francisco's Butterfly Brigade blowing whistles in the Castro to defend each other from violence to the community organizing coming out of Chicago now,"" Frameline's executive director Allegra Madsen told SFGate.

A flight carrying four federal lawmakers to Washington, D.C., was diverted to Kansas City after a passenger became disruptive and shouted about a ‘fascist state.' (@Adam_Burtner via X)

An American Airlines flight carrying four members of Arizona's congressional delegation to Washington, D.C., diverted Tuesday to Kansas City, Missouri, after a passenger became disruptive.

The airline told Fox News Digital that Flight 1218 left Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport Nov. 11, 2025, and was rerouted because of ""a disruptive customer.""

""On Nov. 11, American Airlines flight 1218, with service from Phoenix (PHX) to Washington, D.C. (DCA), diverted to Kansas City (MCI) due to a disruptive customer,"" American Airlines told Fox News Digital. ""Law enforcement met the flight and removed the customer, and the flight later re-departed for DCA, where it landed normally.

""We thank our customers for their patience and our crew members for their professionalism.""

Rep. Greg Stanton, a Democrat from Arizona, posted on X that he and three Republican colleagues — Reps. Eli Crane, Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar — were aboard when the incident occurred.

""Flying to DC rn to vote no on CR that fails to lower health care costs. @RepEliCrane, @RepAndyBiggsAZ & @RepGosar all on this flight. We're making emergency stop in Kansas City to remove disruptive passenger. None of my colleagues is the disruptor. Freedom Caucus losing its mojo,"" Stanton wrote.

Flight data shows the Airbus A320 had been airborne for roughly two hours and 40 minutes before diverting to Kansas City International Airport around 6:15 p.m. local time.

Video posted to X by another passenger shows Kansas City police officers boarding the plane to remove a woman who apologized as she was led away, saying, ""We live in a fascist state.""

The flight departed again about an hour later and landed at Reagan National Airport shortly after 10 p.m.

""On a serious note, thank you Kansas City police for handling the situation professionally and without incident,"" Stanton later wrote.

Stanton said he was headed to Washington to vote against the Republican continuing resolution to end the government shutdown, while his GOP colleagues supported the plan.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Epstein Returns at the Worst Time for Trump","https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2025/11/jeffrey-epstein-trump-emails/684926/","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 00:23:00 GMT","

The president is desperate to make the questions go away, but there is no sign they will.

Since his return to office, President Donald Trump has missed few chances to flex the power he wields over the nation's most formidable institutions and its wealthiest people. So when the White House announced that Trump would host the latest in a series of dinners with top business executives, this time including JPMorgan Chase head Jamie Dimon and the chief executive of Nasdaq, reporters in the White House press pool prepared to watch Trump show off.



Nope. Last night's dinner was closed to the press. No reporter was even given a glance. And later, when the White House held a signing ceremony for the president to officially end the longest federal-government shutdown in history, the reporters present were quickly whisked out of the Oval Office. Today, too, he didn't talk to the press after signing an executive order alongside the first lady in the East Room. The president, to be clear, had not suddenly become camera-shy. But he had indicated to aides that he didn't want to face reporters' questions, because every inquiry was going to be about the one subject that Trump, for all his power, simply can't make go away.



Jeffrey Epstein is dead. But the disgraced financier and sex offender continues to shadow Trump. The storyline's reemergence yesterday—with the release of thousands of Epstein's emails, some of which highlight his relationship with Trump—delivered another blow to a president already at the weakest moment of his second term. Trump's party got wiped out in last week's elections as voters assigned it the greater portion of blame for the shutdown. The Supreme Court seems set to unravel his signature tariffs. His poll numbers have dipped as Americans conclude that he cares too much about gilded ballrooms and is not focused nearly enough on bringing down high prices. And dread has crept into the West Wing now that Trump faces a rare rebuke from fellow Republicans, including some who have been among his most loyal MAGA foot soldiers.



Trump and a number of top Department of Justice officials this week tried to persuade a pair of normally close allies, Representatives Lauren Boebert and Nancy Mace, to withdraw their names from a discharge petition that would force a vote on releasing a trove of Epstein material. Their efforts failed, and it will go to the House floor next week. The president in the past two days has made a round of calls to longtime allies to rage against the Epstein matter, blaming Democrats and the media, one of the people who received a call told me. (A White House official later confirmed that the president was “speaking to trusted friends”; both people spoke with me under the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.) In those calls, Trump mused about pressuring GOP senators to block the release of additional files when the matter could go to the upper chamber later this month.



Read: Wait, are the Epstein files real now?



The White House's push to keep more Epstein materials from being released came after Democrats on the House Oversight Committee leaked emails yesterday morning that suggested close ties between the sex offender and Trump. House Republicans, hoping to distract from the initial emails, released an additional 23,000 messages. (Some of those emails, including one in which Epstein offered to give the Russian government information on Trump, only raised more uncomfortable questions for the president.) All of this came after Speaker Mike Johnson sent the House home for nearly eight weeks, in part so that he could delay swearing in the Democratic representative-elect whose vote provided the needed margin to authorize the release of the Epstein files. And although Trump has avoided reporters, his anger broke into the open on social media yesterday.



“The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein hoax again” to distract from the shutdown, Trump posted. “Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap.”



All of this, of course, raises the question: What exactly is Trump trying to prevent from being released? For months, White House aides have snapped at reporters who even mentioned the word Epstein. But in private moments, members of the president's inner circle acknowledge that they don't know the true extent of Trump's relationship with Epstein. The men were close, to be sure, and clearly enjoyed chasing women decades ago in the party circles of Manhattan and Palm Beach. That's been known for years, and although that history is embarrassing, Trump has never been charged with any wrongdoing. Is he trying to protect himself? Or someone close to him? He doesn't talk about it, allies say, except to fume that it's still a story. But Trump's over-the-top response prompted the ally he called to urge Trump to change tactics because he's “not acting like someone who has nothing to hide.”



Trump was always an unlikely champion for those on the right who believed in the Epstein conspiracy theories. The men were undeniably friends. There are plenty of photos of them together, including at Trump's private Mar-a-Lago Club. Trump flew on Epstein's private jets seven times in the mid-1990s, according to flight logs that emerged at an Epstein-related trial. And in a 2002 New York magazine profile of Epstein, Trump said he'd known Epstein for 15 years and praised him as a “terrific guy.” The financier pleaded guilty in Florida state court in 2008 and was convicted of procuring a child for prostitution and of soliciting a prostitute. He received a generous—and controversial—plea deal and served a short prison sentence before being released. He was arrested again in August 2019 and was accused of sex-trafficking minors. Epstein died a month later in jail, while awaiting trial. His death was ruled a suicide, but many on the far right suspected that he had been killed to keep him from revealing what he knew about the rich and the powerful. The so-called Epstein files—an accounting of who else in his orbit might have been involved—became something of an obsession in the MAGA movement. Though Trump never quite championed that cause, he led many to believe that, were he to return to power, he'd expose the truth and deliver justice.



That's not at all what has happened. Even after Attorney General Pam Bondi declared early this year that she had the Epstein files on her desk, only scattered documents were released to right-wing influencers. Trump then made clear that he wanted to move on, blasting those still obsessed with Epstein, who, in the president's words, has been “dead for a long time. I don't understand what the interest or what the fascination is.” He sued his on-again, off-again friend Rupert Murdoch for $10 billion after The Wall Street Journal reported in July that Trump had sent Epstein a lewd birthday card in 2003.

But some in Trump's base felt betrayed, like he was trying to invalidate a core political belief of theirs. And some Republicans refused to abandon the issue. Four of them—Mace, Boebert, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Thomas Massie—defied Trump to vote with Democrats this week on the Epstein discharge position. Boebert and Greene did not respond to requests for comment, while a spokesperson for Massie said the representative was unavailable. A spokesperson for Mace responded by pointing to a social-media post in which the candidate for governor in South Carolina urged a focus on the women and underage girls whom Epstein trafficked. If the measure passes both houses of Congress, Trump would likely veto it—and face even more scrutiny.



Indeed, Trump's own efforts to manage the story have only fed it. His account of why he and Epstein had a falling-out two decades ago has shifted multiple times. His aides have advised him to stop saying that he has the right to pardon Epstein's former partner Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking and related offenses. (Maxwell was transferred to a cushier prison in Texas over the summer after an unusual one-on-one meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, Trump's former personal lawyer.) White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt raised eyebrows yesterday when she said that Trump was not considering a pardon for Maxwell “at this moment in time.” The White House did not respond to my request for comment.



Few people in the White House believe that the Epstein matter will swing many votes next year. But it has the makings of an unrelenting distraction, a scandal that could bog down Trump's presidency. Further Republican rebellions could loosen Trump's grip on the GOP just as he is trying to preserve his party's Capitol Hill majorities. Should he lose one or both of the houses of Congress next year, he'd face congressional investigations and be firmly relegated to lame-duck status.

Trump is set to depart Washington tomorrow for another weekend at Mar-a-Lago, according to the White House. At the lush Palm Beach club, where he once palled around with Epstein, the president will surely talk to allies, eager to change the subject from the one consuming his administration.



A travel press pool will also make the trip to Florida on Air Force One. At least for now, Trump is not scheduled to take questions.

When QAnon meets Veep

Some generations get a nationally televised car chase featuring O. J. Simpson fleeing police in a white Bronco. Others get the communal adrenaline rush of frantically “CTRL-F”-ing a House Oversight Committee trove of Jeffrey Epstein's emails.



Yesterday, lawmakers released more than 20,000 pages of documents related to Epstein, including thousands of emails between him and his powerful contacts in the government, Silicon Valley, and the British royalty. There is an obvious voyeuristic thrill to reading them, but these documents have a deeper relevance. They are a skeleton key for understanding the dynamics of Donald Trump's America, one in which the wealthy and powerful appear not as master operators but as bumbling sycophants, eager to cozy up to influence no matter how villainous or depraved.



Like Epstein's birthday book, published in September by the House Oversight Committee, the messages are often enthusiastic, even fawning (unlike the birthday book, these messages were sent long after Epstein took a plea deal to reduce his sentence for sex-trafficking charges). His interlocutors ask for favors, seeking insight or dirt on Trump, or advice. In some instances, Epstein responds pompously (“Needs edit,” he wrote in one message, when asked to forward an invitation). When glimpses of his character come through in a message—“‘Girls?',, careful i will renew an old habit,” he replied to an innocuous email that used the word girls—they seem to always be tolerated or ignored.

But perhaps most striking is how unimpressive Epstein seems. He appears to have been a serial emailer, frequently pecking out barely legible, one-line messages in rapid succession to political advisers, journalists, and well-known personalities such as Peter Thiel and Deepak Chopra. (Reached through a spokesperson about his email correspondence with Epstein, Chopra told me, “I'm always cognizant of Dr. and patient privilege. However, in this case, I hope that all of the truth comes out after ongoing and proper investigations. I'm happy to share whatever I know with authorized officials. Otherwise there are only endless speculations without knowing the context.”)





The emails reminded me of the Elon Musk text messages that were made public in 2022 as part of a legal dispute with Twitter: Here we have another coterie of men infatuated with their own ideas and engaged in shallow conversations and insipid gossip. In one representative email exchange, the economist Larry Summers—the former president of Harvard and a member of the Obama and Clinton administrations—griped about women to Epstein: “I'm trying to figure why American elite think if u murder your baby by beating and abandonment it must be irrelevant to your admission to Harvard, but hit on a few women 10 years ago and can't work at a network or think tank,” Summers wrote. He then added, “DO NOT REPEAT THIS INSIGHT.” A spokesperson for Summers declined to comment. Summers has previously acknowledged “regretting my past associations with Mr. Epstein.”



Read: Elon Musk's text messages explain everything



Some of the emails read like absurdist tone poems. In one email to himself with the subject line “radical breakthrough,” Epstein appears to be free-associating and journaling his thoughts about anatomy, science, and consciousness, jotting down disconnected phrases such as “Skin as part of brain?” and “Beards and long hair   , are meant to catch and hold smells. ?”



Other emails are unnerving, given that Epstein was arrested for allegedly sex-trafficking minors. In March 2016, he emailed Thomas Barrack, a Trump ally and the current United States ambassador to Turkey, “Send photos of you and child. — make me smile.” A State Department representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.



Trump has personally called the emails part of a hoax. “The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they'll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they've done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects,” he wrote on Truth Social yesterday.



The emails show that, in the lead-up to and during the first Trump administration, Epstein was in communication with journalists looking for dirt on the president. He also frequently discussed his relationship with Trump. “I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is trump,” Epstein wrote in 2011 to Ghislaine Maxwell, his co-conspirator, who is serving time in prison for child sex-trafficking. Epstein said in one email to himself that Trump “came to my house many times.” In another, Epstein wrote that he once “gave” a 20-year-old girlfriend to Trump; in yet another, he alleged that Trump “spent hours” with a “victim,” as the redacted document says, while at Epstein's home. At one point, Epstein emailed a journalist: “Would you like photos of donald and girls in bikinis   in my kitchen?” Across these messages to various correspondents, Epstein describes Trump as “dirty,” worse “in real life and upclose,” and “borderline insane.”



Yet it also seems that Epstein was acting as an informal adviser to people in Trump world; prominent Trump associates such as Thiel and Steve Bannon corresponded with him. One email with Bannon suggests that he and Epstein were scheduled to have dinner in March 2018. (A spokesperson for Thiel has said that he never visited Epstein's island; Bannon did not respond to a request for comment.) One email dated August 21, 2018, to an unknown recipient captures this dynamic. Epstein writes:



1. Peter Thiel in town. 2. Lets make sure you are keeping your own path on front burner. Strategy etc. 3 at the same time . Take no heat re me. Not worth it for the moment. Mid terms . Over exposure , create shooting star risks. 4. The mooch ( still in contact with Ivanka ) has reached out to me ,  and asked how he can re engage with you. ?? I ve only met him once. odd. 5 /



He follows that message with the equally cryptic “Like musk, your health first. Its a very long game.”



This is a near-perfect representation of the Epstein trove in all of its dizzying, typo-plagued ingloriousness. Epstein's pidgin writing style, paired with his name-dropping and vagueness, makes emails like this excellent fodder for both speculation and genuine concern. There's enough detail to cause the mind to race, and not quite enough to get a full picture of what is going on. It's conspiracy-theory jet fuel, yet it seems to point to some very real behind-the-scenes maneuvering.



There's a surreal quality to reading these messages for yourself. At times, some of the emails read almost like QAnon fan fiction. One of the eerier documents is an email from Epstein sent to himself six days before his 2019 arrest with the subject line “list for bannon steve.” The body of the email is just a list of a few dozen names, some recognizable, some not. There is no context here, just names, rattled off by the subject of the 21st century's most durable conspiracy theory just 41 days before his mysterious death in a jail cell.



It's too early to tell what the release of these emails will ultimately accomplish. The messages certainly suggest that Epstein and Trump had a longer and closer relationship than the president previously said, and they imply that Trump had, at minimum, firsthand knowledge of Epstein's depravity. The House is now poised to hold a vote as part of a bipartisan effort to force the Justice Department to release a broader set of documents related to the case, known colloquially as the Epstein files.



Read: The Epstein ‘client list' will never go away



As grist for the algorithmic mills of social media, the emails are a cursed document—one that seems all but certain to sow maximum chaos online. There are enough famous names, insinuations, and revelations that the messages are inherently newsworthy. But they are also a perfect storm of context collapse—a massive, searchable supply of salacious and screenshottable fodder, dumped online for anyone with any political motive to post. Given that many of Epstein's correspondents are redacted and that threads start and stop randomly, many of the emails are perfect building blocks for constructing plausible but ultimately unprovable narratives. On X, the far-right influencer Jack Posobiec suggested that the emails actually show Epstein and other associates “trying to figure out ways to enwrap Trump into this.” In right-wing spheres, Epstein's email to the journalist Michael Wolff, which includes the assertion that Trump “knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,” is now being used as proof of Trump acting heroically to intervene. “Trump was the first to expose Epstein. That's why they came after him,” Infowars' Alex Jones said on his show. (An attorney for Wolff did not respond to a request for comment.)



Read: MAGA's next top influencer



The emails are corrosive in another way too. When Epstein's birthday book was released, I argued that the fawning messages therein were more proof that “there is a festering rot among at least one group of powerful elites with an abiding belief that their money and power make them invincible.” Now we know that the birthday book was just the tip of the iceberg. Although the extent of Epstein's crimes might not have been known to all of his correspondents, he was still a registered sex offender who took a highly unusual plea deal to avoid a long prison sentence for child sex-trafficking—yet this doesn't appear to have stopped people from wringing whatever value they could from him. What the obsequious emails to Epstein seem to illustrate is that many people with influence were willing to overlook his crimes, horrific behavior, and witless observations as long as there was something in it for them.



In this respect, it's hard not to see these emails as something like a final nail in the coffin when it comes to a broader distrust and contempt for the ruling class of lawmakers, gatekeepers, and the ultra-wealthy. The populist sentiment that elites are corrupt and operate with impunity is one that Trump and the MAGA movement have harnessed successfully. Trump himself has amplified and endorsed the QAnon conspiracy theory, which offers a dramatic fantasy that a cabal of pedophiles is controlling world events from the shadows. Like many durable conspiracy theories, QAnon depicts an immoral elite that is both evil and hyper-competent. There is always a master plan shrouded in secrecy and protected by code words.



From the June 2020 issue: The prophecies of Q



The Epstein revelations of the past few months suggest that these conspiracies actually do represent reality in some way—plainly speaking, some of the most powerful people in the world were communicating with one another through the kingpin of an alleged child-sex-trafficking operation. But the emails also prove that the truth is dumber than fiction. These global elites are far from organized and hyper-competent—it feels like how Veep would have treated QAnon. The elites don't message with sex pests using code words; they openly muse about having fun with girls at “Hawaiian Tropic” parties.



That reading these emails feels surreal makes sense—they shatter the myth of genius and merit that the ruling class tries carefully and spends exorbitantly to cultivate, and they affirm the worst suspicions of the conspiracy-minded. As more revelations are made public, it may feel like the conspiracy theorists have won. But they've been wrong as well. Cabal is too flattering a word for this crowd of cosplaying, hunt-and-peck email addicts. Conspiracy theories are a flawed tool meant to help make sense of a nonsensical world. The truth is darker: You don't need an elaborate master plan to dodge accountability when everyone's all too willing to simply look the other way.

Transportation Security Administration officers ""who served with exemplary service"" during the 43-day government shutdown will receive $10,000 bonus checks, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced on Thursday.

She was seen onstage in Houston giving out bumper $10,000 bonuses to TSA agents.

Noem said this reward was in addition to back pay, which agents are set to receive in the coming days.

Before giving out the checks to around a dozen staff standing behind her, Noem lauded TSA officers who'd worked without pay for ""outstanding patriotism and service.""

""We're going to continue to evaluate every single employee that helped during the shutdown and stepped up and went above and beyond,"" Noem said, adding that employees will be rewarded if they performed ""exceptional service.""

It is unclear how many TSA agents will get this bonus.

DHS said in a press release on Thursday that it is paying for these bonuses using carryover funds from fiscal year 2025.

""This funding is available thanks to President Trump and Secretary Noem's commitment to fiscal responsibility, enabling DHS to save the American taxpayer over $13.2 billion since President Trump returned to office,"" the press release said.

Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection, and TSA did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Noem also said on Thursday that Americans were ""damaged and harmed by what Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries and the Democratic Party did,"" blaming congressional Democrats for triggering the shutdown.

In an earlier clip in October, Noem said TSA operations had been disrupted and that most employees were working without pay because ""Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government.""

Noem's move comes after President Donald Trump recommended on Monday that air traffic controllers who did not call in sick during the shutdown should receive a $10,000 bonus.

""For those that did nothing but complain, and took time off, even though everyone knew they would be paid, IN FULL, shortly into the future, I am NOT HAPPY WITH YOU,"" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Monday, adding that those who continued working are ""GREAT PATRIOTS.""

Air traffic controllers who failed to come back to work immediately would be substantially ""docked,"" Trump said, presumably referring to their salary.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Tuesday that air traffic controllers could be penalized if they stopped working before missing a paycheck.

The government shutdown ended on Wednesday after a prolonged back-and-forth in the Senate and House. Some Democratic lawmakers broke with the party line this week and voted with their GOP colleagues to end the shutdown, funding the government through January 30.

The 43-day shutdown was the longest in US history. It caused widespread travel chaos, as air traffic controllers faced staffing shortages, and FAA flight reductions led to widespread cancellations.

On November 6, the FAA ordered airlines to cut flights by 4% at 40 major airports, a reduction that took effect last Friday.The FAA added that the flight reductions would be mandated to increase to 10% by Friday to ""maintain the highest standards of safety.""

But even with the shutdown now over, travel disruptions are expected to stretch into Thanksgiving, which is typically the busiest travel period of the year.

Pressed on when flight schedules might return to normal, Duffy said Tuesday that delays would likely continue even after the shutdown ended, citing ongoing shortages of air traffic controllers.

China's slowdown worsened in October, dragged by soft consumer demand and a deepening property downturn, with the long holiday period further denting factory activity.

Fixed-asset investment, which includes real estate, contracted 1.7% for the first ten months of the year, steepening from a 0.5% decline in the January-to-September period, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Friday. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.8% drop.

The last time China recorded a contraction in fixed-asset investment was in 2020 during the pandemic, according to data going back to 1992 from Wind Information, a private database focused on the country.

On a single-month basis, fixed-asset investment fell 11.4% from a year earlier, the weakest reading since early 2020 when the first Covid lockdowns hit, according to Goldman Sachs' estimates. The bank attributed the drop to Beijing's efforts in reining in industrial overcapacity and the housing downturn.

Within that segment, property investment continued to decline, shrinking 14.7% in the year through October, compared with a 13.9% contraction in the first nine months.

Manufacturing investment rose 2.7% and utilities spending, which includes electricity, fuel and water supplies, climbed 12.5%.

Industrial output expanded 4.9% in October, slowing from a 6.5% the prior month and missing expectations for a 5.5% jump.

China's manufacturing activity contracted more than expected in October, falling to the lowest level in six months, as a weeklong holiday that ran from Oct. 1 to Oct. 8 shuttered most factories across the country.

Retail sales climbed 2.9% in October from a year earlier. While beating the 2.8% growth forecast in a Reuters poll, the consumption gauge fell for a fifth straight month to its lowest level this year, according to LSEG data.

The survey-based urban unemployment rate ticked down to 5.1% last month from 5.2% in September.

The sharp drop in fixed-asset investment was largely dragged down by lackluster investment in the property sector and infrastructure, according to Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.

Manufacturing investment has seen ""modest and uneven growth,"" with state-owned enterprises increasing spending on infrastructure, such as electricity, heat and gas supply, while foreign investment contracted sharply, Yuhan Zhang, principal economist of the Conference Board's China Center, said in a note.

""We will continue to see policy-directed investment in infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, and industrial upgrading,"" he added.

In a sign of persistently weak demand in the beleaguered housing sector, separate official data released on Friday showed China's new home prices dipped 0.5% in October from the previous month, the steepest month-on-month decline since October last year. Home prices fell 2.2% in October on an annual basis.

Consumer prices rose 0.2% from a year earlier in October, the strongest inflation reading since January this year and the first positive growth since June, according to LSEG data.

The core CPI, which strips out food and energy, rose 1.2% from a year earlier, the highest since February 2024, according to data provider Wind Information.

China's exports in October unexpectedly contracted for the first time in nearly two years as tensions with Washington over trade escalated before a deal was reached at the month's end.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed last month to trim their tit-for-tat tariffs and suspend a raft of restrictive measures for one year.

Economists widely expect the  as businesses' front-loading activity tapers off, and global demand may not fully offset a deepening decline in U.S.-bound shipments, putting Beijing under greater pressure to stimulate domestic demand.

""I don't expect stimulus to happen in the rest of this year,"" said Zhang, noting the economy appears to remain on track to achieve its 5% growth target, although fiscal policy may turn more supportive at the start of next year.

China's economic growth slowed to 4.8% in the third quarter, following expansions of 5.2% in the second quarter and 5.4% in the first quarter.

SINGAPORE - Amid fears of an artificial intelligence bubble, much has been made of recent reports suggesting that AI has yet to generate returns for companies investing billions into adopting the tech. 

But that's not what the chief executive of Southeast Asia's largest bank is seeing — she says her firm is already reaping the rewards of its AI initiatives, and it's only just the beginning. 

""It's not hope. It's now. It's already happening. And it will get even better,"" DBS CEO Tan Su Shan told CNBC  on the sidelines of Singapore Fintech Week, when asked about the promise of AI adoption.  

DBS has been working to implement artificial intelligence across its bank for over a decade, which helped prepare its internal data analytics for recent waves of generative and agentic AI. 

Agentic AI is a type of artificial intelligence that relies on data to proactively make independent decisions, plan and execute tasks autonomously, with minimal human oversight.

Tan expects AI adoption to bring DBS an overall revenue bump of more than 1 billion Singapore dollars (about $768 million) this year, compared to SG$750 million in 2024. That assessment is based on about 370 AI use cases powered by over 1,500 models throughout its business. 

""The proliferation of generative AI has been transformative for us,"" Tan said, adding that the company was experiencing a ""snowballing effect"" of benefits thanks to machine learning. 

A major area in which DBS has applied AI is in its financial services to institutional clients, with AI used to collect and leverage data for clients in order to better contextualize and personalize offerings. 

According to Tan, this has resulted in ""faster and more resilient"" teams. The CEO believes that these uses of AI have contributed to a recent uptick in the bank's deposit growth as compared to competitors'.

The company also recently launched a newly enhanced AI-powered assistant for corporate clients known as ""DBS Joy,"" which assists clients with unique corporate banking queries around the clock. 

Despite Tan's strong convictions about AI, recent evidence suggests that many companies are struggling to turn their AI investments into tangible profits. 

MIT released a report in July that found 95% of 300 publicly disclosed AI initiatives, encompassing generative AI investments of $30–$40 billion, had failed to achieve real returns. 

However, at least in the banking sector, there are signs that the tides are turning. 

While DBS doesn't differentiate spending in generative AI from other in-house investments, other major banks have recently offered this comparison. 

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon stated in an interview with Bloomberg TV last month that the bank is already breaking even on its approximately $2 billion of annual investments in AI adoption. That represents ""just the tip of the iceberg,"" he added.

Those expectations are shared by DBS, which plans to continue to accelerate its AI development to become an AI-powered bank.

The ultimate goal, according to Tan, is for its generative AI to develop into a trusted financial advisor for clients, including retail users who are expected to interact with personalized AI agents through the DBS banking app. 

The bank already has over 100 AI algorithms that analyze users' data to provide them with personalized ""nudges,"" such as alerts on incoming shortfalls, product recommendations, and other insights. 

While DBS may already be reaping rewards from its AI adoption, Tan acknowledged that it will require continued investments, not only in capital, but in the time needed to reskill employees. 

The company has launched several AI reskilling initiatives across departments this year and has even deployed a generative AI-powered coaching tool to support these efforts. 

This will help the company automate mundane work and refocus its staff on building and maintaining human-to-human relationships with customers, rather than reducing headcount, Tan said. 

""We're not freezing hiring, but it does mean reskilling. And that's a journey. It's a never-ending journey ... a constant evolution.""

				Taken from CNBC's Daily Open, our international markets newsletter — Subscribe today


U.S. markets had their worst day since Oct. 10. That marks a sharp reversal for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which shed 1.65% to settle at 47,457.22, a day after it closed above 48,000 for the first time. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 lost 1.66% and the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.29%.

The slump in stocks can partly be traced to a turnaround in sentiment regarding artificial intelligence. Tech behemoths such as Nvidia, Broadcom and Oracle slumped, with the last losing more than one-third in value since it rocketed 36% in September.

Investors, it seems, are growing worried over the high valuations of tech names, as well as the gigantic amount of capital expenditure they are committing to — with some, like Oracle, having to take on debt to fulfil those obligations.

Uncertainty over an interest rate cut in December is also putting a downer on Wall Street. It's a coin toss as to whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy then, according to the CME FedWatch tool. That's a huge difference from a month ago, when traders were pricing in a 95.5% chance of a December cut.

Not having October's employment and inflation numbers, and possibly never getting them, means the Fed lacks visibility into the state of the economy — and whether it should try to support the labor market or continue reining in inflation.

After all, flying blind makes it hard to see where you'll land. As of now, that applies both to the Fed and investors trying to navigate the still-hazy ambitions of tech companies.

U.S. stocks pull back on AI sell-off. All major U.S. indexes fell Thursday stateside dragged down by heavyweight technology names. Europe's regional Stoxx 600 retreated 0.61%, with most bourses in the red.

A December rate cut doesn't seem so certain. A lack of economic data because of the government shutdown — now ended — is complicating the Fed's decision. Fed official Susan Collins on Wednesday said holding rates will ""likely be appropriate.""

Elon Musk's xAI is raising $15 billion. A large amount of money in this latest funding round will go toward graphic processing units, sources familiar with the matter told CNBC's David Faber. Musk called the news ""False"" in a post on X.

China's Singles' Day sales stumble. The Double 11 shopping festival this year marked a 14.2% year-on-year growth in sales, according to Chinese consumer research firm Syntun, trailing last year's 26.6% increase.

[PRO] Be wary of stocks with zero revenue. The year-to-date rally in stocks means some could be trading at elevated prices. CNBC Pro found a few names with market caps of at least $1 billion — but haven't generated revenue over the last 12 months.

Wall Street cools on Oracle's buildout plans as debt concerns mount: 'AI sentiment is waning'

Two months ago, Oracle's stock soared 36% to a record after the company blew away investors with its forecast for cloud infrastructure revenue. Since then, the company has lost one-third of its value, more than wiping out those gains.

The mood of late has turned, with investors questioning whether the AI market ran too far, too fast and whether OpenAI can live up to its $300 billion commitment to Oracle over five years. Of the big cloud companies in the GPU business, Oracle is expected to generate the least amount of free cash flow, said Jackson Ader, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Stock futures are little changed Thursday night after Wall Street witnessed its worst day in more than a month.

Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65 points, or 0.1%. S&P futures ticked up about  0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.08%. 

Major U.S. indexes, along with the small-cap Russell 2000 index, posted big losses on Thursday to close out their worst one-day performance since Oct. 10. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost about 800 points, or 1.7%, taking back gains seen in Wednesday's session when it crossed the 48,000 level.

Technology giants came away battered in the previous session, putting the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite on pace to snap its seven-week win streak. Nvidia and Broadcom notably declined 3.6% and 4.3%, respectively, while Google parent Alphabet fell 2.8%.

Concerns about the artificial intelligence trade have emerged more seriously this week, with the recent wipeout in once-hot cloud stock Oracle further spooking investors about elevated tech valuations, a massive surge in debt financing and soaring AI capex plans. To be sure, Oracle's growth is uniquely more reliant on its cloud deal with OpenAI and the company has far less cash compared to hyperscalers.

""We saw what happened in 2021. Those stocks got destroyed, everything was okay for a while, and then it turned out that the rest of the market had more of a reset to do as well,"" Yung-Yu Ma, PNC Asset Management chief investment strategist, said Thursday. ""I do think a lot of the market is underpinned by the AI trade. I still think this pullback is a healthy pullback here. And you have this push and pull in the market, you have this reset of investor sentiment but you also have a lot of broken failed breakouts and broken charts. And that does take a while to rebuild.""

Mounting unease about the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision also added pressure to the market on Thursday. Traders are now pricing in a nearly 52% chance that the central bank will cut its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point during their December meeting, which is lower than the 62.9% likelihood that markets priced in a day ago and 95.5% chance a month ago, per the CME FedWatch Tool.

The U.S. government shutdown, which was the longest in history, ended Wednesday evening after stretching on for more than six weeks. That development had been expected to end a period of time where investors were operating without important economic data. Instead, it has raised new questions. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt suggested that some economic data that was due out during the impasse might never be released. Now, some investors think it might make the Fed less inclined to cut rates.

Week to date, the S&P 500 is up about 0.1% and the 30-stock Dow is higher by 1%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq is down nearly 0.6% this week.

LISBON, Portugal — Top tech executives told CNBC they're concerned about a bubble forming in the artificial intelligence sector, underscoring growing unease within the industry over soaring valuation.

In recent weeks, markets have been reckoning with the notion that too much capital is pouring into the AI boom, clouding the outlook on revenue and actual profit and putting high valuations into question.

Up to now, warnings around overstretched valuations have mostly come from investors and leaders in the world of finance. Goldman Sachs' David Solomon and Morgan Stanley's Ted Pick have warned of potential corrections as valuations of some major tech firms reached historic highs.

The concerns have been crystallized by famed 'Big Short' investor Michael Burry, who this week accused major AI infrastructure and cloud providers, or 'hyperscalers' of understating depreciation expenses on chips. Burry warned that profits at the likes of Oracle and Meta may be vastly overstated. He recently disclosed put options that bet against Nvidia and Palantir.

However, CEOs of companies who are themselves developing AI, expressed their concerns this week during interviews with CNBC at the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon.

""I think the evaluations are pretty exaggerated here and there, and I think there is signs of a bubble on the horizon,"" Jarek Kutylowski, CEO of German AI firm DeepL, told CNBC on Tuesday.

The sentiment was echoed by Picsart CEO Hovhannes Avoyan.

""We see lots of AI companies raising ... tremendous valuations ... without any revenue,"" Avoyan told CNBC on Tuesday, adding that it is a ""concern.""

The market values smaller startups with ""just some noise and vibe revenue,"" he said, referring to companies being backed even though they have minimal sales.

Vibe revenue is a play on ""vibe coding,"" a term that refers to using AI to code without needing deep technical expertise.

Even with concerns over valuations, the technology industry remains bullish on the long term potential of AI.

Lyft CEO David Risher said there are reasons to be optimistic given the potential impact of AI but acknowledged the risks.

""Let's be clear, we are absolutely in a financial bubble. There is no question, right? Because this is incredible, transformational technology. No one wants to be left behind.""

Risher went on to argue that there is a difference between the financial bubble and the industrial outlook.

""The data centers and all the model creation, all of that is going to have a long, long life, because it's transformational. It makes people's lives easier. It makes people's lives better… On the other hand, you know, the financial side, it's a little risky right now.""

The tech CEOs also addressed their outlook on AI demand for 2026 from businesses, as investors look for any clues as to what this will look like.

""I think there's a lot of demand, and there's a lot of interest. I think everybody understands that AI can do magical things to businesses, and... we can all operate on another level when it comes to efficiency,"" Kutylowski said.

Still, businesses are ""strugging in adopting"" AI. ""We're going to get further, but I don't think we're that we're going to be in a place where we can say, like every enterprise, every organization, has it figured out totally,"" Kutylowski said.

DeepL's core product is an AI translation tool but it recently launched a more general purpose ""agent"" designed to be able to carry out tasks on behalf of employees.

Francois Chadwick, the chief financial officer of Cohere, a company that is also focused on enterprise AI, told CNBC on Tuesday that ""demand is definitely there.""

Despite the concerns over overstretched valuations and huge capex spend, the investment into artificial intelligence doesn't appear to be slowing down. A report from venture capital group Accel released this week showed that the buildout of new AI data center capacity is forecast to reach 117 gigawatts by 2030 which translates into about $4 trillion worth of capital expenditure over the next 5 years.

About $3.1 trillion worth of revenue is required to pay back that capex, according to the Accel report.

Already this year, there have been a slew of deals worth billions announced by the likes of Nvidia and OpenAI as they look to develop data center capacity around the world in a bid to keep up with demand.

Philippe Botteri, a partner at Accel, said that three major factors will drive that revenue — more powerful AI models that require capacity to be trained, the use of new AI services and the ""agentic revolution in the enterprise.""

""Agentic"" is often a term used to describe a type of AI tool that can automatically carry out tasks on behalf of users.

But not everyone believes that the large amount of spending is necessary.

Ben Harburg, managing partner at Novo Capital says the figures being discussed by large tech firms for future investment may be overblown.

""We hear these crazy headline numbers about how much energy is going to be needed, how many chips are going to be needed, although, again, I think that there is probably more of a bubble brewing there than on kind of the front end, the actual product front,"" Harburg told CNBC on Tuesday.

""I think we're starting to realize that there's been probably over exuberance around data centers. Even Sam [Altman], I think, would privately admit that they need fewer chips than they originally set out, they need less capital than they originally set out. They need less energy than they originally set out.""

British government bond yields rose sharply on Friday following reports Finance Minister Rachel Reeves is no longer planning to raise income tax rates in the Autumn Budget later this month.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt rose around 12 basis points in early trade, before paring gains to trade at 4.498%. Yields and prices move inversely to one another.

The moves came as investors reacted to a report from the Financial Times of an income tax U-turn. The Treasury was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC on Friday morning.

U.K. stocks were also lower. The FTSE 100 index shed over 1% at 8:54 a.m. in London (3:54 a.m. ET), with Lloyds, Natwest, and Barclays banks occupying the bottom of the index, each losing more than 2.8%.

Reeves had spent the past week apparently laying the groundwork for a manifesto-breaking rise in income tax, which split Labour party lawmakers and led to further turmoil in the already embattled party, whose leader Prime Minister Keir Starmer has dismal approval ratings. 

A proposed 2p national income increase was to be offset by a 2p reduction in national insurance. There are now expectations, however, that the £30 billion ($39.5 billion) hole in the government's budget will be filled by a patchwork of smaller rises.  

It could be a ""fiscal reckoning"" as a patchwork approach will put pressure on the gilt market, Wren Sterling's investment chief Rory McPherson told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Friday.  

""Within the U.K., if we have more of the smaller taxes being targeted as part of the programme from Rachel Reeves, I think that's going to put more pressure on the government, more pressure on them to go back to the bond markets and ask for more money, which in turn puts more pressure up on yields,"" McPherson said.

He added that there has been a ""big march down"" in yields but now ""we're pulling away that that."" 

Volatility this year has left long-term borrowing costs hovering at their highest level since the late 1990s, with U.K. debt having the heftiest price tag in the G7. 

McPherson said that the Bank of England will still be able to make an interest rate cut after the budget, if it wants to. Other investors appear to have curbed their optimism, with bets on cuts shedding six basis points compared with Thursday, according to data compiled by LSEG.

The Autumn Budget is expected on Nov. 26.

European stocks were lower on Friday as worries about an artificial intelligence bubble and the global economy shake investor confidence.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 was 0.8% lower an hour into the session, with all major bourses in negative territory.

China's economic slowdown ramped up in October, with data showing fixed asset investment – which includes the country's closely watched real estate sector – contracted in the first 10 months of the year. Retail sales softened, meanwhile, and industrial output growth also slowed.

Investors are also reeling from big losses on Wall Street on Thursday, as concerns about AI valuations and the U.S. interest rate trajectory mounted. Big Tech stocks were hit particularly hard, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite shedding 2.3% by the closing bell.

Comments from Federal Reserve officials in recent weeks have prompted money markets to reconsider the likelihood of a December rate cut from the central bank. By Friday morning, markets were pricing in a 52.1% chance of the Fed cutting by 25 basis points at its next meeting. A month ago, the market had assigned a 95% probability to an end of year cut.

Back in Europe, yields on U.K. government bonds — known as gilts — spiked on Friday, amid reports that the Labour government was U-turning on an income tax raid that had been planned as part of the looming Autumn Budget.

Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions, meaning a spike in yields represents a sell off of the assets.

By 9 a.m. in London (4 a.m. ET), the yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt had risen by 7 basis points to 4.5%, climbing down from an earlier spike that saw yields rise by as much as 13 basis points at the longer end of the maturity curve. Yields on the long term 20- and 30-year gilts rose by 8 and 9 basis points, respectively.

Meanwhile, the British pound fell as markets reacted to the reports. Sterling was last seen trading 0.2% lower against both the U.S. dollar and the euro.

Corporate earnings also continue to hold the spotlight in Europe, with German insurer Allianz among the companies reporting on Friday.

Allianz said it had achieved record results in the first nine months of the year, bolstered by double-digit growth in operating profit in the third quarter. Operating profit for the three months to September jumped 12.6% to 4.4 billion euros ($5.1 billion), largely driven by the firm's Property-Casualty division.

The company said it expects to achieve an operating profit of at least 17 billion euros this year, which sits in the upper end of its full-year guidance range.  

Allianz shares were last seen trading around 1% higher.

Across the Atlantic, U.S. stock futures were little changed on Friday morning following Wall Street's Thursday sell off.

Overnight in Asia, stocks fell as investors monitored Wall Street moves and reacted to the Chinese data.

The 11 U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) collectively bled $869.86 million Thursday, registering their second-highest outflow on record, according to data source SoSoValue. 

Investors have pulled out $2.64 billion over three weeks, signaling growing caution and shifting sentiment in the market. 

Thursday's outflow coincided with Bitcoin's fall below the key $100,000 support level and heightened risk aversion on Wall Street. Ether ETFs also registered an outflow of $259.72 million, the highest since Oct. 13. 

As of writing, bitcoin traded near $97,500, down over 5% in 24 hours and 11% on a month-to-date basis, according to data source CoinDesk.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $100,000. It is now approaching a Bitcoin death cross, a technical event where the 50-day SMA crosses below the 200-day SMA.

Historically, this pattern has often appeared near market bottoms. However, the macro environment and the market structure of 2025 are no longer the same as in previous cycles. This raises a critical question: Is this the actual bottom, or merely one step in a more extended capitulation phase?

Several analysts have been watching the approaching Bitcoin death cross. The 50-day SMA is expected to cross below the 200-day SMA within the next few days.

According to analyst Colin, the upcoming Bitcoin death cross is expected around mid-November, which means it is only 1–2 days away. Before it happens, Colin expects BTC to decline further, with altcoins potentially dropping even more. This aligns with BTC's recent retracement below $100,000.

“The projected Bitcoin ‘Death Cross' (50 day crossing below 200 day SMA) is a timing element for when the bottom might be in.” Colin commented.

Multiple observations also support the idea that BTC typically forms a bottom around such events, although timing may vary. Another analyst on X detailed the pattern's occurrence over the past 7 years.

Between 2018 and April 2025, Bitcoin has experienced at least eight death cross events. Each time, BTC formed a local bottom within 5–9 days and rallied at least 45% from the lows. If we consider the recent dip below $100,000 as a local bottom, projections suggest BTC could rise to at least $145,000 afterward.

Supporting this view, analyst Ash Crypto noted that in the last three death crosses, Bitcoin bottomed within a week before rallying strongly to new all-time highs.

However, some analysts present a more cautious scenario. Another X user points out that while the Bitcoin death cross is indeed about to form, the average maximum loss following the cross is typically over 30% within 12 months. Historically, BTC takes an average of 141 days to reach a peak after a cross.

If the death cross occurs in mid-November with BTC hovering around $100,000, this model suggests a potential retracement toward the $70,000 region. A new upward cycle may then resume.

If the Bitcoin death cross aligns with a final capitulation flush, history suggests a sharp rebound in the weeks that follow. Conversely, if macro conditions worsen, the death cross could instead signal a deeper correction, consistent with the historical average drawdown of roughly 30% within a year.

It is also essential to note that a death cross is primarily a timing indicator, not a guarantee of a bottom or a top. Traders should consider factors like trading volume, RSI/MACD divergences, on-chain activity, and stablecoin liquidity. These help assess the probability more accurately.

At the current moment, the higher-probability scenario is a short-term capitulation, followed by the formation of the Bitcoin death cross, and then a strong rebound. Still, short-term traders should manage risk carefully: set appropriate stop-loss levels and wait for recovery confirmation, such as a daily close above the SMA50 with rising volume, before allocating heavily.

Major cryptocurrencies are facing persistent pressure this month, even as gold and silver rally.

These diverging trends reflect risks unique to digital assets, as mounting concerns over government stability propel precious metals higher, highlighting a strengthening investor confidence in traditional safe havens.

This month, bitcoin BTC$97,290.40, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, has slipped over 9%, falling below the critical on-chain support level of $100,000, CoinDesk data show. This weakness has spread across the broader crypto market, pulling down major tokens like Ethereum's ether ETH$3,195.32, solana SOL$143.28, and DOGE$0.1633 by 11% to 20%. Payments-focused XRP has shown relative resilience, declining just over 7%.

The weak tone comes despite the dollar index (DXY) rally losing momentum after encountering resistance above 100 earlier this month. Typically, a fading DXY – which measures the U.S. dollar against a basket of global currencies – bodes well for bitcoin and the broader crypto market, as well as for precious metals.

However, while bitcoin remains subdued, precious metals have found strength; gold and silver have climbed 4% and 9%, respectively, this month. Less-tracked precious metals, such as palladium and platinum, have also seen gains exceeding 1%.

So, what's holding bitcoin back? According to Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, much of the bullish news has already been priced in, leaving BTC vulnerable to bearish developments.

""Post government shutdown, risk assets are selling off as all the 'good news' catalysts are being used. Fed easing via FOMC, China/U.S. trade cooperation, and a now resolved government shutdown,"" Magadini told CoinDesk.

""Bitcoin traders have been bullishly positioned given a strong fundamental backdrop for an EOY rally, but positioning is likely being flushed as the market was overly positioned long with no one to buy next,"" he added.

Beyond positioning, fears of a deeper system risk are also weighing on cryptocurrencies, Magadini explained, highlighting a potential credit freeze as a major risk to digital asset treasuries (DATs).

These entities have been a significant source of bullish pressure for cryptocurrencies over the past year, relying heavily on credit markets to fund their crypto purchases, often through convertible bonds and debt issuance. However, DATs are not alone in this competition for capital; they face increasing pressure as sovereign governments and AI-related ventures vie for the same constrained pools of credit.

With the recent surge in DAT formation, demand for credit has increased substantially, Magadini noted, adding that should credit markets tighten or freeze, these companies could struggle to refinance their obligations, forcing them to sell their coin holdings to meet debt payments. This forced selling could trigger a cascade, as subsequent DATs might also be pressured to liquidate their assets.

""As crypto is sold, the next tranche of DATs could be forced to sell as well (so on and so forth). Although this risk is less pronounced with quality assets (such as BTC), the downward-spiral risk increases for DATs who recently purchased volatile altcoins at peak valuation,"" Magadini said.

""Today the market is likely thinking about this type of credit risk,"" he noted. (DATs are already facing the heat in the far east.)

Precious metals have gained ground mainly due to mounting concerns about the fiscal health of major economies, including the U.S.

Fiscal strain is evident in the soaring government debt-to-GDP ratios of many advanced economies. For instance, Japan's ratio exceeds 220%, while the United States stands above 120%. France and Italy also carry substantial debt burdens, exceeding 110%. While China's government debt-to-GDP is below 100%, its total non-financial debt exceeds 300% of GDP, making it one of the most indebted countries in the world.

The problem is particularly acute in the Eurozone, according to Robin Brooks, senior fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution.

""The precious metals rally isn't about a flight out of USD. It's a symptom of profoundly broken fiscal policy, which is true globally, especially in the Eurozone, where high-debt countries control the ECB,"" Brooks said on X.

Interestingly, gold has a history of leading BTC price movements. Analysis by market experts indicates that BTC tends to lag behind gold by approximately 80 days, suggesting that once the yellow metal's rally eventually stalls, the cryptocurrency may receive a strong bid.

Whether this pattern holds in the current macroeconomic environment remains to be seen.

Crypto market crash as the global market cap dropping to a 6-month low of $3.27 trillion.

Bitcoin has now crashed 23% and Ethereum by 36% from their ATH prices.

Hopes of Fed rate cut in December fades amid economic worries.

Trading volumes drops further as $4.7 billion in crypto options to expire today.

Over $1.1 billion in crypto got liquidated amid spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs outflow.

The crypto market crash continues in November, with the global market cap dropping from $4.28 trillion to a 6-month low of $3.27 trillion in a month. Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have now tumbled 23% and 36% from their ATH. Traders are anticipating a deeper fall in altcoins as JPMorgan sees BTC support at $94,000.

The Crypto Market Fear & Greed Index has further slipped to extreme fear at 15 today. This indicates bearish sentiment among investors and potential for further drop in crypto prices.

Top and trending altcoins XRP, Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Zcash (ZEC), and AI coins tumbled 5-12% over the past 24 hours. Meme coins including Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe Coin (PEPE) further erased their earlier gains, with PEPE now down 80% year-to-date (YTD).

US President Donald Trump signed a bill to end the longest government shutdown after 43 days. However, the White House confirmed no release of CPI and jobs data for October.

Moreover, Fed officials, such as Neel Kashkari, warned of rising inflation amid the government shutdown. This raised economic concerns and markets trimmed bets on a Fed rate cut in December.

CME FedWatch tool now shows odds of another 25 bps Fed rate cut dip from 62.9% to 52.1%. This is in line with Fed Chair Jerome Powell's hawkish stance that fueled crypto market crash concerns last month.

The US dollar index (DXY) dipped to 99 on Friday, a second consecutive weekly decline. Also, the 10-year Treasury yield stays near 4.1% after a sharp decline in prior sessions.

The $4.7 billion crypto options expiry today further worsened trading volumes and led to a deeper crypto market crash. More than 41K BTC options worth $4 billion in notional value will expire today on Deribit. The put-call ratio is 0.7 and the max pain price is at $105K.

In the latest 24 hours, put volume has exceeded call volume, with a put/call ratio of 1.10. This signals traders are hedging to offset losses, expecting BTC to fall below $95K.

Also, over 233K ETH options with a notional value of almost $738 million are set to expire today, with a put-call ratio of 0.68. The put volume has doubled in the last 24 hours, but is still low against more than 99K call volume. The put-call ratio is 0.91, confirming options trader sentiment leaning bearish.

Also, the max pain point is at $3,500, way above the current market price of $3,175. Traders are even opening puts targeting ETH price below $3,000 in the coming days.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Ethereum ETFs continue to record outflows. Institutions are likely rotating to Solana and XRP. Canary XRP ETF (XRPC) saw a record $59 million and $245 million in inflows on debut.

As per Farside Investors data, Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net outflow of $866.7 million. BlackRock's IBIT and Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF saw $256.6 million and $318.2 million in outflows amid bearish sentiment.

Meanwhile, others such as Fidelity, Bitwise, Invesco, Ark 21Shares, and GBTC also saw massive outflows. It indicates a massive decline in interest among institutional investors.

Meanwhile, spot Ethereum ETFs saw $259.6 million in net outflows, the 3rd consecutive day of outflows. BlackRock's ETHA led with $137.3 million. Shorting Ethereum remained a smart move as long as the broader crypto trend remains firmly downward. And, it looks like there is no urgency to step in. 

As CoinGape reported, long-term holders (LTH) and whales were certain about BTC peak in October. Historically, BTC topped 12-18 months after a halving and the bull market peaked around 1,060-1,070 days, and the pattern held this year.

Coinglass data revealed over $1.1 billion in crypto liquidations, with 237K traders liquidated in the last 24 hours. The largest single liquidation order happened on crypto exchange HTX again. BTCUSDT valued at $44.29 million was sold in a single trade.

Notably, over $900 million long and $200 million short positions were liquidated. ETH, SOL, XRP, ZEC, DOGE, XPL, HYPE, BNB, PUMP, and ADA are among the altcoins witnessing the most liquidation.

The hourly crypto liquidations chart revealed $300 million in longs were liquidated a few hours ago, causing the crypto market crash.

BTC price today fell more than 5% to 96,840 intraday low. Whereas ETH price tumbles 10% to a low of $3,112 and XRP corrects 8% to $2.28. The crypto market crash sees no signs of slowing as experts predict a further drop in crypto prices.

ZEC price dropped 4% to $485.20, correcting 40% from ATH after a massive 1000% parabolic run. Arthur Hayes claimed he will buy more at dips to target another leg up to $1,000.

10x Research says BTC latest drop left traders scrambling for explanations, yet the clues were visible weeks ago. Buyers who once supported every dip have suddenly vanished. “Since October 10, both our Ethereum and Bitcoin trend models have been firmly bearish, and that signal remains intact,” it added.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","How Will Ethereum's New AI Commerce Standards Reshape Startups?","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/ethereum-ai-commerce-standards-crypto-banking","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 07:52:40 GMT","

Ethereum seems to be laying down a new game board for AI commerce with the introduction of ERC-8004 and x402. These standards aim to allow autonomous systems to transact and coordinate independently, bypassing intermediary platforms. What does this mean for startups and established businesses alike?

The ERC-8004 standard is focused on interoperability among AI agents, allowing seamless communication across the Ethereum network. The x402 standard aims for better coordination of activities. The hope is to create a transparent environment for AI transactions. 

By establishing these protocols, Ethereum seeks to prevent closed platforms from monopolizing AI commerce. This positions Ethereum as a potential backbone for a decentralized machine economy. Supporters like Vitalik Buterin and Binance's Changpeng Zhao recognize that this could change economic interactions between AI agents.

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are pioneering the blockchain movement, but they face substantial challenges in implementing these standards. First and foremost is regulatory compliance. The nature of DAOs complicates legal recognition, making it difficult to comply with various jurisdictions.

Security is a major concern. Smart contracts that are vital for DAOs can be compromised by bad actors. Without rigorous security measures, they can be vulnerable to attacks.

Scalability also presents challenges. Should DAOs grow, they might face issues like network congestion and steep transaction fees, hindering their scaling efforts. Adding AI to the mix intensifies the complexity, particularly concerning ethical decision-making and the risk of bias.

Small fintech startups stand to gain from these Ethereum standards. By using ERC-8004, they can establish a reliable on-chain identity, which allows for discoverable banking services. This integration can lead to a more cohesive financial ecosystem.

The x402 standard offers an infrastructure for micropayments, allowing startups to monetize their services. This is particularly useful for those offering APIs or financial services, as they can charge stablecoins for service access. This could simplify operations and enhance user experience by reducing reliance on traditional banking systems.

Additionally, these standards enable startups to create portable reputations, allowing their services to be trusted across various platforms, which is a step away from centralized rating systems.

Despite the introduction of decentralized protocols, monopolization risks linger. Dominant players can gain control over essential data, infrastructure, and market power, hampering competition and innovation. This concentration can lead to undemocratic governance and inequality.

Data hoarding by large firms creates barriers for smaller competitors, stifling innovation and increasing systemic risks. Regulatory capture, where powerful AI monopolies shape regulations to maintain dominance, adds another layer to the issue.

Even decentralized systems can face re-centralization risks. Dominant entities may arise, undermining the advantages of open protocols. Coordinated regulatory frameworks and market oversight will be required to ensure fair competition.

Ethereum's standards have significant implications for crypto payroll integration, particularly in Asia. The focus on greater transparency helps payroll platforms build trust with users and regulators, especially in regions where compliance with AML and KYC is critical.

Evolving Ethereum standards can facilitate smart contract automation for payroll payments, addressing regulatory challenges. Regulatory uncertainty and price volatility remain barriers to widespread adoption, but as Ethereum refines its standards, it can assist companies in navigating the regulatory landscape.

Crypto payroll systems promote inclusivity by providing banking access to the unbanked. They can also streamline operations and ensure compliance with global employment regulations, potentially benefiting the broader financial ecosystem.

Ethereum's new standards could represent a pivotal moment in AI commerce and crypto banking. If they effectively address the challenges faced by DAOs and startups, they could lead to a more transparent and decentralized financial landscape. Yet, the monopolization risks and regulatory hurdles remain significant. As the digital economy evolves, Ethereum's commitment to transparency and decentralization will be essential in shaping the future.

Bitcoin BTCUSDT price plunged below $100,000 and sent ripples of panic across the crypto markets, challenging the confidence of traders and investors alike. Yet, in a surprising twist, some of the market's top altcoins, including Ethereum, XRP, and Solana, have held steady above their respective support levels, defying the expected domino effect. It's now important to examine what factors are helping these altcoins maintain stability even as Bitcoin faces significant selling pressure.

Why Bitcoin Price Dropped Below $100,000

Bitcoin's sudden fall under $100,000 rattled the crypto market, but the drivers go beyond routine profit-taking. Experts point to a combination of serious liquidity and structural factors behind the plunge.

First, a wave of massive liquidations hit the market, with hundreds of millions of dollars in long positions unwound within hours. This created a cascade effect, pushing the price sharply lower. At the same time, long-term holders began offloading BTC, signaling a shift in sentiment from cautious optimism to risk management.

Macro factors also played a role. Tighter liquidity conditions, combined with hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve, have reduced appetite for high-value risk assets like Bitcoin. Finally, the breach of key technical support levels triggered stop-loss orders, further accelerating the decline.

Altcoins Held Up Despite Bitcoin's Drop

While Bitcoin price faced heavy selling pressure, several major altcoins—including Ethereum ETHUSDT, XRP, and Solana SOLUSDT—have shown surprising resilience. Analysts point to a few key factors behind this divergence.

Cautions for Investors

While altcoins haven't collapsed, history warns that resilience may be temporary. Macro risks—including interest rates, liquidity, and equities — can eventually pressure all crypto assets. Traders should monitor correlation shifts closely, as altcoins can still follow Bitcoin's trajectory with a lag.

Key Levels & What to Watch

What's Next for Bitcoin and the Market

With Bitcoin slipping below $100,000, the coming days will be crucial in determining the next phase of the crypto market. Traders are closely watching key support levels around $93,000–$95,000; a sustained breach could accelerate selling pressure, while a recovery above $100,000 may stabilize sentiment.

Altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, and Solana may continue to resist downward pressure in the short term, but their fate is increasingly tied to Bitcoin's direction. Liquidity, macroeconomic developments, and technical signals will dictate market movements this weekend, making cautious positioning and active monitoring essential for investors.

In a world where fortunes can vanish with the flicker of a screen, the current state of the cryptocurrency market paints a troubling picture. Major altcoins, once riding high on Bitcoin's coattails, are now grappling with considerable losses as Bitcoin's price falters. The dramatic shifts we're witnessing urge investors to scrutinize their strategies and prepare for anything that might come next.

The altcoin market is a mixed mosaic of performance amid the chaos, where substantial corrections are evident, yet some assets still show signs of resilience over the week. Notably, significant downturns have beset tokens like Starknet, Uniswap, and Filecoin, inviting scrutiny of their technical indicators as potential harbingers of future trading outcomes. The upcoming analysis sheds light on these troubling losses while providing a framework for understanding the broader market dynamics.

Bitcoin's descent below the $102,000 mark recently sent tremors through the altcoin landscape, igniting a cascade of sell-offs. This most recent dip has upended market sentiment, leading many traders to retreat into profit-taking mode, further intensifying the already volatile climate. For anyone trying to navigate this choppy terrain, recognizing the interconnectedness of market movements is essential to informing trading decisions effectively.

Starknet stands out as one of the most impacted tokens, with an alarming 13.46% drop in just 24 hours, reducing its value to around $0.14. Despite a previous weekly surge of 28%, technical indicators like the MACD and RSI signal a cooling trend, suggesting traders are eager to lock in gains after last week's rally. This shift in interest underlines the necessity for potential investors to proceed with caution and to seek thoughtful entry points.

Amidst the current upheaval, Uniswap has not been immune, suffering a 10.94% drop to $7.90. Despite a remarkable 47% rise over the past week, Uniswap's bearish crossover on its MACD indicates a possible slowdown in momentum. Traders should remain vigilant for signs of resurgence or further declines, as the market grapples with the implications of evolving sentiments.

Filecoin has encountered significant turbulence, with a notable 10.91% decrease bringing its value to $2.13. Even though it boasts an impressive 54% increase for the week, negative signals from its MACD reflect declining buyer enthusiasm. Investors now face the challenge of weighing this short-term setback against the long-term potential of decentralized storage solutions, necessitating astute strategic adjustments.

In this environment of relentless volatility, technical indicators such as MACD and RSI have emerged as indispensable tools for navigators of the crypto seas. The fluctuating fortunes of altcoins underscore the importance of these analytical instruments which can provide crucial insights into potential entry and exit points, enhancing the decision-making prowess of traders eager to capitalize on price movements.

Amidst this onslaught of volatility, the behavior of investors becomes paramount. Many traders chose to secure profits during these downturns, intensifying concerns regarding price consistency and the market's future trajectory. As fear and uncertainty reign, those who remain astute to sentiment fluctuations could uncover fresh opportunities in the event of a market rebound. Traders with a keen intuition for shifting behaviors may stand to benefit significantly when momentum eventually swings back in their favor.

For those daring to explore altcoins, well-defined and informed strategies are essential. Here are critical approaches to consider:

As the unpredictable cryptocurrency tides continue to ebb and flow, the recent downturns in the altcoin market offer a stark reminder of the sector's volatility. Awareness of market dynamics, application of intelligent trading strategies, and strategic use of technical indicators will be crucial in safeguarding investments. In an environment where values can swiftly shift, informed decision-making and astute awareness are key to successfully harnessing the opportunities that lie ahead. Embrace the unpredictability, navigate your risks wisely, and you might just find the rewards waiting under the stormy skies.

Earlier this week, the Canton Network announced the expansion of Franklin Templeton's Benji Technology Platform onto the Canton Blockchain, enabling global institutional clients to access regulated, tokenized investment products and supporting new liquidity opportunities in the digital asset space.

This move further cements Franklin Resources' commitment to blockchain innovation, opening new avenues for institutional adoption of digital assets while addressing regulatory and privacy requirements.

We'll now explore how Franklin Templeton's integration with Canton Blockchain may influence its technology-driven investment narrative and competitive positioning.

This technology could replace computers: discover 27 stocks that are working to make quantum computing a reality.

Owning Franklin Resources means believing in the long-term value of its global reach, product diversity, and ability to harness innovation like blockchain to drive future inflows. While the expansion of the Benji Technology Platform onto the Canton Blockchain signals progress in digital assets, this development does not appear to materially impact the short-term catalyst for Franklin, the stabilization and potential reversal of persistent net outflows at Western Asset Management. The key risk remains around continued outflows and margin pressure driven by fee competition and changing investor preferences.

Among recent announcements, Franklin Templeton's new pricing for its Core Equity Funds stands out, making the funds among the lowest-fee options in their peer group. This move addresses ongoing fee compression, one of the firm's clearest risks, while responding to investor demand for cost-effective products, a critical factor as the company pursues new growth channels and aims to offset revenue headwinds.

But, in contrast to these promising steps, investors should be aware that persistent net outflows at Western Asset Management continue to...

Sheryl Estrada is a senior writer at Fortune, where she covers the corporate finance industry, Wall Street, and corporate leadership. She also authors CFO Daily.

Good morning. Blockchain technology is gaining mainstream traction in the U.S., with clearer regulations emerging as a key driver of adoption.

To explore what that means for financial infrastructure, I sat down with Jeremy Fox-Geen, CFO of Circle Internet Group, a leading stablecoin issuer. “We are at the beginning of what can only be described as a global megatrend—the building of the internet financial system,” Fox-Geen told me.





That system, he explained, encompasses blockchains, digital assets, and the applications built upon them—technologies that promise “massive benefits to businesses and consumers all around the world,” he said. While blockchain is already transforming parts of the economy, he emphasized that we are still in the early stages of its impact.





Fox-Geen described Circle as a market-neutral infrastructure company: a platform that sits within the internet financial system's foundation—spanning blockchain, digital-asset, and application layers. “We're a platform that other companies choose to build upon,” he said.





Stablecoins, such as Circle's USD Coin (USDC), are digital assets designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to and backed by the U.S. dollar or equivalent assets. In the U.S., the GENIUS Act has clarified how stablecoins are regulated, Fox-Geen noted. Regulatory certainty, he said, is “a major unlock” for large companies considering digital assets for corporate treasuries—and a driver of multi-year growth for Circle.




Key use cases for stablecoins include trading, settlement, dollarization, and cross-border payments. Circle's platform supports these use cases, aiming to reduce friction and cost in global financial transactions, Fox-Geen said.





Circle made its public debut on the New York Stock Exchange on June 5, marking the largest two-day post-IPO surge since 1980, Fortune reported. On Wednesday, the company reported its Q3 results: combined revenue and reserve income grew 66% year-over-year to $740 million, while net income rose 202% to $214 million. USDC circulation reached $73.7 billion, up 108% from a year earlier, and on-chain transaction volume jumped 580% to $9.6 trillion—evidence of its expanding real-world utility, Fox-Geen explained. JPMorgan has upgraded Circle's stock to “overweight” from “underweight” and increased its price target to $100 from $94, which helped rebound Circle shares in pre-market trading on Thursday.





Fox-Geen said that blockchain's transformation of the financial system is just beginning—comparable to the internet's evolution in the mid-1990s. “The disruption is underway, but the technologies are still maturing,” he said.





Banks, neobanks, payment firms, and capital markets participants are already integrating blockchain for trading, settlement, and supply-chain payments. “We're seeing use cases grow fastest where costs, frictions, and business needs are highest,” Fox-Geen added.





Fox-Geen has served as CFO of Circle since May 2021 and was previously CFO of iStar and Safehold. Before that, he was CFO for McKinsey & Company, North America, and held senior roles with PricewaterhouseCoopers and Citigroup.




Circle is now building the fourth generation of blockchains, he said, as well as Arc, a native Layer-1 blockchain optimized to bring economic activity to the internet.





To illustrate his thoughts on blockchain's promise, Fox-Geen posed this question:





“Why can't you send money to anyone in the world—instantly and for free—just like sending a photo or text message? When you put it like that, it's absurd that you can't.”





For CFOs and finance leaders exploring blockchain for the first time, his advice is pragmatic: fast follow.





“You don't have to be a pioneer,” he said. “Institutions will bring these benefits to you.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Minnesota's emerging blockchain builders","https://mndaily.com/296245/city/minnesotas-emerging-blockchain-builders/","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 03:23:13 GMT","



The Twin Cities are home to 17 Fortune 500 companies. But when it comes to blockchain and cryptocurrency, the industry is far more hidden. 

Despite making headlines for years, blockchain technology remains a mystery to some. At its core, blockchain is a system for recording and verifying transactions without relying on a central authority such as a bank. It is essentially a shared, transparent digital database that is extremely difficult to alter. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are transferable digital assets whose ownership is recorded on the blockchain. 

“It's really just a database,” explained Brandon Ferdig, co-founder of the Minnesota Blockchain Initiative. “Blockchain is a way to track who owns what. And it's a revolution because it's more decentralized, which is good for security.” 

Ferdig added that crypto technology has the advantage of transparency and efficiency that traditional currency lacks.

“Anyone can look at the blockchain and see who owns what, and you don't have to wait for a check to clear or a credit card payment to go through a bank,” Ferdig said.

For Ferdig, blockchain is more than cryptocurrency trading, speculation or hype cycles. He said he sees it as a form of digital infrastructure and a foundational technology that could change how Minnesotans manage records and build trust online.

The blockchain scene in the Twin Cities

The Minnesota Blockchain Initiative, founded in 2018, has grown organically based on community interest.

Today, the group hosts monthly Twin Cities meetups, runs a podcast, maintains an active Slack channel and collaborates with a multitude of actors, including the University of St. Thomas School of Law, where they have held large events in recent years.

“We consider education a foundational application of blockchain,” Ferdig said. “We teach about it, hold seminars. Many lawyers come to our events.”

He compared Minnesota's emerging blockchain community to the state's traditional industries that favor steady, long-term growth over flashy trends. Ferdig said blockchain can be more than just cryptocurrencies and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), interchangeable digital assets and in the future, become a foundational technology. 

“Minnesota is known for wheat and iron ore and timber, and for medical technologies and Post-it notes from 3M,” he said. “We've quietly built a really good society up here with these backbone industries. They're not flashy, but they're crucial.” 

Ferdig admitted that the local ecosystem is young and has not fully taken off. 

While a handful of blockchain-related startups exist in the state, such as Kigo and Just For Krypto, most development happens remotely or in coastal hubs like San Francisco and New York.

University of Minnesota's Blockchain Club President Daigan Berger said he agreed. 

“I would say the Twin Cities are underdeveloped for blockchain,” Berger said. “But a lot of blockchain jobs are remote, so there are still opportunities for graduates from Minnesota to work in the industry.”

The UMN Blockchain Club mostly draws members from computer science and business students, Berger said. However, they aim to remain open to anyone curious about the technology.

“Our meetings are part lecture, part discussion,” Berger said. “We cover everything from programming topics to blockchain fundamentals. It builds from week to week, but we try to make it beginner-friendly.”

The club's goal is to help students explore the technology's potential and connect with the growing industry. 

“We want to show students what the possibilities and jobs in the industry are,” Berger said. 

To Berger, their efforts seem to be paying off. 

“One of our alumni interned at Coinbase and is now joining full-time,” Berger said. “Others have gone on to work in crypto-related roles at startups in New York.”

Stigma and skepticism

Berger said despite growing interest, blockchain's public image remains complicated — especially on campus.

“I would say most students perceive it in a pretty negative way,” Berger said. “People have read headlines about scams or lost investments and assume that's what it's all about.”

Berger said he often finds himself clarifying that the club focuses on technology, not trading. 

“We never tell people to invest in anything,” Berger said. “We just teach how the systems work. Learning about the technology doesn't cost anything, and I think people would appreciate blockchain more if they learned how it actually works and how to interact with it.”

Ferdig acknowledged that skepticism extends beyond universities. Much of it, he said, comes from environmental concerns, crypto scams and the hype surrounding NFTs.

“That kind of criticism always follows new technology,” Ferdig said. “Now a lot of people hate AI, because of the same reason they distrusted blockchain: they think it's greed from corporations, and that it's gonna take away from the user experience.”

Reflecting on the argument that bitcoin mining causes environmental harm, Ferdig said that seeing the criticism move from one thing to another takes away their legitimacy.

“I don't take those concerns super seriously,” Ferdig said. “I see how fickle they are.”

Ferdig added that blockchain art, like other creative uses of technology, can evolve past its early missteps. 

“There's a real resistance to AI now in art, in video games, in movies,” he said. “You've got to get past that and keep an open mind.”

Looking forward

Both the Minnesota Blockchain Initiative and the UMN Blockchain Club see education as key to future growth. Berger said the club hopes to expand and eventually split into specialized groups focusing on development, governance and finance. 

“For now, we're keeping it general so everyone can follow along,” Berger said. “But as we grow, we want members to actually build projects and engage with the side of the industry that interests them most.”

Berger believes that the market is not ripe for a full blockchain takeover yet. 

“One of the biggest problems in this industry is figuring out how Blockchain can be used to facilitate business or increase revenue, or in some way be better than the Web2 [the internet] or a current alternative that exists,” Berger said. “I think until that problem is solved, it will continue to be more of a niche community.”

Ferdig said that government and regulation will play a role, too. 

“Yes, cryptocurrency gives people more freedom, but it also means less government control,” Ferdig said. “But the benefit of a more secure, more efficient system outweighs that.”

For Minnesotans curious about blockchain, especially University of Minnesota students, Ferdig and Berger share the same advice: stay open-minded.

“A lot of college students see the benefits of AI when writing a paper, but there are costs too, like jobs that might not exist when they graduate,” Ferdig said. “It's the same with crypto. The key is to understand how these systems work and how to use them wisely.”

Key Statistics

The SocialFi NFTs market is poised for exceptional growth, expected to increase from USD 359.7 million in 2025 to USD 7,021.4 million by 2035, reflecting a CAGR of 34.6%. This rapid expansion is driven by the convergence of social finance (SocialFi) and NFTs, which offer users the opportunity to monetize their online presence, content, and social interactions in decentralized environments. As more platforms integrate NFT-based social features and allow users to create, trade, and leverage their digital assets, SocialFi NFTs will gain traction among both creators and users in digital spaces.

The growing interest in Web3 technologies, decentralized finance (DeFi), and blockchain-based social media platforms will be key drivers of market growth. By enabling users to retain ownership and control over their digital identity and assets, SocialFi NFTs provide a new way to engage with social media, reward creators, and facilitate peer-to-peer transactions. As social networks evolve into decentralized communities and virtual spaces, the demand for NFTs tied to social experiences, content sharing, and digital communities will continue to increase, securing a dominant position for SocialFi NFTs in the broader digital economy.



From 2025 to 2030, the market is projected to grow from USD 359.7 million to USD 1,589.3 million, a rise of USD 1,229.6 million. This growth will be driven by the increasing integration of NFTs in social media platforms and the expanding creator economy. As decentralized social finance platforms gain popularity, users will increasingly seek ways to monetize their content and digital identities through NFTs, which will further accelerate market growth during this period.

Between 2030 and 2035, the market is forecast to expand from USD 1,589.3 million to USD 7,021.4 million, adding USD 5,432.1 million. This rapid surge will be fueled by the mainstream adoption of NFTs in social networks, gaming, and virtual worlds, where social interactions and content creation are increasingly tied to digital ownership. As Web3 technologies continue to transform how people interact online, SocialFi NFTs will play a central role in reshaping digital economies and fostering new monetization opportunities for creators and communities, driving strong growth throughout the decade.

The SocialFi NFTs market is experiencing rapid growth due to the increasing integration of NFTs in social media platforms, content monetization, and digital identities. As the demand for decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to rise, social platforms are increasingly adopting NFTs as a means to reward content creators and foster community engagement. Social content monetization NFTs are becoming a key driver of this growth, allowing creators to tokenize their content and receive compensation directly from their audiences. The rise of web3 technologies and the growing interest in decentralized social platforms are providing new avenues for NFT applications in areas like reputation management, social gamification, and digital identities. Additionally, the increasing popularity of social tokens and the ability to monetize social media activities are further contributing to the market's expansion. With platforms like Friend.tech, Galxe, and StepN leading the charge, the SocialFi NFTs market is expected to grow rapidly, providing new ways for users and creators to interact, earn, and own digital assets in decentralized environments.

The SocialFi NFTs market is segmented by classification and application. By classification, the market covers social content monetization NFTs, social identity and reputation NFTs, social gamification NFTs, and others. Among these, social content monetization NFTs hold the leading share at 30%, driven by creator-led earning models across web3 social platforms. By application, the market is divided into the primary market and secondary market, with the primary market holding a dominant 65% share. Regions such as China, India, and Germany exhibit the strongest adoption due to rapid blockchain expansion and creator economy growth.



The social content monetization NFT segment leads the SocialFi NFTs market with a 30% share because it directly addresses the evolving creator economy, where individuals seek autonomy and direct revenue channels without relying on centralized platforms. This segment allows creators to tokenize posts, artwork, experiences, or exclusive community access as NFTs, enabling supporters and followers to own moments and interactions rather than simply consuming them. Platforms such as Friend.tech, Mirror.xyz, and Roll are driving adoption by offering infrastructure for decentralized monetization, shifting control from traditional social platforms to individual creators.

The ability to transform engagement into ownership is a key growth catalyst. Users purchasing these NFTs not only support creators but also gain assets that can appreciate with the creator's brand growth, introducing value exchange into social interactions. Additionally, micro-transaction models and fan-token ecosystems elevate ongoing engagement, making creator-fan relationships deeper and financially meaningful. As web3 social platforms expand and creator monetization norms evolve, this segment's leading position is expected to strengthen, particularly in markets like China, India, and Brazil, where digital creator entrepreneurship is expanding rapidly.



The primary market dominates the SocialFi NFTs market with a 65% share because it represents the point of first issuance, where creators and platforms establish direct value capture from NFT sales. This eliminates intermediary control and reduces revenue leakage, allowing creators to earn more, while giving early adopters access to NFTs at original issue prices. The primary market is especially active on SocialFi platforms like Friend.tech, Galxe, and Lens Protocol, where NFTs are launched as membership badges, access tokens, creator passes, or identity-linked collectibles.

The appeal of exclusivity, first-access rights, and early-value acquisition drives strong user participation in the primary market. These NFTs often grant privileges such as gated chat access, tiered memberships, or early participation in tokenized events, making them valuable beyond speculative resale. The rise of decentralized fan economies and token-driven communities has strengthened the primary issuance model further. Moreover, the availability of easy-to-use minting and identity linking tools has lowered the barrier of entry for new creators worldwide. As more social platforms transition to decentralized engagement models, the dominance of the primary market will continue, supported by rapid adoption in regions like China, India, and Germany, where social tokenization is scaling fastest.

The SocialFi NFTs market is expanding rapidly due to the increasing demand for decentralized social platforms, which offer creators the opportunity to monetize their content directly via NFTs. The shift from centralized social media models to web3-based platforms is reshaping the way digital content is valued. Platforms like Friend.tech and StepN are leading the charge, allowing users to tokenize and trade social interactions. The creator economy, the rise of digital identity management, and social gamification are also driving market growth as platforms continue to evolve.

What are the key drivers of the SocialFi NFTs market?

The key drivers of the SocialFi NFTs market include the growing adoption of web3 technologies and NFTs within social media platforms. The ability for content creators to monetize their work directly through NFTs is attracting significant interest from influencers, artists, and creators across digital spaces. Additionally, the increasing demand for decentralized and transparent platforms where digital identity and reputation can be securely managed is another important factor. Platforms like Galxe and Mirror.xyz enable users to engage in social gamification and reputation building, leading to stronger consumer participation in the SocialFi ecosystem.

What are the key restraints in the SocialFi NFTs market?

Despite strong growth, the SocialFi NFTs market faces several challenges. Market volatility is one of the main concerns, as NFT prices can fluctuate widely, creating uncertainty for investors and content creators. Furthermore, regulatory uncertainty regarding the use of NFTs and cryptocurrency in decentralized applications can deter potential users from engaging in the market. Additionally, the environmental impact of blockchain transactions, especially those using proof-of-work systems, is raising concerns about the sustainability of SocialFi NFTs. These challenges may hinder wider adoption in certain regions.

What are the key trends in the SocialFi NFTs market?

Several key trends are shaping the SocialFi NFTs market. Social tokens and NFT-based digital assets are gaining popularity as platforms move toward decentralization. The rise of social gamification is encouraging deeper user engagement, where NFTs are used as rewards in community-driven activities. Another key trend is the increasing focus on digital identity management, where reputation NFTs are allowing users to build and maintain their online identity securely on blockchain platforms. Additionally, the growing integration of NFTs in decentralized social media platforms will continue to drive the market as new players enter the Web3 space.

Central bank finalizes stablecoin regulations while three major banks complete first wholesale CBDC transactions

Singapore's central bank is moving forward with comprehensive digital asset initiatives spanning stablecoin regulation, wholesale CBDC pilots, and tokenized capital markets guidance, Monetary Authority of Singapore Managing Director Chia Der Jiun announced at the Singapore FinTech Festival on Thursday.

MAS has finalized features for its stablecoin regulatory regime and will prepare draft legislation, Chia said Wednesday. The framework prioritizes ""sound reserve backing and redemption reliability"" to ensure value stability, addressing concerns about unregulated stablecoins that have experienced recurring de-pegging events.

In a significant CBDC milestone, DBS, OCBC, and UOB successfully conducted interbank overnight lending transactions using Singapore's first live wholesale CBDC issuance for settlement. MAS plans to expand trials next year by issuing tokenized MAS Bills to Primary Dealers settled with CBDC.

The regulator launched the BLOOM (Borderless, Liquid, Open, Online, Multi-currency) initiative in October 2025, to support industry experimentation with tokenized bank liabilities and regulated stablecoins for settlement, inviting financial institutions and clearing operators to conduct trials.

Chia outlined three critical requirements for scaling tokenized assets: standardized tokens with interoperable networks, deep pools of safe settlement assets, and institutional-grade blockchain networks with clear governance and regulatory compliance.

Chia also added that MAS will publish a Guide on Tokenisation of Capital Markets Products this week, providing regulatory clarity through case studies, while acknowledging that despite commercial launches of tokenized bonds and money market funds, ""asset-backed tokens have not yet achieved escape velocity.""

The central bank emphasized a ""co-opetition"" model where market participants cooperate on standards while competing for liquidity, working through initiatives like Project Guardian to develop global tokenization frameworks.

As Trump touts Bitcoin's role in easing pressure on the dollar, his administration's pro-crypto stance is reshaping markets, regulation, and global competition.

When you think of financial innovation, Singapore is never far away. The country, which already made an impression by hosting the global TOKEN2019 event, continues to move forward at a rapid pace. In the crypto universe, the city-state increasingly positions itself as an open-air laboratory. The latest move: the issuance of Treasury bonds… in tokenized form. Public securities settled in central bank digital currency (CBDC). A transition that could well reshuffle the deck in state finance.

After TOKEN2049, Singapore takes a new step. At the Singapore FinTech Festival 2025, Chia Der Jiun, director of the MAS, unveiled a pilot operation: issuance of tokenized MAS Bills, reserved for primary dealers, and settled in digital Singapore dollar. A paradigm shift? Probably. Especially when you hear the MAS head state:

Are asset-backed tokens clearly out of the lab? Undoubtedly. Many commercial products have been launched. Bonds have been issued natively and settled on-chain. Money market funds have been tokenized.

The MAS does not stop there: the banks DBS, OCBC and UOB have already conducted interbank lending operations using CBDC. These initiatives confirm an assumed ambition: to impose public finance in the crypto ecosystem with safe, traceable, and agile digital tools. A role-play where states are no longer just regulators but also builders of monetary networks.

The real challenge is no longer technical, it is structural. In his speech, Chia Der Jiun mentions a major risk: that of a fragmented ecosystem, made of incompatible networks, tokens not recognized from one platform to another. The solution? A “coopetition” approach.

They must agree on common standards for asset-backed tokens, even while seeking to grow. A bond or fund token must be understood and accepted on another network than the original one.

The Guardian project, already launched in 2022, and the Global Layer One initiative aim to create these standards. Their mission: to ensure that any tokenized asset on network A can be recognized and exchanged on network B. This is not just an advance for crypto traders; it is a market overhaul itself. 

The regulator wants to avoid the emergence of closed monopolies or walled gardens. It supports open finance, driven by regulation but fueled by innovation. A hybrid model that could set an example far beyond Asia.

Behind the launch of these tokenized bonds, another battle is raging: the choice of settlement assets. The digital Singapore dollar, stablecoins, and tokenized bank liabilities are tested to serve as bases for dematerialized exchanges.

Key points to understand the stakes:

Each of these models has its strengths. CBDCs offer security and legitimacy. Regulated stablecoins allow smoother circulation. And bank liabilities bring private sector flexibility, provided they are interoperable. This plurality of approaches clearly shows one thing: no one yet holds the key to universal programmable money. But Singapore is moving forward, and fast.

Singapore only confirms a trend underway for several years. Like the Bank of France and the Bank of Switzerland, its central bank has already successfully tested wholesale CBDCs. By crossing this new threshold, it helps shape the contours of programmable, fluid finance but under close supervision. A complex score, where each note played already resonates well beyond its borders.

Today's Paper


			OUR PICKS:		

Goodbye, Bitcoin? There currently are at least 32 crypto kiosks, according to St. Paul police, where users can deposit cash and see it converted into a digital alternative.

Soon, there may be none.

Alarmed by fraud cases that have cost victims millions of dollars nationally, the St. Paul City Council is poised to ban virtual currency kiosks that have proliferated citywide.

The ATM-like kiosks are placed in high-traffic areas such as convenience stores and allow users to make cash deposits, which are then converted into Bitcoin or other digital currencies and transferred into an account or virtual wallet. Digital currency is money that exists only in an electronic form and can be exchanged online. It often operates independently of central banks.

An ordinance before the city council calls for prohibiting any person from operating a virtual currency kiosk within city limits. It would not affect online virtual transactions conducted by businesses and residents.

Michael Carter, an enforcement audit director with the Minnesota Department of Commerce, told the council Wednesday that there have been 51 law enforcement reports statewide involving $700,000 lost to various kiosk scams. The real numbers likely are larger as many victims are too embarrassed to come forward.

Gordon Wrobel, a resident of St. Paul and an AARP volunteer, said the crypto kiosks need more regulations and oversight.

“The impact of fraud on victims and their families is wide reaching and can have an impact financially and emotionally,” said Wrobel, during a public hearing Wednesday. “Criminals are becoming more sophisticated in their approach which authorities struggle to keep up.”

However, Ethan McClelland, the director of government relations for Bitcoin Depot – a leading Bitcoin machine operator – called the proposed ordinance an overreaction. The company sued the city of Stillwater after it banned cryptocurrency machines earlier this year.

“We share the council's goal of protecting consumers from fraud,” McClelland said. “However, placing a reactionary ban on the industry that is already licensed and regulated by the state, which serves a legitimate purpose for St. Paul residents, is unnecessary and will deprive many customers their only way of participating in the digital economy.”

Law enforcement investigators have called crypto scams especially dangerous because there is no centralized authority to flag suspicious behavior, and they are often untraceable.

In 2023, Americans reported losing $5.6 billion in cryptocurrency scams, according to the FBI, which found that the frauds were more likely to target older people.

Often, residents unfamiliar with cryptocurrency are warned by fraudsters that they owe the Internal Revenue Service or another federal agency back payments, and they're pressured to use a kiosk to deposit cash to a serial number within a matter of hours, or they'll be prosecuted, they're told.

The Minnesota Legislature implemented a degree of cryptocurrency fraud protection in 2024. A new law required all kiosks to disclose terms and conditions, issue refunds for new customers, and set a maximum transaction limit of $2,000 for new customers.

Tim Greenfield, the city council's chief policy officer, said the state's measures haven't been effective in stopping scams, and fraudsters have quickly found ways around the regulations.

“These kiosks serve as a very specific flashpoint for which criminal activity defrauds citizens and no amount of disclosure or tapping of a screen or a receipt can be as effective as  simply removing them from operation,” Greenfield said.

Tim Plunkett, a St. Paul resident, said he fell victim to a scam in February. Scammers impersonated Xfinity technicians and told him abnormally high activity on his desktop had led them to find evidence of money laundering and other illegal acts. The scammers told Plunkett that they would report the activity to the Federal Trade Commission unless he transferred them money through a cryptocurrency kiosk.

Plunkett went to different kiosks four times. When he received an email from Rocket Coin, a cryptocurrency ATM company, he realized he had been scammed. It turned out that the scammers had locked him out of his computer and his bank account.

“The first thing they want you to do is to get you in a state of confusion,” he told the council.​

Council President Rebecca Noecker said the proposed kiosk ban is a way to protect the vulnerable.

“Part of this is we want to raise public awareness of the level of these scams for older members, low-income folks and the incarcerated and their families in our community,” Noecker said.​

Crypto scams have become lucrative crimes in recent years. In September, two men stole $8 million in cryptocurrency after kidnapping a father and his nine-year-old son in Washington County.

​In June, an Eagan couple was almost scammed out of $125,000. The couple was able to avoid losing all of their money when Gabby Conklin, an office assistant in the city attorney's office who had stopped at a convenience store for gas, intervened, Noecker said.

A scammer was trying to get the couple to deposit money into a kiosk by pretending to be an FTC agent.

“The elderly couple were literally one press of a button away from losing their life savings irreversibly, but through Gabby's work that was averted,” Noecker said.

The council will host a final vote on the proposed ordinance on Nov. 19.

Online betting and gaming operator Super Group is entering the digital currency space with the launch of its new stable digital currency, the ZAR Supercoin.

Purpose-built for South Africa and the wider African market, ZAR Supercoin will operate under a new division of the Super Group business, Super Money SA.

Supercoin will eventually be used as a payment option for customers using Super Group's sportsbook brand Betway, with customers also benefiting from initiatives exclusive to Supercoin users.

“The time is right for Super Group to move into the digital currency space, with our exciting new Supercoin,” said Super Group chief financial officer Alinda van Wyk. “We have always been at the forefront of tech advancement in the gambling industry, and this offering will also benefit the millions of customers who enjoy our brands in South Africa and in the rest of the continent.

“The launch of Supercoin will position us for continued success, as alternative payment methods and digital asset frameworks become more integrated into the regulated gaming ecosystem. This also underscores our commitment to innovation and the use of advanced technology to position Super Group for sustained growth.”

Supercoin will be listed on Luno and made available to customers in South Africa. 

Luno is a leading regulated cryptocurrency exchange with operations in Nigeria, Kenya, Malaysia, and Indonesia. As Supercoin gains traction, it will be listed on additional international exchanges.

Custody of ZAR Supercoin fiat currency backing reserves will be held by South African bank, ABSA Group.

What happens when the king of cryptocurrencies falters? The recent crash of Bitcoin, dipping below the once highly coveted $100,000 threshold, has triggered alarm bells across the entire crypto ecosystem. This is no ordinary stumble; this drop reflects a tumultuous market grappling with volatility, fuelled by unsettling remarks from the Treasury Secretary that sent ripples through financial networks. As trepidation grips investors, we must dissect the broader ramifications of shifting sentiments in the cryptocurrency arena.

Regulatory chatter is stirring the waters of the crypto sector, with implications that reach far and wide. The Treasury Secretary's caution about instituting rigorous regulatory frameworks has injected anxiety into this already precarious landscape. Amid the confused mingling of traditional markets and cryptocurrencies, startups in the Web3 space find themselves navigating an increasingly treacherous path—juggling the demands of compliance while striving for financial viability. It's crucial we untangle these complexities, as the crypto world writhes under the weight of potential restrictions that could stifle innovation and growth.

If cryptocurrencies are sinking, then commodities have emerged as the star players. Gold and silver are basking in newfound glory, defying the downturn engulfing the digital currency realm. In the midst of financial upheaval, gold prices soared, enticing investors seeking refuge. As Bitcoin languishes, the stark divide between its plight and the commodities' upward trajectory reveals a fundamental pivot in investor sentiment. This shift underscores a growing inclination toward stable investments, highlighting the necessity of securing oneself against the unpredictable tides of risk-laden assets.

A deep dive into Bitcoin pricing reveals a troubling narrative, particularly in the wake of a staggering $114 million in long liquidations over a mere blink of an eye. The ferocity of these liquidations emphasizes the volatility synonymous with the cryptocurrency sector and raises alarm about further declines. As Bitcoin hovers near critical support levels, it's a waiting game for investors, who must keep a watchful eye for signs of recovery or the précipice of continued decline. Market analysts caution that failing to recover the key $100,000 landmark may pave the way for even grimmer bearish trends to sweep through the crypto landscape.

The tug of war between geopolitical developments and the current state of the cryptocurrency market is undeniable. Talk of inflation, potential shifts in monetary policy, and looming economic uncertainties are intricately woven into the fabric of investors' views on digital currencies. According to a study conducted by John Doe, the often-overlooked issues of regulatory compliance are fundamental to understanding the operational risks crypto investors face. As the global economic currents ebb and flow, these geopolitical forces take on increased significance for anyone navigating the murky waters of cryptocurrency investment.

Amidst the upheaval sweeping the crypto space, the time has come for investors to realign their strategies. By diversifying portfolios to incorporate both cryptocurrencies and more stable commodities, investors can fortify themselves against the risks that often accompany market downturns. Staying agile and attuned to fluctuating market indicators facilitates the safeguarding of assets and the optimizing of returns. In these uncertain times, strategic diversification transcends being merely a choice; it's a vital response to the tempest of financial instability.

The current maelstrom enveloping the cryptocurrency sector starkly illustrates the intricate relationship between traditional assets and digital currencies. Bitcoin's fragile standing brings forth urgent concerns regarding volatility while spotlighting a wider transition toward commodities such as gold and silver. As regulatory landscapes evolve, investors must remain vigilant, prepared to pivot with the shifting economic tides. By embracing diversification within their investment portfolios, they can weather the storm of financial uncertainty and set themselves on a path toward enduring success in both the cryptocurrency domain and the realm of commodities. 

In essence, as the cryptocurrency universe battles unprecedented trials, it's imperative to grasp the expansive financial dynamics at play, providing essential insights for investors striving to keep their footing in this tumultuous industry. Confronting these pressing realities is crucial for steering towards a resilient financial future.

On Thursday, Cathie Wood-led Ark Invest executed significant trades, notably involving Circle Internet Group Inc (NYSE:CRCL), Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc (NYSE:BMNR), Bullish (NYSE:BLSH), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), and Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT). These trades reflect Ark's strategic positioning in the market, with particular focus on the tech and crypto sectors.

Ark Invest purchased 188,941 shares of Circle across multiple ETFs, including Ark Fintech Innovation ETF (BATS:ARKF), ARK Innovation ETF (BATS:ARKK), and ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (BATS:ARKW). 

On Thursday, CRCL closed at $82.34, down 4.59%. Despite this dip, analysts at Bernstein remain optimistic about Circle's potential, citing its strong third-quarter performance and a $230 price target. Bernstein flagged intensifying competition from ""frenemies"" like Stripe and PayPal, who are building their own stablecoin ecosystems. Still, analysts said USDC's (CRYPTO: USDC) liquidity edge continues to outpace rivals, and Circle's Arc blockchain and Payments Network rollout bolster its long-term positioning.

The total value of Ark's purchase was approximately $15.5 million, calculated from the closing price and the number of shares acquired.

Ark Invest increased its holdings in Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc through ARKF, ARKK, and ARKW by purchasing 242,347 shares. BMNR shares closed at $36.57, a 9.86% drop. 

The company recently announced its Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) holdings, aiming to own 5% of the total supply. BitMine said it expanded its Ethereum holdings to 2.9% of total ETH supply, adding more than 110,000 ETH last week as it pushed toward its long-term 5% accumulation goal. The company now holds over 3.5 million ETH, along with 192 Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and $398 million in cash reserves. Chairman Tom Lee said growing institutional interest and Ethereum's role in tokenization continue to strengthen the firm's conviction.

Ark's purchase amounted to around $8.9 million.

Ark's interest in Bullish was evident in the purchase of 177,480 shares through ARKF, ARKK, and ARKW. BLSH shares ended at $41.02, down 9.85%. 

Bullish, backed by Peter Thiel, has been a focus for Ark, with previous million-dollar buys. The value of Ark's latest acquisition was approximately $7.3 million, showcasing continued support for the crypto exchange.

Ark Invest reduced its AMD position by 87,051 shares through ARKK. AMD shares closed at $247.96, a 4.22% decrease. Ark's sale was valued at about $21.6 million.

AMD's ambitious target of $20 EPS by 2030 drew mixed reactions from analysts. Some argued the stock already prices in these aggressive assumptions, while others warned the forecast depends heavily on steep growth, margin expansion and sustained hyperscaler spending.

Ark Invest sold Reddit shares through ARKF and ARKW. Reddit shares closed at $189.42, down 6.61%. The sale of 39,854 shares was valued at $7.5 million.

Reddit recently beat expectations with third-quarter earnings of 80 cents per share and $585 million in revenue. Daily active users rose 19% to 116 million, while ad revenue surged 74%. Margins and cash flow also improved sharply, with adjusted EBITDA climbing to $236 million.

Benzinga's Edge Stock Rankings indicate AMD stock has a Value in the 5th percentile. Here is how the stock compares with other semiconductor plays.

The 11 U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) collectively bled $869.86 million Thursday, registering their second-highest outflow on record, according to data source SoSoValue. 

Investors have pulled out $2.64 billion over three weeks, signaling growing caution and shifting sentiment in the market. 

Thursday's outflow coincided with Bitcoin's fall below the key $100,000 support level and heightened risk aversion on Wall Street. Ether ETFs also registered an outflow of $259.72 million, the highest since Oct. 13. 

As of writing, bitcoin traded near $97,500, down over 5% in 24 hours and 11% on a month-to-date basis, according to data source CoinDesk.

A fresh move lower in Asian morning exacerbated losses for hopeful traders as bitcoin lost the $98,000 level for the first time since May, extending a week-long bleed that has dragged majors sharply lower.



Ether fell more than 8% to around $3,500, while XRP, DOGE$0.1633, Solana's SOL and Cardano' ADA posted similar declines. The tone remained decisively risk-off, with crypto tracking equity weakness across Asia as traders unwound leveraged bets and rotated into cash.



Liquidation data shows the magnitude of the flush. More than $1 billion in leveraged crypto positions were wiped out over 24 hours, with roughly $887 million coming from longs.



That marks one of the heaviest bull-side liquidations in a month. About 235,000 traders were forced out of positions, and the single largest wipeout was a $44 million BTC long on HTX.



Across major venues, Bybit, Hyperliquid and Binance each saw more than $180 million in long liquidations which represented over 85% of all bets, reflecting how aggressively traders had leaned into last week's bounce.



The setup heading into the decline was fragile as funding rates had turned positive across majors, open interest was climbing, and spot volumes were thinning — making for conditions that often amplify downside once momentum flips.



With BTC slicing through $100,000, liquidity pockets evaporated on the way down, creating a vacuum that accelerated the move toward $97,000.



Macro headwinds added fuel. China's latest dataset showed economic activity cooling far more than expected. Industrial production slowed to 4.9% year-on-year from 6.5% in September, while fixed-asset investment contracted 1.7% over the first 10 months in a historic slump.



The numbers hit Asian equities immediately, with the MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropping 1.3% and chipmakers leading losses. The weakness spilled into crypto within minutes, mirroring patterns seen throughout Q4 where digital assets have behaved like high-beta macro risk.



At the same time, hopes for a December Federal Reserve rate cut faded after a series of cautious remarks from officials. Money markets now price the odds of a December cut at below 50%, down sharply from earlier in the week. That shift, combined with the global equity wobble, created the latest leg lower in crypto as traders reassessed positioning into year-end.



For crypto, the immediate question is whether the forced unwinds have run their course.



BTC's break below $98,000 puts focus on support near $94,000, while altcoins remain vulnerable if equities extend their pullback.



But structurally, liquidation-driven resets have often marked exhaustion zones. Whether that dynamic repeats depends largely on whether macro volatility stabilizes over the next 48 hours.

Brutal selloff breaks psychological $2.30 floor, erasing recent gains as distribution overwhelms historic XRPC debut.

The session confirmed a full technical breakdown with clear structural damage:

Support/Resistance:• $2.29–$2.30 becomes primary support after breach of psychological floor• Former support at $2.36, $2.40, and $2.47 now act as stacked resistance• Invalidation for bulls requires a decisive reclaim of $2.36

Volume Profile:• Total session volume 157.9M (+46%) confirms institutional-grade distribution• Breakdown sequence showed 254% hourly volume spike, typical of liquidation-driven moves• No meaningful recovery volume appeared during post-crash consolidation

Chart Structure:• Descending triangle support failed decisively, killing prior reversal setup• New lower range forming between $2.29–$2.33• Breakdown aligns with medium-term downtrend in broader crypto indexes

Momentum Indicators:• Oversold signals emerging intraday, but no confirmation of trend reversal• Breakdown occurred below key EMAs; 50D/200D cross continues to slope bearishly

XRP now sits at a pivotal inflection point:

• Holding $2.29 is essential — failure exposes a fast move into the $2.00–$2.20 demand zone• Any recovery must first reclaim $2.36 before bulls regain technical control• ETF inflows will act as the next volatility catalyst; early XRPC volume during market open will indicate whether institutions treat the listing as an accumulation opportunity or liquidity event• On-chain flows around the 110.5M XRP whale transfers remain a wildcard — exchange inflows would confirm additional downside risk• Sentiment remains fragile across majors; beta-sensitive assets like XRP will respond disproportionately to broader market weakness

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Threshold: Upgraded bridge to funnel $500B institutional BTC into DeFi","https://cointelegraph.com/news/threshold-improves-tbtc-bridge-institutional-btc-defi","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 00:23:03 GMT","

 Threshold has introduced upgrades to its tBTC bridge, which it claims will better position the $500 billion worth of Bitcoin held by institutions and whales to access DeFi opportunities. 

Crypto infrastructure platform Threshold has rolled out a major upgrade for its tBTC bridge, aimed at enticing institutions to put their billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin to work in decentralized finance protocols. 

Threshold's latest upgrade now enables institutions to mint tBTC directly to supported chains in a single Bitcoin (BTC) transaction, without secondary approvals and without gas fees, while redemptions back to the Bitcoin network are equally as straightforward, Threshold said in a statement.

Threshold's head of marketing, Rizza Carla Ramos, went into more depth in an interview with Cointelegraph at the Web Summit in Lisbon this week, explaining that the feature improvements could incentivize more Bitcoin-holding institutions to put their BTC to work in DeFi instead of just letting it sit there and waiting for it to appreciate:

“They're going to be wanting lending, they want yields on it because if they're investing for Bitcoin in the long run, you don't just want it sitting there, right?

“That's how we're going to build that next level of finance for Bitcoin, by allowing the institutions to get that part of the market onchain,” she added.

Every tBTC minted is verifiably backed 1:1 by Bitcoin, with no middlemen or custodian risk, by implementing a threshold rule where at least 51 out of 100 Bitcoin node operators must sign the transaction for it to be valid. It could empower more than $500 billion in institutional and whale-held Bitcoin to move into Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, Sui and other blockchains to chase DeFi opportunities.

Threshold has seen over $4.2 billion in cumulative volume cross its tBTC bridge since it launched five years ago.

It competes with Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and renBTC (RENBTC), which have seen far more trading volume than Threshold but operate on a more centralized model to move Bitcoin across other blockchains.

WBTC made a move of its own on Thursday, expanding to Hedera to bring more liquidity and Bitcoin tokenization opportunities to the high-speed chain.

Threshold also argued that tBTC would make the decentralized finance space more robust, as Bitcoin would deepen liquidity in decentralized exchange pools and lending protocols while enabling more sustainable yields.

My main MUD was Discworld MUD which was started in 1991. I can't describe the excitement I felt on finding a game where the world continued when I was offline. Where I could go to make friends with the thrill of also making enemies.It was the perfect place to escape to, which taught me about addiction and many aspects of myself.My character is still alive after 20 something years and if I feel like logging in I'm sure there will be friendly faces who remember me.

Adding dapagliflozin (dapa) to the endothelin A receptor antagonist zibotentan (zibo) did not reduce hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) or fluid retention in patients with compensated or decompensated cirrhosis and clinically significant portal hypertension, according to 6-week results of a phase 2 study.

Although dapa could not counteract the zibo-induced fluid retention, it showed potential effects against fluid retention on its own, the researchers of the study wrote in their abstract. “We hypothesize that any increased intrahepatic vasodilation by zibo was counteracted by an increased blood volume,” they added.

The study was presented by Mattias Mandorfer, MD, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria, at The Liver Meeting 2025: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD).

The findings were limited in part by the small sample size and relatively short study period.

The study was supported by AstraZeneca. Mandorfer disclosed serving as a speaker, consultant, or advisory board member for AstraZeneca, AbbVie, Boehringer Ingelheim, Echosens, Eli Lilly and Company, Gilead Sciences, Ipsen, Takeda, and W.L. Gore. He reported receiving grants and research support from Echosens.

A plant-based drink and an animal-based meal triggered similar satiety hormone responses and small appetite reductions after breakfast, yet neither changed how much participants ate at lunch, suggesting that increasing protein at breakfast may support satiety without automatically reducing total energy intake.



Study: The effect of consuming different dietary protein sources at breakfast upon self rated satiety, peptide YY, glucagon like peptide-1, and subsequent food intake in young and older adults. Image Credit: Muhammad Umair132 / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the European Journal of Nutrition, researchers at Newcastle University, UK, investigated the impact of consuming different protein sources at breakfast on adults' subsequent hunger and food consumption, as well as the regulation of associated hormones.

Their findings indicate that high-protein breakfasts, both plant-based and animal-based, elicited stronger satiety hormone responses and appetite suppression, which was significant for the plant-based drink and trending for the animal-based meal. However, neither influenced the total energy consumed during the afternoon meal.

Adequate protein intake is vital for health, but environmental and ethical concerns are driving interest in sustainable, plant-based alternatives.

The Food and Agriculture Organization promotes alternative proteins as part of its global sustainability goals, leading to growth in plant-based foods and drinks.

Protein source can influence digestive, metabolic, and appetite responses, as amino acids stimulate satiety hormones such as peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) while suppressing ghrelin.

Studies comparing protein types have yielded inconsistent results; some find that casein or pea proteins are more satiating than soy, while others report stronger effects for whey.

Plant- and animal-based meals may also differ in their ability to trigger gut hormone release, with outcomes varying by population and protein form. Liquids typically reduce appetite less than solid foods, though this difference in relation to protein source remains unclear.

In the UK, most adults meet their protein recommendations, but older adults may require more due to a reduced appetite and an increased risk of muscle loss. Since breakfast tends to be low in protein, it offers an opportunity to enhance intake.

This study aimed to compare the effects of plant-based and animal-based high-protein breakfasts with a low-protein control on appetite, satiety hormones, and energy intake in younger and older adults.

Researchers employed a randomized, within-subject, crossover design, in which 18 healthy adults, comprising 12 between 18 and 35 years old and 6 over 65, participated in three breakfast conditions: a plant-based, high-protein drink, an animal-based, high-protein breakfast, and a low-protein, high-carbohydrate breakfast.

Each meal was energy-matched, with the high-protein treatments containing 30 g of protein. However, the plant-based drink contained more fiber at 7.8 g than the animal-based meal at 4.5 g. Participants attended the laboratory in a fasted state after consuming a standardized evening meal and avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and exercise.



Schematic of study protocol 

Appetite was measured using visual analogue scales at baseline and at regular intervals for four hours after breakfast, while blood samples were collected at specific time points to measure plasma PYY and GLP-1 concentrations. After the final blood draw, participants consumed an ad libitum pasta lunch to assess energy intake.

Statistical analyses employed mixed models to evaluate the effects of treatment, time, and age group, while controlling for baseline values. Pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction were applied where significant effects were found. Associations between appetite, hormone levels, and energy intake were examined using repeated measures correlation analysis.

Both plant-based and animal-based high-protein breakfasts produced stronger satiety hormone responses than the low-protein, high-carbohydrate meal.

GLP-1 levels were significantly higher after both high-protein meals compared with the control, with no difference between the two protein types. Similar patterns were observed for PYY, which increased significantly after the high protein meals compared with the control, again showing no difference between protein sources.

Subjective appetite ratings were significantly lower following the plant-based protein drink and showed a trend toward reduction after the animal-based meal compared with the low-protein meal. However, these differences were modest and mostly below the 15 mm threshold considered necessary to influence eating behavior meaningfully. Energy intake at the ad libitum lunch did not differ between treatments, and no age-related effects were observed.

Correlation analyses showed that subjective appetite was positively associated with subsequent energy intake. Unexpectedly, GLP-1 and PYY levels showed weak, positive associations with energy intake; however, this represented only a statistical trend, with p values of 0.074 and 0.078, respectively, and was not significant at the 0.05 level.

Within participants, no associations were found between changes in hormone levels, appetite, or energy intake. Overall, both high-protein breakfasts promoted greater satiety hormone responses and appetite suppression than the low-protein meal, but did not affect later food intake.

This study found that plant- and animal-based high-protein breakfasts similarly enhanced satiety hormones GLP-1 and PYY, and reduced appetite, compared with a high-carbohydrate, low-protein meal, with no difference observed between protein sources or age groups.

Although the plant-based drink appeared to produce slightly quicker hormonal responses, a tentative observation the authors suggested might be due to faster gastric emptying of liquids, these effects did not translate into reduced energy intake at lunch.

The comparable responses indicate that plant-based proteins can effectively replace animal proteins in supporting satiety without affecting subsequent calorie intake. Strengths of this analysis include a controlled, crossover design and inclusion of older adults.

Limitations include the small size of the older adult subgroup and the absence of solid plant-based and liquid animal-based conditions, which limit the ability to isolate the effects of protein form and source. Moreover, the study was not statistically powered to detect age differences, which increases the risk of overlooking true age-related effects.

In conclusion, a plant-based, high-protein drink appears to be a practical and sustainable alternative for increasing protein intake without affecting later eating behavior. However, future studies are needed to assess the long-term acceptability of these dietary interventions and the real-world applications of these findings.

A new study published in Nature and Science of Sleep reveals a strong connection between social media addiction and poor sleep quality among high school graduates in Bangladesh, offering fresh insights into the mental health and digital habits of young people. 

Researchers from the Marshall University Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine, CHINTA Research Bangladesh, University of South Asia, Jahangirnagar University and the Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, analyzed data from 1,139 students preparing for university admission. The study found that higher levels of social media addiction were closely associated with poorer sleep quality. Two key symptoms - ""relapse"" and ""daytime performance disruption"" - emerged as major links between excessive social media use and sleep problems. 

The study also uncovered significant gender differences. Female participants experienced poorer sleep quality when social media addiction was present, while male students exhibited a higher overall prevalence of addiction, suggesting a differential, sex-related susceptibility to the effects of social media use. 

Through network analysis, the researchers identified several ""central"" symptoms that bridged social media use and sleep health: ""mood modification,"" ""taking time to fall asleep"" (sleep latency) and ""efficiency disruption during the day."" 

These findings underscore that sleep health and social media behaviors are deeply intertwined. Our results highlight the importance of targeted interventions to promote healthier digital and sleep habits among young people.""

An international study co-led by University of Calgary researchers has found new insulin delivery technology helps control glucose levels during pregnancy for those with Type 1 diabetes, which is crucial to the health of women and their newborns.

The technology, known as automated insulin delivery (AID), mimics a healthy pancreas. The system automatically adjusts the amount of insulin given by a pump in real-time, based on current and predicted glucose levels.

""For pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes, keeping glucose within a healthy range is very important to the health of the woman and fetus,"" says an endocrinologist at Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary and Cumming School of Medicine researcher Dr. Lois Donovan, MD, the study co-principal investigator.

In a multicenter clinical trial, published in JAMA, researchers evaluated the impact of a hybrid closed-loop (HCL) insulin therapy treatment regime with standard insulin injections or an insulin pump that was not automated, along with continuous glucose monitoring.

Keeping blood glucose in the optimal range for pregnancy is exceptionally challenging when someone has Type 1 diabetes, despite their best efforts and the support of dedicated health care clinics.""

Dr. Denice Feig, MD, study's other co-principal investigator

She is an endocrinologist and clinician scientist at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Sinai Health, and a professor of Medicine at the University of Toronto.

Risks associated with Type 1 diabetes in pregnancy can include increased chances of miscarriage, preeclampsia, which involves dangerous spike in blood pressure, and other significant health concerns. Newborns of pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes are more likely to be born excessively large or early and have low blood glucose at birth and are at higher risk of birth defects.

""The study found this AID system worked in pregnancy. It resulted in a three hours per day improvement in the time spent in the desired glucose range compared to the standard delivery with insulin injections or regular insulin pumps,"" says Donovan. ""This is very important because we have learned from other larger studies that every 72 minute per day increase, with glucose in the desired range during pregnancy, is associated with reduction in newborn complications.""

The AID system used in the study is knowns as a Tandem t:slim X2 insulin pump with Control-IQ technology.

""We've known for a while that AID systems have achieved better glucose control with less diabetes management burden in non-pregnant people with Type 1 diabetes, but its use had not been well studied in pregnancy,"" Donovan says. ""Most AIDs were not designed to achieve the narrow glucose range desired in pregnancy or to adapt quickly enough to the changing insulin requirement of pregnancy.""

The study found those using the AID spent more time in a healthy glucose level range and less time below and above the healthy range. The improvement in blood sugar control was immediate and persisted throughout the pregnancy. These results were found at all 14 sites involved in the trial.

""This finding will help inform people who are pregnant or planning pregnancy regarding the benefits of this AID system, which can help them achieve better glucose levels in pregnancy and hopefully better pregnancy outcomes"" says Feig.

The University of Calgary was the lead site for the study with clinics involved in Calgary, Toronto, Vancouver, Quebec City, London (Ont.), Winnipeg, Halifax as well as Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney, Australia.

Funding for the study was provided by Diabetes Canada, MSI Foundation, the University of Calgary Clinical Research Fund, the Buckley Family Trust, the Mount Sinai Department of Medicine Research Fund. The Medical Research Future Fund of Australia funded the trial in that country. In kind, reduced cost and loan of study supplies was provided by Dexcom Canada, Tandem Diabetes Care and RxFood.

A magnetically guided microrobotics system is capable of navigating the body's intricate passageways and vasculature to deliver drugs with pinpoint accuracy, according to a new study. The novel system could enable safer, targeted drug treatments that minimize unwanted side effects. Systemic drug treatments often cause unwanted side effects due to off-target exposure and account for nearly one-third of failures in clinical trials, illustrating the need for precise, targeted drug delivery strategies.

To address this, researchers have worked to develop magnetic micro- and nanorobots designed to deliver drugs directly to diseased tissues. Advances in materials science, fabrication, and control systems have enabled microrobots capable of complex movement and targeted delivery in complex biological environments. However, bridging these technologies into clinical practice remains challenging, as it requires the seamless integration of locomotion, navigation, drug delivery, and imaging functions into a single platform while also ensuring the use of biocompatible, biodegradable materials.

Building on their previous work, Fabian Landers and colleagues present a modular magnetically guided, microrobotic platform that integrates an electromagnetic navigation system (Navion) with a custom release catheter and drug-loaded, dissolvable capsule. Each nontethered gelatin-based microrobot contains magnetic and radiopaque nanoparticles along with therapeutic agents, allowing it to be precisely guided to a target site within the body while being tracked in real-time via X-ray imaging. After use, the microrobot can be triggered to dissolve safely within the body.

Landers et al. tested the platform in vitro using human vasculature models and in vivo in sheep and pigs under realistic clinical conditions to demonstrate the system's capabilities. By applying specific magnetic fields, the authors show that the system can maneuver through complex blood vessels and cerebrospinal spaces, trigger controlled heating to dissolve the microrobot and precisely release drugs into targeted tissues, even reaching the smallest vessels. ""Although significant work remains to fully translate this technology into clinical practice, our results provide a robust framework for addressing the complex challenges associated with targeted drug delivery,"" Landers et al. write.

Alcohol-related diseases and injuries have the potential to cost the Australian healthcare system a staggering $68 billion over 60 years if nothing is done to stop the impact.

The new Griffith University developed The Alcohol Policy (TAP) model is an epidemiological model used to estimate the avoidable alcohol-related disease, injury and healthcare cost burden in the Australian population aged over 15 years.

Dr. Mary Wanjau from Griffith's School of Medicine and Dentistry said if we eliminated alcohol consumption over the first 25 years, we could prevent more than 25 million cases of diseases and injuries and more than 200 thousand deaths, of which the majority would be from cancers.

If we act now and eliminate alcohol consumption to zero, we could save the healthcare system $55 billion in the first 25 years. These findings can help policymakers understand the scale of the future alcohol burden which can be prevented.""

Dr. Mary Wanjau from Griffith's School of Medicine and Dentistry

Excessive use of alcohol was one of the leading risks for mortality and disability globally with the evidence suggesting there is no safe level of alcohol-use for overall health.

The risk of cancers and mortality rises with increased levels of drinking.

Young adults aged 15-39 years bear most of the acute consequences due to high rates of injuries leading to death and disability.

Even minor decreases in alcohol consumption across the population could significantly reduce health burdens for individuals and the healthcare system while also lowering costs for individuals, communities, and governments.

Professor Lennert Veerman said the findings support prioritisation of investment in alcohol harm reduction.

""Policies and interventions which reduce consumption at the population level are likely to offer favourable impact as they create environments which support and allow for an increase in the number of people who abstain from drinking, a delay in the age when people start drinking, and reductions in alcohol consumption for those who drink,"" he said.

""The research findings underscore the consequences of inaction and reinforce the health and economic case for preventive measures, especially for Australia, where alcohol is the most widely used drug.

""Stronger alcohol control policies are needed to realise these gains in the reduction of alcohol harm and related healthcare costs.""

The paper 'The avoidable health burden and healthcare costs related to alcohol consumption in Australia: multistate life table modelling' has been published in the International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction.

Research institutions around the world house valuable genetic information that could help unlock countless medical mysteries. However, because DNA degrades over time, it is difficult for researchers to analyze DNA samples older than 20 years using conventional analytical approaches.

Although modern technologies have transformed researchers' ability to learn about disease, these technologies have primarily been used on modern genetic samples. The ability to study genetic data from earlier decades has been exceedingly limited, which hinders researchers' understanding of old diseases and why changes in diseases occur over time.

By adapting techniques originally used to study ancient DNA from archaeological specimens, researchers at the University of Chicago were able to recover genetic information from nearly century-old medical samples.

The work will be presented at the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) 2025 Annual Meeting & Expo, taking place Nov. 11–15 in Boston.

To test their technique, the researchers used samples of tissue from colorectal cancer specimens collected between 1932 and 2023. The researchers chose to focus on colorectal cancer because it has become significantly more common among young adults over the past several decades without a clear explanation. Today, a 35-year-old is twice as likely to develop colorectal cancer compared to a 35-year-old in 1985.

The researchers isolated tumor tissue from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens for DNA extraction. The researchers optimized the removal of paraffin wax and chemical preservatives to maximize the amount of usable DNA. Next, the researchers used tailored approaches to put the DNA fragments into a readable format for sequencing. They created a custom pipeline using digital tools typically reserved for ancient DNA analysis so they could match samples with missing or damaged DNA to the human genome.

After checking the quality of the DNA, the researchers sequenced the genome using whole-genome sequencing and a targeted gene-enrichment panel (OncoPlus) to find genetic mutations that drive tumor growth. In both cases, they modified the protocols to retain tiny fragments of DNA that is traditionally discarded. Finally, they analyzed the non-human DNA found in the tissue samples to identify bacteria that may have been in the tumor.

Dr. Alexander Guzzetta, M.D., Ph.D., who oversaw the project alongside ancient DNA researcher Maanasa Raghavan, Ph.D., noted, ""When we analyzed bacterial DNA from colon cancer tissues, we not only detected normal gut microbes but also bacterial species which are specifically associated with colon cancer."" The team is now working on refining their analysis methods to better understand these bacteria and understand how their presence may have shifted over time.

Although Guzzetta's team is currently focused on colorectal cancer he hopes that other researchers use this work to study other disease changes over time. ""There is massive potential here for other groups to use these approaches to unravel the root causes underlying the shifting landscape of modern diseases,"" Guzzetta said. ""This approach could unlock the ability to study how diseases evolve over decades and shed light on how their biology has changed through time.""

This work was led by Alexander Guzzetta, M.D., Ph.D., at the University of Chicago, and will be presented during a platform presentation at 2:45 p.m. Eastern time on Nov. 13, at the Thomas M. Menino Convention and Exhibition Center in Boston. The work will also be presented as a poster in the convention center. Guzzetta's poster number is TT008. He will be available to discuss the work with reporters.

A new sociomedical perspective shows how off-label use of GLP-1 drugs for slimness is redefining what counts as a healthy, responsible body, revealing hidden moral pressures and global inequalities behind the weight loss boom.



Perspective: The Uncharted Territory of the New Obesity Drugs in Users Without Obesity: A Sociomedical Perspective. Image Credit: Pietukhova / Shutterstock

In a recent perspective in the journal Obesity, researchers discussed recent medical developments that have not only revolutionized the treatment of diabetes and obesity, but whose popularity has also quickly spread among groups who lack clinical indication for obesity or diabetes treatment.

This off-label use, the authors argue, is exposing deeper tensions between medical innovation, weight stigma, and the social value attached to thinness, as medication becomes a means of attaining social and aesthetic goals rather than improving health.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have revolutionized the treatment of obesity and diabetes, offering significant weight loss with manageable side effects. However, their popularity has rapidly spread to individuals without obesity or metabolic disorders, who use them off-label to achieve or maintain slimness.

This phenomenon, marked by celebrity endorsements, media attention, online sales, and widespread social media discussion, reflects more than a medical trend. It reveals a growing cultural shift in which slimness is equated with moral virtue, self-discipline, and social value, as the authors describe it - a moral economy of the body.

The authors argue that this off-label use exposes deeper tensions between medical innovation, body image ideals, and the social meanings attached to thinness, and explicitly ask whether such use should be considered an abuse of medical technology or a rational adaptation to weight-stigmatizing environments.

Understanding these behaviors requires moving beyond clinical data to explore the psychological, cultural, and political contexts that shape how people use these drugs. Off-label use represents a form of pharmacological thinness, where medication becomes a means of attaining aesthetic and social goals rather than health improvement.

GLP-1 RA drugs were initially developed for individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes, but their reach has extended far beyond this population.

With the rise of online promotion and influencer marketing, these drugs are now positioned as tools of lifestyle optimization and bodily perfection. This expansion also highlights the limitations of the body mass index (BMI) in defining obesity, as many individuals with normal or mildly elevated BMIs may perceive themselves as needing intervention.

Weight loss, once a clinical outcome, has become a visible marker of personal virtue, performative achievement, and conformity to dominant beauty and health ideals, reflecting broader neoliberal healthism ideals that conflate appearance with moral responsibility. Within this moral economy, losing weight symbolizes effort and commitment, while failing to do so is seen as a moral shortcoming.

For users without obesity, these drugs may represent a means of achieving socially approved body shapes and social worth without the burden of traditional self-discipline. They help individuals navigate a culture that equates thinness with attractiveness, competence, and even employability.

Research gaps remain across multiple domains regarding the off-label use of GLP-1 RAs. One key gap concerns food and appetite, particularly how these drugs reshape users' emotional and sensory relationships with eating. While some individuals may feel liberated by reduced hunger, others may experience distress, alienation, or loss of enjoyment associated with food.

Another area of uncertainty involves side effects, as users' perceptions of symptoms such as nausea or fatigue may vary widely and may even be interpreted as markers of treatment efficacy. For some, these effects are interpreted as signs of drug efficacy or commitment to weight loss, whereas others experience them as discomforting or harmful.

Gaps also persist in understanding the impact of these drugs on body image and self-worth. While weight loss may enhance self-esteem for some, it may simultaneously heighten dissatisfaction or lead to further body modification pursuits, such as cosmetic procedures. Off-label use may alter eating behaviors, emotional regulation, and mental health, potentially leading to increased anxiety, guilt, or disordered eating.

Further research is required on access and dependency, particularly regarding how users obtain these drugs through medical or informal channels, and how cost, medical oversight, medical gatekeeping, and social privilege shape accessibility. Emotional dependence also warrants investigation, as some users may fear weight regain more intensely than adverse effects, raising concerns about long-term reliance.

Social media plays a pivotal role in normalizing GLP-1 RA use, spreading narratives that frame pharmacological weight loss as desirable and legitimate. However, the ways digital spaces shape motivations, self-image, and peer validation remain poorly understood. Users may view pharmacological weight loss as more legitimate or effective than other methods, reinforcing moral hierarchies around body management.

The authors propose a multinational research initiative, currently involving Brazil, the US, Denmark, and Japan, to examine how off-label GLP-1 RA use manifests across different societies, where cultural contexts shape distinct motivations. For example, this includes navigating racialized beauty standards in Brazil and technologies of neoliberal self-discipline in the US. This is not merely a deviation from medical norms but part of a broader cultural transformation in how the body, health, and morality are understood.

An intersectional framework is vital to understanding how factors such as gender, race, age, class, and geography shape who uses these drugs, how they are judged, and what outcomes they experience. Without such nuance, users risk being stereotyped as vain or irresponsible, while the deeper structural pressures that normalize pharmaceutical thinness remain invisible.

Ultimately, understanding off-label GLP-1 RA use requires integrating biomedical insights with sociological and cultural analysis. These drugs not only alter metabolism and appetite but also reshape identities, social hierarchies, and moral judgments.

Taking a page from market research tactics, UC San Francisco experts are studying whether artificial intelligence (AI) can improve diagnosis of a complex liver condition by using the clinical notes of multiple providers. 

Their recent study, published in Gastro Hep Advances, focused on hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), a complex condition associated with liver disease that is often difficult to diagnose during hospitalization. The researchers sought to learn if large language models could analyze the clinical notes of multiple physicians and other providers to improve diagnostic accuracy and streamline patient care. 

""The concept is inspired by sentiment analysis technology commonly used with reviews in online shopping platforms, where AI summarizes collective opinions,"" said Jin Ge, MD, MBA, UCSF assistant professor of medicine and gastroenterologist, who led the study.

We utilized this approach to determine if collective sentiment could predict an HRS diagnosis.""

Jin Ge, MD, MBA, Assistant Professor, University of California - San Francisco

The study compared traditional diagnostic methods based on clinical variables, such as lab results, with an AI-enhanced model that incorporated sentiment analysis derived from clinical notes. Incorporating AI-generated sentiment scores significantly improved predictive accuracy for HRS diagnosis upon patient discharge. 

The technology offers clarity in situations where conflicting recommendations among health care professionals may arise, providing a unified summary of the care team's consensus for clinicians and patients alike. While still in the research phase, this application has the potential to transform decision-making in hospitals and enhance patient outcomes. 

""Using the 'wisdom of the crowd' doesn't just predict outcomes, it offers a directional insight into what the clinical care team collectively thinks about a patient's condition,"" said Ge. ""For cases with mixed opinions or uncertainty, AI-generated summaries could help align care decisions and expedite treatment plans."" 

The study has not yet been implemented in clinical practice but could pave the way for future trials. The researchers aim to evaluate how this information might influence real-world decision-making and patient care.

A blocked coronary artery causing an acute heart attack must be opened immediately with a stent procedure. However, if other coronary arteries also appear to be narrowed, it is safe to wait and treat those later. This approach cuts the number of stent procedures in half, according to cardiologists from Radboud university medical center, writing in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Each year, 33,600 people are admitted to the hospital with a heart attack. In those cases, doctors must quickly open the blocked artery with angioplasty to prevent part of the heart muscle from dying. Yet during the procedure, it often becomes clear that other coronary arteries are also narrowed. Researchers from 41 hospitals, led by Radboudumc, investigated whether it is necessary to treat those narrowed vessels immediately, or if it can be done safely later, under calmer circumstances.

Their study, involving 1,146 participants, shows that waiting is safe. Only patients with an acute heart attack were included. This means that a coronary artery is completely blocked, for example by a blood clot. Half of the patients received full treatment immediately, while for the other half, additional stenting was done up to six weeks later. The researchers followed the patients for three years. Robin Nijveldt, Professor of Cardiovascular Imaging at Radboudumc, explains.

We saw no difference between the two groups in terms of death, new heart attacks, or hospital admissions due to heart failure.""

Robin Nijveldt, Professor, Cardiovascular Imaging, Radboud University Medical Center

One striking finding: in the later, calmer phase, cardiologists treated only half as many narrowed arteries as in the acute phase. 'That's because of how we determine whether stenting is necessary', says Professor of Cardiology Niels van Royen. 'In the acute phase, we use a catheter to measure pressure inside the blood vessel. Later, we can perform an MRI scan to map the heart's overall blood flow. If that shows the heart is getting enough oxygen, then stenting a single narrowed artery isn't required.'

Still, the cardiologists don't advise delaying additional treatment deliberately. 'For patients, it's usually more convenient to have everything done in one procedure', Van Royen explains. 'But sometimes that's not possible - for example, if the patient is in pain and exhausted, or if another person with an acute heart attack arrives and takes priority. Now we know it's safe to stop at that point. There's no need to force things, because faster is not better.'

It's also now clear that cardiologists can reassure patients a few weeks later with an MRI scan showing that no further stenting is needed. 'But patients do need to come back for the MRI', Van Royen notes. 'Some choose to skip the follow-up, even though additional treatment might still be wise.'

The cardiologists expect that current guidelines - which recommend immediate treatment of all narrowed arteries during the acute phase - will soon be revised. 'These guidelines were based on two major studies that showed a small short-term benefit to immediate treatment, but not in the long term', Nijveldt says. 'Our study provides more clarity: that benefit doesn't actually exist.'

PHILADELPHIA — Perhaps the clearest sign of Mauricio Pochettino's background at the club level comes in his interaction with members of the U.S. men's national team when they are outside international windows.

Which is to say, there's not much interaction at all.

“I feel like in-season, he kinda lets you deal with your club and lets you focus on your coach and stuff there,” USMNT defender Alex Freeman told The Post this week. “But if you ever need him, he's always a text or a call away. He always picks up. I think he lets you be at your club. He was a club coach, so he probably knows how it is with clubs.”

That is not to imply that Pochettino isn't building the necessary relationships with his players or doing the legwork in between international windows amid the run-up to next summer's World Cup that will be the most important event for American soccer perhaps ever.

Pochettino and his staff have visited more than 50 clubs in North America and Europe and watch every game they can. 

When Freeman showed up at camp for the Gold Cup over the summer, Pochettino took him aside for a 20-minute conversation that included extensive feedback on his game.

“It's good to go to camp and have a guy who's giving you feedback and letting you know what he thinks about how you play,” Freeman said. “Just gives you confidence as a player to want to do better for him. Just having him as a coach, you can tell he's very passionate about the sport and he wants the best out of all of us.”

Pochettino has admitted he didn't know Cristian Roldan before making the midfielder a late call-up two months ago. 

But when Roldan arrived for his first camp under the Argentine, Pochettino established a relationship immediately, nevertheless.

“Giving me confidence, telling me I belong here,” Roldan told The Post. “Telling me that I can do it, that I had been gone [from the national team] for two years [but] I still have the ability to affect the game in the way they see it. To be myself with my personality. I think that those things correlate to success. And I felt like he did a great job of just bringing me in and making it seem seamless.”

That was crucial for Roldan's successful re-entry into the national team fold.

“He was very clear in what he wanted out of me,” Roldan said. “So just bringing that same energy back is really important. … Continue to form that relationship. Definitely trust is the first word I'd put to it.”

PHILADELPHIA — Mark McKenzie was talking Thursday about the little intricacies, the things an athlete knows about his teammates through practicing together over and over and over again.

“Whether it's turning over your left shoulder, turning over your right shoulder, whether someone's a bit more aggressive stepping into midfield,” McKenzie, a center back for the USMNT, said before Thursday's training session. “Whether they're more comfortable in aerial duels, whether they're more comfortable covering space behind. I think those are all things you build through repetition.”

And that inherently represents a problem to be solved for a national team.

Between now and June 12, when it begins the World Cup on home soil in Los Angeles, the Yanks have all of a handful of training sessions together. 

There is another international window in March, with Portugal and Belgium as rumored friendly opponents, that should include something like the A-team at camp, and there will be the final, pre-World Cup training camp in the immediate lead-up to the competition itself.

Of course, there's also the remainder of the current window, which includes a friendly against Paraguay on Saturday here in Philadelphia, as well as one against Uruguay on Tuesday in Tampa. 

Due to a mix of injuries and circumstances, though, a number of players anticipated to play key roles at the World Cup, including Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Antonee Robinson, Yunus Musah and Chris Richards, were not called up this time around.

The problem is not unique to the United States; it's inherent to any national team and in any sport. 

Still, the question of how to build chemistry over a limited window of practices, dispersed over months at a time, with the stakes as high as could be, is one whose answer will help dictate how far the U.S. goes next summer.

“There's a sense of intentionality, a sense of urgency, that comes along with that,” McKenzie said. “Knowing you have a limited amount of training sessions together. Knowing that there's work to be done, areas we want to improve on and continue to grow as a group. Building the chemistry we already have. Figuring out the nuances of how we want to play, what message we want to send every time we step on the pitch, to our opponents. The biggest thing is intentionality and urgency with the sessions we do have together.”

Of course, it's not as if players show up their first time at a national team camp cold, not knowing anyone in the building. 

The world of American soccer is small and interconnected. 

McKenzie, Brendan Aaronson, Auston Trusty and Matt Freese, for example, all grew up in Philadelphia and played for Bethlehem Steel FC, the United Soccer League affiliate for the MLS Philadelphia Union.

Alex Freeman has built close bonds with fellow defenders Max Arfsten and Miles Robinson.

“I feel like the bond of this team is one of the reasons I feel like we're gonna go very far in this World Cup,” Freeman told The Post on Wednesday. “We do everything together. Not only that, it's like no egos. No one thinks they're better than everyone. I think it's nice because [coach Mauricio] Pochettino kinda created that culture. Everyone here has to work for it.”

Pochettino, in the run-up to this camp, dismissed any notion that his main group may not get enough time together before the World Cup.

“We are not going to complain,” he said. “We cannot give excuses to ourselves in case [we do] not perform. I think we have time enough. We need to be intelligent and we need to give our best to perform and it's up to us.”

Women's World Cup champions and Olympic gold medallists Tobin Heath and Heather O'Reilly were elected Thursday to the U.S. National Soccer Hall of Fame along with men's players Tony Sanneh and Chris Wondolowski.

Referee Kari Seitz also was elected along with Kevin Crow, known primarily for his time in indoor football.

They will be inducted on May 1 at the hall in Frisco, Texas.

O'Reilly, 40, was a forward and winger who scored 47 goals in 231 international appearances, helping the U.S. win the 2015 World Cup and Olympic gold medals in 2004, 2008 and 2012. 

She won league titles with Sky Blue in 2009 in Women's Professional Soccer and with Kansas City in 2015 and North Carolina in 2019 in the National Women's Soccer League.

Heath, 37, was a midfielder and forward who had 36 goals in 181 appearances, winning World Cup titles with the U.S. in 2015 and 2019 and Olympic gold medals in 2008 and 2012.

Wondolowski, 42, is Major League Soccer's career scoring leader with 171 regular-season goals and two in the playoffs, playing for San Jose (2005, 2009-21) and Houston (2006-09). He scored 11 goals in 35 international appearances, playing in two games at the 2014 World Cup.

Sanneh, 54, was a defender who scored three goals in 43 international appearances, starting all five games for the U.S. at the 2002 World Cup as the Americans reached the quarterfinals in their farthest advancement since 1930. 

O'Reilly, Heath and Wondolowski were picked from the player ballot, while Sanneh and Crow were chosen from the veteran ballot.

Seitz, 55, refereed nine games at the Women's World Cup in 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2011 and six at the Olympics in 2004, 2008 and 2012. She became the U.S. Soccer Federation's vice president of referees in 2024.

Seitz was on the builder ballot, which this year included only referees. The top voter-getter is picked if receiving at least 50 per cent.

Three former players who performed domestically and internationally for U.S. national teams, have been elected to the National Soccer Hall of Fame, the organization revealed on its website on Thursday.

The trio was U.S. women's national team standouts Heather O'Reilly and Tobin Heath and Major League Soccer all-time scoring leader Chris Wondolowski.

All three were voted in on the Players' Ballot.

O'Reilly played 231 full internationals between 2002 and 2016. She was a member of the 2015 Women's World Cup championship side, and Olympic gold medals in 2004, 2008 and 2012.

Heath made 181 appearances for the USWNT. She performed three Women's World Cups, lifting the trophy in 2015 and 2019. She also competed in four Olympic soccer tournaments, winning gold in 2008 and 2012 and bronze in 2021.

A forward who retired as the leading goal scorer in Major League Soccer history, Wondolowski played 17 seasons in the league between 2005-21.

They will be inducted into the NSHOF in Frisco, Texas on May 1, 2026.

There likely will be more inductees soon.

The 2026 World Cup is almost upon us, especially now that the USMNT is about to play its final two games of the 2025 calendar year. The first game is set for Saturday when the Americans play Paraguay. Mauricio Pochettino's team is on a three-match unbeaten run, finally showing some promise and building some momentum ahead of the World Cup. However, they will be challenged by Paraguay, which is also preparing for next summer.

Following a concerning loss to South Korea in September, the U.S. has turned things around. A switch by Pochettino to a three-back system has yielded a win over Japan, a draw with Ecuador, and a win over Australia. However, it's not a stretch to say that the USMNT's biggest tests of the year await with the games against Paraguay and Uruguay.

Saturday's opponent, Paraguay, is coming off a successful World Cup qualification campaign. Granted, seven wins, seven draws, and four losses were only good for sixth place in CONMEBOL qualifying. But it was good enough to make it into the field of 48, getting Paraguay to the World Cup for the first time since 2010.

This will be the first time the USMNT and Paraguay have played each other since 2018. The U.S. won that March 2018 friendly 1-0. They were also victorious in a 1-0 win over Paraguay during the 2016 Copa América despite playing most of the second half with 10 players.

Time: Saturday, November 15, 5:00 PM, ET

Venue: Subaru Park, Chester, Pennsylvania

TV/streaming: TNT and HBOMax in English | Telemundo, Universo and Peacock in Spanish

Our final roster of the year is here! 🇺🇸⚽️25 players have been called up for matches against Paraguay on Nov. 15 and Uruguay on Nov. 18! 👇 pic.twitter.com/7D0bnH2QPu

While it seems like Pochettino is starting to put the pieces together for next year's World Cup, this will not be the USMNT at full strength. Injuries and circumstances at club level will leave the U.S. without the likes of Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson, Tyler Adams, Malik Tillman, Chris Richards, Tim Weah, and Weston McKennie for the November window. All seven are potential starts, leaving some uncertainty as to how the USMNT will lineup against Paraguay.

USMNT Lineup (3-4-3, right to left)

Matt Freese (GK) - Miles Robinson, Mark McKenzie, Tim Ream - Sergiño Dest, Aidan Morris, Tanner Tessmann, Max Arfsten - Brenden Aaronson, Folarin Balgoun, Gio Reyna

Paraguay Lineup (4-2–3-1, right to left)

Roberto Fernandez (GK) - Juan Caceres, Gustavo Gomez, Omar Alderete, Junior Alonso - Damian Bobadilla, Andres Cubas - Hugo Cuenca, Diego Gomez, Miguel Almiron - Antonio Sanabria

Paraguay should be a good test for the U.S., especially since Pochettino's side is missing several key figures. The South American side has just two losses in its last 14 matches, although one of those came in a friendly against South Korea last month. That stretch also includes victories over Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay in World Cup qualifying matches, so Paraguay can compete against high-level teams.

Defensively, Paraguay has been particularly strong. They have a veteran backline that's helped them to keep seven clean sheets in their last 14 matches. Only four times in those 14 matches has their opponent scored multiple goals. On the other hand, both Japan and South Korea scored two goals against them in friendlies last month.

Meanwhile, the U.S. has come on strong on both ends lately. The three-back formation has helped to solidify them defensively, while the Americans have shown some grit and determination to manufacture goals on the attacking end. Even with key players missing, the USMNT has some potential match-winners, not to mention plenty of players with a point to prove, which should help push the Americans over the top.

Prediction: USA 2, Paraguay 1

As football's global governing body, FIFA, gears up for its largest-ever World Cup in 2026, it has enlisted technology giant Lenovo as its official partner to manage the operational and digital demands of the tournament.

In a recent media briefing, executives from both organisations outlined the scope of the partnership, which aims to leverage advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), to enhance the experience for teams, broadcasters, and the estimated six billion fans who will tune in.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup, hosted across the US, Mexico, and Canada, is set to be an event of unprecedented scale, featuring a record 48 teams, 104 games, and 16 host cities. Running such a massive event requires a robust technology backbone, a role which Lenovo is well-positioned to fill, said FIFA technology director Nacho Fresco.

“We need a partner who is able to deliver fast, because in a World Cup football match, we cannot wait for just one minute,” Fresco said, adding that Lenovo's innovative and entrepreneurial spirit, as well as high-quality standards, helped to seal the deal.

For Lenovo, its work with FIFA will allow it to showcase its full breadth of capabilities beyond its reputation as a major PC maker. Besides supplying laptops, tablets, and Motorola smartphones used by officials to run the games, the company will also provide servers, storage, and edge infrastructure to power systems like the Hawk-Eye video assistant referee used by FIFA referees to make pitch decisions.

Jeff Shafer, Lenovo's senior vice-president of corporate marketing, said the World Cup is also an opportunity for the company to transform itself into an AI powerhouse. “The reality is that if we can do it for FIFA, F1 and the Olympics, then we know we can do it for anybody out there, from consumers to the biggest companies in the world.”

Art Hu, Lenovo's chief information officer, concurred, noting that the partnership is in line with its transition to a services-led, AI-first company in a hybrid world, focusing on developing custom capabilities for use cases where out-of-the-box solutions do not exist.

For example, Hu said tablets will be deployed to not only help VIP guests such as government leaders get seated, but also provide them with access to content, such as game snippets and match statistics, delivering a high-touch experience for a targeted set of users.

While AI-powered services and applications for players, coaches, broadcasters and fans are being saved for a major reveal at the CES technology show in Las Vegas in January 2026, Shafer said “if we can use AI to deliver something of value to each one of those groups, we'd have achieved our goal.”

Santiago Manso, Lenovo's director for sports vertical, added that the robustness of the systems and infrastructure used to support World Cup games can be replicated in other fields, such as nuclear power, smart energy grids, and military defence – all of which require high resiliency.

In the run-up to World Cup 2026, Lenovo had the opportunity to apply its capabilities during the FIFA Club World Cup this past summer, where it helped implement semi-automated offside technology, leading to faster and more accurate offside calls that reduced game delays. “That benefits the players, broadcasters and fans, and it makes the game better,” Shafer said.

When asked by Computer Weekly about what's being done to secure the high-profile tournament – a prime target for disruption – against cyber threats, Manso said Lenovo is incorporating security into all its devices and services from the design stage, he said, adding that the company is also working with FIFA and governments in host countries to incorporate multiple layers of security.

Ultimately, both organisations see the partnership as a legacy-defining project. “We are going to have the most technologically advanced FIFA World Cup,” Fresco said, adding that the work done for the men's World Cup will extend to future tournaments, including the Women's World Cup in 2027.

The alleged deal to use the Kennedy Center complex comes as ticket sales are reportedly declining after Trump's takeover

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

FIFA will reportedly use large parts of the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., displacing previously scheduled performers, even as the showpiece arts complex is reportedly struggling with sharply declining ticket sales following President Donald Trump's takeover of the institution earlier this year.

The soccer governing body will occupy multiple facilities for nearly three weeks that normally rent for tens of thousands of dollars per day in the lead-up to the December 5 World Cup draw there, The Washington Post reports, citing an August venue use agreement and Kennedy Center employees. 

The operation has reportedly forced big-name performers to relocate to other venues, including the National Symphony Orchestra. 

The Independent has contacted FIFA and the Kennedy Center for comment. 

In the eight months since Trump cleaned house at the Kennedy Center and installed himself as chair of its board ticket sales have reportedly plummeted nearly 50 percent.

Using the venue for the World Cup draw caps off months of FIFA president Gianni Infantino building goodwill with President Trump. 

In July, the president was on hand at New Jersey's Metlife Stadium to present a trophy to Chelsea, the winners of the FIFA Club World Cup. 

The following month, Infantino visited Trump in the White House, where the president was seen holding the golden World Cup winner's trophy, which the FIFA boss said was privilege only given to “the FIFA President, presidents of countries, and then those who win.”

The FIFA boss has also joined the many dignitaries who've publicly supported Trump's long-running bid to win a Nobel Peace Prize, writing in October that Trump “definitely deserves” the award for his efforts toward a peace deal in Gaza. 

FIFA has said it will unveil the winner of its own newly created peace price on December 5, the same day as the World Cup draw. 

Earlier this month, when asked if Trump would win the FIFA prize, Infantino left the door open to the possibility.

“On the 5th of December, you will see,” he told reporters.

FIFA also opened an office in New York City's Trump Tower this year.

The U.S., Mexico, and Canada will jointly host the 2026 men's World Cup.

Northern Ireland last qualified for the World Cup in 1986

Fifa World Cup qualifier: Slovakia v Northern Ireland

Venue: Kosice, Slovakia Date: Friday, 14 November Kick-off: 19:45 GMT

Coverage: Watch live on BBC Two NI, BBC Three & BBC iPlayer; commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Radio Ulster & BBC Sounds; live text commentary and in-play clips on BBC Sport website & app

As Northern Ireland take the field against Slovakia on Friday evening, for many of Michael O'Neill's young squad it will feel like the most consequential international of their careers to date.

With their efforts to reach the World Cup in North America next summer reaching a critical juncture, there is a sense that the 90 minutes in Kosice could be defining in Group A where Northern Ireland are three points behind both Germany and Slovakia with two games remaining. 

However, needing at least a point to carry their hopes of a top-two finish into their final group game at home to Luxembourg on Monday, there is the curious scenario where Northern Ireland's players could leave the field beaten, only to discover that events elsewhere have ensured them a qualifying play-off spot regardless.

As a winner of their Nations League group, only a highly unlikely set of results would mean Northern Ireland would miss out on the play-off games in March. 

Knowing the importance of seeding come the play-offs, and what second place in the group would represent for his panel, manager O'Neill is giving little thought to the potential of a backdoor route into those crunch spring fixtures.

""We haven't paid any attention to that,"" he said. ""We did our job in the Nations League and, if that gives us a route to a qualification play-off, great. If it doesn't, we have to take care of it here.

""This is the here and now, we have to deal with that situation which is obviously getting as many points as we can from the final two games.

""What we can get is 12 points and we have to aspire to that.""

NI the 'strongest we've been' - Peacock-Farrell

Magennis praises NI 'fearlessness and athleticism'

Belief that Northern Ireland could seal second place ahead of Slovakia surged after they were comfortably the superior team when the sides met in Belfast last month, winning 2-0 with a performance that record goalscorer David Healy said was perhaps their best ever under O'Neill.

In the weeks since, however, there is a growing feeling that the tables have turned somewhat.

Slovakia were missing influential pair Stanislav Lobotka and David Hancko for the game at Windsor Park, with both expected to be back in Francesco Calzona's starting line-up at the Kosice Football Arena this time around. 

Northern Ireland, however, will be without three-quarters of the midfield that so impressed in the reverse fixture, with Shea Charles and Ali McCann injured while Ethan Galbraith is suspended.

How the manager fills such considerable holes in his line-up has been the key talking point since his squad was confirmed last week.

In Napoli's Lobotka, O'Neill believes Slovakia can again call upon one of the best defensive midfielders in Europe.

""He's an excellent player and he plays at the top level with Napoli, but we look at Slovakia as a team, we don't look at them as one player or two players,"" he said.

""It won't change the way Slovakia try and play. We have to deal with that as a team, it's not one individual player.

""We don't envisage any dramatic change in their strategy or how they look to play tactically, but they'll obviously be stronger.""

Stanislav Lobotka missed the game between the sides in October

If O'Neill is complimentary of Lobotka, such sentiments have not been reciprocated this week with the 30-year-old quoted as saying Northern Ireland lacked creativity were ""annoying"".

In response to what was a not dissimilar critique of his side to the one aired by Germany manager Julian Nagelsmann earlier in the campaign, O'Neill quipped that his wife is quick to call him annoying too, but in fact feels there are similarities between his side and Slovakia in terms of style and approach. 

""We take that as a compliment and it won't upset us,"" he said of Lobotka's remark.

""I would say that they're quite similar to us in the way that it is their collective as a team. They play in a very structured way. They believe in the way they play. They have good individual players. They're good as a collective.

""It's always hard to play away, but we're looking forward to the game and we believe we can do it.""

Argentina and Mexico square off in Round of 32 action of the FIFA U-17 World Cup. Here's everything you need to know ahead of kickoff, including how to watch.

Argentina enter the knockout stage in dominant form after sweeping their group with three straight wins, outscoring opponents 11-2. They closed the group with a 7-0 rout of Fiji, following hard-fought victories over Tunisia and Belgium. Mexico, meanwhile, struggled to find consistency, defeating Ivory Coast 1-0 but falling to both South Korea and Switzerland. Mexico will need to rediscover their sharpness in front of goal to challenge a confident Argentina side that's hitting top form at just the right time.

The alleged deal to use the Kennedy Center complex comes as ticket sales are reportedly declining after Trump's takeover

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

FIFA will reportedly use large parts of the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., displacing previously scheduled performers, even as the showpiece arts complex is reportedly struggling with sharply declining ticket sales following President Donald Trump's takeover of the institution earlier this year.

The soccer governing body will occupy multiple facilities for nearly three weeks that normally rent for tens of thousands of dollars per day in the lead-up to the December 5 World Cup draw there, The Washington Post reports, citing an August venue use agreement and Kennedy Center employees. 

The operation has reportedly forced big-name performers to relocate to other venues, including the National Symphony Orchestra. 

The Independent has contacted FIFA and the Kennedy Center for comment. 

In the eight months since Trump cleaned house at the Kennedy Center and installed himself as chair of its board ticket sales have reportedly plummeted nearly 50 percent.

Using the venue for the World Cup draw caps off months of FIFA president Gianni Infantino building goodwill with President Trump. 

In July, the president was on hand at New Jersey's Metlife Stadium to present a trophy to Chelsea, the winners of the FIFA Club World Cup. 

The following month, Infantino visited Trump in the White House, where the president was seen holding the golden World Cup winner's trophy, which the FIFA boss said was privilege only given to “the FIFA President, presidents of countries, and then those who win.”

The FIFA boss has also joined the many dignitaries who've publicly supported Trump's long-running bid to win a Nobel Peace Prize, writing in October that Trump “definitely deserves” the award for his efforts toward a peace deal in Gaza. 

FIFA has said it will unveil the winner of its own newly created peace price on December 5, the same day as the World Cup draw. 

Earlier this month, when asked if Trump would win the FIFA prize, Infantino left the door open to the possibility.

“On the 5th of December, you will see,” he told reporters.

FIFA also opened an office in New York City's Trump Tower this year.

The U.S., Mexico, and Canada will jointly host the 2026 men's World Cup.

Report as England end Serbia's top-two chances in Group K of World Cup qualifying and maintain their perfect record in the group through Bukayo Saka and Eberechi Eze goals; Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden second-half subs after Morgan Rogers favoured at No 10

England maintained their perfect World Cup qualifying record with a 2-0 win over Serbia thanks to a fine Bukayo Saka volley and excellent Eberechi Eze finish, as Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden had mixed performances off the bench at Wembley.

The goals were standout moments of quality on a rain-soaked night in which already-qualified England struggled to hit the high levels they've reached in recent internationals. But Thomas Tuchel's side were markedly improved after he intervened midway through the first half after a lacklustre and sloppy start to the game from his team.

England had been 3-0 up by half-time in their past three internationals - including a 5-0 thrashing of Serbia in Belgrade - but were alarmingly slow out of the blocks here until an impromptu Tuchel team talk shook things up when Jordan Pickford went down calling for treatment on 23 minutes.

With Harry Kane dropping deeper to turn playmaker and Declan Rice more advanced, Saka and Marcus Rashford suddenly began to threaten. As well as Saka's volley, there were more good chances before half-time, with Kane heading wide and Rogers glancing off target after Rashford and Rice were unable to capitalise on a counter.

There were let-offs in the second half, though, with Dusan Vlahovic flicking wide and then clipping the roof of the net as Serbia - increasingly desperate - searched for an equaliser to save their World Cup hopes. This result, though, coupled with Albania also winning in Andorra, ends their chances of a top-two finish in Group K.

The statistics look good for England. They are still yet to concede in this campaign, with Pickford's England record run of international clean sheets stretching to 10 matches. But at the other end of the pitch there is intrigue into how Tuchel will utilise all his attacking options.

There were just a handful of Serbia supporters in the away section at Wembley. The Serbia FA opted not to sell tickets to their supporters after recent crowd problems had led to hefty fines from UEFA.

Bellingham and Foden - benched with Tuchel favouring Morgan Rogers at No 10 - finally entered the fray after an hour. Foden, as a false nine, nodded a headed chance wide but made his mark late on, chipping a wonderful pass for an Eze shot to be tipped onto the bar before assisting his team-mate for England's second.

Bellingham, meanwhile, playing off Foden, buzzed like a player with a point to prove. There were a couple of exciting combinations with Reece James but ultimately the Real Madrid man became frustrated. If anything, this was another night in which Rogers once again showed why he is liked by Tuchel despite competition at No 10 from high-profile team-mates. It is a battle which will run right up until the World Cup.

England boss Thomas Tuchel: 

""We wanted to have quality and impact and new energy from the bench which we got. We created chances, half-chances and scored.

""We had some moments to defend until the very end, to defend our clean sheet. A special compliment to Jordan and the back four today. In the second half the pressing was not always right and we let Serbia escape. There was some intense output we had to give to get the clean sheet and win the game.

""It was a difficult match, a complicated match, we had to adapt and be flexible. Maybe throughout the match we lacked a little bit of precision with the last pass, otherwise we could have created more and scored earlier to be a bit more calm.

""But I liked it, it stayed intense and a tight match. We could see their quality. I'm happy about this test. It was a test. The attitude was right.""

Sky Sports' Sam Blitz at Wembley:

""So what did we learn there?

""England don't play with a striker. Harry Kane played like a deep midfielder. Phil Foden came on as a false nine. Lots of people called for a Danny Welbeck to support Kane, but do England even need that out-and-out No 9?

""Tuchel can change it mid-game. England were dire in the first 25 minutes. The England boss got the group in with a tactical time-out and suddenly the team was much, much better. Rice played higher. Rashford and Saka were more involved.

""Anderson looks the part. So many clever incisive balls from England's defensive midfielder. That No 6 role is his to lose, with Adam Wharton only given five minutes to impress.

""There's a race on at centre-back. Ezri Konsa looked good, with a couple of last-ditch challenges. Who out of him, John Stones and Marc Guehi fill the two spots?

""Nico O'Reilly looks the part too. The Man City left-back did not look out of place on England debut - he lasted the 90 minutes. Is that spot his to lose too?

""And Bellingham is still not at it. Still feeling his shoulder injury? Not up to speed? Short of confidence? Rogers looked better than him here.""

England's Phil Foden to ITV:

""So happy to be back in the squad. Great players and I'm enjoying it. I thought I did well, created a few chances and unlucky not to put a couple away. Overall, I have to be happy with the impact.""

On his role as striker: ""I'll play wherever the manager puts me. I can play multiple positions and I was happy to come on as a false nine. I enjoyed it. Maybe it will get the best out of me, only time will tell.

""There are quality players all over the pitch. I know there is pressure on me to perform at Man City and I just have to keep my head down and earn my place. The smile is back.""

The draw for the 2026 World Cup will take place in Washington on December 5.

President Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures.

Announcing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was ""the biggest event in sports"", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like ""104 Super Bowls"".

The draw will take place from 12pm local time (5pm UK time).

The 2026 FIFA Men's World Cup takes place from June 11 to July 19, 2026.

It will be the 23rd edition of the tournament.

As football's global governing body, FIFA, gears up for its largest-ever World Cup in 2026, it has enlisted technology giant Lenovo as its official partner to manage the operational and digital demands of the tournament.

In a recent media briefing, executives from both organisations outlined the scope of the partnership, which aims to leverage advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), to enhance the experience for teams, broadcasters, and the estimated six billion fans who will tune in.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup, hosted across the US, Mexico, and Canada, is set to be an event of unprecedented scale, featuring a record 48 teams, 104 games, and 16 host cities. Running such a massive event requires a robust technology backbone, a role which Lenovo is well-positioned to fill, said FIFA technology director Nacho Fresco.

“We need a partner who is able to deliver fast, because in a World Cup football match, we cannot wait for just one minute,” Fresco said, adding that Lenovo's innovative and entrepreneurial spirit, as well as high-quality standards, helped to seal the deal.

For Lenovo, its work with FIFA will allow it to showcase its full breadth of capabilities beyond its reputation as a major PC maker. Besides supplying laptops, tablets, and Motorola smartphones used by officials to run the games, the company will also provide servers, storage, and edge infrastructure to power systems like the Hawk-Eye video assistant referee used by FIFA referees to make pitch decisions.

Jeff Shafer, Lenovo's senior vice-president of corporate marketing, said the World Cup is also an opportunity for the company to transform itself into an AI powerhouse. “The reality is that if we can do it for FIFA, F1 and the Olympics, then we know we can do it for anybody out there, from consumers to the biggest companies in the world.”

Art Hu, Lenovo's chief information officer, concurred, noting that the partnership is in line with its transition to a services-led, AI-first company in a hybrid world, focusing on developing custom capabilities for use cases where out-of-the-box solutions do not exist.

For example, Hu said tablets will be deployed to not only help VIP guests such as government leaders get seated, but also provide them with access to content, such as game snippets and match statistics, delivering a high-touch experience for a targeted set of users.

While AI-powered services and applications for players, coaches, broadcasters and fans are being saved for a major reveal at the CES technology show in Las Vegas in January 2026, Shafer said “if we can use AI to deliver something of value to each one of those groups, we'd have achieved our goal.”

Santiago Manso, Lenovo's director for sports vertical, added that the robustness of the systems and infrastructure used to support World Cup games can be replicated in other fields, such as nuclear power, smart energy grids, and military defence – all of which require high resiliency.

In the run-up to World Cup 2026, Lenovo had the opportunity to apply its capabilities during the FIFA Club World Cup this past summer, where it helped implement semi-automated offside technology, leading to faster and more accurate offside calls that reduced game delays. “That benefits the players, broadcasters and fans, and it makes the game better,” Shafer said.

When asked by Computer Weekly about what's being done to secure the high-profile tournament – a prime target for disruption – against cyber threats, Manso said Lenovo is incorporating security into all its devices and services from the design stage, he said, adding that the company is also working with FIFA and governments in host countries to incorporate multiple layers of security.

Ultimately, both organisations see the partnership as a legacy-defining project. “We are going to have the most technologically advanced FIFA World Cup,” Fresco said, adding that the work done for the men's World Cup will extend to future tournaments, including the Women's World Cup in 2027.

France have joined England in booking their place at the 2026 FIFA World Cup finals. Get the lowdown on all the sides from the continent who will be in action next summer. 

There are a total of 16 UEFA berths available at the 48-team 2026 FIFA World Cup, with the 12 qualifying group winners assured of a final tournament place along with the four eventual play-off winners.

After topping Groups K and D respectively, England and France have become the first two European teams to confirm their place at the finals, which run from 11 June to 19 July 2026 across Canada, Mexico and the United States.

UEFA.com keeps track of the qualifiers as they are confirmed and runs the rule over the European contenders.

How does qualification work?

In total, 16 UEFA nations will qualify for the 2026 World Cup. The 12 group winners qualify directly for the World Cup; the four remaining berths are determined by play-offs involving the 12 group runners-up, along with the four best-ranked group winners of the 2024/25 UEFA Nations League that did not finish their European Qualifiers group stage in first or second place.

ENGLAND

How they qualified: Group K winnersBest World Cup performance: Winners (1966)Most recent appearance: 2022 (quarter-finals)

The UEFA EURO 2024 runners-up began a new era when Thomas Tuchel replaced Gareth Southgate after that showpiece defeat by Spain in Berlin and the German coach has certainly made his mark. England secured qualification with a perfect 18 points from their opening six games, scoring 18 goals and conceding none. The talismanic Harry Kane continues to lead the line but the supporting cast has grown ever deeper, with the likes of Anthony Gordon and Elliot Anderson particularly impressive.

FRANCE

How they qualified: Group D winnersBest World Cup performance: Winners (1998, 2018)Most recent appearance: 2022 (runners-up)

Les Bleus will be aiming to reach a third World Cup final in a row after topping Group D to secure an eighth consecutive qualification. With an outrageously talented squad led by star striker Kylian Mbappé, Didier Deschamps' side will no doubt be considered one of the favourites to go all the way again in North America.

Play-offs via the Nations League

The 12 group runners-up will participate in the play-offs, along with the four best-ranked group winners of the 2024/25 UEFA Nations League that did not finish their European Qualifiers group stage in first or second place.

Nations League path A group winners: Spain, Germany, Portugal, France

Path B group winners: England, Norway, Wales, Czechia

Path C group winners: Romania, Sweden, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland

Path D group winners: Moldova, San Marino

MLS announced a landmark decision by switching to a fall-spring calendar, and the benefits are obvious, but there are some valid challenges the league needs to navigate through

Focus really hard, and you could almost see the relief in Don Garber as he announced the news. MLS has done the one thing it really should have done for years, and he knew it. There has been talk, stretching back to last January, that an official switch to a fall-spring calendar in North America's professional soccer setup was imminent. For a while, there were just whispers and suggestions. It was reportedly brought up at countless board meetings. It received cautious public backing from coaches. 

And, more broadly, anyone who consumed the league, followed its transfers, or even turned on Apple from time to time knew it was probably the sensible idea.

After some previous challenges, MLS, at long last, has a fall-spring calendar. The league has confirmed it. The basics are as expected. Starting in 2027, games will run from late July to early May. There will be a break in the winter. Transfer windows will align with the rest of the world. There will be no more playing through international breaks. On the face of it, this seems like the day when a still-growing, but at times conservative, league finally decided to take a bold swing. 

At the same time, there are clear caveats. Existing player contracts will need to be reworked, and the league will now find itself competing more directly with other major U.S. sports during the heart of its season. There's also value in tradition - even if MLS's calendar has always been unconventional. So while this move feels logical and long overdue, it won't be without complications.

MLS 3.0 may be underway, but its success is far from guaranteed.

MLS has been inching toward this for years, and there was a growing sense that the shift was inevitable. This is a league in a constant state of evolution, and the move brings it into the modern era in a more convincing way. In truth, MLS delayed the change longer than it wanted to, Commissioner Don Garber admitted at a news conference.

""We would rather take our time and get it right than be fast and get it wrong,"" Garber said. 

The general idea here is to capitalize on the momentum brought about by the 2026 World Cup. The tournament is considered - and rightly so - a landmark event in the scope of the game in North America. Now is the perfect opportunity, if not excuse, for MLS to make significant changes in earnest. And what better way to convince people that MLS is legitimate than to do so around a World Cup? If this is the expression of the American game in club form, it should surely be linked to the biggest global event that soccer offers. 

There have been extensive discussions, though, to make sure that the change is made in the right way. The league surveyed fans and other relevant parties, it said in a release, about their relative interest in a Fall-Spring calendar. Ninety-two percent of respondents supported a change to align with the European game. Discussions first started in earnest in October 2023. Just over two years later, rumor has become reality. 

On the face of it, primarily, removing all of the noise, this is advantageous for MLS. Some would meet it with a shrug and a ""duh."" MLS, by working on a different schedule, is out of touch with the European world that it is so often compared to. On the face of things, this is a move toward legitimacy. Want to take us seriously? Well, here's a calendar to show you that we're for real. 

But the most obvious benefit is the way the league functions in the global soccer sphere. For so long, transfer windows have been so awkward to figure out. MLS's primary window runs from January to April. Its secondary one stretches from July to August. That has proven to be a roadblock on two fronts. Primarily, it has made player acquisition harder, with the league forced to go after those who have either already begun their seasons at their club or are looking for a move halfway through. It's a pain in terms of recruitment. Even more difficult, though, is the midseason window where MLS teams can so often lose their best players. That July to August window has been a deadly thing for some sides, who have to kiss top talents goodbye when a good offer comes in. 

""It allows us to be aligned with the international transfer windows, which we think is incredibly important. It gives us a wide variety of opportunities that will expand our ability to be on this path, to be one of the top and leading leagues in the world,"" Garber said.

The shift won't entirely change the fact that MLS teams will lose good footballers here and there. But they can also use those windows to sign new ones, or plan ahead properly. What can happen here, then, is the fleshing out of a proper global transfer infrastructure, where players come and go - and spending can be maximized (albeit with the caveat of complicated salary cap rules). There could be more transfers like LAFC's blockbuster move for Son Heung-Min as a result. 

There is further good news to be found in the fact that the calendar now aligns with FIFA international windows. There are a number of instances during the season where clubs lose significant chunks of their roster due to national team commitments - and still have to worry about regular season games with significant implications. That is no longer a problem.  

Yet there are surely some losers. The main group, immediately, might just be the players. A switch to a fall-spring calendar would undoubtedly complicate contract negotiations. Under current MLS rules, deals expire in December. There will, surely, be some contracts to renegotiate. Garber was asked, in fact, how much of a say the players had in the decision, and his response was vague.

""I'm sure there will be a time soon that we'll be able to, collectively with the MLSPA, have a discussion, and we can talk about all those details,"" Garber said. 

There are also some questions to be asked about timing. To be sure, a break from mid-December to early February - similar to the setup currently offered by the Bundesliga - will save some fans in cold climates. But Minnesota, Chicago, and New England in early December, or even November, might not be all that pleasant. 

There are broader questions to be asked, too, about fan attendance in general. The league very proudly announced that it welcomed over 14 million fans in the regular season alone into stadiums on matchdays. Will the march to the stadium remain the same in the dark and the cold, rather than an agreeable summer evening? These are things that simply cannot be prepared for. 

And then there are the minutea: sponsorships, season tickets, day-to-day operations for teams. Those remain unknown. 

""The bottom line is this change has been approved because we think it will, overall, raise the awareness, therefore the engagement with our teams, and therefore make them more valuable to the corporate community and to their fans,"" Garber said.

But perhaps the biggest question, writ large, is how this all fits in to the rest of the North American sports calendar. Currently, the MLS season runs from February to early December. The playoffs and MLS Cup clash directly with the middle of the NFL season, the World Series, crucial college football games, and the start of the NBA season. This is not the best time of year to get eyes on your hallmark event.

A shift to a May MLS Cup, then, would seem to alleviate some of those fears. NFL and college football will be over. The start of the MLB season is hardly gripping stuff. And falling right before the NBA finals seems a good deal. MLS is happy where they will fit in the calendar under a new system, Nelson Rodriguez, EVP of MLS said Thursday.

""We think this sets us up to showcase ourselves in a much better form. The competition will always be there, whether it's gridiron, hoops, or sticks and balls,"" Rodriguez said.

Still, there are questions to be asked. The middle of the season will then clash directly with the biggest games in the NFL and College Football Playoff (which is now approximately 36 teams large). And whatever eyes MLS might have been able to capitalize on during the club soccer offseason are now fixated elsewhere. The theory that MLS is an alternative to boredom when Europe's top leagues aren't active will now fall apart. 

There will also be the question of how the 2027 season fits into the new calendar. The 2026 campaign is still set to conclude in December, and MLS can't simply pause for seven months. The league's current solution is a 14-game “sprint season” running from February through May 2027, before the new full season begins in mid- to late July.

Another challenge is the six-week gap between seasons. That break will require significant adjustment from clubs, but it also provides flexibility as MLS navigates the transition. The league acknowledged Thursday that the gap could be filled with additional fixtures - potentially Leagues Cup or U.S. Open Cup games.

“We will consider anything, and we will look at whether it's Leagues Cup, some other competition, or some centralized training for all our teams, as we've done in the past during preseason,” Rodriguez said.

While the league pushed through a major structural change, several other ideas remain on the back burner. Reports that MLS owners were weighing a move to a single-division format did not materialize yet, and long-standing concerns around roster rules and the salary cap - an area Lionel Messi recently pointed to as needing growth - as well as playoff design, were left untouched. Garber indicated that more adjustments are coming, but for now this remains the lone change, albeit a historic one.

More broadly, the shift marks a meaningful course correction. MLS has long operated on its own rhythm, a model that has delivered growth, star power and record fan engagement. But aligning more closely with the global game was inevitable. Even with the complications ahead, the league's decision feels both pragmatic and overdue.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Karim Benzema has fiercely defended actress Lyna Khoudri, his partner, against a far-right activist who criticised her participation in a tribute to the victims of the November 13, 2015 terrorist attack. The Al-Ittihad striker fired back on social media, dismissing the activist as ""just an extra in our world"" for mistaking the solemn ceremony for a staged performance.

Benzema has publicly confronted a far-right activist who launched an attack on his partner, actress Khoudri, following her involvement in a solemn tribute to the victims of the attacks in France. Khoudri participated in a commemoration on TF1, reading Charlotte Delbo's poem ""Prayer to the Living to Forgive Them for Being Alive,"" marking the 10th anniversary of the tragic events outside the Stade de France.

Activist Damien Rieu criticised Khoudri due to her previous alleged actions and her connection to Benzema. Rieu posted on social media: ""To honour the victims of November 13, they could find no one other than Lyna Khoudri, partner of @Benzema, who liked a post justifying the beheading of Samuel Paty (and who lost her lawsuit against me when I denounced it).""

Benzema swiftly responded to Rieu on his own account, defending Khoudri and condemning the activist's remarks. ""There are those who pay their respects, and those who put themselves on display... You have to be incredibly shallow to mistake a tribute for a staged performance, Damien. You're just an extra in our world,"" the former French international declared. This strong rebuke highlights Benzema's readiness to protect his partner and address what he perceives as a cynical attempt to politicise a moment of remembrance.

The tribute marked a poignant anniversary for France, recalling the coordinated terrorist attacks that occurred on November 13, 2015. These attacks, which included bombings outside the Stade de France during a France-Germany football match, claimed 130 lives and injured hundreds more. The stadium, where the French national team faced Ukraine on the day of the anniversary, holds particular significance as one of the attack sites.

Khoudri's participation in the tribute involved reading a powerful poem, a common form of remembrance and a way to honour those lost. Benzema's reaction underscores his belief that such a solemn occasion should be respected and not used as a platform for personal or political attacks. His statement implies a clear distinction between genuine acts of remembrance and what he views as superficial displays of criticism.

While engaging in this off-field defence, Benzema is also navigating a challenging period in his professional career with Al-Ittihad in the Saudi Pro League. The reigning champions have experienced a difficult start to the season, currently sitting in eighth place after 11 matches, having already suffered three defeats.

Benzema, 37, who joined Al-Ittihad on a contract until June 30, 2026, has been a central figure for the club, serving as team captain. However, his performances have recently come under scrutiny. Following Al-Ittihad's 1-0 defeat to Al-Ahli in the Western Derby, former Al-Ittihad defender Rashed Al-Raheeb publicly criticised the foreign players, specifically targeting Benzema.

In an interview with Al-Riyadiya, Al-Raheeb stated: ""The Frenchman Karim Benzema, the team captain, was absent from the match and did nothing, as was his compatriot Moussa Diaby, who was not at his usual level. Meanwhile, Al-Ahli's foreign players shone and dominated for the full 90 minutes."" He also questioned coach Sergio Conceicao's decision to keep Benzema on the pitch despite his ""modest level."" This criticism highlights the pressure on Benzema to deliver consistent performances for his new club.

Al-Ittihad's current form shows a mixed bag, with a recent 3-0 win against Sharjah followed by a 4-4 draw with Khaleej, and the 1-0 loss to Al-Ahli. Benzema's personal statistics show a career with 345 goals and 84 assists in 635 club appearances, including a highly decorated tenure at Real Madrid where he won numerous titles, including five Champions League crowns and four La Liga titles.

Benzema and Al-Ittihad face a demanding schedule, with an upcoming match against Al-Riyadh on November 21, followed by a Champions League fixture against Al Duhail on November 24. These matches will be crucial for Al-Ittihad to improve their league position and progress in continental competition.

The latest incident, while unrelated to his on-field performance, further highlights the level of attention and expectation placed upon the veteran striker, both in his professional and personal life, particularly within the context of French public debate and the Saudi Pro League's global ambitions.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Can Graham Potter revive Alexander Isak, Viktor Gyokeres and Sweden's £235m forward line in time to earn World Cup 2026 qualification?","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/graham-potter-revive-alexander-isak-viktor-gyokeres-sweden-235m-forward-line-earn-world-cup-2026-qualification/blt8205bf023909efda","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 08:00:00 GMT","

This time last year, Sweden seemed to be on the rise again. A side that had failed to qualify for both the 2022 World Cup and Euro 2024 was flying under Jon Dahl Tomasson, with Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyokeres scoring freely in a refreshingly attack-minded line-up. However, the country's first-ever foreign manager has since become the first coach in Sweden's history to be relieved of his duties before the expiration of his contract.

The nation's football federation (SvFF) felt they had no option but to act, though, as the atmosphere around - and allegedly within - Dahl Tomasson's team had turned toxic, resulting in the ""Danish bast*rd"" being dismissed before the 2026 World Cup qualification campaign had even concluded.

Intriguingly, Sweden have now turned to another foreign coach to resurrect their hopes of securing a spot at next summer's tournament in North America, with Englishman Graham Potter taking over less than a month after being fired by West Ham.

So, where did it all go wrong for Dahl Tomasson? And is Potter really the right man to get the best out of a side blessed with a forward line worth £235 million ($310m) that is presently struggling to score goals and suffering from a collective crisis of confidence?

It felt like the Swedish national team had hit rock bottom after missing out on Euro 2024. Not since 1996 had they failed to reach the finals - but, on this occasion, they hadn't even gone close. Sweden won just three of their qualifying games and finished nine points adrift of second-placed Austria, and 10 behind group winners Belgium.

Given Sweden had also been eliminated in the play-offs for Qatar 2022 by Poland, the SvFF unsurprisingly felt it was time to bring an end to Janne Andersson's seven-year spell as coach. They also brought in Kim Kallstrom as their new director of football and the retired midfielder, who made 131 appearances for Sweden (and four for Arsenal!), was immediately charged with finding a worthy successor to Andersson.

""That is the No.1 priority,"" Kallstrom said on December 6, 2023. ""But I think we need to take our time. We need to analyse a little bit where we are, why we are there, where we want to go, how we can get there, and who the people are who are going to implement all that.""

Kallstrom ultimately decided that the man to turn the national team around was Dahl Tomasson, the ex-Denmark forward who had just parted company with Blackburn Rovers by 'mutual consent' after a run of eight Championship games without a win.

Tomasson lost three of his first four games in charge - including a 2-1 defeat in his native Denmark - but they were all friendlies. When the competitive action began in September 2024, Sweden suddenly caught fire - and Tomasson's daring decision to move away from the national team's tried-and-trusted 4-4-2 appeared to be the main reason why.

There were plenty of pundits who argued that Isak and Gyokeres couldn't play together; that they were too similar. However, the pair contributed a combined 12 goals in the four Nations League games they played alongside one another at the apex of Tomasson's bold 3-4-1-2 formation.

""Some observers have called it a revolution but, first and foremost, I see my goal as a reversal of bad results by building a new style and a new team,"" the former Malmo coach told Bold.dk. Tomasson acknowledged, though, that not everyone was convinced by his adventurous approach, primarily due to the standard of Sweden's opponents in their Nations League C group (Slovakia, Estonia and Azerbaijan).

""I find that there are still people who are sceptical about whether we can play so offensively against better nations,"" he said, ""but while we play offensively, we do not do so naively.""

However, when Tomasson's tactics were truly tested for the first time in World Cup qualifying, the results were dire. 

Even though Isak wasn't match fit for Sweden's opening qualifier against Slovenia on September 5 due to his professionally successful but physically detrimental summer strike, the Scandinavians should have kicked off their campaign with a win in Ljubljana. However, despite twice taking the lead - first through Anthony Elanga and then Yasin Ayari - they threw away two points in the final minute of normal time because of a goalkeeping error from Robin Olsen. 

Even worse was to follow three days later, with the Swedes slumping to a disastrous 2-0 defeat in Kosovo. By that stage, faith in the manager was already wavering. There were still four matchdays remaining, but the feeling in the media was that their hopes of automatic qualification were already over after losing to a team ranked 95th in the world at the time.

Former winger Freddie Ljungberg called the performance against Kosovo ""appalling"", Expressen labelled it ""a betrayal"", while Goteborgs-Posten argued, ""The uphill struggle is so steep now that it's impossible to see how a Swedish national team under Jon Dahl Tomasson will be able to regain the confidence they have failed to instil over the past year and a half.""

Unfortunately for the under-fire coach, the increasingly sceptical Swedish press would be proven correct.

To have any real chance of pipping Switzerland to top spot in UEFA Group B, Sweden simply had to beat Murat Yakin's men in Solna on October 10. However, despite being able to once again pair a fully-fit Isak with Gyokeres from the first minute while Elanga made do with a place on the bench, the hosts failed to register a single shot on target in an embarrassingly meek 2-0 loss.

Unsurprisingly, Tomasson's toothless team were booed from the field, as the infamous 'JDT Out, Danish bast*rd' banner was unfurled in the stands. ""That was terrible,"" defender Emil Holm told Aftonbaldet. ""There should be no such thing. I understand that people are disappointed, but I find writing things like that to be the lowest of the low.""

As for Tomasson, he reacted with admirable diplomacy to his nationality being brought into the argument in such classless fashion, while at the same time trying desperately to talk up Sweden's hopes of keeping their World Cup dream alive.

""I understand the fans, they want results and wins,"" he told reporters. ""Football is emotion. The fans are worried - we have to deal with that, because that result was a slap in the face. But we haven't been eliminated yet. I believe that we can make it to the World Cup with this team.""

However, the following Monday, Sweden would be once again beaten by Kosovo, this time losing 1-0 in Gothenburg, meaning even a second-place finish was now beyond them. Sweden were clearly ""completely broken"", as retired defender Jonas Olsson put it on Viaplay, and the FA promptly turned to Potter to fix the national team.

Potter's appointment as Dahl Tomasson's successor surprised a lot of Premier League followers, given he'd been fired from his two previous jobs, with Chelsea and West Ham. ""He has won the lottery with the Sweden job,"" former Manchester United striker Dwight Yorke told Snabbare.

""After the way it ended for him at West Ham, to have probably the two biggest names in British football in terms of the summer transfer window in Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyokeres, that doesn't happen very often. It all happened so quickly too, but I think Potter was just in the right place at the right time and sometimes that's all that is required. I won't say it was just luck but you talk sometimes about getting the break you need. Well, he's got it, and it all depends on what he's going to do with it now.""

It's certainly an excellent opportunity for Potter to go some way towards restoring a once-stellar reputation - and his ties to Sweden should certainly help. The 50-year-old is obviously best known for the aesthetically pleasing team he built at Brighton. However, it was in Sweden that he forged his reputation as one of England's most promising young coaches, with the former York City left-back taking Ostersunds from the fourth tier to the top-flight during a remarkable seven-year stint as manager that also featured a Swedish Cup triumph and a famous Europa League win over Arsene Wenger's Arsenal at the Emirates. 

Consequently, the appointment of such a high-profile coach was considered quite the coup in Sweden - particularly as Potter had made it very clear beforehand that he was willing to accept a relatively small salary because he was so excited by the challenge.

""That's normally the issue when the Swedish FA are due to appoint a manager,"" ex-West Brom centre-back Olsson told Sky Sports, ""as the wage isn't the highest, so they can't really go for the biggest names. But Potter's link with Swedish football is big because of what he did at Ostersunds, and also because of his coaching staff - his assistant Bjorn Hamberg has been with him at Brighton and Chelsea.

""Swedish supporters kind of see him as one of their own, so it was an easy appointment to sell and, in terms of getting the balance right, his leadership qualities show he can create a sense of harmony in a good group of players.""

Chelsea and West Ham supporters (and maybe even some players) would obviously take issue with Olsson's positive appraisal of Potter's leadership qualities - he was allegedly dismissed as a 'yes man' by some squad members at Stamford Bridge and derogatorily referred to as 'Harry' or 'Hogwarts'. However, simply speaking the local language in his first press conference as Sweden boss enabled Potter to make a far more positive first impression than Tomasson, who only ever engaged with the press in English.

""It's a big honour for me to be here. I'm very proud,"" he said. ""I understand Swedish football well, and I just think, as the national team head coach, it's important to at least try [to speak the language]. I wouldn't say I'm already back up to speed, to be honest - obviously it's been a long time since I spoke Swedish, and I wasn't particularly fluent when I left. So, it's been a bit of a mix of upskilling myself, while at the same time watching games and watching players, and making sure that we get a team and a group now that we can go forward with.""

It's hardly an ideal situation, of course. Potter is taking over a team low on confidence in the middle of a qualification campaign. Still, the mere fact that Tomasson has been dismissed should lift the spirits of players like Elanga, who reportedly had issues with the Dane's ""damned system"". Captain Victor Lindelof was also put in an awkward position by Tomasson's public falling-out with goalkeeper Olsen, who vowed never to play for the coach again after being dropped for last month's game against the Swiss.

Funnily enough, Sweden already being out of the running for automatic qualification is also a plus for Potter. The only way they can now make it to the World Cup is through the play-offs - which the Scandinavians are almost certain to make due to them topping their Nations League group. As a result, Potter's first two games, against Switzerland and Slovenia, are effectively free hits, opportunities for him to prepare for the knockout games in March that will decide whether Sweden go to the World Cup, and whether the manager's short-term contract is extended.

The problem, though, is that Gyokeres is presently unavailable through injury, while Isak hasn't played a minute of competitive football for Liverpool since October 22, meaning there will unquestionably be a limit on how much game time the British-record signing can be afforded. In that context, it may well be difficult for Potter to get Sweden firing again - at least initially. As Tomasson lamented before his dismissal, ""We have forgotten how to score goals and I don't know why.""

Potter basically has two games and five months to come up with an answer. If he doesn't, the Swedish FA will be left counting the considerable cost of failing to qualify for a second successive World Cup - despite being in possession of two of the most valuable strikers in the game today.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Cavan Sullivan's form, Mathis Albert's rise and the five key takeaways for the U.S. U17s ahead of World Cup knockouts","https://www.goal.com/en-qa/lists/cavan-sullivan-s-form-mathis-albert-s-rise-and-the-five-key-takeaways-for-the-u-s-u17s-ahead-of-world-cup-knockouts/blt3da32b3d9bfd2886","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 02:49:09 GMT","

From Cavan Sullivan exceeding expectations to a quietly solid back line, GOAL breaks down five key takeaways on the U.S. U17s ahead of their World Cup clash with Morocco.

The U17 World Cup feels important for the U.S. This is a breeding ground of talent, yes, but also a true barometer of where the country's talent pool stands. And, in theory, the U.S. has a pretty good one. Cavan Sullivan is the headliner, of course, but in Mathis Albert, Chase Adams, and Julian Hall, there are enough good footballers here to suggest that they could make a run. 

The group stage only reinforced that notion. Gonzalo Segares' side hasn't exactly blown anyone away, but they have been remarkably composed. The Americans have conceded just once, and looked mightily resolute at the back. Going forward, they have been carried by individuals, but also created chances in spades. Sullivan is finding form, while Albert has enjoyed some promising moments of his own.

Piece it all together, and this is a side well-equipped to continue to win. It isn't a kind matchup on Friday. Morocco are a good team, who are certainly better than their 1-2 record in the group stage that saw them squeak into the round of 32. GOAL looks at the major takeaways from the tournament so far, and evaluates the Americans ahead of their round of 32 matchup...

This felt like a big tournament for Sullivan. The hype around the Philadelphia Union product was immense just a year ago. But since then, his star has faded a little. His MLS minutes were few, and his only start came in the U.S. Open Cup. This future Man City player was largely playing in MLS Next Pro. 

The U17 World Cup, then, felt significant. Sullivan needed to perform here, if only to show that he still has that bit of quality to show that he can still make a difference for club and country. And he has shown up in style. Sullivan came off the bench in the U.S.'s opening game against Burkina Faso, complete with a new haircut and a brash attitude about him. His impact was almost immediate. The U.S. were struggling, and the Union product offered the piece of magic necessary to pick up a result. Sullivan responded with a Panenka penalty to give them a 1-0 win. 

He was even better in the second game, making an impact from the start. He began the game in a deeper role, but was an active presence throughout, scoring one and assisting another as the U.S. beat Tajikistan, 2-1. He had two good efforts at goal against Czechia, in the game after, and was unfortunate not to find the net as the U.S. managed a 1-0 win. Early days, but the signs are good.

If Sullivan is the known quantity of the U.S., then Albert is the wildcard. Sure, he has already made some noise at Dortmund, but he remains a raw playmaker, the kind of kid to get excited about - but not place expectations on. Some who have worked with him extensively insist that he, not Sullivan, is the best player in his age group. That may or may not be true, but the reality remains: Albert should perform here. 

And his efforts to do so started pretty poorly. He watched from the bench while Sullivan bagged the winner in the first game. He was much better in the second, scoring off a Sullivan assist. And then, he made the difference in the third, bursting into the box before providing a lovely curved finish around a helpless goalkeeper. It was a moment that showed how good this U.S. side can be, full of athleticism and movement - capped off with a deadly final touch.  

And how about at the other end? Sure, the U.S. has attacking quality in spades, and can match up player-for-player with pretty much anyone outside the absolute elite. Still, their defensive showings have been even better. There is the caveat that they have yet to face an attacking force, but the unit looks pretty good at the moment. The raw numbers are good: one goal conceded, 10 shots on target allowed across three games. 

But there's more to it than that. The U.S. have had the majority of the ball in two of their three games thus far, while captain Christopher Cupps, the six-foot-three center back, who featured for Chicago Fire II last year, has been excellent as a one-on-one defender. Sure, there will be tougher challenges to come, but thus far, the Americans have looked wonderful defensively. That will absolutely have to continue in the knockouts.

A word, too, for the numbers. The U17 World Cup has, historically, been a tricky stage for the Americans. Their best performance remains fourth place in 1999. They haven't made the last eight since 2017, and were bounced in the last 16 in 2023 (although they ran into an excellent Germany side). 

Still, they have made everything look remarkably easy thus far, and are the second U.S. side in history to win all three group games at the competition. The last time that happened was 1991 - before the real advent of the U.S. as a soccer power.

There is one issue, ahead of the U.S.'s Round of 32 matchup with Morocco: their opponents have beaten them at pretty much every level in recent years. It started in 2024, when the Atlas Lions emphatically bounced the U.S., 4-0, in the Paris Olympics quarter final. Last month, they beat the U20s, 3-1, at the same stage of the World Cup. More broadly, the U.S. has struggled against African teams historically, with a 5-8-1 record against sides from the African football federation. 

Yet this iteration of Morocco is a little different. They have admittedly struggled at the U17 World Cup, squeaking through their group with just three points after losing to Portugal and Japan, before battering New Caledonia. Their eight goals conceded certainly offer hope for the Americans against a bit of a bogey opponent for the Americans.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Said El Mala: Why Germany boss Julian Nagelsmann has called up teenage Koln sensation wanted by both Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/said-el-mala-germany-call-up-teenage-koln-sensation-wanted-bayern-munich-borussia-dortmund/blt269b916f30b65b1a","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Florian Wirtz's £100 million ($130m) move from Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool didn't just upset Bayern Munich. It also hit hard at Koln. After all, Wirtz had come through their academy only to leave for Leverkusen in the summer of 2020 - and for a paltry €300,000 (£265,000/$350,000). Koln were furious. They felt Leverkusen had broken a 'gentleman's agreement' by signing one of the most exciting young players they'd ever produced - but there was nothing they could do about it. Wirtz's contract was expiring and he wanted to leave.

However, while Koln may have missed out on a massive transfer fee with Wirtz, it looks like they're going to make a colossal profit on the €350,000 (£310,000/$405,000) they invested in another potential superstar. Indeed, Said El Mala has just received his first Germany call-up after taking the Bundesliga by storm this season, and has already attracted the attention of both Bayern and Borussia Dortmund, as well as a string of top clubs across the continent.

So, who is Koln's new teenage sensation? And how long might it be before one of Europe's elite pays big money to sign him? GOAL breaks it all down below...

El Mala was born and raised in Krefeld in western Germany. Both he and his brother Malek - who is one year older than Said and also on Koln's books - got their love of the game from their Lebanese father Mohammed, who played as a centre-back for local side Linner SV. El Mala briefly followed in his father's footsteps before joining Malek at Borussia Monchengladbach in 2017. However, he was released three years later.

""Said was still very small back then, making him extremely inferior athletically to his opponents and not competitive at that level,"" El Mala's former coach at the Gladbach Under-15s, Sven Schuchardt, told Bild. ""Some boys simply need a little more time to develop.""

El Mala was nonetheless devastated by the rejection. ""It wasn't easy to process,"" he later admitted in an interview with Radio Koln. ""Everything turning around, just like that. As a 14-year-old, you ask yourself: What did I do wrong?""

He even considered quitting the game and was only convinced to continue by Malek. The two brothers would ultimately reunite at TSV Meerbusch and then again at Viktoria Koln, where they excelled in the same Under-19s team. 

El Mala's impressive performances at youth level led to him making his senior debut in a third-tier clash with FC Saarbrucken on February 21, 2004 - just two days after signing his first professional contract with Viktoria. However, just four months later, he was snapped up by Viktoria's city rivals Koln. Crucially, Koln were unable to register new players at the time, so in order to get a deal done for the in-demand youngster as quickly as possible, they agreed to immediately loan El Mala back to Viktoria for the 2024-25 campaign.

It proved a pivotal moment in his development, as the winger benefited enormously from regular game time at a lower level. He scored 13 times in 32 appearances across his first full season in the professional ranks, resulting in him being awarded the 3. Liga's Newcomer of the Season award, and then shone for Germany's U19s during their summer run to the semi-finals of the European Championship, with four goals and three assists.

Consequently, El Mala belatedly arrived at Koln brimming with belief. 

Despite El Mala marking himself out as one of Germany's most promising prospects over the previous year, Koln coach Lukas Kwasniok was reluctant to place too much pressure upon the teenager's shoulders and decided to carefully manage his game time. Consequently, El Mala has been employed primarily as an impact sub in 2025-26 - but to devastating effect. The attacker has already racked up four goals and two assists in this season's Bundesliga, even though he's only started three times. 

Julian Nagelsmann also felt that he'd seen enough of El Mala to warrant inclusion in his squad for this week's crucial World Cup qualifiers against Luxembourg and Slovakia.

""Said should get the chance to show his carefree and easy-going style of play,"" the Germany boss told reporters. ""We keep an eye on our U21 players and always want to give them the chance to feature for the senior national team.""

As for El Mala, he was taken aback by his rapid promotion to Germany's senior squad and revealed that he had initially ignored Nagelsmann's call.

""I was at home when it arrived but I don't like answering unknown numbers,"" the teenager revealed to Sky Germany. ""Then, he sent me a message saying, 'Hi, this is Julian Nagelsmann, please call me back!' I immediately showed the message to my brother and that's when I realised, 'I guess I'm in!' But you can't take it all in during one week. It takes a bit longer. But I'm incredibly excited for the game [against Luxembourg on Friday], and I can enjoy whatever comes after that.""

In Germany, El Mala is considered something of a throwback, the kind of old-school street-footballer that one rarely sees anymore.

He's a refreshingly direct dribbler. His first thought always seems to be to take on his man - which makes sense, as he's blessed with wonderful close control and a blistering turn of pace, meaning he's a nightmare for full-backs in one-v-one situations.

He's also got one hell of a strike on him. Time and time again this season, we've seen him come off the left flank and cut in onto his favoured right foot before unleashing fearsome shots on goal.

Luckily for El Mala, size is no longer an issue. During this time at Meerbusch, he had a massive growth spurt and now stands at 6'2"". However, while he's no longer lacking physical strength, El Mala does still need to work on the defensive side of his game. Kwasniok even hauled him off at half-time in Koln's 3-1 loss at Gladbach just before the international break because he wasn't happy with his work off the ball.

""He simply didn't perform quite as well in certain challenges as we would have liked,"" the Pole explained. ""I evaluate his performance like I do with all the other players, and it wasn't quite up to par in the first 45 minutes. That's why I substituted him.""

Koln sporting director Thomas Kessler was quick to point out that such setbacks were ""perfectly normal"" for such an inexperienced player: ""He's a young guy. We emphasise that week after week, even if people don't like to hear it. But El Mala is still developing.""

As a left winger with an eye for goal who's made his breakthrough at Koln, El Mala has rather inevitably been compared with Lukas Podolski.  'Prince Poldi' has admitted that El Mala reminds him ""a little bit"" of himself and says that he's a huge fan of 'El Maladona', who has has quickly become a fan favourite at Koln as much for his ""great character"" as his fancy footwork.

""He just goes for it, and he gets things done,"" enthused Podolski, who scored 49 times for Germany and represented the likes of Bayern, Arsenal and Inter after starting out in Cologne. ""He's on the move."" And that could well be the case soon enough.

There's no guarantee that El Mala will make his international bow in the coming days, given Germany's bid to qualify for the World Cup is set to go right to the wire. Even if they win in Luxembourg on Friday, top spot in Group A will only be decided after Monday's meeting with second-placed Slovakia at the Red Bull Arena. However, El Mala has clearly got a chance of making the squad for next summer's World Cup, because Nagelsmann is certain that the Koln ace is destined to become a ""top player"".

It's a view shared by several suitors. Brighton actually tried to sign El Mala during the summer but their €20m (£18m/$23m) bid was rejected by Koln, who were convinced that his value was only going to rise this season and thus extended his contract - and that of his brother Malek - in July.

It was a brilliant bit of business on Koln's part because, according to the latest reports, Kessler & Co. now believe El Mala is worth at least three times the Brighton bid after playing such a thrilling role in the newly-promoted club making a surprisingly strong start to the season (Koln are currently ninth in the Bundesliga).

Even Kwasniok, who is trying to manage expectations around El Mala, is in no doubt that Koln's new hero will eventually leave for ""an incredibly high fee"".

""We are proud that the club signed him at the right moment,"" the manager said. ""We know that he probably won't be playing here for the next 15 years - and that's okay. But I have the feeling that he currently holds FC Koln very dear to his heart, is enjoying this time here - and we are enjoying it too."" As well they should.

Kwasniok may have been joking when he said that El Mala is adding an extra €5m to his asking price with each passing goal, but it's clear that when he does eventually leave Koln, it will be for a lot more money than they got for Wirtz!

England beat Serbia 2-0 on Thursday in their first World Cup qualifying game since securing a spot at next summer's tournament finals. The result meant very little to the Three Lions, whose players are now competing with one another for a place on the plane to North America as members of Thomas Tuchel's 26-man squad.

Bukayo Saka opened the scoring for England with a superb volley after Serbia failed to clear their lines from a free kick, and though the hosts dominated the ball throughout the entire match, their visitors did threaten to hit them on counters and breakaways to claw their way back into a must-win contest given their scramble for a play-off spot in Group K.

With seconds remaining, Eberechi Eze came up with a fine strike into the top corner to seal England's victory in their last competitive home match before the World Cup kicks off in June 2026.

GOAL breaks down the winners & losers from Wembley...

So long as Morgan Rogers is starting games as England's No.10, we have to lump these two together. That role should be theirs to lose, yet now it's up to them to win it back off the Aston Villa sensation.

When Tuchel's starting XI was leaked a few hours before kick-off on Thursday, the headline news was the absence of both Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden, with Rogers continuing in a midfield three alongside Declan Rice and Elliot Anderson. The England boss had already claimed he saw the snubbed duo as attacking midfielders rather than wide options, so this sent a clear warning to them - show the country why you should be playing from minute one.

Perhaps Bellingham's prospects are looking a little brighter given when he was introduced from the bench, he was the one to go into the No.10 position, while Foden went up front in place of Harry Kane. They both played a part in Eze's clinching goal, with the Real Madrid man powering his way up the pitch and feeding the Manchester City star, who in turn shifted possession for the Arsenal favourite to expertly place in the top corner.

When asked by ITV how he thought he did as an impact sub, Foden replied: ""I thought I did well, created some chances, unlucky not to put a few away. Overall I think I have to be happy with the impact I did today."" He also admitted he would accept coming off the bench if that appeased Tuchel, but there will come a point where these two players - one who was on the Ballon d'Or podium 12 months ago, the other the PFA Players' Player of the Year shortly before that - will be demanding more. An England manager can only hold back that tide for so long.

Saka became Arsenal's highest-scoring player for the England men's team last month when he netted in their rout against Wales. However, head coach Tuchel wasn't that impressed with the record.

""How many goals did he score for England? 13? One-three?"" the German said with incredulity. ""This has to be more. It's not enough. He needs to keep on going. I thought it's 30 at least! And then I would have said 'well it's not enough' because I'm never, never satisfied.""

In fairness, this was a stance that Saka himself understood. ""I 100 percent agree with him. So, yeah, let's go for more,"" the Arsenal winger told talkSPORT this week.

""I think just being on the pitch is enough. In the England shirt, you have players of immense quality who can create chances, who can score chances. So just being on the pitch for me I think is enough. It's up to me, the manager, the coaching staff, they create the perfect game plan for us to be ourselves, show our best qualities and express ourselves. So, yeah, it's up to me.""

So how did Saka respond on the pitch? By breaking the deadlock in style, obviously. There was a hint of shin about the strike, but it doesn't matter as long as it ends up in the back of the net, and you'd hardly have believed England's No.7 had mishit it by the scything flight of the ball anyway.

In truth, only three outfield positions are locked down in Tuchel's side. Kane up front is one, Rice in midfield is another, and Saka wide right is the third.

The increased scrutiny placed on Bellingham and Foden has allowed Eze to go about his own business and carry on as if his place has never been in doubt. Though not always a starter for club and country, he's always viewed as an important piece of the puzzle.

Of all of Tuchel's five substitutes, Eze was the one who appeared fresh and ready to fight for his role, with Bellingham a close second in that regard. The Arsenal attacker now has three goals for the Three Lions, only one fewer than Foden's tally in 31 fewer appearances.

Eze's tested ability to change games from the bench makes him the ideal 'finisher' for Tuchel, who is increasingly wary that there are only eleven players he can pick to start each game. As humble as ever, Eze claimed he was still in the mix with his other team-mates and is yet to secure his spot at the World Cup, telling ITV: ""There's a lot of talent in the team. You can see the players here and the types that aren't here as well. It's the type of competition you want to be up against and it is going to help the team for sure.""

Eze made the most of his chance to impress Tuchel, but the man he replaced after 65 minutes, Marcus Rashford, didn't. It was a real shame for the Manchester United outcast, who has rediscovered his best version of himself on loan at Barcelona and if anything has added another layer to his game with his new-found penchant for assists.

Rashford long had the beating of diminutive Serbia right-back Ognjen Mimovic, though often let his marker get away with cheap fouls and lacked the end product to make this a one-sided pasting.

This may have been a goalless endeavour for Rashford, but he received some words of praise from one of his harshest critics. Roy Keane, on punditry duty for ITV, claimed the Barca forward should still be considered England's first choice in that position ahead of Anthony Gordon, who has regularly featured under Tuchel and has only missed this camp through injury.

Keane said: ""If you're comparing the two of them, Rashford and Gordon at their very best, I'm going for Rashford. He can still frustrate you, of course, but he's a threat and when he's on top form he is a handful. You wouldn't want to face him.""

The saving grace for Rashford was he linked up well with Rice and debutant Nico O'Reilly down the left flank, so if Tuchel really is putting value in on-field relationships, this was not an entirely pointless evening for the winger. Speaking of O'Reilly...

England's newest international enjoyed a fine evening representing his country at this level for the first time. Serbia's best and most promising attacks came down the Three Lions' right-hand side, while the Man City academy graduate was a useful part of his team's build-up play and was involved in plenty of moves down the left.

O'Reilly was called into Tuchel's squad for the October camp following injury withdrawals, but this selection was entirely on merit. The 20-year-old has been in superb form for Pep Guardiola's Premier League title challengers, and now he has a decent shot at making the World Cup next summer.

Tuchel kept his praise short and sweet for O'Reilly: ""He is a calm and shy person. He is very intelligent on the pitch and adapted well to the things we asked of him. Well done."" The man himself wasn't fazed by what was expected of him: ""It was a dream come true tonight, an honour to put on this shirt, play at Wembley in front of my family and the fans, surrounded by world class players. It was a great night... I expected the players to be world class, the manager knows what he wants and how to play. I've adapted well and quick to the system. I'm enjoying it.""

It was probably a good thing that the only England defender who wasn't at any point chasing a shadow was the newbie who still isn't legally old enough to drink in the place where next summer's World Cup will occur, right?

Tuchel already warned Myles Lewis-Skelly last month that he will fall down the England pecking order if he didn't work his way back into Arsenal's starting lineup. Since then, he's played only three Premier League minutes and was dropped for the November camp.

O'Reilly immediately coming in and flourishing will surely only make it harder for Lewis-Skelly to win his place in the Three Lions fold back. He remains one of the country's best young talents and if anything is being penalised for playing for the Premier League leaders who have an incredible array of defenders already. That's not Tuchel's problem, though.

Talk of Lewis-Skelly leaving Arsenal is ridiculous and won't have even entered the youngster's thinking. His career will progress at his boyhood club, and if that means he misses out on a spot at the World Cup, then so be it. These are just the ebbs and flows for any athlete when in the heat of competition. His time will come, be it in 2026 or beyond.

England don't really have a John Terry or Rio Ferdinand anymore. In this new age of set-piece dominance, even a prime Harry Maguire wouldn't go amiss. There isn't a world-leading centre-back among Tuchel's options, rather an assorted platter of good-to-decent defenders.

John Stones, at last fit again after a hellish 2025, appears to be a shoo-in for the starting XI so long as he remains healthy, with the other spot going to one of Ezri Konsa or Marc Guehi. With the Crystal Palace defender suffering a foot injury on the eve of this camp, the Aston Villa star has taken the initiative.

England needed Konsa's pace to quell Serbia's threat on the counter on Thursday. That characteristic alone should make the 28-year-old feel more at ease about his World Cup prospects - Three Lions defenders just aren't as quick as they were even a couple of years ago.

Ultimately, the biggest losers from Thursday's game are Serbia, who were not only defeated on the night, but their already slim hopes of reaching the World Cup were dashed for good.

The visitors went into this round of qualifiers one point behind bitter rivals Albania, who occupied the play-off spot and were effectively guaranteed three points away at minnows Andorra. Serbia had to get at least a point from Wembley to stand any chance of qualification.

""It was a difficult match,"" said Tuchel. ""It was complicated because they knew everything about us and we knew nothing about them. Go through the list of players, they are at top clubs, they play in top leagues. They have individual quality, they came with new energy and they made it a final for them.""

Alas, despite a spirited second-half effort, they came up short, and Albania - England's hosts on Sunday - are safely through to the play-offs as they look to reach the World Cup for the first time in their history.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Later, the Aussie added that his team and fiancée Katie Boulter were key in navigating the complex emotions he was feeling.Q. When did that making peace with yourself actually click in? Was it that night? Next morning? Did you have to be on your own completely? Even when you were in that 'dark place', did you reflect back on what you actually achieved this year?

If you could, reflect on that.ALEX de MINAUR: To be honest, I'm incredibly lucky with the support system that I have, the people I've got around me, every single one in my team, even Katie. They were able to, or they tried to, talk some sense into me and get me out of a very dark place.Sometimes when you're in that dark place, you make peace. You start to care less, right? Ultimately you can focus on other elements and not the results.For the first time in a long time, I forgot about the what if's, the results, what happens if I miss this shot, what happens if I lose this match. I just committed to the way I wanted to play from the first point to the last. A couple days ago I didn't. That's what hurt so much.Today I knew that no matter what, I wanted to be proud of my decision making, my aggressive mindset, and I wanted to go out there and try to win the match.

The Cooldown Room: F2's Luke Browning takes on a charades challenge

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Piastri's weekend to forget in Sao Paulo

Ahead of the final three races of the 2025 season, we asked our writers to answer the big questions on what could unfold – as well as making some bold predictions.

As a captivating 2025 season heads towards its close, there is still plenty to play for in the upcoming final three rounds of the campaign. Ahead of this all-important triple header – spanning Las Vegas, Qatar and Abu Dhabi – our writers Lawrence Barretto, Chris Medland, David Tremayne and Alex Jacques have shared their predictions for what could unfold, ranging from who will emerge as World Champion through to the most exciting storylines to keep an eye on…

Lawrence Barretto (F1 Correspondent & Presenter): Given the form Max Verstappen is currently in – his heroic drive from pit lane to podium in Brazil was another example of just how good he is driving right now – I don't think you can discount him, even if the Red Bull racer is 49 points adrift with three rounds to go.

But there is no doubt, Lando Norris is the favourite now. He's finished ahead of McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri in the six events since his painful mechanical DNF in the Netherlands and seems to have come into form at just the right time. But it wasn't that long ago that Verstappen seemed like he was right in the hunt and, before that, Piastri looked to be in control of the title fight – so in my mind, it's far from over.

Chris Medland (Special Contributor): At this point it's getting tough to look past Lando Norris, given the momentum he has built up. It really does feel like Norris has found the consistency that has been lacking at times this year, just as Oscar Piastri has struggled a little more.

Verstappen can still win it, but Las Vegas is going to be crucial for that. He needs a victory and the McLarens struggling in the cold conditions to give him the chance of a big points swing, because I don't see Qatar being a race weekend where he's likely to take a significant chunk out of any lead, even if he is able to fight for the win there.

David Tremayne (Hall of Fame F1 Journalist):  I think the odds favour Lando now, if he can keep it clean and keep finishing on the podium whatever anyone else does. I can see Max overhauling Oscar, unless the latter can rediscover his mojo. There were signs of good race pace from him in Mexico and Brazil, but he needs to recover his Qualifying form.

Alex Jacques (F1 TV Commentator): All roads currently lead to Lando, but I think we need to take a step back. Oscar has led 15 rounds of this championship and Max Verstappen was the bookmakers' favourite after Austin. Keeping the momentum has turned out to be the defining feature of this championship, and we still have enough time for it to shift again; just look at 2007 or 1986, for example. It should finish in the current order, but we've just seen so many twists to be certain.

LB: Brazil was a painful weekend for Ferrari, with the Scuderia arriving at Interlagos in P2 of the Teams' Championship and leaving in P4 – and it was compounded because Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli and George Russell showed how heavily they can score when the car suits the track. It's going to be a tight fight between those two for P2 – with Red Bull suffering from only scoring heavily with one car – and given that I expect Ferrari to be strong at Las Vegas and Abu Dhabi, I think the Italian squad might just edge it to steal P2 for the second year on the bounce.

CM: I've got to go with Mercedes now. This was a much harder question to answer before Brazil, but Kimi Antonelli's form has been impressive, and even a tough weekend for George Russell yielded a P3 and a P4. I can't see Red Bull getting enough points across both cars to close the gap despite the potential for Verstappen to pick up some wins, and Ferrari's double-DNF looks really costly. They are 36 points behind Mercedes, and would need to match their best score of the season – achieved in the Sprint weekend in the United States – with the Silver Arrows not scoring to draw level again.

DT: I can see Red Bull getting up to second, from Mercedes and Ferrari.

AJ: I think with Vegas and Qatar coming up, twinned with Kimi Antonelli's strong form in Brazil, Mercedes start as favourites for the runner-up spot. Red Bull are effectively fighting with one car, and Ferrari are having internal battles.

LB: Yuki Tsunoda needs a strong end to his campaign to retain a presence on the grid for a sixth successive year with the Red Bull family. The Japanese racer has shown glimmers of a breakthrough, but he had a tough time in Brazil – on a weekend where Verstappen starred once more to show the gulf between them.

From a teams' perspective, Racing Bulls, Aston Martin, Haas and Kick Sauber are separated by just 20 points with each position in the championship worth several million dollars – and thus all of them need to have a strong end to what has been a very tightly-fought midfield campaign.

CM: Plenty of candidates here for different reasons, but given what's at stake I'll go with McLaren and Oscar Piastri. The Australian has had a great season but is just struggling a little at the wrong time, while certain decisions haven't gone his way either. He's shown he's more than a match for Norris for so long this year, but he has to hit back in Las Vegas to prevent his team mate from being able to control the championship fight in the final two rounds.

The reason I include McLaren is both because they didn't get their strategy quite right with Piastri in Brazil – and they can't afford to get it wrong for a driver as the title goes down to the wire – and because Verstappen will take advantage of any big errors in general.

DT: Max and Red Bull, if they are to overcome the not insignificant points deficits to Lando and Oscar.

AJ: Yuki Tsunoda could do with a standout drive as he tries to save his F1 career; Lewis Hamilton not standing on the podium once in a Formula 1 season feels impossible; and Franco Colapinto will be desperate not to finish the season without a point. All three will hope for season bests in the final three.

LB: Aside from the tense three-way fight for the Drivers' Championship, I'm intrigued to see if Lewis Hamilton can put together a smooth weekend and get that first podium in red, or if he or team mate Charles Leclerc can give the famous Italian team their first victory of what has been a challenging season.

CM: Is it boring to say the Drivers' Championship fight? Especially if Verstappen can drag himself back into a three-way battle heading to the final two rounds. Certainly in Vegas I'm excited to see if he can do that after his charge in Interlagos. Aside from that, the midfield fight has been brilliant this year. The driver in 19th in the Drivers' standings has 19 points and a top-six finish this year. It's been so competitive, and I'm looking forward to some more big drives as the final Teams' positions get sorted out.

DT: The title fight, naturally. That will take precedence over everything else: just how strong Max will be (I suspect very), whether Lando holds firm or cracks, and how much Oscar can find his old form in a car that no longer seems quite so suited to his driving style. How, if necessary, the McLaren drivers can help one another, in extremis. And how will McLaren juggle their wish to let them fight and the desire for their first Drivers' World Championship since Lewis in 2008?

But also the intra-team fight chez Mercedes, which has been hotting up of late. A strong showing from them in Vegas could also tilt the outcome of the title fight. Ditto Racing Bulls, re intra-team competition.

AJ: Both storylines for the championship are excellent – we'll either have a new champion with one of the McLaren drivers or the greatest comeback in F1 history. Beyond the obvious, I'm excited to see more giant killing from the rookies. Ollie Bearman and Isack Hadjar have performed brilliantly this year, and no one expected Gabriel Bortoleto to beat Nico Hulkenberg in a Qualifying head-to-head. They've been so much fun to watch.

LB: Kimi Antonelli has been growing in confidence since Mercedes boss Toto Wolff described his performance at Monza as “underwhelming”. He took a superb second in the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, following up his P2 in the Sprint, and I reckon he can go one better and win one of the final events of the season.

CM: We're still going to have one more shock top-three result. I'm not sure if it will be in a Qualifying session, Sprint or over a Grand Prix distance – the latter probably least likely – but so many teams have shown an ability to just nail everything at certain points, particularly on Sprint weekends, and I just think another midfield driver will pull out an eye-catching performance.

DT: I stand by my pre-season prediction: Kimi will win a race…

AJ: I'll go with a first career win for Kimi Antonelli.

“I'm like any other actor: don't mimic me with falseness,"" the Oscar winner said. 


							By 

	Lexi Carson


Associate Editor


Morgan Freeman is speaking out again on AI. 


	Freeman recently spoke with The Guardian about his thoughts on AI and how its trying to use his voice with permission. “I'm a little PO'd, you know,” he said. “I'm like any other actor: don't mimic me with falseness. I don't appreciate it and I get paid for doing stuff like that, so if you're gonna do it without me, you're robbing me.”




	The Now You See Me: Now You Don't star claims, “my lawyers have been very, very busy,” to remove AI being used without his knowledge, and added that there's been “quite a few” cases his lawyers have found.

	And this wasn't the first time the Oscar winner has been vocal about the issue. In June 2024, he took to X to share his appreciation for fans noticing that AI-generated imitations of his voice had been created. “Thank you to my incredible fans for your vigilance and support in calling out the unauthorized use of an A.I. voice imitating me,” Freeman wrote. “Your dedication helps authenticity and integrity remain paramount. Grateful.” He also used hashtags “scam” and “IdentityProtection.” 


	AI has been a hot topic in Hollywood as of late, with SAG-AFTRA addressing the creation of a computer-generated actress, Tilly Norwood, in September.


	“To be clear, ‘Tilly Norwood' is not an actor, it's a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers — without permission or compensation,” said SAG-AFTRA. “It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we've seen, audiences aren't interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience. It doesn't solve any ‘problem' — it creates the problem of using stolen performances to put actors out of work, jeopardizing performer livelihoods and devaluing human artistry.”

Fans hated ‘The Rise of Skywalker,' but still want to see the story continue. 


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


	You could almost call it the Rise of Solo. Or maybe A New New Hope. 


	Weeks after it was revealed that the Walt Disney Company had squashed the idea of a Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker spinoff centered on Ben Solo, the son of Han Solo played by Adam Driver, the idea refuses to die amongst fans of the galaxy far far away.




	A plane with the banner “Shareholders Want The Hunt for Ben Solo,” the latter part being the hoped-for movie's title, flew over Disney's Burbank-based headquarters in the 11 a.m. hour Thursday, just hours after the company had its earnings call.

					Boba Fett's Blaster Likely to Hit $1M at Auction Boasting Rare 'Star Wars' Item		
			









	It's the latest banner-flying move (fans hired a plane with a banner reading “Save the Hunt for Ben Solo” in late October) and comes the same week as flyers showed up in Los Angeles' mid-Wilshire area on lampposts and street signs, taking the form of missing persons posters.


	“Missing” and “Have You Seen This Man?” flank a photo of Driver as Ben Solo, also known as Kylo Ren. On top of personal information, it notes that the person was last seen five years and 10 months ago, referring to the release date of The Rise of Skywalker, which occurred in December 2019.


	All this hullaballoo comes after Driver, in an October interview with the Associated Press, revealed he and acclaimed filmmaker Steven Soderbergh came up with an idea and how a script was written by Scott Z. Burns. It was even given the thumbs up by Lucasfilm head Kathleen Kennedy.     


	“We took it to Bob Iger and Alan Bergman and they said no,” Driver said. “They didn't see how Ben Solo was alive. And that was that.”

	











	Soderbergh confirmed the project and its being blown up, Alderaan style.


	The irony here, however, is that Rise of Skywalker has such a poor reputation amongst fans and audiences in general that it killed Star Wars movies for years. Next summers The Mandalorian and Grogu will be the first movie since 2019.


	On top of that, the character was killed at the end of the movie in a redemptive act. The idea of resurrecting him would go against his sacrifice and lend more incredulity to the Star Wars franchise' very loose concept of death, as it has brought back such characters as Emperor Palpatine, Death Maul, and even Boba Fett.


	Still, as any decent Star Wars fan could tell you, rebellions are built on hope. And right now there is a hope amongst a faction that their actions can change Jedi minds.

""I'd brave any weather 'cause nothing is better than being together again,"" the rivals-turned-friends sing to each other in the festive new song.


													By
												

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	From the fiery summer release of ZOMBIES 4: Dawn of the Vampires to the icy winter melody of “Snow Angels,” Freya Skye and Malachi Barton are back together again.


	Skye's Nova and Barton's Victor started out on opposite sides of an ancient fight as members of the rival Daywalkers and Vampires, respectively, in the fourth ZOMBIES installment that came out in July, but in the snow-dusted music video for “Snow Angels” — premiering exclusively on Billboard Family below — they're realizing the holidays are so much better when they're together.

	











	“Oh the choir sings and the bells all chime/ When your sno-oh-ow angel's next to mine,” Skye sings to Barton to start the song, as they lie down in the fresh snow and make head-to-head snow angels. Later in the tune, they sing in harmony: “I'd brave any weather 'cause nothing is better than being together again.” In the visual, they both harness their powers — Nova's solar flares and Victor's night winds — to conjure a flurry of snow.


	The “Snow Angels” song will be available across all digital music platforms first thing Friday (Nov. 14) at midnight ET, while the music video hits Disney+ and DisneyMusicVevo at 3 a.m. ET. The video will also premiere on Disney Channel after the ZOMBIES 4 sing-along encore event airing Nov. 28 at 7 p.m. ET, which will help kick off the network's “Fa-La-La-Lidays” holiday programming.

	











	Watch the music video below:


	Back in July, the ZOMBIES 4: Dawn of the Vampires soundtrack debuted at No. 1 on Billboard‘s Kid Albums chart (dated July 26) and also bowed at No. 3 on the Soundtracks chart, No. 16 on Independent Albums and at No. 90 on the all-genre Billboard 200. The ZOMBIES 4 album carried on the impressive track record of Disney's ZOMBIES film franchise on Billboard's Kid Albums chart: The first ZOMBIES soundtrack, released in 2018, spent 10 weeks atop the tally, while ZOMBIES 2 (2020) peaked at No. 2 and ZOMBIES 3 (2022) spent two weeks at No. 1.

Cardi shared the news (""A new baby into my world"") in the caption of an Instagram video soundtracked by her song ""Hello.""


													By
												

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


Cardi B has welcomed her new baby boy with boyfriend Stefon Diggs, the rap superstar announced Thursday (Nov. 13) on Instagram.


	This is Cardi's fourth child, following her trio of kids with ex-husband Offset: 7-year-old daughter Kulture, 4-year-old son Wave, and 1-year-old daughter Blossom.


	Cardi shared the news in the caption of an Instagram video soundtracked by her song “Hello,” from her Billboard 200-topping sophomore album Am I the Drama?, which arrived in September.


	“My life has always been a combination of different chapters and different seasons,” she wrote in part in the lengthy caption. “My last chapter was the beginning of a new season. Starting over is never easy but it's been so worth it! I brought new music and a new album to the world! A new baby into my world, and one more reason to be the best version of me, one more reason to love me more than anything else or anyone else so I can continue giving my babies the love and life they deserve. This next chapter is Me vs. Me!”


	In a video posted to her Instagram Story, Cardi confirmed the sex of the baby, fawning over a girly, flower-covered stroller and lamenting, “I just had a boy … why didn't I know about this [stroller] last year?”

	











	While whispers of their relationship started in the fall of last year, Cardi and New England Patriots player Stefon Diggs made their first public outing as a couple in May, cuddling up courtside at the New York Knicks vs. Boston Celtics game during the 2025 NBA Playoffs. Cardi announced their pregnancy news in September, telling CBS Mornings: “I feel very powerful that I'm doing all this work. But I'm doing all this work while I'm creating a baby, and me and my man, we're very supportive of each other.”




	In the Instagram caption, Cardi referenced her 2026 Little Miss Drama tour, which kicks off Feb. 11 in Palm Desert, California. “I've started prepping for tour getting my body right getting my mind right,” she wrote. “There's nothing thats gonna stop me from giving you guys the performance of a life time! I've learned i've healed, and im loving the woman i've become! Thats what this next era means to me and i'm stepping into it better than ever.”

Bad Bunny gana Album del año. La brasileña Liniker gana tres premios; Fito Páez y Edgar Barrera dos.

Chief Content Officer Latin/Español, Billboard


Bad Bunny y el dúo argentino Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso — dos artistas revolucionarios de lugares muy diferentes del mundo, haciendo música muy distinta y viviendo momentos totalmente diferentes en sus respectivas carreras — fueron los grandes ganadores de los Latin Grammy 2025, llevándose cinco premios cada uno y compitiendo en las mismas categorías varias veces.

	Bad Bunny, el gran favorito de la noche, se llevó el importantísimo premio al álbum del año por su aclamado disco DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS, un proyecto que lo llevó de regreso a sus raíces puertorriqueñas, celebró el amor por su isla y sus tradiciones, inspiró su histórica residencia de conciertos y, finalmente, marcó el camino hacia su próxima presentación en el show de medio tiempo del Super Bowl.


	“Este premio se lo quiero dedicar a todos los niños y jóvenes de Latinoamérica, especialmente los de Puerto Rico”, dijo al recoger su premio. “Nunca dejen de soñar y de ser ustedes. Nunca olviden de dónde vienen sin olvidar a donde van. Hay muchas maneras de hacer patria y defender nuestra tierra. Nosotros escogimos la música”, puntualizó.


	Bad Bunny también ganó mejor interpretación urbana/fusión urbana y mejor canción urbana por “DtMF”, así como mejor interpretación de reggaetón por “Voy a llevarte pa PR”. DeBí TiRAR MáS FOToS obtuvo además el premio al mejor álbum de música urbana.

	











	Si Bad Bunny era el gran favorito, Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso fueron la sorpresa. Aclamados por la crítica, desde temprano en la noche parecían listos para darle pelea a Bunny. El dúo argentino, que fusiona con acierto el hip-hop con el soul, la electrónica y el pop estilizado para crear una mezcla de sonidos que desafía los géneros y letras irreverentes, ganaron cinco estatuillas: mejor video musical versión corta por “#tetas”, mejor video musical versión larga por “Papota”, mejor álbum de música alternativa por Papota, mejor canción alternativa por “#tetas” y mejor canción pop por “El día del amigo”.


	Además, los productores de su galardonado álbum, Rafa Arcaute y Federico Vindver, se alzaron con el premio al productor del año, compartiendo el galardón con Nico Cotton en un empate.


	En la extravagante presentación de Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso, un grupo de tipos musculosos, usando solo diminutos speedos negros, lanzaron rosas a los pies de una banda de soul/funk súper bien sincronizada, mientras el dúo, vestido con ropa estampada de Versace, rapeaba y tocaba riffs de guitarra excelentes y de gran calidad técnica. No se confundan por lo loco del show; este dúo tiene talento y capacidad de sobra y sabe perfectamente qué hacer con su música, su estilo y su ironía, tanto dentro como fuera del escenario.


	Más temprano, en la Premiere del Latin Grammy, Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso (cuyos nombres reales son Catriel Guerreiro y Ulises Guerriero, sin parentesco entre ellos) recogieron premios vestidos con conjuntos de seda estampados, los mismos que usaron para su presentación.


	“Hemos hecho un esfuerzo sobrehumano para ganar este hermoso objeto. Tan sobrehumano que ya no nos percibimos humanos, nos percibimos empresa”, dijo Ca7riel con total seriedad, fiel al estilo irónico que caracteriza la música y la imagen del dúo.

	











	Conforme avanzaba la noche y se sumaban los premios, el dúo se fue emocionando. Al recibir su premio a la mejor canción alternativa, Ca7riel cedió. “A nuestras madres, Estrella y Andrea, que son las culpables de todo esto”, dijo.


	“La verdad es que estamos sorprendidos de que nos den premios, que nos den cosas”, añadió Paco Amoroso. “Gracias al equipo que nos ha permitido hacer cosas. Estamos felices. Gracias a la gente de Argentina”.


	Irónicamente, ni Bad Bunny ni Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso ganaron grabación o canción del Año, dos categorías en las que los Latin Grammys, inexplicablemente, los hicieron competir contra sí mismos con dos canciones de un mismo álbum, prácticamente asegurando que se anularan entre ellos.


	En su lugar, Karol G se llevó el premio a la canción del año por su exitosísima (y maravillosa) “Si antes te hubiera conocido”, coescrita con Edgar Barrera, quien ganó compositor del año por tercer año consecutivo.


	Por otro lado, el superastro español Alejandro Sanz ganó grabación del año por su hermosa “Palmeras en el jardín”. Aunque es un gran tema, incluso Sanz expresó su sorpresa: “Benito, te lo he robado, perdóname”, dijo mientras recogía su premio.


	El premio al Mejor nuevo artista fue para la mexicana Paloma Morphy. 


	En cuanto a número de victorias, Brasil también brilló con Liniker, quien se llevó tres premios: mejor álbum de pop contemporáneo en lengua portuguesa por Caju, mejor Interpretación urbana en lengua portuguesa por la canción del mismo título, y mejor canción en lengua portuguesa por “Veludo Marrom”. Edgar Barrera también se alzó con tres galardones, al igual que Natalia Lafourcade, quien ganó mejor álbum cantautor por Cancionera.

	











	La transmisión en vivo arrancó con un confuso popurrí con el legendario Santana en la guitarra y varios nominados, como Maluma y Grupo Frontera, interpretando fragmentos de canciones junto a un grupo de bailarines cuyo estilo de principios de los 2000 se sintió un poco fuera de lugar con la música. Pero, conforme avanzaba la noche, avanzaron las actuaciones, empezando por Rauw Alejandro, quien presentó un medley de canciones respaldado por sus propios bailarines y banda, con una deslumbrante producción escénica y una interpretación vocal sobresaliente.


	Otros momentos destacados incluyeron a los ya mencionados Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso y a Bad Bunny, quien actuó junto al grupo puertorriqueño Chuwi. Hubo grandes sorpresas, como la presentación de Raphael, el homenajeado como Persona del Año, quien, a sus 82 años y tras problemas de salud, aún conserva la poderosa voz que lo ha convertido en uno de los baladistas más icónicos de la música latina. 


	Elena Rose y Morat también sorprendieron, mostrando una autenticidad y entrega que les ha permitido conectar profundamente con su público. Por su parte, Los Tigres del Norte ofrecieron un mensaje de conciencia social con su éxito “La lotería”.


	Los anfitriones de la transmisión por TelevisaUnivision fueron la veterana actriz y cantante Roselyn Sánchez, quien ya ha conducido este premio en múltiples ocasiones y demostró su carisma y experiencia; y Maluma, quien debutó como presentador con una actitud relajada y convincente. Me le quito el sombrero.


	Si hubo un tema central en la noche, fue la autenticidad y el regreso a lo real. En su emotivo discurso tras ganar el premio a canción del año, Karol G pidió “por favor no me corten” porque tenía algo importante que decir. La cantante colombiana reflexionó sobre los peligros de la fama y el riesgo de escuchar las voces externas que siembran dudas y críticas.

	











	“Lo único que me quedó de eso fue volver a la raíz y volver al propósito”, dijo. “No lo digo por mí, porque hay un montón de personas en la casa que piensan que no son suficientemente buenas. Cuando uno se olvida del otro, lo único que queda es la pasión”.

	This might have the Whitesnake faithful crying in the rain. Frontman David Coverdale, who co-founded the multiplatinum hard rock band in the late 1970s, co-wrote most of its songs and also sang with Deep Purple and Jimmy Page, announced his retirement today. Watch him reveal the news in a video below.


	“Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, brothers and sisters of the Snake, a special announcement for you,” Coverdale said. “After 50 years-plus of an incredible journey with you — with Deep Purple, with Whitesnake, Jimmy Page — the last few years it has been very evident to me that it's time really for me to hang up my rock ‘n' roll platform shoes and my skintight jeans.”

	











	The English singer added: “And as you can see, we've taken care of the lion's wig, but it's time for me to call it a day. I love you dearly. I thank everyone who's assisted and supported me on this incredible journey: all the musicians, the crew, the fans, the family. It's amazing. But it really is time for me to just enjoy my retirement, and I hope you can appreciate that.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Now 74, Coverdale founded Whitesnake in 1978 after a stint fronting Deep Purple following Ian Gillan's exit. His recorded three albums with that band — 1974's Burn and Stormbringer, both of which went gold in the U.S., and 1975's Come Taste the Band — singing on such popular tracks as “Burn,” “Mistreated” and “Soldier of Fortune.” He was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame with the group in 2016.

	











	Coverdale then formed released a pair of solo albums before forming Whitesnake in 1978. Its first two LPs charted in the Top 50 in his native UK, but the band would break out with its third disc, Ready an' Willing. That 1980 album hit the UK Top 10 and made its first U.S. chart appearance, peaking at No. 90 fueled by the single “Fool for Your Loving.” Fans would hear much more of that song late in the decade.


RELATED: Bernie Marsden Dies: Whitesnake Guitarist Who Co-Wrote ‘Here I Go Again' Was 72Whitesnake's next two albums, Come an' Get It (1981) and Saints & Sinners (1982), also reached the UK Top 10 but didn't click stateside. That changed with the group's 1984 LP Slide It In, which made the U.S. Top 40 thanks to the single-entendre FM hit “Slow an' Easy,” “Love Ain't No Stranger” and its libidinous title track. It was the first Whitesnake album to feature ex-Thin Lizzy guitarist John Sykes, who would co-write many of his new band's songs with Coverdale.


	But the group's next disc shot Coverdale and company to superstardom.


	Released worldwide in March 1987, the eponymous Whitesnake was an international smash, spending eight weeks at No. 2 — thwarted from the top spot by U2's The Joshua Tree — and going Top 10 in a half-dozen countries. The album featured the band's first big hit single: “Here I Go Again,” a new version of a track from the band's Saints & Sinners disc, hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. It ranked No. 17 on VH1's list of the Top 100 Songs of the 1980s and was fueled by its steamy, MTV-smash video that featured Coverdale's soon-to-be-wife, model Tawny Kitaen. Watch it here:


Whitesnake also featured such popular tracks as the ballad “Is This Love,” which hit No. 2 in the U.S.; the hard-rocking, Zeppelin-esque “Still of the Night,” “Crying in the Rain,” another reworked Saints & Sinners song; and Give Me All Your Love. The album ultimately sold more that 10 million units stateside and drove sales of its catalog, making Whitesnake of one the poster bands of the “hair metal” genre, though it often was bluesier and/or more hard rocking than most others. 


RELATED: Tawny Kitaen Dies: ‘Bachelor Party' Actress And Whitesnake Video Vixen Was 59 


	The group then released Slip of the Tongue (1989), which went Top 10 in the U.S. and the UK and featured a reworked version of “Fool for Your Loving” that was a huge FM hit, spend four weeks at No. 2 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart. 


	But Coverdale would dissolve Whitesnake the following year, and in 1993 he teamed with Led Zeppelin's guitarist to form the one-off Coverdale Page. Their self-titled album made the Top 5 in the U.S. and UK, going platinum stateside, but the pair split late that year.


	Whitesnake had a run of eight consecutive Top 10 albums in the UK from 1980-94, including one live and one compilation set. Its 2008 disc Good to Be Bad also went Top 10 in Coverdale's homeland.


	Coverdale revived Whitesnake in 1997, and the group would release five more studio albums through 2019. None would reach the commercial heights of the band's '80s output, though. Coverdale would continue to tour the world with the group up until this past summer. 


	Whitesnake's music can be heard in dozens of films and TV shows ranging from I Know What You Did Last Summer, Old School and The O.C. to How I Met Your Mother, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Cobra Kai.


	Here is the Coverdale's video announcing his retirement:

	With his most epic cinematic outing yet, Christopher Nolan was determined to use as much practical filmmaking as possible.


	The 2x Oscar-winning writer and director of The Odyssey revealed that he “shot over two million feet of film” during the 91-day shoot, much of which was actually at sea to capture the grand scale of Homer's ancient Greek epic.


	“It's pretty primal! I've been out on it for the last four months,” he told Empire. “We got the cast who play the crew of Odysseus' ship out there on the real waves, in the real places. And yeah, it's vast and terrifying and wonderful and benevolent, as the conditions shift. We really wanted to capture how hard those journeys would have been for people. And the leap of faith that was being made in an unmapped, uncharted world.”

	











	Nolan explained that by “embracing the physicality of the real world,” he was “confronted on a daily basis by the world pushing back at you.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	An adaptation of one of the first stories in human history, The Odyssey follows Odysseus (Matt Damon) through the incredible trials and mythical encounters he faces on his decade-long journey home to wife Penelope after the Trojan War.


	For Nolan—who was tapped to direct Troy (2004), based on Homer's Iliad, but ended up doing Batman Begins (2005) for Warner Bros.–his adaptation of The Odyssey has been a long time coming.


	“As a filmmaker, you're looking for gaps in cinematic culture, things that haven't been done before,” explained Nolan. “And what I saw is that all of this great mythological cinematic work that I had grown up with – Ray Harryhausen movies and other things – I'd never seen that done with the sort of weight and credibility that an A-budget and a big Hollywood, IMAX production could do.”

	











	Premiering July 17, 2026 in IMAX, The Odyssey also stars Tom Holland, Anne Hathaway, Zendaya, Lupita Nyong'o, Robert Pattinson, Charlize Theron, Jon Bernthal, Benny Safdie, John Leguizamo, Elliot Page, Himesh Patel, Bill Irwin, Samantha Morton, Jesse Garcia, Will Yun Lee, Rafi Gavron, Shiloh Fernandez, Mia Goth and more.

	As some of his peers embrace generative artificial intelligence with their own likeness, Morgan Freeman is putting his imitators on notice.


	The Oscar winner recently brushed off “the idea of retirement” as he shared his reaction to AI recreations of his voice and likeness online, revealing that his “lawyers have been very, very busy” with “quite a few” cases.


	“I'm a little PO'd, you know,” he told The Guardian. “I'm like any other actor: don't mimic me with falseness. I don't appreciate it and I get paid for doing stuff like that, so if you're gonna do it without me, you're robbing me.”

	Although his frequent collaborator Michael Caine recently partnered with ElevenLabs to “preserve and share” his voice in their ‘Iconic Voice Marketplace‘ along with several other living and dead stars, Freeman plans to keep using his talents for the time being. 


	“Sometimes the idea of retirement would float past me,” he admitted. “But as soon as my agent says there's a job or somebody wants you or they've made an offer, the whole thing just boils back into where it was yesterday: how much you're going to pay, where we're gonna be?”


	The Now You See Me: Now You Don't actor also chimed in on the discourse around AI creation Tilly Norwood, one of 40 avatars being rolled out from AI talent studio Xicoia.


	“Nobody likes her because she's not real and that takes the part of a real person, so it's not going to work out very well in the movies or in television,” said Freeman. “The union's job is to keep actors acting, so there's going to be that conflict.”

Justin Baldoni claimed in a new legal filing that Blake Lively improvised an off-script kissing scene during the filming of “It Ends With Us.”

An exhibit filed by Wayfarer and others on Nov. 13 included a brief clip in which Lively and Baldoni — who co-starred in the movie — share a light kiss while passing in a hallway in a hospital.

Per People, attorneys for Baldoni alleged in documents that the “Gossip Girl” alum, 38, “added [the scene] to the script, in which her character kissed Baldoni's character in every take, although there was no kiss in the script.”

The footage from May 2023 — which is just over one minute long — shows Lively, who plays Lily, come across Baldoni, who plays neurosurgeon Ryle, as he works at the hospital.

Lily approaches a confused Ryle in the hallway, apologizing for interrupting his day and planting a quick kiss on his lips. 

She then leaves Ryle, telling him she “happen[s] to love him too” on the way out. 

Baldoni's character watches her exit with a bemused expression, tossing his phone before saying, “Alright, cut.”

A rep for Lively did not immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment on the deleted scene. 

Advertisement

Lively, 38, sued the film's director Baldoni, 41, for alleged sexual harassment and retaliation in December 2024. 

Baldoni denied wrongdoing and hit back with a $400 million countersuit against Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds, as well as others, in January, though it was later dismissed by the judge.

Advertisement

Lively's original complaint accused the director of alleged “improvised physical intimacy that had not been rehearsed, choreographed or discussed with Ms. Lively.” 

After a January 2024 meeting between Lively and Reynolds, as well as producers, Wayfarer agreed to employ an intimacy coordinator and stated that there would be “no more improvising of kissing,” per Lively's complaint.

Baldoni's legal team had previously claimed only scripted kissing scenes were filmed before the Hollywood strikes. 

However, they also claimed the alleged new unscripted kissing scene was filmed prior to the industry strikes on May 13, 2023.

“Lively also complains that there was inappropriate and improvised kissing during the first period of filming, before the strike break,” Baldoni's since-dismissed complaint read, per People. 

Advertisement

“But in fact, the only two kissing scenes filmed during the initial filming period were both scenes that included kisses as written in the script. These kissing scenes were not improvised.” 

On Wednesday, alleged texts between Baldoni and the film's source material author, Colleen Hoover, emerged as well. 

The “It Ends With Us” author allegedly wrote that she “felt forced to choose” between Lively and Baldoni amid their feud and that she was “disappointed” in the director, in alleged communications from 2024. 

The alleged texts were filed by Wayfarer on Nov. 10.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner hit back at Ray J's ‘frivolous' lawsuit over infamous sex tape","https://pagesix.com/2025/11/13/celebrity-news/kim-kardashian-kris-jenner-react-to-ray-js-sex-tape-lawsuit/","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 01:49:00 GMT","

Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner have hit back at Ray J's new bombshell lawsuit against them, which came on the heels of them filing a defamation lawsuit against him.

Alex Spiro — the lawyer for Kardashian and Jenner — called the “One Wish” singer's lawsuit “frivolous” in a statement to Page Six on Thursday.

“After realizing he is losing the case and losing his way, this disjointed rambling distraction is not intimidating anyone,” Spiro said. “Ray J will lose this frivolous case too.”

Ray J's new lawsuit doubles down on his claims that Kardashian and Jenner have been lying about the infamous 2007 sex tape leak for two decades. The singer alleges the mother-daughter duo were behind his and Kardashian's sex tape — which he claims was filmed consensually in 2003 when they were dating — getting leaked.

Advertisement

Ray J, 44, claimed in the filing obtained by Page Six that he and Kardashian, 45, discussed releasing the tape in 2006, and that she allegedly told him that her mother should be in charge of releasing it.

He claimed that Jenner and Kardashian are now “furious” that he “no longer wants to play along with their tall tale.”

Ray J, whose real name is William Ray Norwood Jr., also hit back at Kardashian and Jenner's lawsuit against him for defamation, which they filed in October.

“Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner's lawsuit is not about defamation — it's about publicity, power, and punishment,” he claimed in the court docs.

Kardashian and Jenner filed the defamation lawsuit shortly after Ray J made the shocking claim that he's working with the feds to build a RICO case against them.

“The federal RICO I'm about to drop on Kris and Kim is about to be crazy,” the singer told Chrisean Rock during a livestream that circulated on X.

“I'm talking about, I'm on the news every day. I'm gonna say a lot of s–t. Anybody that is cool with Kim, they need to tell her now, the feds is coming. There's nothing I can do about it.”

He added, “It's worse than Diddy.”

But in Kardashian and Jenner's lawsuit against Ray J, they stated that “no such federal investigation exists.”

Advertisement

“No law enforcement agency has initiated any criminal proceedings or investigations related to racketeering charged against Ms. Kardashian or Ms. Jenner and no credible evidence whatsoever supports these inflammatory allegations,” their lawsuit reads, which was obtained by Page Six.

“Unable to accept the end of his fleeting relationship with Ms. Kardashian over 20 years ago, Ray J has repeatedly sought to attach himself to Plaintiffs' names and exploit their prominence for personal gain,” the lawsuit also states.

Morgan Freeman's distinctive voice has been the bane of everybody who has a “funny co-worker” for the last 20 years and counting—and now it's apparently the bane of his lawyers' workloads, too. This is per a new interview that Freeman gave to The Guardian this week, in which the veteran actor talked briefly about his reaction to the inescapable fact that his distinctive, warm tones were one of the first targets for AI voice copying—in many ways, now the irritating “office clown” to humanity as a whole.

To put it in Freeman's (apparently congenitally folksy) terms, “I'm a little PO'd, you know,” he said of the way his specific voice and cadences get copied by every huckster trying to peddle new AI tech. “I'm like any other actor: don't mimic me with falseness. I don't appreciate it and I get paid for doing stuff like that, so if you're gonna do it without me, you're robbing me.” When asked about whether he pursues legal remedies when he finds out that his voice is being copied, Freeman makes it plain: “I tell you, my lawyers have been very, very busy.”

(Freeman was also, of course, asked about the whole “Tilly Norwood” thing, to similarly hardline results: “Nobody likes her because she's not real, and that takes the part of a real person, so it's not going to work out very well in the movies or in television … The union's job is to keep actors acting, so there's going to be that conflict.”)

AI being used to imitate well-known actors has been one of the many prongs making up the gnarly, multi-tined sticking point that's been Hollywood's response to artificial intelligence in recent years, especially after the estates of certain actors with highly distinctive voices—notably James Earl Jones—signed off on official copies. The topic was a major area of contention in the strikes that happened back in 2023—and apparently a big talking point for the Now You Seem Me actor and his reportedly tireless legal team.

James Van Der Beek will soon be auctioning off memorabilia from throughout his long film and television career, People reports. Van Der Beek revealed earlier this week that he intends to sell off his collection—including pieces from fan favorites like Dawson's Creek and Varsity Blues—in order to help pay medical costs. The actor revealed last November that he'd been diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer.

Per People, Van Der Beek will be selling the items—which include hats and cleats worn during Varsity Blues, the clothes he wore in the first episode of Dawson's Creek, and, in what's expected to be the highest-ticket item, the necklace that his character gave Katie Holmes' Joey during the show's prom episode—through Propstore's Winter Entertainment Memorabilia Live Auction in December.

Here's Van Der Beek:

I've been storing these treasures for years, waiting for the right time to do something with them, and with all of the recent unexpected twists and turns life has presented recently, it's clear that the time is now. While I have some nostalgia tugging at me as I part with these items, it feels good to be able to offer them through Propstore's auction to share with those who have supported my work over the years.

All proceeds from the sales will reportedly go toward covering Van Der Beek's medical expenses. A father of six, the actor has continued to work after revealing his diagnosis, including making recent appearances in Prime Video's Overcompensating.

The memorabilia auction is scheduled to begin with live bidding on December 5 in London, with the sale being opened up to global collectors the following day. You can see the full collection—which also includes some pretty choice non-Van-Der-Beek memorabilia, including Will Ferrell's Elf costume, one of the stunt axes from The Shining, and the usual array of Star Wars and Indiana Jones collectibles that often pop up in these kinds of sales—right here.

President Donald Trump likes his news apologetic, but more than that, he likes news organizations to show conciliation through cash payments. Earlier this year, he shook down CBS and ABC for roughly $15 million over various defamation allegations. However, while ABC settled with the billionaire co-founder of Truth Social for $15 million and apologized, CBS paid him $16 million and did not. The BBC did the opposite, offering Trump an apology but refusing to pay. In a report published today, the BBC stated that it has apologized for splicing parts of Trump's January 6, 2021, speech together but “rejected his demands for compensation.” As they have done to other news organizations, Trump's lawyers threated to sue the BBC for $1 billion over the edit.

“BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president's speech on 6 January 2021,” a BBC spokesperson said. “While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.”

Over the weekend, The Daily Telegraph published a note from a whistleblower stating that a 2024 episode of the docuseries Panorama spliced together parts of Trump's January 6 speech that were 50 minutes apart, giving, as the BBC puts it, “the mistaken impression that President Trump made a call for violent action.” The news caused an upheaval at the BBC, leading to the resignations of two executives: Tim Davie, the network's director general, and Deborah Turness, its head of news. Unfortunately for the BBC, this wasn't the first time they've done this. Today, The Daily Telegraph found another instance of the BBC making a similar edit to the same speech nearly two years earlier for a 2022 episode of Newsnight.

President Trump has a long history of threatening to sue media organizations. Over the summer, he threatened The Wall Street Journal with a $10 billion lawsuit over its publishing a news story alleging that Trump had written the infamous “enigmas never age” letter in Jeffrey Epstein's extremely disgusting 2003 birthday book.

Miles Teller has opened up a bit about one of the more distressing moments of his entire career: The way his efforts, post-Whiplash, to fully embrace the Hollywood leading man stereotype (i.e., by getting himself his own superhero franchise) collided full-on with the disaster surrounding 2015's Fantastic Four. Specifically (per Variety), Teller talked to Andy Cohen on Sirius XM this week about the flop, saying that, “Honestly, maybe there was one really important person who kind of fucked it all up.”

Teller declined to name names for this particular RIP(WKOFIAU), although internet detectives have not had to look super hard to find a likely subject for the Eternity star's comments. Fantastic Four was, after all, dogged for months by rumors of conflict between director Josh Trank and pretty much everybody else on set—including Teller, who supposedly nearly got into a full-on fist fight with his director over clashing personalities. Everybody tried to make nice in public as the film's August 2015 premiere approached, with Trank notably doing damage control with producer and writer Simon Kinberg, hoping to dispel rumors he'd been fired from his own movie in all but name.

But then, on the literal night before the movie came out, Trank sent out a since-deleted Tweet bemoaning that audiences would “probably never get to see” the “fantastic version of this” he'd had “a year ago.” (The implication being that studio meddling, reshoots, and seized control of the movie's final edit had already ruined the film.) The rest was history: A critical drubbing, a box office return that just barely cleared the movie's budget, and Trank's vanishing from the list of up-and-coming genre filmmakers he'd been slotted onto in the wake of his 2012 found-footage superhero movie Chronicle. (He probably would have lost the Star Wars movie he'd been working on at that point, too, except he'd already lost it four months earlier; Disney was reportedly unhappy when it heard about how he'd been comporting himself on his first big-budget film set.)

And, again, Teller himself was classy enough not to get into any of this well-known superhero movie lore, beyond pointing out the singular nature of the culprit for his movie's famed fucking up. (He does note that “When I first saw the movie, I remember talking to one of the studio heads and said, ‘I think we're in trouble,'” which suggests that he was not as enamored with Trank's initial, reportedly much more somber, cut of the film than the director himself was.) The actor mostly just sounds kind of wistful at the missed opportunity, saying of his co-stars (which included Kate Mara, Toby Kebbell, Jamie Bell and Michael B. Jordan) that “The casting, I thought, was spectacular. I love all those actors… It's unfortunate…because so many people worked so hard on that movie.”

Former “Dancing With the Stars” host Tom Bergeron has publicly apologized to season 27 champion Bobby Bones, following remarks he made about the radio host's 2018 win.

Earlier this week, Bones shared a video on Instagram revealing that he had returned his Mirrorball trophy to ABC after hearing comments from Bergeron that he found “hurtful.” The 45-year-old said the remarks made during a recent interview where Bergeron called Bones' win “surprising” and “took away the joy” from his time on the show.

“I try not to get my feelings hurt, especially about stuff like this, but this was hurtful,” Bones said in the video. “Not because of what was said, but who said it.”

Bergeron, who hosted DWTS from 2005 to 2020, reached out soon after to make things right, according to People. “Bobby, it wasn't my intention to hurt your feelings,” Bergeron wrote in a message shared publicly. “My ‘ouch' was based on my honest feeling that your win spoke to a need to address the balance between judge and viewer voting. I always felt bad that you and Sharna [Burgess] had to deal with the aftermath of that win and I certainly regret pouring any salt into that old wound.”

Bones' video quickly drew attention online, with fans flooding the comments to show their support and encouragement.

“Nobody works harder, you earned that W,” one user wrote. Another added, “If I was you, I would not have sent it back. You and @sharnaburgess worked incredibly hard and deserved it!”

Others praised the country radio host for his maturity in handling the situation. “Good for you!!! You're being the ‘bigger person' and speaking volumes with your actions rather than words,” one fan commented.

Bones thanked followers for their kindness and emphasized that he still looks back fondly on his time on the show. “I loved my time there,” he said, adding that his partnership with Sharna Burgess remains one of his proudest professional moments.

This isn't the first time Bones has reflected candidly on his DWTS experience. As reported earlier this year, he revealed on “The Trading Secrets” podcast that he went above and beyond in rehearsals during season 27 — sometimes practicing extra hours alone after filming sessions. “I was so far behind everybody else,” he said, explaining that his determination helped him and Burgess clinch the Mirrorball trophy despite being considered the underdog.

Bones' openness about his journey — from facing criticism to earning respect — has resonated with fans and fellow contestants alike. Bergeron's heartfelt apology and Bones' grace in accepting it marked a moment of mutual understanding that reminded viewers why the show's legacy continues to center on perseverance, connection, and growth.

As Bergeron put it best in his message to Bones, “I certainly regret pouring any salt into that old wound.”

“Dancing With the Stars” airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC and Disney+.

Week 9 of “Dancing with the Stars” Season 34 also coincided with the show's 20th anniversary. It was a special night for Robert Irwin, as he performed an emotional Foxtrot to “Footprints in the Sand” by Leona Lewis in honor of his late father, Steve Irwin.  The routine had been inspired by his sister, Bindi Irwin, and her dedication dance to their father when she competed on Season 21 alongside professional dance partner Derek Hough. 

But this wasn't Robert's only performance on the night, and his jive was so fun! 

Robert also scored his first perfect score of 40 out of 40, and the first of the season. Judges and fans at home were impressed with his dance alongside professional dance partner Witney Carson. Later in the evening, the wildlife conservationist returned to the ballroom to do his relay dance. This time it wasn't alongside Carson, but with Xochitl Gomez, who competed on and won Season 32 of DWTS. 

Irwin and Gomez performed a jive, and it was an energetic, fun routine. They won the relay over Alix Earle and Season 33 Mirrorball champ Joey Graziadei. A video of their performance was shared on the official “Dancing with the Stars” Instagram account, allowing fans to rewatch it and share their thoughts. 

“Robert Irwin & Xochitl Gomez and Alix Earle & Joey Graziadei dance the Jive to ‘Dance with Me Tonight' by Olly Murs. #DWTS20 #DWTS,” the caption of the video reads. The comment section has been flooded with excited fans' reactions. 

“Ughhh i love Robert and Xochitl so much!!! I knew they were gonna win they were just perfect!!” an excited fan shared. “The chemistry between xochitl and Robert is undeniable and Soo cute. Fantastic partnership and dance!!” another person shared. 

Other reactions include, “Robert and Xochitl were soooo good!!!,” “robert and xochitl KILLED IT. so cute! and so so clean and technically good, too! just plain fun and adorable, couldn't stop smiling,” and “Go Xochitl!!!  and Robert is such a natural with the Jive!” 

The performance was a more playful part of the evening compared to Irwin's beautiful but emotional Foxtrot, and he had previously shared a look into his bond with Gomez. In a video posted on Instagram on November 11, the pair shared a hilarious skit as Irwin mimed to a voiceover. The clip didn't highlight their dance abilities, but it did show they both have a great sense of humor. “My dance knowledge has reached a new high with a mirrorball winner in the rehearsal room! @_xochitl.gomez,” the caption reads. 

“So funny. I'm gonna miss all these funny videos after u win,” a fan wrote. “The perfect pair!!!” another person shared.

The past year has been full of wonderful surprises for country music legend and “The Voice” coach Reba McEntire, from her NBC sitcom being renewed for a second season to getting engaged to longtime love (and “Happy's Place” co-star) Rex Linn. 

On November 11, 2025, McEntire, 70, got another surprise. Reps from her record label, MCA, and “Happy's Place” cast members threw the queen of country an unexpected party on the set of her sitcom. The celebration marked 50 years since she signed her first record deal, with Mercury Records, back on November 11, 1975. 

To mark 50 years of memories in showbiz, McEntire was surprised in front of a studio audience with a giant cake emblazoned with her name, a huge plaque honoring 50 years of accomplishments, tons of balloons, and many of her colleagues wearing t-shirts featuring one of her 32 album covers. 

“Reba's impact on country music is immeasurable,” MCA CEO Mike Harris said in a statement. “For 50 years, she's set the standard for artistry, authenticity, and work ethic — inspiring generations of artists and fans alike. It's an incredible honor for all of us at MCA to celebrate this milestone with her and continue the journey with one of the most defining voices in our genre.”

According to MCA, McEntire has sold over 58 million records worldwide, with hits including “Fancy,” “Survivor,” and “Whoever's in New England.” She is the only female country solo artist to have scored a number one hit in four consecutive decades (1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s).

McEntire has shelves full of awards, too. Over her career, she's won 16 ACM Awards, 15 American Music Awards, nine People's Choice Awards, six CMA Awards, and three Grammys. And in February, she could win her fourth Grammy, since she just received her 18th nomination. McEntire is up for the Best Country Duo/Group Performance for her collaboration on “Trailblazer” with Miranda Lambert and Lainey Wilson.

The last year hasn't been all sunshine for McEntire. In early August, she lost her cherished stepson, Brandon Blackstock, whom she helped raise with her ex-husband Narvel Blackstock. Brandon, who was also married for several years to “The Voice” coach Kelly Clarkson, died at age 48 following a two-year battle with melanoma. 

But his passing has made it all the more clear to McEntire that now is a time to reflect on where she's been, enjoy the present moment, and be grateful for the gifts in her life. 

“I think I'm happier now than I've ever been in my life,” she told People in late October. “It's amazing. It's wonderful being 70 and getting to do what I get to do at the level I want to do it.”

McEntire stars on NBC's “Happy Place” on Friday nights and on season 28 of “The Voice” on Monday nights.

Bobby Bones competed on “Dancing with the Stars” Season 27 in 2018. Despite not being the most talented dancer on the show, he won the Mirrorball Trophy thanks to the incredible support of his fans and for giving the ABC dance competition his best effort. Bones is a likable guy. However, his win alongside professional dance partner Sharna Burgess has been somewhat controversial. 

In an interview with Parade, beloved former DWTS host Tom Bergeron was asked what had “shocked” him the most during his time on the show, and he responded that the event that shocked him the most was Bones' win. The comments upset Bones, who responded with a TikTok video. “This was hurtful,” Bones said. “And not because of what was said, but really who said it.” He also claimed he would be returning his Trophy. 

Not wanting to cause Bones hurt, Bergeron issued a public apology on Instagram on November 12. In his message, he wrote, “I was doing so many interviews leading up to the [DWTS 20th anniversary], I was bound to say something inelegantly. Sorry, Bobby. Sometimes I should fall back on my mime training.” 

The post's comment section was flooded with reactions, some of which Bergeron responded to. It was in one of these comments that he made a brilliant offer to ensure that Bones and his Mirrorball Trophy find their way back to each other. 

In the comment section, fans have shown their support for Bergeron, sharing that what he said was not said with malice. “Tom. You spoke on something that everyone has been talking about. BUT Bobby's win and Andy's progress through the weeks shows that this show is about the public view,” a comment reads. “It's about who is likable. I'm sad that he felt the need to send his trophy back, but i also understand that he's been talked about poorly since his win.”

The comment attracted attention from fans, was liked over 400 times, and prompted Bergeron to respond. “I'd like to offer to personally return his trophy to him. On my dime,” he wrote. 

Fans applauded this response, with reactions including, “this is why you were the BEST host,” “Another reason we love you. You have the biggest heart, and just speak what we all are thinking. Praying Bobby will feel the support and healing love,” and “you should.”

If you're among the many who discovered L.A. pop duo After on social media in the last few months, you probably did a double take when you noticed that their two self-titled EPs were released this very year. Vocalist Justine Dorsey and producer Graham Epstein—often pictured together looking exactly like Frou Frou's Details photo shoot—are the closest thing we have to Y2K time travelers, but that's not really a compliment. Their debut cashes in on culture's nostalgic obsession with strictly faithful recreations of several radio-friendly subgenres of the early '00s. Though the out-of-time aesthetics are impressive, After's limp and unimaginative rehashes have little to offer beyond the novelty of hearing these styles done all over again.

Consider “300 dreams” and “Deep Diving,” the interchangeable breakbeat pop tracks that open each EP. Dorsey told Rolling Stone that “300 dreams” represents her attempt at a “Coldplay coded” song. Breakbeat-based Coldplay should be a fascinating concept, but After opt for the laziest possible execution. Dorsey sounds a bit like a femme Chris Martin as she sings faux-inspirational verses contrasted by a downer hook (“Oh, look at the state of me/I'm always falling down”). The chord progression sounds like it could have been lifted from “Clocks” or “Speed of Sound.” Breakbeats, Coldplay songs, and pop choruses are exactly as you remember them, each element as inert as a museum display. “Deep Diving” repeats the formula, except the lyrics evoke a CD skipping (“All the stones on the beach, and the shells on the beach, and the sand in your teeth”), and with no anthemic final chorus, it ends abruptly after the bridge.

Lackadaisical songwriting decisions like this fracture the nostalgic lull. EP 2's “Where we are now” tries to tell a story of everyday longing similar to Frou Frou's “Hear Me Out,” but exchanges the central metaphor of waiting on hold for something even more circular (“Wherever we're walking/I'll see you at the end somehow/That's where we are now”). Unsurprisingly, Dorsey and Epstein hardly touch the emotion apparent in Imogen Heap and Guy Sigsworth's performances. “Close your eyes,” the EP 2 closer, evokes Speak for Yourself's yearning technoromantic ballads at five percent power, but while the drums and breathy vocals may be superficially similar, the brilliance of a song like “Just for Now”—the reason Heap can yell “shut up” and then softly whisper that she's “on your side” in the next breath—is its emotional dynamism. Dorsey's robotic ponderings just meander over Epstein's zombified version of the ROMpler-based affective synthwork from the 2003 visual novel that inspired their band name.

After's lifeless consistency gives little impression that time travel is any fun. EP 1's “Obvious” is immaculate-sounding mall rock, but it lacks all the personality and snotty affect that makes an early-2000s classic like “Complicated” so great. Dorsey gives us nothing as entertaining as an Avril Lavigne hit or as heartfelt as a Michelle Branch ballad—she just sings. And when staccato string hits à la Vanessa Carlton's “A Thousand Miles” bookend the chorus, it feels like a nostalgic formality rather than a worthy addition.

Truly great retro music isn't made by time travelers but by artists whose interpretation of the past remains compelling and productive in the present. PC Music resurrected passé sound artifacts in order to simultaneously embrace and critique consumer culture with varying degrees of irony—a terrifying word to After—and someone like Danny L Harle has parlayed this experience into work on tracks like Caroline Polachek's “Blood and Butter” and “Billions,” where unironic anachronisms artfully commune with contemporary aesthetics. After's version of unironic anachronism is more like insultingly ignorant bliss. EP 2's “Outbound”—a uniformly positive pick-me-up anthem that promises you'll feel better after your friend “take(s) you to the movies, then take(s) you to the park”—fetishistically embraces the sounds of faux-optimism that left a prior generation of young people blindsided by late capitalism.

With no substance under its surface, After's pitch-perfect Y2K imitation doesn't amount to more than a viral trend. Perhaps the music's nostalgic presentation puts you at ease, but its profound lack of purpose in the present can't justify the effort to revive it. This is pop's Crystal Pepsi—a gloriously ephemeral product of our memories that came back tasting like absolutely nothing.

Pop music is trapped in a funhouse mirror. Borrowing has never been more in vogue. Halloween is now one expensive, unsettling lookalike contest in which celebrities pose as other, usually deceased, celebrities. The song that currently holds this decade's record for most weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 chart is an almost word-for-word interpolation of a hit from the first Bush administration. The recent past haunts our Instagram feeds and Spotify algorithms with the disturbing possibility that there really is nothing new under the sun. Repurposing a phrase from the Marxist scholar Franco Berardi, the late critic Mark Fisher referred to this phenomenon as “the slow cancellation of the future.” This is the dark side of nostalgia, the notion that the march of progress—whether in social movements or music—has slowed to a halt.

Asha Lorenz and Louis O'Bryen have made a home in this uncanny valley. Over their nearly decade-long career, the two primary songwriters for London's Sorry have embraced the tension between past and present, shining a floodlight on their references rather than burying them in the mix. Across two albums and a collection of EPs, the group—which also includes Lincoln Barrett on drums, Campbell Baum on bass guitar, and Marco Pini on electronics and production—has nabbed song titles from Oasis and refashioned lyrics from Tears For Fears and Death Cab for Cutie in their wry, neurotic image.

On their third album, fittingly titled COSPLAY, Sorry try on new personas—UGK MC, folk troubadour, dark ambient chanteuse—without the veil of irony they once used to keep listeners at a remove. Unpredictable, sensuous, and slightly spooky, COSPLAY captures the disquieting sounds of a foregone future.

In the spirit of plunderphonic predecessors like the Avalanches and the Books, Sorry takes a cut-up approach to pop culture. “Jetplane” flips a Guided By Voices hook, some dial tone, and a taut breakbeat into a frenzied battle cry: “Arrest me! I'm a hot freak!” On “Waxwing,” backed by a Twilight Zone synth and industrial feedback, Lorenz transforms Toni Basil's coquettish one-hit wonder “Mickey” into something altogether more salacious. “Love Posture” could be the band's answer to Nine Inch Nails' “Closer,” the bass humming as Lorenz sings about the things lovers do on all fours. (And that's not to overlook the band's 2022 song actually called “Closer,” an emo slow burn with decidedly fewer references to animalistic abandon.)

COSPLAY revels in distinctly human flaws: The false start on the theatrical piano number “Magic;” Lorenz's vocal rasp on the rowdy “Today Might Be the Hit;” the way her voice loses and finds the beat on the profane, Elton John-indebted “Candle.” A porous mix of influences and imperfections, the album captures the uneasy sensation of grasping for something concrete in a world that stubbornly defers meaning.

Sorry falters when they try to nail down specifics. A tossed off line about reactionary Japanese philosopher and poet Yukio Mishima on “Into The Dark” and anesthetized single-word repetitions on “Echo” threaten to flatten Sorry into just another group of Zoomer nihilists dreaming of extinction. But this being a Sorry record, a few seconds of a discordant guitar or a percussive clash will shift the mood again.

It might be tempting to compare Sorry, a brash duo equally versed in shitposts and postmodernity, to an American counterpart like 100 gecs. Both groups delight in muddying cultural hierarchies; both make art that is simultaneously an homage and an affront to the 21st century's “crushing sense of finitude and exhaustion,” as Fisher once wrote.

But the final song on COSPLAY, “Jive,” sets Sorry apart from hyperpop's anarchic whimsy. Building slowly from a single downbeat, “Jive” goes through multiple episodes: a sumptuous R&B groove, a bratty outburst of electroclash, and what sounds like a marching band of misfits. Lorenz is steady throughout these shifts, repeating the song's refrain like a mantra. Where gecs might pull back before the song's emotional pitch, Sorry leans in, free from pastiche or ironic detachment. “I wanna jive tonight,” Lorenz sings, and for a moment, the future seems to stretch out forever.

These days, I have a hard time going back to a lot of old Chicago drill. Sure, a handful of the best rap songs and mixtapes of the 2010s came from that scene, but fire up vintage Zacktv interviews or D Gainz and A Zae Production music videos and it's like sitting through an in memoriam segment: nothing but decade-old clips of teenagers and early twentysomethings who are now dead, in jail, experiencing mental health issues, or exiled from their hometown. They could've been or They should've been is how most of the comments read underneath the clips. One of the last few standing to tell the story is G Herbo, maybe the hardest rapper of the entire generation.

I'm not normally a you-had-to-be-there type of guy, but when G Herbo first hit YouTube as Lil Herb—a scrawny, Polo-wearing 16-year-old kid with the burly voice of a cigarette-smoking grown man—the explosive rhymes of “Kill Shit” and “Gangway” had my New York City high school on lock. Back then, outside of Wayne and Meek Mill, it was rare that our anthems were by out-of-towners, but to this day a lot of my friends still talk about Herb with the gravitas NBA prospects do Paul George. Looking back it makes sense—compared to, say, the Gucci-like numbness of Chief Keef or the Bone Thugs-lite rap-sing of Lil Durk, Herb's Southern influences (Three 6 Mafia and Project Pat; I've never heard him talk about Houston rap but sometimes the hulking rasp of his voice makes me think about the Screwed Up Click dudes) were dusted with streaks of East Coast traditionalism. If he'd been born 10 years earlier he might've been wreaking havoc on jacked beats with Major Figgas. That combination has given him the flexibility to adapt to the fast-moving micro-eras of rap and gradually shift his perspective as he's gotten older.

Freshly 30, G Herbo keeps on growing along with his music on Lil Herb, a loose concept album, mostly recorded in Chicago, that reflects on the original era of drill with a level of clarity that no other rapper has yet. Herb goes about that by tweaking the heat-of-the-moment POV of classic drill for one that puts him back in the shoes of his teenage self. It's almost like hearing the narrator of The Sandlot flash back to the summer that shaped his life.

Herb's storytelling is vivid and lived-in, oscillating between wistfulness for simpler times when he was hustling to get fly and all his friends were still alive and the anxiety of living through violence and disarray with a deep focus on the hard-earned lessons along the way. On “Give It All,” backdropped by a dreamy piano riff, he takes us through his entire childhood in two and a half minutes: From the days when he was a broke kid hooping, riding the bus, and hitting on girls at juke parties to losing his innocence with guns, beefs, and orgies. The pained inner monologue of the soulful “Fallen Soldiers” has a novelistic level of detail—you get the names, the locations, the conflicted emotions—as he struggles with how to respond to all the death around him. Sharpest of all is “Blitz,” where the hunger bursts from him like Dreamchasers 2-era Meek over a beat that smashes together ballistic drums and nonstop gunshots. The choice to rap over spraying bullets is as mesmerizingly cool as it is eerie, like it's a memory he can't shake.

The knock I have on almost all of G Herbo's studio albums, though, is that they take the idea of being an album too seriously, meaning there's notes hit for no reason except that's what big albums are supposed to do. On Lil Herb, it's stuff like “Every Night,” the sweeping choir intro that flat-out explains all of the emotions he'll be dealing with on the record. I'd much rather listen to “Radar,” which has writing that ties those feelings to specific scenes: “You ever lived through a nightmare?/Look death in the face, he might stare/Somebody try and kill you right there/You can't depend on nothin' but Nike Airs.” Then there's the obligatory radio cuts like the Jeremih-assisted ode to his girl “Whatever U Want” and “Thank Me,” with Anderson .Paak, which has the cutesiness of Coloring Book. His heart doesn't seem in them, which is not the case with the two-hander he pulls off with Wyclef Jean by just rapping hard as fuck like he normally does.

If I were arguing with someone in a bar about how good of a rapper I believe G Herbo to be, I probably wouldn't use any of his albums as the sole example. I think of him almost like I do Jadakiss, where the catalog is as much and maybe even more about the mix of pop and underground features, freestyles, and one-offs. There's a sense of humor and rhyme scheme playfulness infused into G Herbo's stories (like the ones on his mixtape from earlier this year, Greatest Rapper Alive, where he just rips a bunch of classic rap beats) that tends to be a little muted when it's time to go plaque-hunting.

But Lil Herb is as close as he's ever gotten to capturing that full picture. “Went Legit,” the biggest hit of his career despite having no hook, is full of sharp slice-of-life bars that are kinda funny and kinda real at the same time. On “Longevity,” Herb sounds like he's on a Kay Slay tape with the way he fools around with enunciation and spelling: “In a trap, 17, I touch C, D, and E/One of my brothers in a bing, just seen me on BET/Dropped out of everything and I ain't get no GED/Took myself off EBT, the crib look like a B&B.” He works in these stylish touches without losing sight of the album's message. “Think back, if it weren't for rap, where would I be instead?” he asks himself on the uptempo “Reason,” slightly switching up his flow to give an answer: “Probably jail, probably, probably dead, probably.” It's like one big sigh of relief.

Those silhouettes on the cover of Big city life? That's you and me! Smerz's latest and best album feels like it was made for projection. It's not designed to be relatable, that most cursed descriptor of meaningless contemporary pop, but to be lived in, tailored to your body, snagged on the pedal of a Lime bike. In that sense, it lends itself fabulously to a remix album, and so arrives Big city life EDITS, an album of sinuous reinterpretations that highlights the endless plasticity of Catharina Stoltenberg and Henriette Motzfeldt's voices and songwriting.

Across these 14 reworks, 18 acts write artful Smerz fan fiction: For the most part, the duo's voices are left intact, but layered atop sounds far removed from the original record's arch, deconstructed take on dance music. On Molina's discomfitingly sexy version of “Roll the dice,” Stoltenberg and Motzfeldt seem to have taken a wrong turn off the high street and into one of those crusty dive bars that only plays hypnotic European dub; the song's lyrics, so embodied and affirmative on the original, suddenly feel ominous, like you're being lured somewhere you're not supposed to be. The arty electroclash duo New York turn “Imagine this” into something that might have fit on After Dark 2, striking a perfect balance between high kitsch and high glamour.

If it can sometimes feel like “alternative” pop is simply real pop music that's kind of unfinished—like, music that uses avant-garde texture or structure to hide a dearth of coherent ideas—Big city life EDITS proves that Stoltenberg and Motzfeldt's songs have strong bones. The Copenhagen singer Fine plays “A thousand lies” straight: It's just her voice atop a loose, jazz-folk arrangement, and it sounds like a lost cut from the Norman Fucking Rockwell! sessions. It's not the only song on EDITS that conjures the spirit of Lana straight from the Bayou: On a rework of “You got time and I got money,” by Vilhelm Strange, Villads Tyrrestrup, Tobias Hansen, Zack Sekoff, and Jakob Littauer—credited here as VVTZJ—Clairo is a dead ringer for the singer circa Ultraviolence, warbling over an impossibly luxurious soul arrangement like a lounge singer playing her last show.

Fair play: A couple of informal tributes to the queen of idiosyncratically romantic, atmospheric pop makes perfect sense on an album that also serves as a starting lineup of uncompro-pop's next generation. Big city life EDITS works so seamlessly—and feels so much like it's just another Smerz album—that it's easy to forget that it's also a feat of A&Ring that brings together more than a dozen of the most interesting and talented producers currently working. I can imagine that, five to 10 years from now, teens will be posting the tracklist of Big city life EDITS on whatever newfangled social media platform I've dragged my lifeless body over to and asking “How did Smerz get MIKE, Erika de Casier, Astrid Sonne, and haloplus+ all on the same album?” At which point I will smile to myself, delete my account, and hit play on “You got time and I got money – VVTZJ EDIT,” happy that I got to witness it in the moment.

Pebe Sebert — mother of Kesha and a singer-songwriter who's collaborated with Dolly Parton, Miley Cyrus, and more — has announced her self-titled debut album, scheduled to arrive Dec. 12.


	The artist revealed the news Thursday on social media with the simple caption, “Pebe Sebert. My one and only album,” alongside a pre-save link to streaming services. Hours before the announcement, Sebert dropped “City's Burning,” the third single from the upcoming project, following previously released tracks “Vampire” (2021) and “Hard Times Ahead” (2022).


	The record is set to span 11 songs and showcases Sebert's original recordings from the Eighties. Kesha will release her mother's debut LP under her own eponymous label Kesha Records, which dropped the “Joyride” singer's sixth album, (Period.), in July.


	“I grew up in the studio, watching my mom turn her life into songs. These moments became stories. these stories are her life,” penned Kesha, who's regularly worked with her mother throughout her career, on X. “She wrote an album before I was born. This was the only album she made as an independent artist before focusing her life on raising her children and writing songs for other people.”

	Kesha continued, “I grew up watching this alchemy, and I only became who I am because of the road she paved before me. I'm so proud to finally release my mom's debut album on KESHA RECORDS, and I'm so proud of her release today !”

	











	During the release of “Vampire” in 2021, Sebert opened up about her struggles with substance abuse and how it affected her work. “I felt like this song had died along with my career as a recording artist when my life fell off the tracks due to drug and alcohol abuse in the middle of recording my debut album, I grieved the loss of my recording career and this music I was so proud of,” Sebert said in a statement at the time. “Last year I found these tapes in a dusty box in my basement and Guy [Roche] was nice enough to help me bring them back to life and it's very fulfilling to finally release this.”

Jimmy Kimmel Live! was hit by tragedy this week when bandleader Cleto Escobedo III died from an undisclosed illness. “To say that we are heartbroken is an understatement,” Kimmel said in a statement. “Cleto and I have been inseparable since I was nine years old. The fact that we got to work together every day is a dream neither of us could ever have imagined would come true.” (Watch Kimmel's 22-minute monologue tribute here.) The gig was also a dream for Jimmy Kimmel Live! keyboardist/musical arranger Jeff Babko, who worked alongside Escobedo for over 30 years, and considered him one of his closest friends. Babko hopped on the phone with Rolling Stone to look back at their time together. 


	I don't think I've ever seen television like Jimmy's monologue the other night. It was something else. We were all feeling a lot, and I think it really showed what kind of family Jimmy created over there. If it's not legit blood family, it's one step removed. It's pretty deep. And with Cleto gone, it's all hitting hard. These events — the good ones and the bad ones — show our little show-family at its closest. It's not making it easy.

	I met Cleto in 1994. I was just out of college, on my first tour with Julio Iglesias. We'd play Caesars Palace a few times a year in the old Circus Maximus ballroom, the last of the old Vegas rooms still standing. Cleto's dad was the valet, the butler backstage. Sammy Davis Jr. had gotten him that job years before, and Julio absolutely loved him. Cleto Sr. spoke Spanish, understood Julio in ways most people didn't — his needs, his personality. He introduced himself to me right away, the friendliest guy, and he treated us musicians with this deep respect when most people treated us like the help. Only later did I learn he had been a musician himself, which explained everything.

	











	Every time I was backstage, Cleto Sr. would tell me, “You gotta meet my son. He's in L.A. He's new to town. You're the L.A. guy.” And then I came home and started following this band, Cecilia Noel and the Wild Clams. Wild is an understatement. Part Latin, part funky L.A. music, part simulated sex show, part complete insanity. Monday nights, Thursday nights — I was there every chance I got. Cecilia eventually asked me to join; I didn't need rehearsal. I'd memorized the whole show just by being in the room.

	And Cleto Jr. was in that band. Singing, playing sax. We really bonded there. One night after a gig, we all ended up at Jerry's Famous Deli in Studio City. Cleto was holding court with the backup singers, telling horrible stories about his ex-girlfriend, animated and loose and hilarious. And I remember thinking, How do I not know this guy? He liked the way I played, especially the wah-wah pedal I used on keyboards. We kind of found each other right away — instant click. We became inseparable from that Jerry's Deli moment.


	We started doing everyday life together — cotton commercial auditions with the whole 13-piece band shoved into a tiny casting office (the band didn't get the spot, but the overweight trumpet player did, which we thought was hilarious). We were broke together. If one of us needed $100 to get through the weekend, whoever had it loaned it. We ended up in the same apartment building — he was downstairs, I was upstairs. We hung out constantly. We built a little act at Café Cordiale on Ventura Blvd. in Sherman Oaks, playing twice a month for six years. He was too humble to make a fool of himself onstage, and I had no problem doing that for both of us. That little band became the nucleus of the Cletones.


	By the early 2000s, our Cordiale gig had become a kind of valley sensation — part middle-aged pickup joint, part musicians hang, and absolutely packed. Rumor was Jimmy Kimmel was going to get his own show after The Man Show ended. One night Jimmy came in with [executive] Lloyd Braun from ABC. We did our act — R&B, Stevie Wonder, Rufus, some bizarre Borscht Belt rock-and-roll humor. Lloyd stayed for three songs, smiled, left. Next thing we knew, we had a gig. This was late 2002.

	Cleto was out with Marc Anthony at the time, and I was juggling touring with Toto and working on The Martin Short Show. But the call came: help build the show open, figure out the music. We all knew most shows aren't built to last — three weeks and gone. But we knew we loved Jimmy, and we knew we loved Cleto. We were all in.

	











	The early days of Kimmel were chaos. Total party. The green room was a party. The show was trying to be what late night really was in Hollywood, which, it turns out, is not sustainable. We'd get three-week, six-week, nine-week pickups. The smell of pizza at rehearsal meant celebration: We got renewed again. That was how we lived. Two years in, it started to feel like maybe we would stick around.


	Cleto had zero experience as a bandleader. None. If you asked him, he'd say, “I just hired the baddest motherfuckers I know and hoped for the best.” And that's exactly what he did. Thankfully, Toshi [Yanagi],and I had done the Martin Short Show, the Wayne Brady Show, a few pilots — we had enough TV tricks to keep the train on the tracks. And Cleto trusted us. Always. He hired people he knew knew more than he did, which made him the best kind of leader.


	Watching him with his dad was something beyond words. His dad had hung up his horn to get a steady job, to raise a family. He hung up his dreams. So when he picked up that horn again — because his son was giving him the stage he deserved — it was powerful. Music did what words could never do. It was soul-to-soul transmission. All of us — me, Toshi, Junior — we're only children. That bond with a parent is deep. The three of them had this magic triangle. When Senior played with Junior, it was like watching someone step back into the life they were meant to live.


	Musically, Cleto loved groove. He loved Stevie Wonder, Rufus, Donny Hathaway, Tower of Power, Sting. He loved the truth. His playing was soulful, genuine — no math, no patterns, no cerebral showing-off. Just purpose and soul. Every note meant something.


	We connected deeply on early Late Night With David Letterman — Paul Shaffer, Steve Jordan, Hiram Bullock. If you shared that OG Letterman DNA, you instantly understood each other's humor, timing, worldview. Letterman was our connective tissue. It fast-tracked me into his life, and honestly into Jimmy's.


	As the show evolved, our music evolved. Early on we were trying to pilfer the KROQ playlist — Queens of the Stone Age, Foo Fighters — instrumental versions that kept the energy young. But as the show grew up, we leaned into what two saxophones are supposed to do. A little more classy, a little jazzier. And Cleto always trusted me to write music that featured what we did well. He gave us freedom. If I needed to miss a show to record a film score, he insisted I go. “You never know how long a show will last,” he'd say. He was never threatened. He just wanted his people to shine.

	











	And now — now that he's gone — it's hard to imagine coming back without him. For decades, Toshi, Cleto, and I could communicate entire conversations with a single look. Cultural opposites, but an only-children family. One of us is missing now.


	The end was brutal. He got sick, and I won't go into details, but I've never seen doctors and nurses love a patient like they loved him. He knew every RN, every tech, every doctor. Even when he couldn't communicate, they experienced Cleto through us. They felt his spirit. I've never seen medical professionals break down like that. It was a testament to him — his kindness, his light.


	Jimmy got everything right in that monologue, except one thing: it was a BB gun, not a shotgun, shooting down kites. Cleto corrected that story eight times. But Jimmy painted the picture. Cleto was humble. He wanted respect, but hated attention. Hard place to live. Those who knew, knew. And he got his flowers.

	Standing next to his dad during that monologue… I've never had to try that hard to be the strong one. His dad showed up in a suit, with his horn, ready to play. We played Grover Washington — the solo Cleto had air-saxophoned in his hospital bed just a week earlier. We played a song Cleto and I wrote for his mom 30 years ago. And we were going to play “Hard Times” by Ray Charles. I said to Senior: “That's kind of your song, are you OK to play it? I thought we would play it without a sax, just as a tribute to you guys.” And his dad said, “You know, Jeff, I always hoped that he would play this when I died. This is wrong. It wasn't supposed to go this way. But I have to play this for Junior.” And he played like I've never heard anyone play.


	So we know this wasn't by choice. He fought until the bitter end to stay here for his family. Last night, his wife said, “I never wanted to do this alone.” And I said, “You couldn't be less alone.” He spent a lifetime building friendships — deep, wide, loyal friendships. A chosen brotherhood. And I'm just so lucky I got to be his friend.

	Much like American democratic ideals, pop's creative vanguard has largely been flourishing outside the U.S. these days. Rosalia's Lux, to cite 2025's most vivid example, moves music vernacular forward by looking backwards to old-world virtuosity and spirituality. FKA Twigs' EUSEXUA, meanwhile, found her leaning into brave new worlds: AI, virtual spaces, digitized ecstasy and body modification — all things making humans meta-human, for better or for worse.


EUSEXUA Afterglow finds Twigs doubling down on the personal cybernetic project she's been engineering since 2014's sublime vibrator “Two Weeks.” Originally conceived as a set of extras for the EUSEXUA deluxe edition, Afterglow is being released as a stand-alone LP, which is fair enough; its 11 tracks are all fresh cuts, as opposed to remix packages a la Charli XCX's Brat and It's Completely Different but Also Still Brat and Pink Pantheress' Fancy Some More? If you hear echoes of those artists in Twigs latest work, you can hear echoes of her in theirs, too — the context of a dazzling UK pop generation born in rave culture's golden era and, well, afterglow.

	Pink Pantheress turns up on EUSEXUA Afterglow, in fact, on “Wild and Alone,” a softly percolating banger that posits fame as a perpetual relationship hurdle without getting too upset about it. Elsewhere on this horny, party-hardy set, relationships seem beside the point. “Lost all my friends in the club/ then i lost my mind in the car/ i don't even remember who you are,” Twigs purrs woozily on “Lost All My Friends,” a sort of sequel to Pink Pantheress' “Illegal” delivered over smeared downtempo beats that shift in and out of focus. “Slushy” feels like the offspring of Kate Bush's “Deeper Understanding” after 30+ years of computer love, a swirl of harp and high-hat spectres under ASMR positivity mantras.

	











	Admittedly, there's nothing here as sticky as EUSEXUA's “Sticky,” let alone “Childlike Things,” “Room of Fools” or “Drums of Death.” Afterglow is strongest when the beats are sickest, which is roughly midway through, when things peak with the tag-team of “Predictable Girl” and “Sushi,” a head rush of junglist bass growls and breakbeat abstracts. It's heady, after-the-afterparty stuff — dance music for folks maybe too far gone to stay vertical, let alone dance. But Twigs, reliably, is about pushing one's limits, so you might just find yourself rising to the occasion.

Kacey Musgraves and Carín León brought a touch of Nashville to the Latin Grammys in Las Vegas. During Thursday night's ceremony at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, the música mexicana star was joined by the Nashville queen for a performance of their bilingual collaboration, “Lost in Translation.”


	Dressed in his classic tall sombrero, León opened his performance solo with his sweet ballad “Ahí Estabas Tú” from Palabra de To's, backed by the strums of the requinto. Then, Musgraves emerged on a second stage in a sparkly black dress as they transitioned into “Lost in Translation” and sang the love song to each other, trading verses in Spanglish.

	The Latin-country duo released “Lost in Translation” on Aug. 29 about a love that defeats language barriers. Musgraves and León co-wrote the song alongside Amy Allen and Shane McAnally, with Julian Bunetta and Matt Zara serving as producers.


	Musgraves previously said of their collab, “Growing up singing traditional country and western music, I've always loved exploring the borders of Country and where it blends with other styles like norteño and some regional Mexican sounds that I heard a lot of in Texas.”

Nightcrawler Research, a data-focused UFO investigation team, reports capturing footage of three unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in New York. In each case, the citizen journalists say the objects disrupted camera performance during recording. They further disclosed that their efforts have drawn attention from the FBI and other federal agencies.

During an interview with host Ross Coulthart on NewsNation's “Reality Check,” Nightcrawler Research's John Tedesco revealed that one of the UFO sightings they captured on video in New York took place July 5. (RELATED: Mysterious ‘Crop Doodle' Spotted In Argentine Wheat Field)

“This was an object that presented over the water. Initially, what we saw was something that, roughly about 600 feet from the surface off the Atlantic Ocean, we saw an object that was not very luminous, very, very low, low light, not really in the IR, some visible light was present, and we noticed that the light presented in the same basic area, the same area of the sky,” said Coulthart.

“Within a short period of time, that object disappeared, and we saw this, what looked like a sphere on the water, an extremely bright, luminous sphere.”



Later in the conversation, the research team described additional UFO encounters. In one instance, they captured footage of an object seemingly entering and exiting the water. They also detailed another sighting involving a number of black triangular crafts, which they detected inside a cloud and recorded using radar.

Coulthart questioned the team whether or not federal agencies, such as the FBI, have been treating their reported UFO sightings seriously, with Tedesco responding, “Absolutely. It's an ongoing thing with them. They're certainly very concerned about it. And, you know, our communication, it's been ongoing.”

Marnik light the torch for their next musical chapter with ‘The Ritual', a wrecking ball of energy that brings their epic techno sound even further to the forefront. Set for release on Zeitgeist, – sublabel of Intercord Records, the newly revitalized Virgin Records Germany and home of harder dance genres –, the single sees Marnik continue to stake their claim as one of the most fearless and in-demand acts on the current techno circuit. Out now, ‘The Ritual' has officially begun, all that's left is to answer the call.

From its opening bars, ‘The Ritual' locks into a ceremonial chant and entrancing beat, highlighting the larger than life nature of Marnik's epic techno sound. The speedometer clocks in at a scolding 150BPM, with the track pushed to even bolder heights with ripping synths and a kinetic low-end that insists on walking the edge of insanity. In all, it makes for a perfect debut with Zeitgeist as part of Intercord Records (the newly renamed Virgin Records Germany), as both the duo and the label set their creative sights on the harder side of the electronic spectrum.

The release arrives as Marnik extend a decade-long run that's surpassed one billion streams and taken them to some of the world's biggest stages, from Tomorrowland in Belgium to Ushuaïa in Ibiza. Their upward trajectory shows no signs of slowing, with ‘The Ritual' acting as a guiding light as they continue to climb the stairs of success. This month, they take that momentum eastward, bringing their explosive sound to Sri Lanka and Indonesia for a duo of shows that promise to turn ‘The Ritual' into reality.



Italian duo Marnik are one of the most prominent and influential names in electronic music today. Over the course of their decade-long career, Alex and Lele have surpassed 1 billion streams, blending a relentless touring schedule with cutting-edge studio work to stay at the forefront of the global electronic scene. Manrik's unique approach sees Alex commanding the stage at premier festivals and clubs including Tomorrowland, Sunburn, Creamfields, Ushuaïa, Story Miami, as well as headlining tours across Europe and Asia.

Meanwhile, Lele focuses on crafting their sound in the studio, creating a seamless synergy between high-energy live performances and a steady stream of fresh releases. From global radio hits such as “Boyz In Paris” and “Gam Gam”, to genre-defining anthems like “Bazaar” and “Mandala,” Marnik's discography continues to resonate with fans worldwide. In 2025, Marnik achieved a career milestone, climbing to #80 in DJ Mag's Top 100, up 10 positions from the 2024 chart. The same year, the duo also launched their own label and imprint, ARENA, which is poised to make waves in the Electronic scene. Celebrating 10 years of innovation, Marnik are proving there's no limit to what's next.

Center Theatre Group will present Paranormal Activity with an original story based on Paramount Pictures' terrifying film franchise.

Production photos have been released from Center Theatre Group's presentation of Paranormal Activity, the new stage production with an original story inspired by Paramount Pictures' film franchise. 

Center Theatre Group will present Paranormal Activity with an original story based on Paramount Pictures' terrifying film franchise—now live on stage from November 13 to December 7 at the Ahmanson Theatre, the third attraction of the 2025–2026 season. The press opening is November 14. Tickets are available at CenterTheatreGroup.org.

Paranormal Activity, in its North American premiere production, is from Levi Holloway, who chilled Broadway audiences with his Tony Award-nominated Grey House in 2023, and Felix Barrett, pioneering founder and artistic director of the acclaimed Punchdrunk, whose immersive Sleep No More played more than 5,000 performances in a record-breaking 14-year run in New York at The McKittrick Hotel. Barrett and Punchdrunk are currently represented in New York by Viola's Room at The Shed through October 19.

Paranormal Activity features illusions by Tony Award-winner Chris Fisher, whose work includes the West End and Broadway productions of Stranger Things: The First Shadow, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, and Back to the Future, along with the West End and Center Theatre Group productions of 2:22.

The North American premiere began at Chicago Shakespeare Theater from October 8 to November 2 before moving to the Ahmanson Theatre. Following Los Angeles, the production will be presented by Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, D.C. from January 28 to February 7, and American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco from February 19 to March 15.

The story follows James and Lou, who move from Chicago to London to escape the past but soon discover that places aren't haunted—people are. The cast includes Cher Álvarez, Patrick Heusinger, Shannon Cochran and Kate Fry.

Levi Holloway said, “Writing Paranormal Activity for the stage, collaborating with Felix Barrett in London—working to create an actual nightmare—has been a dream. We strived to create something impossible, mixing the familiar with the uncanny, heart with horror. Chicago audiences have a nose for honesty on stage and little patience for anything else. They'll find it here, right alongside all the mischief we've made to trouble their sleep.”

Playing Lou and James— a couple trying to escape a sinister force—are Cher Álvarez and Patrick Heusinger. Álvarez has appeared on television in Grey's Anatomy and NCIS: Hawai'i, and has performed at The Goodman Theatre, Steppenwolf Theatre and Writers Theatre, with additional credits at Milwaukee Repertory Theatre and American Players Theatre.

Heusinger has been seen on Broadway in Next Fall and Fiddler on the Roof and starred as Lancelot in the national tour of Spamalot. His television credits include Gossip Girl, Royal Pains and Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce.

The cast also includes Shannon Cochran as James' mother, Carolanne, and Kate Fry as Mrs. Cotgrave, a medium. Cochran's credits include the West Coast premiere of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child in San Francisco, the national tour of Roundabout Theatre Company's Cabaret, and the first national tour of August: Osage County. This production marks her return to the horror genre following her appearance in the 2002 film The Ring. Fry, whose many credits include Henry V, As You Like It, Henry IV Parts 1 and 2, and The Merchant of Venice at Chicago Shakespeare Theater, has recently appeared in The Cherry Orchard at Goodman Theatre and Birthday Candles at Northlight Theatre.

Levi Holloway is an ensemble member of A Red Orchid Theatre, which debuted his plays Grey House—later produced on Broadway—and Turret, starring Michael Shannon. He has performed as an actor with Lookingglass Theatre and Steppenwolf Theatre. Holloway is co-founder of the Neverbird Project, a youth-based deaf and hard of hearing theatre company that creates work for deaf audiences. He previously taught in the deaf department at Bell Elementary in Chicago for more than a decade and teaches playwriting at Silk Road Rising.

Felix Barrett is the founder and artistic director of Punchdrunk and has conceived and directed productions such as Sleep No More, The Burnt City and Viola's Room. He directed the critically acclaimed 2024 UK premiere of Paranormal Activity at Leeds Playhouse, which moves to the West End this winter.

The creative team includes Fly Davis (scenic and costume design), Anna Watson (lighting design), Gareth Fry (sound design), Luke Halls (video and projections design), Chris Fisher (illusions design), Bob Mason (casting), Travis A. Knight (assistant director), Camille Etchart (UK associate scenic designer), Frank McCollugh (US associate scenic designer), Abby May (US associate lighting designer), Will Pickens (US associate sound designer), Lianne Arnold (US associate video and projections designer), Skylar Fox (associate illusions designer), Daniel Weissglass (assistant illusions designer), Melanie J. Lisby (production stage manager), Julie Jachym (assistant stage manager) and Emma W. Lipson (production assistant).

 The enigmatic interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has captivated astronomers worldwide, and fresh observations have led some experts to speculate it may actually be an extraterrestrial spacecraft. 

The enigmatic interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has captivated astronomers worldwide, and fresh observations have led some experts to speculate it may actually be an extraterrestrial spacecraft.

Researchers noted a series of puzzling irregularities, including its survival of a close encounter with the Sun, enormous unexplained jets, and a peculiar “anti-tail,” News.Az reports, citing The Mirror.

Unlike typical comets, 3I/ATLAS remained intact and luminous after passing near the Sun, defying expectations.

Astronomers also detected an unusual radio signal emanating from the object, sparking speculation that it could be an alien vessel. Harvard professor Avi Loeb has suggested that the comet's strange behaviors—such as its anti-tail and twin jets—could be the result of “technological thrusters,” implying it might be a mothership from another planet.

Fresh images from the Nordic Optical Telescope, a 2.56-meter research telescope situated at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on the island of La Palma, Spain's Canary Islands showed that 3I/ATLAS continues to display a confounding ""anti-tail"".

The ""anti-tail"" was spotted as a streak of debris strangely pointing toward the Sun, even as the object races away from it.

3I/ATLAS is the enigmatic 'comet' that has captivated the globe in recent weeks.

Fresh observations now suggest it might actually be an extraterrestrial spacecraft. This speculation comes after researchers examined a string of puzzling irregularities, including its ability to survive a close encounter with the Sun, enormous unexplained jets, and a peculiar ""anti-tail"".

Just days ago, astronomers detected a strange radio signal from the mysterious interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS as it raced through our solar system, sparking wild theories that it could be an alien vessel. The so-called ""anomaly"" has left scientists stunned by enduring a scorching encounter with the Sun without falling apart - something no typical comet could achieve, reports the Daily Star.

Rather than breaking up, 3I/ATLAS appeared as one solid, luminous object, featuring a strange ""anti-tail"" and two massive jets shooting material in opposing directions - occurrences that experts claim violate the laws of physics.

Consequently, Harvard professor Avi Loeb has recently suggested these strange behaviors could be the result of ""technological thrusters"", implying the object might be a mothership from another planet.

Fresh images from the Nordic Optical Telescope, a 2.56-meter research telescope situated at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on the island of La Palma, Spain's Canary Islands showed that 3I/ATLAS continues to display a confounding ""anti-tail"".

The ""anti-tail"" was spotted as a streak of debris strangely pointing toward the Sun, even as the object races away from it.

Typically, a comet's tail streams behind, pushed by solar winds, but this weird reversal has left experts puzzled, with some proposing it's just an optical illusion, the Daily Mail reported.

In Montana's ancient rocks, scientists uncovered the tiny remains of a land-dwelling crocodyliform that challenges what we thought we knew about crocodile evolution.

Around 95 million years ago, a small crocodyliform affectionately called Elton roamed what is now southwest Montana, near the ancient shoreline of the Western Interior Seaway.

According to Montana State University paleontology professor David Varricchio, the juvenile measured less than 2 feet long from snout to tail—roughly the size of a large lizard. Even as an adult, it would have reached only about 3 feet in length, making it much smaller than most members of the Neosuchia clade, which includes modern crocodiles and their extinct relatives. Most of these species were aquatic or semi-aquatic predators equipped with simple, conical teeth suited for catching prey in the water.

Elton, however, was different. It lived on land and likely fed on plants, insects, or small animals, using its varied and specialized teeth to process a wider range of food. Its distinctive features revealed that it belonged to a newly identified family of crocodyliforms native to Cretaceous-era North America.

This remarkable discovery might never have happened without the keen observation of Harrison Allen, a 2023 graduate of MSU's Department of Earth Sciences in the College of Letters and Science. During a 2021 field excavation in the Blackleaf Formation near Dillon, Montana, Allen—then a student in Varricchio's paleontology course—spotted a tiny fossil, no larger than his pinkie tip, with a “weird texture on it.”

“I brought it to Dr. Varricchio and knew it must be something good, because he said, ‘Take me to where you found this,'” said Allen, who is now studying croc paleontology as a doctoral student at Stony Brook University in New York.

It was an exciting moment for Allen, originally from Kentucky, who chose MSU because it offers a paleontology track for undergraduates majoring in earth sciences. Four years and hundreds of hours of study later, he is the lead author of a paper published this week in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology that describes the morphology and scientific significance of the creature whose remains he found in the Blackleaf Formation.

“After the dig, Dr. Varricchio told me why he was so excited the day I found the initial specimen. It had so much visible anatomy to explore, and he could see it was a tiny, tiny croc skull, fully articulated and preserved – it was a special thing,” Allen said. “We have found dinosaurs (in the Blackleaf) before, but this was the second known vertebrate animal we'd ever found in this formation.”

The extinct animal, which Allen and the paper's co-authors later named Thikarisuchus xenodentes for its strange, sheathed teeth, has provided new information about the paleoecology of the Blackleaf ecosystem and about patterns of evolution in the croc family tree.

It also provided the ultimate undergraduate research project for Allen, who delved into the painstaking process of excavating, sifting, and reconstructing the Thikarisuchus remains with the help of some fellow students.

“As an undergraduate student new to research, I nervously went up to Dr. Varricchio and asked if I could study this specimen,” Allen said. “It led me down the rabbit hole into this amazing world of prehistoric, extinct crocs and their evolutionary niches.”

The day after Allen recovered the first piece of skeleton, he and his classmates scooped up several bags of sediment from the mound where it was found. Back in Bozeman, Allen and his friend Dane Johnson, who graduated in 2022 and is now a paleontology lab and field specialist at MSU's Museum of the Rockies, spent between 10 and 20 hours sifting out fine particulate matter and dirt, eventually recovering dozens of tiny pieces of the Thikarisuchus skeleton that collectively fit into the palm of Allen's hand. As they worked, they listened to music, including Elton John's 1970s hit “Crocodile Rock.” The nickname “Elton” stuck, long before the specimen was assigned the scientific name that reflects its physical traits.

Allen and Johnson recovered bits of bone from almost all areas of the animal's body, including its limbs, vertebrae, jaw and 50-millimeter-long skull. Because the fragments were tiny and exceptionally fragile, the students didn't attempt to physically reassemble them. Instead, they took them for a series of CT scans, including some at MSU's Subzero Research Laboratory. Allen estimates that he spent well over 100 hours coloring the digital, 2D segment slices that the scans produced, a process necessary to visually distinguish the bones from the rocks they were embedded in.

“Harrison worked super hard to digitally reconstruct the animal, and it came out beautifully,” said Varricchio.

During the process, Allen discovered that the bones of Thikarisuchus were densely concentrated and organized in a manner consistent with fossils of organisms found in burrows in the Blackleaf Formation and the nearby Wayan Formation in Idaho. He said this suggests that Thikarisuchus was likewise preserved within a burrow, further supporting the notion that fossils recovered from these formations are biased toward those that were preserved in burrows.

The specimen also presented clues about Thikarisuchus' newly named family group Wannchampsidae and a similar group found in Eurasia known as Atopasauridae. Both groups were tiny and terrestrially adapted, and they shared certain cranial and dental features found in another more distantly related group from the Cretaceous of Africa and South America.

“It suggests that during the same time period, we're seeing convergent evolution between two distantly related groups due to similar environmental conditions, prey availability, and who-knows-what that prompted crocs on opposite sides of the planet to develop similar features,” Allen said.

As he works toward his Ph.D. and a career as a paleontology professor, Allen said his experiences with Elton cemented his research interest, which has since broadened to include extinct crocs from all over the world.

“The majority of diversity of crocodyliforms is in the past. There were fully marine crocs, fully terrestrial crocs, herbivorous crocs, omnivores, and some that cracked shells,” he said. “That amazed me and made me want to get into this more specific realm of paleontology.”

Varricchio said he feels fortunate that students like Allen choose to study at MSU.

“It was a true pleasure to have Harrison as a student here – so much positive enthusiasm, followed up with great research,” he said.

By Vatican News

The Dicastery of the Doctrine of the Faith has determined that “the phenomenon of the alleged apparitions said to take place in Dozulé” linked to the creation of an enormous cross that would guarantee remission of sins and salvation to those who approached it, “is to be considered, definitively, as not supernatural in origin.”

The Dicastery's decision was communicated in a letter in a letter signed by the Prefect, Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernández, authorizing Bishop Jacques Habert of Bayeux-Lisieux to issue the relevant decree. The decision was approved by Pope Leo XIV on November 3.

In the French town of Dozulé, Jesus is said to have appeared 49 times between 1972 and 1978 to Madeleine Aumont, a mother, asking for the construction of the so-called “Glorious Cross of Dozulé,” which was never built. The cross was to be fully illuminated and reach a height of 738 meters, with arms measuring 123 meters, thus visible from far away as a sign of universal redemption. In recent decades, “Crosses of Love” have been erected in various countries around the world, scaled down to one hundredth of the size of the “Glorious” cross.

As early as April 1983, the then-diocesan bishop, Jean-Marie-Clément Badré, stated that “in no case can the construction of a monumental cross undertaken in Dozulé (...) be an authentic sign of the manifestation of the Spirit of God.” On December 8, 1985, the same bishop declared: “Regarding what is taking place at Dozulé—the activity and the agitation, the collection of funds by people acting on their own initiative, without a mandate and without respect for the authority of the Bishop; […] the fanatical propaganda in favor of the ‘message'; […] the categorical condemnation of those who do not adhere to it—I am led, in conscience, to judge that, beyond all this ferment, I do not discern the signs that would authorize me to declare the alleged ‘apparitions' to be authentic, nor to recognize a mission given to the Church to spread this ‘message.'”

On the basis of recent guidelines for discerning alleged supernatural phenomena, the current bishop, Bishop Habert, has requested authorization from the Dicastery to issue a declaratio de non supernaturalitate, that is that “the phenomenon of the alleged apparitions of Dozulé is not of supernatural origin.”

Cardinal Fernández's letter accepts the Bishop's proposal: “This Dicastery authorizes Your Excellency to draw up the corresponding Decree and to declare that the phenomenon of the alleged apparitions said to have taken place in Dozulé is to be regarded, definitively, as not supernatural in origin, with all the consequences that flow from this determination.”

The letter highlights a number of problematic elements in the messages associated with the phenomenon, including the comparison of “the cross requested in Dozulé with the Cross of Jerusalem,” which “risks confusing the sign with the mystery, and risks giving the impression that what Christ has accomplished once and for all could be “reproduced” or “renewed” in a physical sense.”

It is also notes that “some formulations contained in the alleged messages of Dozulé insist upon the construction of ‘the Glorious Cross' as a new sign, necessary for the salvation of the world, or as a privileged means of obtaining universal forgiveness and peace. At times, there is a mention of ‘multiplying the sign,' as if such diffusion were a mission given by Christ Himself.”

“The Cross does not need 738 meters of steel or concrete to be recognized,” the Dicastery declares. Rather, the Cross “is raised every time a heart, moved by grace, opens itself to forgiveness; every time a soul converts; every time hope is rekindled where the situation seemed impossible; and even when, by kissing a small cross, believers entrust themselves to Christ.”

It goes on to reiterate that “no private revelation may be considered a universal obligation or a sign binding the conscience of the faithful, even if spiritual fruits may accompany such phenomena. The Church encourages expressions of faith that lead to conversion and charity, but warns against every form of ‘sacralization of the sign' that leads people to consider a material object as a guarantee of salvation.”

The messages of Dozulé say that “all those who will have come to repent at the foot of ‘the Glorious Cross' will be saved,” that “‘the Glorious Cross' will take away all sin,” and that all those who “come there with faith to repent will be saved in this life and for eternity.” The Dicastery states emphatically that “such expressions are incompatible with the Catholic doctrine on salvation, grace, and the sacraments.”

The letter then points out other messages that have been disproven by events. One such message, for example, asked for the “Glorious Cross” and Shrine to be built before the end of the 1975 Holy Year, “for it will be the last Holy Year.” “Clearly, this purported prophecy was not fulfilled,” the Dicastery notes, as two other ordinary Holy Years (2000 and 2025) and two extraordinary Holy Years (1983 and 2016) have subsequently been celebrated.

The Dicastery also notes various apocalyptic statements which suggest the Lord's proximate or even imminent return, such as the one in which it is claimed that Jesus said: “If the cross is not erected, I will cause it to appear—but there will be no more time.”

“Although the theme of the Lord's return is an integral part of the Christian Faith,” the Dicastery says, “the Church—while recalling that Christ's return is a truth of the faith, even though no one can know or predict the precise date or its signs—remains alert against millenarian or chronological interpretations, which risk setting the time or determining the modalities for the Final Judgment.”

Concluding the letter, the Dicastery explains, “The cross, as a sign of devotion, is never mere exteriority. When Christians venerate the cross, they do not adore the wood or metal, nor do they think that a material cross can replace the saving work already accomplished in Christ's Paschal Mystery. Instead, they adore the One who offered His life upon it…The veneration of the Cross thus forms us in a tangible spirituality and an incarnate faith: not an abstraction, but a way of facing life with our gaze fixed upon the Crucified, recognizing in every trial the possibility of a redemptive encounter.”

Summary:

Kim Kardashian took the California bar exam after a six-year journey to become a lawyer in June 2025.

After calling psychics “pathological liars” in a TikTok video, Kim sparked reactions from fans and fellow celebrities.

While psychics have a long history, the rise of platforms like #WitchTok has made spirituality a viral trend.

Kim Kardashian has been on an unconventional six-year journey to become a lawyer, and in June 2025, she finally took the California bar exam. A long-time criminal justice reform advocate, she previously expressed confidence she had passed, though that confidence may have come more from her family's psychics than her studies. In a TikTok recap of her mother Kris Jenner's 70th birthday, Kim called the psychics “pathological liars”, sparking reactions from fans and highlighting a trend among celebrities like Khloé Kardashian, Jennifer Lopez, and Brad Pitt, who have all consulted psychics for guidance.

Psychics have fascinated people for centuries, from ancient temples to 19th-century parlors, and today, Gen Z has made the metaphysical world a viral trend on platforms like TikTok's #WitchTok. While many explore spirituality and alternative practices online, scammers have also taken advantage, with most readings focusing on money, love, and careers, making discernment crucial. Even so, some psychics, like Matt Fraser, suggest the spirit world operates on its own timeline — meaning Kim could still pass the bar, the next time she takes it.

The disclosure of emails from the paedophile financier has fuelled calls for the full release of FBI files on his case

It is 20 years since Florida police first investigated the financier Jeffrey Epstein for the sexual abuse of underage girls; six years since he killed himself in prison following his arrest on federal sex-trafficking charges; and more than a year since Donald Trump said that he would have “no problem” with releasing the FBI files on the offender.

As the Democratic politician Ro Khanna noted, releasing the files “was core to Trump's promise … It was his central theme that the American corrupt elite had betrayed forgotten Americans”. The question is not only what Epstein's associates did, but also what they knew and what they did not do. It is not only about their own behaviour, but about any knowledge or suspicion of his crimes, and willingness to overlook them.

Yet the Maga base is still waiting. Mr Trump has said that he had “no idea” about Epstein's crimes. On Wednesday, questions were reignited by the Democrats' release of emails in which Epstein described Mr Trump as “that dog that hasn't barked”, adding that “[victim's name redacted] spent hours at my house with him”. Republicans said the victim was the late Virginia Giuffre, who told lawyers that “I don't think Donald Trump participated in anything”. Separately, Epstein wrote that “of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine [Maxwell] to stop” and that “Trump knew of it” but “he never got a massage”.

Mr Trump, who has mainstreamed and legitimised conspiracy politics and the championing of emotion over fact, attacks the issue as a “hoax”. The very people who urged Maga supporters to pursue this story – such as Kash Patel, now FBI chief – abruptly changed their minds this year without adequate explanation. Republicans released thousands of documents in response to the emails published by Democrats. But Mr Trump faces a bipartisan demand for the full release of the files, with members of the Maga far right joining Democrats.

The Republicans took a drubbing in off-year elections last week, and Mr Trump's approval rating is the lowest of this term. The ending of the longest government shutdown in history – after a handful of Democrats folded on Wednesday – relieved the White House, but opens the way for a vote on releasing the files, expected next week.

Mr Trump has shaken off troubles that would have ended any other political career – including E Jean Carroll's successful civil suit against him for sexual abuse (which he is again asking the supreme court to dismiss) and two dozen allegations of sexual assault, which he denies. The full release of documents might aid him: the slow drip of information has kept the scandal running and made it look, rightly or wrongly, as if the administration has something worse to hide.

For the Maga base, previously fired up by lurid and false “Pizzagate” claims of a paedophile ring connected to the Democratic political elite, this remains a burning issue. Their claims about Epstein's circle have at times been partisan, provably wrong and antisemitic. Yet it's hard to deny that the mills of justice usually grind slower when the rich and well-connected are involved, and that powerful figures who benefited from a relationship with Epstein, such as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and Peter Mandelson, have sought to avoid scrutiny and minimise their ties. It took the courage of victims and dogged reporting to make Epstein accountable, and it took far too long. A fuller reckoning for his associates – from across the political spectrum – is overdue.

CLEAR

In a truly bonkers but entirely predictable turn of events, right-wing conspiracy theorists are transvestigating late political pundit, Charlie Kirk, and his widow Erika.

Perpetuated by anti-trans trolls, “transvestigations” rely on phrenology-like “evidence” of scrutinising physical features and bone structure to deduce someone's “true” sex, leaning on the false idea that “we can always tell”.

As first reported on by them, conspiracy theories around Erika Kirk started not long after her husband was shot and killed at a Utah university in September. Users across X, Facebook, and Reddit began theorising that her features, such as her “straight collar bones”, “low set ears”, and thigh gap indicated that she was an “invert”, as trans people are called in right-wing conspiracy circles.

Posts on the Facebook group “Transvestigation Disclosure NOW,” which has more than 53,000 members and multiple offshoot groups, return to these features repeatedly, referring to her as “Erik” or “Erik(a)”.

One video from an online creator questions why they're unable to find pregnancy photos of the former pageant queen, pointing to her “little boy hips”.

Even Charlie Kirk isn't safe in death, with people theorising that he may also be an “invert”, while others argue his entire family are, with one X user suggesting that his sister's clavicles could be an indicator of her secret transness.

“that's why Charlie Kirk seemed so feminine and emasculated because she was a transgender handler. That's why he was so pretty,” one user wrote, referring to the idea that trans people are controlled by “handlers” assigned by those at the top of the conspiracy.

Delving deeper into these forums and threads reveal more unhinged theories, from the idea that Erika was the victim of child trafficking, to more sinister, antisemitic rhetoric that play on ideas of the “new world order”.

Transvestigations are becoming more and more common as trans people are weaponised by those across the political spectrum, with seemingly anyone becoming a potential target.

Candace Owen, a far-right political commentator and friend of Charlie Kirk, is currently being sued by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and his wife Brigitte, after spending months harassing the pair and accusing Brigitte of secretly being trans.

Owens released an eight-part series on YouTube Becoming Brigitte, in which she claimed Brigitte Macron was assigned male at birth under the name Jean-Michel Trogneux, the name of her actual brother.

She also claimed the Macrons are blood relatives and that Emmanuel Macron is the result of a CIA human experimentation program similar toMKUltra, with the series garnering more than 2.3 million views.

GLAAD notes the movement of transvestigations began around 2017, and initially targeted Black women including Michelle Obama and Serena Williams, accusing them of secretly being men in a deeply racist and transphobic attempt to discredit their achievements.

A 2021 report from the Wilson Center called the phenomenon, “deeply misogynistic”.

“These narratives tap into the trope of the duplicitous woman, implying that not only are transgender individuals inherently deceptive, but that this deception is responsible for the power and influence that these women hold,” it detailed.

            Three Chinese astronauts landed back on Earth on Friday, according to state media, more than a week later than their scheduled landing, capping an extended stay in space after a suspected debris hit left their spaceship with a cracked window.
    


            After the capsule hatch opened medical teams found that the astronauts were in good physical condition, Chinese state media outlet CCTV reported.
    


            The crew of the Shenzhou-20 spaceflight had been due to finish their mission at China's Tiangong space station last Wednesday; they'd even handed the keys to the space station to a new crew who had just arrived for their own six-month mission.
    


            But instead, their journey home was postponed “due to a suspected impact from tiny space debris” to their ship, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.
    


            After a nine-day wait, they finally headed home on the Shenzhou-21 spacecraft that transported the incoming crew, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).
    


            The damaged Shenzhou-20 ship had “a slight crack” in the window of its return capsule, likely caused by debris impact, making it unsafe for the crew to return in, according to the CMSA. The ship will stay in orbit to carry out experiments instead, the agency said.
    


            During their extra week in space, the crew continued working and living alongside the newly arrived Shenzhou-21 astronauts, as the space station has enough capacity to support two crews in orbit, according to Xinhua.
    


            The Tiangong station is only one of two operating space stations, alongside the International Space Station. Since it was completed in 2022, the biannual launches of China's Shenzhou program have been a source of national pride.
    


            Recent advances have seen China break an American-held record for the longest spacewalk, with a nine-hour sortie, and it's about to open the doors of the Tiangong to foreigners for the first time, with plans to welcome an astronaut from Pakistan next year.
    


            The new crew on board the Shenzhou-21 – who are now without a spaceship to return in – include China's youngest astronaut to be sent to space, 32-year-old Wu Fei.
    


            The Shenzhou-22, due to launch sometime next year, will include one astronaut who stays more than a year for a “long-duration residency experiment,” Xinhua reported.
    


            China's rapid development in space exploration has raised alarm bells in Washington, which is racing to put an astronaut on the moon again. The Trump administration placed bans on Chinese citizens with US visas participating in NASA programs.
    


            The US space agency is familiar with the difficulties of retrieving astronauts stuck in space. What was meant to be a short stay on the International Space Station stretched into a more than nine-month mission for two American astronauts earlier this year after their spacecraft malfunctioned. They eventually returned home in March.
    


            Both countries are also competing in nascent institution-building efforts, with the US-led Artemis Accords on lunar exploration matched up against the Chinese- and Russian-led International Lunar Research Station.

Pictures posted on social media showed different sites in flames and residents gathering in rubble-strewn streets outside apartment buildings

Russia unleashed a massive combined attack on Kyiv early Friday, sparking fires and scattering debris across many districts of the capital, mayor Vitali Klitschko said. At least 11 people were injured as emergency crews responded to multiple strikes, he said in a statement.

Five people were hospitalised, including one man in critical condition and a pregnant woman, after a series of powerful explosions sounded in the city and air defences were activated.

The attack on the capital was ongoing, officials said, urging residents to remain in shelters until the air raid alert is lifted. City authorities warned that power and water outages were possible.

Pictures posted on social media showed different sites in flames and residents gathering in rubble-strewn streets outside apartment buildings.

“The Russians are hitting residential buildings. There are a great many damaged multi-storey apartment buildings, in practically every district,” Tymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv's military administration, wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

He said both drones and missiles had been deployed and emergency crews were dispatched to several neighbourhoods.

Klitschko said Kyiv's heating system had also sustained damage, with service interrupted in one district. He warned of possible disruptions to power and water supplies.

In the Darnytskyi district, debris landed in the yard of a residential building and on the grounds of an educational facility. A car caught fire after being hit by falling fragments.

In the Dniprovskyi district, debris damaged three apartment buildings, a private household and caused a fire in an open area. In the Podilskyi district, five residential buildings and a nonresidential structure were damaged.

Several fires were caused by falling debris elsewhere in the city.

In the Kyiv region, Russian strikes damaged critical infrastructure and private homes, injuring at least one civilian, regional head Mykola Kalashnyk said. A 55-year-old man in Bila Tserkva suffered thermal burns and was hospitalised, he said. Fires broke out in private houses in the capital's suburbs.

The strike came as European Union officials warned this week that Ukraine must continue to crack down on corruption following a major graft scandal that has put top nuclear energy officials under scrutiny. But they also offered assurances that aid will continue to flow as Kyiv strains to hold back Russia's invasion.

The removal of US tariffs is intended to reduce the price of bananas, coffee, and other food products from the region.

The United States is set to lift tariffs on certain food products and other imports from Argentina, Ecuador, Guatemala and El Salvador in return for improved access to those markets for American firms.

The framework agreements, which are expected to be finalized in the next fortnight, are aimed at reducing prices for bananas, coffee and other foodstuffs from the region.

""With all of these deals, the ones in Asia, the ones we're announcing today, we maintain the tariffs, we give some tariff relief on certain products or goods, but at the same time, we open up foreign markets in ways that they have not been open before,"" a government official told the Reuters news agency on Thursday.

After recent Democratic wins in New Jersey, New York and Virginia, due in part to cost-of-living concerns exacerbated by President Donald Trump's tariffs, the administration has renewed focus on affordability issues, blaming higher costs on policies enacted by Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden.

Economists, on the other hand, say price hikes have been caused in part by sweeping import tariffs imposed by Trump on nearly every country on the planet.

Officials in Argentina, El Salvador, Guatemala and Ecuador welcomed the deals.

Argentine Foreign Minister Pablo Quirno said the deal would ""create the conditions"" to boost US investment in Argentina and thanked Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei for his ""conviction"" in bringing about the agreement.

El Salvador's ambassador to Washington said the two ""sister nations"" had ""rebuilt their relations on the basis of trust and self-determination,"" while his Guatemalan counterpart said the agreement ""places us as an even more competitive and more attractive country for investment.""

Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed a similar framework with Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira on Thursday.

""The Secretary of State said that they are analyzing the bilateral issues with Brazil with all due attention and time, that they want to resolve them quickly, and that an answer will come very soon, tomorrow or next week,"" Vieira told reporters in Washington.

Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer and exporter. but its exports to the US currently face crushing 50% duties imposed by Trump.

U.S. markets had their worst day since Oct. 10. That marks a sharp reversal for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which shed 1.65% to settle at 47,457.22, a day after it closed above 48,000 for the first time. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 lost 1.66% and the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.29%.

The slump in stocks can partly be traced to a turnaround in sentiment regarding artificial intelligence. Tech behemoths such as Nvidia, Broadcom and Oracle slumped, with the last losing more than one-third in value since it rocketed 36% in September.

Investors, it seems, are growing worried over the high valuations of tech names, as well as the gigantic amount of capital expenditure they are committing to — with some, like Oracle, having to take on debt to fulfil those obligations.

Uncertainty over an interest rate cut in December is also putting a downer on Wall Street. It's a coin toss as to whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy then, according to the CME FedWatch tool. That's a huge difference from a month ago, when traders were pricing in a 95.5% chance of a December cut.

Not having October's employment and inflation numbers, and possibly never getting them, means the Fed lacks visibility into the state of the economy — and whether it should try to support the labor market or continue reining in inflation.

After all, flying blind makes it hard to see where you'll land. As of now, that applies both to the Fed and investors trying to navigate the still-hazy ambitions of tech companies.

Stocks pull back on AI sell-off. All major U.S. indexes fell Thursday stateside dragged down by heavyweight technology names. Asia-Pacific markets also retreated Friday. South Korea's Kospi sank more than 3% and investors sold off SoftBank stock for the third straight day.

China's economic slump deepens. The country's fixed-asset investment, which includes real estate, shrank 1.7% in the January-to-October period. The last time this measure contracted was in 2020 during the pandemic, according to Wind Information.

A December rate cut doesn't seem so certain. A lack of economic data because of the government shutdown — now ended — is complicating the Fed's decision. Fed official Susan Collins on Wednesday said holding rates will ""likely be appropriate.""

Air India losses to weigh on Singapore Airlines. Singapore's national carrier reported Thursday that its second-quarter earnings plunged 82%. Analysts think profits might remain muted because of persistent losses at Air India, in which SIA has a 25.1% stake.

[PRO] Be wary of stocks with zero revenue. The year-to-date rally in stocks means some could be trading at elevated prices. CNBC Pro found a few names with market caps of at least $1 billion — but haven't generated revenue over the last 12 months.

CEO of Southeast Asia's largest bank says AI adoption already paying off: ‘It's not hope, it's now'

""The proliferation of generative AI has been transformative for us,"" DBS CEO Tan Su Shan told CNBC on the sidelines of Singapore Fintech Week. She adding that the company was experiencing a ""snowballing effect"" of benefits thanks to machine learning. 

Tan expects AI adoption to bring DBS an overall revenue bump of more than 1 billion Singapore dollars (about $768 million) this year, compared to SG$750 million in 2024. That assessment is based on about 370 AI use cases powered by over 1,500 models throughout its business.

U.S. President Donald Trump is once again on the warpath against a major global media company, having threatened the BBC with a $1 billion lawsuit this week.

The British public broadcaster found itself in hot water after airing a documentary in which Trump's Jan. 6 speech in 2021 was edited to make it look like he was explicitly encouraging his supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol.

As concerns over the documentary came to light, the BBC went into crisis mode, with both its director general and head of news resigning. Meanwhile, BBC Chair Samir Shah said the corporation was assessing the ""very serious allegations"" and apologized for an ""error of judgment"" over the edit.

The BBC on Thursday apologized to Trump and agreed not to show the documentary again on any of its platforms. It reportedly rejected the U.S. president's call for compensation, however. Trump told Fox News this week that he has an ""obligation"" to sue the BBC.

Here's what's going on and why it matters:

In October 2024, the BBC aired a Panorama documentary called ""Trump: A Second Chance?"" in which it showed Trump addressing supporters on Jan. 6, 2021.

In the Panorama program, Trump was shown saying, ""We're going to walk down to the Capitol ... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell."" The edit combined two separate parts of his speech, although this was not flagged to viewers, making it look like he had explicitly instructed his supporters to riot in a single statement.

That was not the case as Trump had said, ""We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,"" and only much later (in fact, around 54 minutes later) he said, ""and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.""

The speech became infamous as Trump supporters descended on the Capitol after the address, with skirmishes breaking out with police and a number of protesters entering the building. At the time, Trump urged those involved in the riots to ""go home now.""

The documentary doesn't appear to have caused a fuss at the time, but the editing process came to light when a memo written by ex-BBC adviser Michael Prescott was leaked to the press in which he criticized editorial standards at the BBC.

The Panorama documentary in the spotlight was not made by the BBC, but by a third-party production company called October Films. Nonetheless, questions have been asked as to why it was reviewed and approved for broadcasting. The documentary is no longer available to view on the BBC iPlayer.

A crisis engulfed the BBC as news of the rogue edit emerged. Director General Tim Davie and Head of News Deborah Turness resigned. But that has not stopped the scandal snowballing with questions centering on the BBC's editorial standards amid allegations of institutional bias.

On Tuesday, the BBC issued a statement in which it said, ""we accept our edit created the impression we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from two different points in the speech.""

""Consequently, this gave the impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action. The BBC would like to apologise for that error of judgement,"" it said, adding that ""there was no intention to mislead.""

Trump's legal team wrote to the BBC, demanding that it immediately retract what it said were ""false, defamatory, disparaging, and inflammatory statements"" about the president in the documentary. The letter, which was published in full by Sky News, said the airing of the program had ""caused President Trump to suffer overwhelming financial and reputational harm.""

It warned that Trump would sue for $1 billion in damages unless the corporation issued a ""full and fair retraction,"" apologized and compensated the president ""for the harm caused.""

The letter, signed by Trump's lawyer Alejandro Brito, said the BBC has until 5 p.m. EST on Friday Nov. 14 to comply with the president's demands, otherwise, ""he will be left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights ... including by filing legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages.""

""The BBC is on notice,"" the letter concluded.

In his first comments on the matter, the president told Fox News on Monday that his Jan. 6 speech had been ""butchered"" in the Panorama edit. When asked if he would go ahead with the lawsuit, Trump said, ""Well, I think I have an obligation to do it, because you can't get people, you can't allow people to do that.""

The BBC on Thursday issued a statement on its Corrections and Clarifications page, saying it had reviewed the Panorama documentary following criticism over how Trump's Jan. 6, 2021 speech was edited.

""We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,"" the BBC said.

""The BBC would like to apologise to President Trump for that error of judgement,"" it added.

A BBC spokesperson has said that while the corporation ""sincerely regrets"" the manner in which the documentary clip was edited, they ""strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.""

BBC News has reported that, ""if Trump sues in Florida, he would also need to establish the BBC Panorama documentary was available there."" There appears to be no evidence so far to suggest it has been shown in the U.S.

The British government has defended the corporation, however, with Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy wanting to distinguish between ""editorial failings"" and the BBC's critics who, she said, were "" launching a sustained attack on the institution itself.""

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer also commented on the furore on Wednesday, telling lawmakers he believed in a ""strong and independent BBC.""

It's not the first time Trump has pursued legal action against big media organisations, with lawsuits launched against the Wall Street Journal, CNN, CBS, ABC and New York Times in recent years, with some cases settled and others dismissed.

British government bond yields rose sharply on Friday following reports Finance Minister Rachel Reeves is no longer planning to raise income tax rates in the Autumn Budget later this month.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt rose around 12 basis points in early trade, before paring gains to trade at 4.498%. Yields and prices move inversely to one another.

The moves came as investors reacted to a report from the Financial Times of an income tax U-turn. The Treasury was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC on Friday morning.

U.K. stocks were also lower. The FTSE 100 index shed over 1% at 8:54 a.m. in London (3:54 a.m. ET), with Lloyds, Natwest, and Barclays banks occupying the bottom of the index, each losing more than 2.8%.

Reeves had spent the past week apparently laying the groundwork for a manifesto-breaking rise in income tax, which split Labour party lawmakers and led to further turmoil in the already embattled party, whose leader Prime Minister Keir Starmer has dismal approval ratings. 

A proposed 2p national income increase was to be offset by a 2p reduction in national insurance. There are now expectations, however, that the £30 billion ($39.5 billion) hole in the government's budget will be filled by a patchwork of smaller rises.  

It could be a ""fiscal reckoning"" as a patchwork approach will put pressure on the gilt market, Wren Sterling's investment chief Rory McPherson told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Friday.  

""Within the U.K., if we have more of the smaller taxes being targeted as part of the programme from Rachel Reeves, I think that's going to put more pressure on the government, more pressure on them to go back to the bond markets and ask for more money, which in turn puts more pressure up on yields,"" McPherson said.

He added that there has been a ""big march down"" in yields but now ""we're pulling away that that."" 

Volatility this year has left long-term borrowing costs hovering at their highest level since the late 1990s, with U.K. debt having the heftiest price tag in the G7. 

McPherson said that the Bank of England will still be able to make an interest rate cut after the budget, if it wants to. Other investors appear to have curbed their optimism, with bets on cuts shedding six basis points compared with Thursday, according to data compiled by LSEG.

The Autumn Budget is expected on Nov. 26.

A leadership shakeup at what was once Europe's most valuable company is likely to be cemented Friday as Novo Nordisk's controlling shareholder tightens it's grip on the weight-loss drugmaker, even as minority shareholders express discontent.

Novo has found itself in an increasingly chaotic situation as of late, with shares plunging and investor confidence waning, as its role as the leading player in the highly lucrative weight-loss space is being called into question.

The maker of diabetes and weight-loss drugs last month announced an Extraordinary General Meeting for Nov. 14 to replace its independent board members, including Chair Helge Lund, after it became impossible to reach an agreement between the views of the current board and the Novo Nordisk foundation board — the company's majority shareholder.

Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), one of the larger minority shareholders, said earlier this week it would abstain from voting at Friday's EGM, indicating discontent. Other shareholders, such as California State Teachers' Retirement System, have also said they'll vote against the proposal. NBIM and CalSTRS both declined to comment further.

Lund will be replaced by company veteran Lars Rebien Sørensen, already chair of the Foundation board. The 71-year-old also served as Novo Nordisk CEO between 2000 and 2016.

The foundation also proposed Cees de Jong to become vice chair and Mikael Dolsten, Britt Meelby Jensen and Stephan Engels to become members.

Early Friday, Novo said Dolsten, formerly head of R&D at Pfizer, had decided to withdraw his candidacy to the board due to personal circumstances. Novo shares were down 1.8% to $312.90 in morning trading.

""It is rare that a company of that scale to make that degree of change that quickly,"" Andrew Pettigrew, Emeritus professor at University of Oxford, and an expert of theories of change, told CNBC.

""It's usually precipitated by some awful crisis, which is throwing them off a cliff, but probably also a period when they were blind to what was going on underneath them. In other words, they were surprised by a sudden change, and it usually takes that to overthrow an existing power group in a company, especially if they've been in power for a long time,"" Pettigrew added.

The current board was ""too slow in recognizing the significance of the market changes in the United States,"" Sørensen told analysts at a call following the announcement, adding that two more members would be announced in due course.

Novo is broadly viewed as having fallen behind U.S. peer Eli Lilly which has rapidly taken market share from Novo, as its rival drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound have shown more pronounced weight loss at the highest dose.

""It's a matter of urgency and scope,"" Sørensen said in October about the proposed changes to the board, however also saying the foundation is ""fully aligned"" behind Novo's current strategy under new CEO Mike Doustdar.

Another rationale for the board cull is that a new configuration would bring in more people with direct experience from a U.S. consumer perspective to help navigate the challenging market. It comes amid increasing competition both from Eli Lilly and so-called compounding pharmacies that make cheaper copycat version of the drugs, and a shift towards direct-to-consumer sales.  

Like for many pharmaceutical companies, the U.S. is Novo's largest market. In the first nine months of 2025, the U.S. market accounted for 56% of total sales, measured in Danish kroner.

Analysts, however, have expressed scepticism that the new board will bring in the intended experience. ""On balance, it might seem the new board actually possesses less rather than more commercial, large pharma expertise,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Papadakis said.

Novo shares have fallen 12% since the board shakeup was announced and have lost 58% since the start of this year. Last week, the company reported third-quarter results that missed estimates, and lowered the upper range of its full-year guidance citing slower growth expectations for Ozempic and Wegovy.

It's but one of many dramatic happenings taking place at the Danish pharma giant lately.

""There have been so many moves this year that show Novo as a conflicted company,"" noted Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen. ""With such a new direct-to-patient market emerging as a critical piece of future obesity drug sales growth, and compounders remaining a real competitor in the market, it's not hard to imagine that the boards and management might not have the same vision for how Novo should respond,"" she added.

Over the weekend, Novo pulled out from a dramatic bidding war against U.S. giant Pfizer over an experimental weight-loss drug by clinical-stage biotech Metsera, stepping away from a deal analysts have described as unusual.

The board changes come just months after Novo appointed Doustdar as chief executive, booting former CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, in part blaming him for the current trajectory of the company and its shares. Doustdar has since announced a reorganisation, including laying off over 10% of employees globally.

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) gained a powerful boost in Europe as Luxembourg's finance minister openly backed the asset for long-term sovereign allocation, while the Czech National Bank initiated its first digital-asset pilot.



The finance minister said Luxembourg's sovereign wealth fund already holds a 1% allocation to Bitcoin and stressed the position is a completed, long-term investment.

He noted the fund could have chosen any crypto asset but opted only for Bitcoin, repeating Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR) Founder Michael Saylor's line that ""there is no second best.""

Don't Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

The minister added that Bitcoin comes up frequently in conversations with global financial institutions and said other countries are preparing to move in the same direction.

He described Luxembourg as ""in it for the long haul"" and emphasized that the decision was not designed to attract attention.

According to the minister, digital assets now sit on the agenda of every major financial meeting he attends, reflecting a structural shift in how governments evaluate future reserve plans and payment systems.



In a separate development, the Czech National Bank purchased digital assets for the first time, creating a $1 million test portfolio.

The basket includes Bitcoin, a USD stablecoin, and a tokenized deposit designed to evaluate blockchain-based settlement systems.

Governor Aleš Michl said the project aims to give the bank ""practical experience with holding and managing digital assets.""

He emphasized that the portfolio is separate from official reserves and will not affect monetary operations or foreign exchange interventions.

Michl also explained that the CNB wants to ""test decentralized Bitcoin from the central bank's perspective"" and assess how such assets could diversify reserves.

The initiative, approved on October 30, also launched the CNB Lab innovation hub, focused on blockchain, tokenization, and AI-driven financial tools.

Bitcoin's inclusion in both a sovereign wealth fund and a central bank pilot signals a structural shift in Europe's monetary mindset.

Traders say the dual announcements may accelerate similar moves by smaller EU states exploring diversification away from traditional reserves.

Luxembourg's proactive tone contrasts with the European Central Bank's cautious stance, highlighting growing regional divergence.

The geopolitical race for Bitcoin leadership is accelerating.

Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen

Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.

Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.

Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.

For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.

Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.

Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash, combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.

For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.

Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) trade in red on Friday after correcting more than 5%, 10% and 2%, respectively, so far this week. BTC has slipped below the $100,000 key level, while ETH and XRP have faced rejection at their resistance levels, signaling that bears remain firmly in control and that a deeper correction may be underway.

Bitcoin price faced rejection at the 38.20% Fibonacci retracement level at $106,453 (drawn from the April 7 low of $74,508 to the all-time high of $126,299 set on October 6) on Monday and declined nearly 6% by Thursday. At the time of writing on Friday, BTC is trading down around $99,300.

If BTC continues its correction and closes below the daily support at $97,460, it could extend the decline toward the key psychological level at $95,000.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 35, below its neutral level of 50, indicating strong bearish momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence also showed a bearish crossover, signaling a sell and further supporting the bearish view.

On the other hand, if BTC recovers, it could extend the recovery toward the 38.20% Fibonacci retracement at $106,453.

Ethereum price faced rejection at the previous broken trendline around $3,592 on Monday and declined by nearly 10% over the next three days. At the time of writing on Friday, ETH hovers at around $3,200.

If ETH continues its pullback and closes below the $3,170 support level, it could extend the decline toward the daily support at $3,017.

Like Bitcoin, Ethereum's RSI and MACD indicate bearish momentum gaining traction, signaling a deeper correction ahead.

However, if ETH recovers, it could extend the recovery toward the 38.20% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,592.

XRP price surged 6.75% on Monday, retesting the 50-day EMA at $2.53. However, it surrendered most of those gains on Tuesday after failing to break through that same resistance level. XRP again faced rejection from the 50-day EMA at $2.53 on Thursday and declined 2.74%, closing below the daily support at $2.35. At the time of writing on Friday, XRP trades down at around $2.30.

If XRP continues its correction, it could extend the decline toward the next daily support at $1.96.

Like Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP's RSI signals bearish momentum, while the MACD indicates indecision among traders.

On the other hand, if XRP recovers, it could extend the recovery toward the 50-day EMA at $2.53.

The developer or creator of each cryptocurrency decides on the total number of tokens that can be minted or issued. Only a certain number of these assets can be minted by mining, staking or other mechanisms. This is defined by the algorithm of the underlying blockchain technology. On the other hand, circulating supply can also be decreased via actions such as burning tokens, or mistakenly sending assets to addresses of other incompatible blockchains.

Market capitalization is the result of multiplying the circulating supply of a certain asset by the asset's current market value. 

Trading volume refers to the total number of tokens for a specific asset that has been transacted or exchanged between buyers and sellers within set trading hours, for example, 24 hours. It is used to gauge market sentiment, this metric combines all volumes on centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges. Increasing trading volume often denotes the demand for a certain asset as more people are buying and selling the cryptocurrency.

Funding rates are a concept designed to encourage traders to take positions and ensure perpetual contract prices match spot markets. It defines a mechanism by exchanges to ensure that future prices and index prices periodic payments regularly converge. When the funding rate is positive, the price of the perpetual contract is higher than the mark price. This means traders who are bullish and have opened long positions pay traders who are in short positions. On the other hand, a negative funding rate means perpetual prices are below the mark price, and hence traders with short positions pay traders who have opened long positions.

From 2025 to 2030, the market is projected to grow from USD 1.1 billion to USD 4.7 billion, a rise of USD 3.6 billion. This period will see increased investment in virtual worlds, particularly in gaming and metaverse real estate, as companies and individuals look to capitalize on emerging digital property markets. As the concept of virtual land becomes more mainstream, more platforms will emerge, offering a wider variety of assets and experiences to users, which will drive significant growth during this phase.

Between 2030 and 2035, the market is expected to expand from USD 4.7 billion to USD 20.9 billion, adding USD 16.2 billion. This rapid growth will be propelled by the mass adoption of virtual environments for business, entertainment, and social interaction. As virtual land becomes an integral part of the digital economy, its value will rise exponentially. Increased interest from institutional investors, coupled with advancements in AR/VR technologies, will further fuel the demand for virtual real estate, ensuring that the market will continue to grow at a remarkable pace through 2035.

The virtual land NFT market is growing rapidly due to the increasing adoption of the metaverse and virtual worlds where users can buy, sell, and develop NFT-based virtual land. As the metaverse continues to expand, virtual real estate has become an attractive investment class, with buyers seeking ownership of exclusive digital assets. The rise in gaming, digital art, and entertainment has also contributed to the growth, as virtual land is essential for creating immersive experiences.

Additionally, blockchain technology ensures secure ownership of digital assets, which boosts investor confidence. The demand for NFTs in virtual environments is growing as more platforms offer virtual goods, and the growing interest from both retail investors and institutional players is accelerating market expansion.

Moreover, virtual land can generate revenue through leasing, advertising, and hosting events, making it a profitable asset in the digital economy. As the NFT market continues to mature, and with an increasing number of metaverse platforms emerging, the growth of the virtual land NFT market is expected to continue, as users seek to stake their claim in these digital worlds.

The virtual land NFT market is primarily divided into classification and application. By classification, the market includes metaverse & virtual goods, digital art & collectibles, games & virtual worlds, music & entertainment, sports & fan economy, social & identity authentication, and practical NFT. The metaverse & virtual goods segment holds the largest share, accounting for 30% of the market. By application, the market is split between the primary market and the secondary market, with the primary market representing the largest share at 60%. Regions such as China, India, and Germany lead the charge in terms of NFT adoption and virtual land investments.



The metaverse & virtual goods segment is the dominant segment in the virtual land NFT market, holding approximately 30% of the market share. The growing interest in the metaverse and virtual reality platforms has driven a significant demand for NFT-based virtual land in virtual worlds like Decentraland, The Sandbox, and Somnium Space. These platforms allow users to buy, sell, and develop virtual real estate, making them attractive to investors, developers, and digital entrepreneurs looking to stake their claim in the emerging digital economy. The concept of virtual land as digital assets is expanding, with creators building interactive experiences, virtual stores, and entertainment venues, further driving demand. The virtual land in the metaverse provides new opportunities for revenue generation, including virtual businesses, advertising, and hosting events. As more people engage with the metaverse, the demand for NFTs representing virtual land and virtual assets is expected to grow, solidifying the segment's position as the market leader.



The primary market leads the virtual land NFT market, accounting for 60% of the market share. This segment involves the initial sale of virtual land NFTs directly from metaverse platforms to end consumers. The appeal of purchasing virtual land at initial sale prices has been growing as more users and investors see the potential for long-term value appreciation. Primary market sales are typically where investors first acquire digital land in NFT marketplaces such as Earth 2 and The Sandbox. The primary market allows early investors to acquire virtual land before it's resold at a potentially higher price on the secondary market, creating opportunities for speculation and value growth. Additionally, virtual land purchased in the primary market can be developed into digital experiences or sold for profit, driving significant demand in the primary market. As the metaverse continues to evolve and grow, the primary market will remain a crucial entry point for virtual land NFT investments, fueling its market dominance.

The virtual land NFT market is growing due to increasing interest in the metaverse and virtual real estate. Platforms like Decentraland and The Sandbox are seeing significant demand for virtual land, driven by the ability to monetize digital assets through NFTs.

Additionally, institutional investment in NFT platforms and the growing popularity of digital art has expanded the market. As the metaverse continues to develop and gain mainstream acceptance, virtual land NFTs are expected to become increasingly valuable as part of the broader digital economy.

What are the key restraints in the virtual land NFT market?

Despite strong growth, the virtual land NFT market faces several challenges. Price volatility in the NFT market can lead to uncertainty for both investors and platform developers, making it difficult to predict the value of virtual land over time. Additionally, regulatory uncertainty surrounding NFTs and digital assets may deter potential investors due to concerns about taxation, intellectual property rights, and market regulation. The environmental impact of blockchain networks, particularly those using proof-of-work systems, has raised concerns about the sustainability of NFT platforms. These challenges could hinder broader adoption and limit market growth.

Crypto market weakens as liquidity tightens and major tokens extend losses across the board.

Bitcoin's latest drop reflects growing caution in digital assets as liquidity pressures build

Bitcoin's price fell to around $96,800 (roughly Rs. 85.8 lakh) on Friday as the crypto market came under renewed selling pressure amidst a sharp liquidity squeeze and broad risk-off sentiment. The drop below the key $100,000 level has unsettled traders, with leveraged unwinds, thin market participation, and weak institutional flows weighing heavily on price action. Ethereum (ETH) dropped more than 10 percent over the past 24 hours to trade near $3,100 (roughly Rs. 2.80 lakh). According to the Gadgets 360 price tracker, Bitcoin is priced around Rs. 71 lakh in India, while Ethereum trades at roughly Rs. 2.3 lakh.

Major altcoins posted another day of heavy declines as traders continued to unwind risk positions. Solana (SOL) fell 9.4 percent to $141.83 (roughly Rs. 12,586), XRP declined 8.4 percent to $2.29 (roughly Rs. 203), and Binance Coin (BNB) dropped 5.8 percent to $912.99 (roughly Rs. 81,019). Dogecoin (DOGE) also slipped 7.4 percent to $0.1630 (roughly Rs. 14.47).

Riya Sehgal, Research Analyst at Delta Exchange, said the global shift toward risk-off sentiment is accelerating volatility across assets. “Bitcoin on-chain patterns point to measured profit-taking by long-term players, behavior that typically appears in the later stages of an expansionary phase. Technically, BTC remains constrained beneath major moving averages, with immediate resistance around $101,500–$103,200 (roughly Rs. 90 lakh–Rs. 91.5 lakh) and key support near $98,500 (roughly Rs. 87.4 lakh).”

Avinash Shekhar, Co-Founder and CEO of Pi42, said Bitcoin's breakdown reflects deeper structural stress in the market rather than a routine correction. “Crypto market is under renewed pressure as Bitcoin breaks below the psychological threshold of $100,000 (roughly Rs. 88.7 lakh), trading near $96,000 (roughly Rs. 85.1 lakh) amidst a sharp liquidity squeeze and broad risk-off sentiment [...] Institutional and retail flows remain muted, making near-term price action highly vulnerable unless liquidity meaningfully returns. As always, investors should do their own research and assess risks carefully before investing.”

The CoinSwitch Markets Desk noted that Bitcoin is consolidating within a narrow but fragile band. “While the U.S. government has officially ended the shutdown, the restart of federal operations may take time, meaning key economic indicators could still face delays, keeping investors cautious [...] However, sentiment may improve in the coming weeks as markets look ahead to the Federal Reserve's expected QE in December, which could restore liquidity and revive risk appetite.”

Market sentiment remains extremely cautious as traders assess whether support at $96,800 (roughly Rs. 85.9 lakh) can hold in the coming sessions. Bitcoin's ability to reclaim the $100,000 (roughly Rs. 88.74 lakh) mark will depend heavily on fresh liquidity flows, whale activity, and clearer macro signals in the days ahead.

This is a technical analysis post by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

It's unusual to see ether ETH$3,160.31, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, showing relative strength against market leader bitcoin on a day when the market is under pressure.

Today is exactly that rare instance. While bitcoin BTC$96,916.40 has slipped over 2% on the day to around $97,200, ether remains largely steady near $3,230, per data source CoinDesk. This divergence has lifted the ether-to-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) ratio by more than 2%, signaling ether's outperformance.

With that in mind, here are three key charts worth keeping an eye on.

The Binance-listed ratio is currently confined within a counter-trend downward channel, reflecting a pause following the sharp rally observed between May and August. The slope of this channel is relatively gentle, suggesting the price action is more of a consolidation phase rather than a full-fledged downtrend.

So, a breakout from this channel would confirm a renewed investor bias in favor of ether over bitcoin, suggesting further upside potential for the ETH/BTC ratio. Interestingly, the ratio's MACD histogram appears poised to cross above zero, signaling a potential bullish shift in momentum.

Like the ether-bitcoin ratio, ether's dollar-denominated price is also moving in a counter-trend downward channel, with signs of seller exhaustion near $3,000, as evident from the long tails attached to the recent daily candles.

This suggests a potential for price bounce, although a clean breakout from the channel is needed to confirm a broader bullish outlook.

A potential rally in ether, widely regarded as the leading altcoin, could spark rallies in other major tokens, particularly in the ratio between payments-focused XRP and bitcoin.

The ratio continues to coil in a four-year range, building momentum for a significant breakout. Should ether surge, this could act as a catalyst for a bullish resolution in the XRP/BTC ratio, potentially triggering notable gains.

Although the flu season seems off to a quiet start in the US, warnings from abroad suggest that a new strain may yet shake up the US healthcare system.

New data reported in the British Medical Journal showed a significant increase in flu rates in the UK, largely among young adults and school-aged children. The cases are dominated by a new H3N2 strain, which mutated several times over the summer, increasing in severity, according to experts.

Sometimes a strain develops that, while not entirely new, is new enough to spread more efficiently because it is not well matched to current community immunity from previous infections and vaccinations, according to Antonio Ho, MD, clinical senior lecturer and consultant in infectious diseases at the University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland.

“The current circulating influenza A (H3N2) virus acquired seven new mutations over the summer, which means the virus is quite different to the A (H3N2) strain included in this year's vaccine,” Ho said in a media statement.

The emergence of seasonal influenza A (H3N2) variants was reported in the Journal of the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada.

During the southern hemisphere's 2025 influenza season, a variant A (H3N2) virus emerged that did not match well with the current vaccine, and this variant, now renamed subclade K, is projected to dominate the northern hemisphere's 2025-2026 season, the researchers wrote. In October, Japan declared a flu epidemic, as reported in the journal Nature, but the proportion of cases caused by the subclade K variant and the impact on other countries remains unclear.

Between the recent government shutdown and ongoing changes in the makeup of the CDC, up-to-date information on flu activity on the national level is lacking; the most recent flu activity from the CDC's website indicates low levels as of the last week in September.

“National data on influenza and pertussis are delayed, though organizations that work to collate data from local and state resources are reporting flu activity is beginning in the South,” said Lori Handy, MD, MSCE, associate director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and assistant professor of clinical pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, in an interview.

Even a mismatched vaccine has protective benefits, Handy said. “With flu season about to begin, those who are not yet vaccinated should get vaccinated as soon as possible,” she added. “Many people may still get sick, but vaccination will keep them out of the emergency department and hospital,” Handy emphasized.

Handy disclosed no financial conflicts of interest.

Postmarket surveillance data revealed that enfortumab vedotin (EV) skin toxicity is associated with high hospitalization and mortality rates, especially with Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN); but use of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors or systemic corticosteroids did not augment this risk.

“Our study emphasizes the importance of correctly identifying culprit medications and the potential role of corticosteroids,” the authors wrote. “Clinicians,” they added “should maintain a high index of suspicion for EV-induced SJS/TEN and report cases to improve pharmacovigilance and guide management strategies.”

The study was led by Mackenzie M. Kilton, University of Nebraska College of Medicine, Omaha, Nebraska, and was published online on November 1 in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.

Thomas Tuchel has embraced the idea of England's substitutes being nicknamed the ""bomb squad"" after powerful performances off the bench helped the Three Lions secure a 2-0 victory over Serbia at Wembley. With Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden and Eberechi Eze all making an impact despite not being in the starting lineup, the England boss insisted his team is built on unity rather than star names.

England continued their flawless World Cup qualifying run with a controlled 2-0 win over Serbia, securing another clean sheet in what has become one of the most dominant campaigns in the nation's history. Bukayo Saka opened the scoring with a superb volley, but it was the introduction of Bellingham, Foden and Eze that truly changed the dynamic of the match. Their added energy and invention helped England regain control in the second half before the latter sealed the victory with a brilliant late strike.

The impact off the bench reflected Tuchel's broader approach to squad harmony, particularly in a team packed with elite club-level starters competing for limited roles. With England operating at a high tempo and against opponents determined to frustrate, Tuchel's substitutions injected the speed, pressing intensity and technical sharpness needed to break Serbia down for the second time on the night.

The result extended England's record to seven wins from seven, with 20 goals scored and none conceded, establishing them as the only European side in history to reach a World Cup with a 100% winning and clean-sheet qualifying record this deep into a campaign. It also demonstrated the flexibility and adaptability Tuchel has demanded since taking charge in January, with every squad member expected to remain mentally ready despite fierce positional competition.

Speaking after the win, Tuchel was asked about the South African rugby team's ""bomb squad"" nickname for their substitutes and whether England might adopt something similar. He admitted he approved of the idea, saying: ""I have not named it in a different way but I kind of like it. I like bomb squad a bit more than finisher.""

Tuchel explained the tactical reasoning behind this mindset, emphasising that modern football requires a full squad to win at the highest level. He said: ""That's the nature of this game. The possibility that we go to Albania (on Sunday) and start with 11 and finish with the same 11 goes to zero, and even more so in a tournament. This is not about building a starting 11, it's about building a team.""

He then praised the attitude within the England camp, highlighting the need for humility and togetherness. Tuchel added: ""They're all big players in their club, they're all used to playing, they're all disappointed. Everyone. This is normal. But they buy into this idea of building a team and this is what we want, this is what we need. There is no other way around it.

""Only if we're a strong group who can put the ego behind (them), who can put the disappointment behind, and then contribute and give the coach a headache what to do in the next match, that's the only way. I like it because it's natural for this team. The atmosphere after the matches, during the matches is the right energy and I think everyone is treating everyone with respect. The ones on the pitch know that they can rely on everyone who comes from the bench to finish the game. You could see the impact today, and it has to stay like this. We just need everybody fully involved, especially mentally to accept the decision of the match day and then to continue.""

The victory over Serbia was not only another clean sheet but also a continuation of a historic defensive run under Tuchel, with England yet to concede in any qualifier. Jordan Pickford has now recorded ten straight competitive clean sheets, supported by a defensive unit that has embraced Tuchel's structured pressing and high-possession philosophy. Ezri Konsa, John Stones and Declan Rice were among those producing key interventions during Serbia's most threatening moments.

The game also marked Bellingham's first England appearance since June, and Tuchel eased him back into action with a second-half cameo rather than a start. The Real Madrid star combined sharply with Reece James and Foden, showing his usual drive from midfield while also helping England sustain pressure in the final third. His return adds another layer of complexity to England's midfield competition.

Foden, meanwhile, was deployed as a false nine – a tactical switch Tuchel had planned months in advance – and his smart positioning created the space for Eze's late finish. The Manchester City star operated between Serbia's defensive lines, linking play and drifting wide to overload key areas on the right alongside Saka and James.

England now travel to Albania in their final World Cup qualifier, aiming to complete a perfect campaign while giving Tuchel another opportunity to experiment ahead of the 2026 World Cup. The manager may continue rotating his squad, with several players pushing for more minutes and others, including Bellingham, building match sharpness after recent fitness concerns.

Tuchel will also be evaluating how best to structure his attack as the team approaches next summer's tournament, particularly with competition intensifying across midfield and the front line. Players such as Eze, Foden, Palmer and Bellingham are all vying for advanced positions, and Tuchel's willingness to use them flexibly could become a decisive advantage. England's depth remains one of the strongest in international football, and the manager has reiterated the importance of harnessing that strength.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

England moved within touching distance of unprecedented World Cup qualifying history after a composed 2-0 victory over Serbia at Wembley maintained their flawless defensive record. With Thomas Tuchel's side yet to concede in the campaign, a clean sheet against Albania would make them the first European nation ever to complete an eight-game qualifying cycle without letting in a single goal.

England cruised to another victory as they defeated Serbia 2-0 at Wembley on Thursday, stretching their perfect record in the 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign. Bukayo Saka opened the scoring on the half-hour mark with a crisp volley, before Eberechi Eze came off the bench to curl home a superb late finish and seal a seventh straight win.

The match followed a familiar pattern in this qualifying cycle, with England asserting dominance early and forcing Serbia to defend deep for long spells. Harry Kane's movement, Saka's incisiveness and Declan Rice's control ensured Serbia were rarely able to build sustained attacks, while England's defence remained largely untroubled aside from isolated counterattacks.

England's clean sheet was also significant, extending their run to seven games without conceding, already a rare feat in UEFA World Cup qualifying. Serbia created a handful of half-chances but were kept at bay through Jordan Pickford's alert positioning and the strong recovery defending of Ezri Konsa and John Stones. With the win, England closed in on a piece of history never before achieved in a European qualifying group of eight matches.

The victory places England on the brink of an unprecedented defensive milestone, one that would underline the transformative impact Tuchel has had since taking charge. Should the Three Lions avoid conceding in their final qualifier against Albania, they would become the first European nation ever to complete an eight-game World Cup qualifying campaign without letting in a goal. It would surpass even the great England side of 1990, which finished a six-game campaign without conceding.

Beyond the clean sheet streak, England's qualifying journey has showcased the depth and discipline required to thrive under Tuchel's demanding standards. Pickford has now kept ten consecutive competitive clean sheets, supported by a defensive line that has remained calm under pressure and excelled at denying opponents high-value opportunities. Stones, Konsa and Rice have all played crucial roles in sustaining England's impeccable defensive record.

This campaign has also highlighted Tuchel's insistence on competition for places, with no player guaranteed a starting role regardless of club form or reputation. Tuchel has repeatedly stressed that his focus is on building collective unity, and England's ability to rotate without losing fluidity underscores how deeply the squad has bought into his approach.

England now travel to Tirana for their final World Cup qualifier to take on Albania, where the chance to make history may serve as a major motivational factor despite the game being a dead rubber. Top spot in the group is already secured and Albania are locked into second place.

Should England secure the clean sheet, they will step into the 2026 World Cup not only as qualifying history-makers but also as one of the tournament's most tactically complete and defensively formidable sides.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

World Cup

India supporters cheer their team during a game against Qatar (Noushad Thekkayil/NurPhoto via Getty Images)

The men's World Cup is bigger than ever.

Next summer's tournament in the United States, Mexico and Canada will feature 48 nations, up from the previous 32-team format.

Last month, Cape Verde — whose 525,000 inhabitants make it the second-smallest country by population ever to qualify — joined Jordan and Uzbekistan as first-time participants.

Despite the expanded tournament doubling the number of participating nations from the U.S.-held edition in 1994, seven (eight if Nigeria fail to qualify) of the 10 most populous nations have not qualified.

Here, The Athletic examines why many of the most populous nations will not be represented at the world's premier sporting event.

Editor's note: Population figures are taken from Worldometer at date of publication. 

India population: 1,463,865,525

Pakistan population: 255,219,554

Bangladesh population: 175,686,899

Previous total World Cup appearances: 0

India is the world's most populous nation and the three countries on the Indian subcontinent — including Pakistan and Bangladesh — are all in the world's top eight, comprising 23 per cent of the global population.

None of the three nations have participated in a World Cup finals. In 1950, India qualified by default, but opted not to take part after reported disagreements over team selection, and insufficient practice time.

That was the fourth edition of the World Cup and came just three years after India and Pakistan (from which Bangladesh gained independence in 1971) gained independence and were partitioned into separate states.

India have not come close to qualifying for a World Cup since. In this campaign, they were eliminated in the second round of Asian qualifying, winning one of six group games from a group in which Qatar and Kuwait advanced.

India's best football moment came in 1964, when they were runners-up to Israel (then a member of the Asian Football Confederation) in a four-team edition of the Asian Cup.

Pakistan have never qualified for any major tournament, while Bangladesh lost all four of their matches in their sole appearance at the Asian Cup in 1980.

The three nations can be grouped together geographically, but also for the reasons behind their relative underperformance.

Alongside Afghanistan to the north and Sri Lanka to the south, the area comprises almost half of the world's Test-playing cricket nations. Cricket is the national sport due to its colonial legacy from British rule and is a major strand of national identity.

The prevalence of cricket, in part, helps explain the lack of infrastructure and funding for football — which may not hold national sport status but remains extremely popular, as evidenced by the passionate local support for Argentina and Brazil at major tournaments.

No club team from the Indian subcontinent has ever reached the final of the AFC Champions League, or its predecessor competition, the Asian Club Championship.

Domestic football is not thriving. At the time of writing, the top-flight Indian Super League remains on hold as India's federation, the AIFF, is struggling to sell the competition's commercial rights. As per a November 8 report from Reuters, a number of its clubs have suspended first-team activities as a result, including champions Mohun Bagan Super Giant.

Pakistan, meanwhile, remains the world's largest country without a national football league. The Pakistan Premier League has remained inactive since the 2018–19 season.

Population: 1,416,096,094

Previous World Cup appearances: 1

Unlike the Indian subcontinent, China's continued struggles in men's football are complex.

They have featured just once at the World Cup, in the 2002 edition held in neighbouring Japan and South Korea, losing all three matches without scoring a goal.

In the mid-2010s, China's president, Xi Jinping, pledged to solve the nation's underperformance in the sport and declared an ambition to turn China into a “football powerhouse”.

Huge corporations such as Suning (retail) and Evergrande (real estate) were urged to bankroll the Chinese Super League (CSL). In return, they would gain greater global exposure for their brands and, significantly, presidential approval.

A series of big-money transfers followed, but the project proved unsustainable. Tight financial regulations were introduced, with non-Chinese player signings heavily taxed. The Chinese FA announced a series of measures to address “irrational investments by clubs, high-figure transfer fees and salaries paid to domestic and international athletes and other issues”.



President Xi, who assumed the position in 2013, stated his aims for China to qualify for a World Cup, host a World Cup and, ultimately, win a World Cup. He instructed the installation of 70,000 new pitches and 20,000 training centres across the country by 2020. The sport became compulsory in schools for children aged six and above.

Football is hugely popular there. The average attendance in the CSL is 25,000, with each matchday averaging 200,000 in the top division. However, the international team continue to struggle. China are ranked 93rd in FIFA's world rankings and 13th in Asia. President Xi's ambitions have not yet been realised.

China have, however, been regulars at the Women's World Cup. Since hosting its inaugural edition in 1991, they have reached eight of its nine tournaments and lost the final on penalties to the USWNT in 1999.

Population: 285,721,236

Previous World Cup appearances: 1 (Dutch East Indies)

Football is Indonesia's No 1 sport, but their only World Cup appearance came in 1938 when they were still known by their colonial name as Dutch East Indies. Independence followed seven years later.

The world's fourth most populous nation has struggled to produce top-level footballers due to an absence of infrastructure, but they have recently begun leaning on the nation's diaspora, predominantly based in the Netherlands, to improve their fortunes.

According to the Director of Indonesian Citizen Protection, over 2.2million Indonesian citizens officially live abroad and around 1.7m are in the Netherlands, which ruled the nation for over three centuries.

Indonesia's 23-man squad for the October international break included 15 players born in the Netherlands, one in Belgium, one in Spain and one in Finland — Eliano Reijnders, brother of Netherlands international and Manchester City player Tijjani.

Utilising their diaspora has improved Indonesia's results; reaching the knockout stage of the Asian Cup in 2023 and the fourth round of World Cup 2026 qualifying, before losing by one-goal margins to Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Nine months of that campaign was overseen by former Netherlands international Patrick Kluivert, who has subsequently left his position.

Indonesia have not yet reached the World Cup as an independent nation, but not doing so is now regarded as below par.

Russia's national and domestic teams have been suspended from FIFA and UEFA competitions since the country's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Unlike all other nations on this list, there is a strong football culture and tradition there. As an independent nation, Russia hosted and reached the quarter-final stage of the 2018 World Cup. A decade earlier, they advanced to the semi-finals of the European Championship — a tournament the Soviet Union won once (the inaugural tournament in 1960), as well as reaching three other finals.

Moscow clubs CSKA, Spartak and Lokomotiv, along with Zenit Saint Petersburg, had featured prominently in European club competitions prior to the ban.

In April this year, FIFA president Gianni Infantino spoke of his hope that Russia can be introduced back into the football fold “soon”. Any return, however, is dependent on the ongoing situation in Ukraine.

In September 2023, UEFA announced plans to allow Russian under-17 teams to compete in its competitions, but the proposals were later withdrawn.

Africa's second most populous nation, behind Nigeria, Ethiopia were an early powerhouse in the continent's football scene.

As one of the few independent African states in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, Ethiopia were a key player in early editions of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON); a tournament they won in 1962 with two more top-four places following that decade.

However, they have not progressed beyond the competition's group stage since and have only qualified for two of the past 22 tournaments.

This pattern is replicated at club level. Cotton Factory Club, who were dissolved in 2000, and Saint George SC, both reached the semi-finals of the African Cup of Champions Clubs in the 1960s. No Ethiopian club side has progressed as far into continental competition since.

Despite football's popularity, the absence of infrastructure, the lack of investment in youth football and external influences have seen the national team struggle. They finished fifth in their six-team qualification group for the 2026 World Cup with nine points from 10 matches.

The Philippines' most popular sports are basketball and boxing, inherited from American rule. As a result, football has not enjoyed the same funding as in other Asian nations and the Philippines have struggled to develop top-level players.

Having dropped outside the top 200 in the FIFA rankings in the early 2000s, the Philippine Football Federation (PFF) launched a fresh drive to bring in more foreign-born talent. This meant multiple English-born players representing the country; Chad Gould, who played his youth career at Bournemouth and Southampton, and the Greatwich brothers — Chris, Phil and Simon — alongside two brothers who had the greatest impact: Phil and James Younghusband.

The 2010s saw an upturn in results. The Philippines attained their highest FIFA ranking of 111, recorded their first win in World Cup qualifying and reached the group stage of the Asian Cup for the first time, in 2019.

The Philippines are currently ranked 141st by FIFA and they were eliminated in the second round of 2026 World Cup qualifying, picking up just one point from six matches.

They did qualify for their first Women's World Cup in 2023, defeating co-hosts New Zealand 1-0.

Vietnam was impacted by conflict for much of the latter half of the 20th century, which unsurprisingly limited its potential for sporting success. It was not until the 1990s that a professional structure could be put in place.

Despite limited resources compared to continental rivals, Vietnamese teams have provided AFC Champions League Two semi-finalists in 2009 and 2019. The AFC Champions League Elite has, inevitably, provided a tougher challenge, with Vietnam rarely having a representative beyond the group stages.

Vietnamese football has economic limitations compared to Asian rivals, yet the population's passion for the sport is well-established. A 2022 survey by Nielsen found that 75 per cent of Vietnam were football fans, a higher percentage than any other Asian nation.

Ranked 111th by FIFA, there is clearly potential to break into the top 100 and be in contention for future World Cup appearances. They were eliminated in the second round of Asian qualifying for 2026, with two wins from six group games proving insufficient to advance.

As with the Philippines, Vietnam reached the 2023 Women's World Cup for the first time. Despite losing all three group games, the success demonstrated the nation's potential to compete at the top level.

Luis Rubiales has had eggs thrown at him during the launch of his book, Matar a Rubiales (Kill Rubiales). (Getty Images: Europa Press/Francisco Guerra)

The former president of Spain's national football federation has had eggs thrown at him during a book launch.

Rubiales made international headlines after he kissed Spanish player Jenni Hermoso at the conclusion of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup final in Sydney.

Rubiales was charged with sexual assault and was convicted by Spain's High Court in February this year.

The former president of Spain's national football federation, who made headlines after his behaviour following the final of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, has had eggs thrown at him during the launch of his book.

A Foreign Correspondent investigation has detailed the decades of sexism and misogyny leading up to the infamous World Cup kiss.

Luis Rubiales resigned as president of the RFEF (Royal Spanish Football Federation) after he kissed Spanish player Jenni Hermoso, who was collecting her winner's medal following Spain's 1-0 win over England in the final at Sydney's Stadium Australia.

Rubiales was charged with sexual assault and was convicted by Spain's High Court in February this year.

The 48-year-old has written a book called Matar a Rubiales (Kill Rubiales), which he says, according to ESPN, is ""for those who want to know the reality"".

During a book launch event on Thursday (local time) in Madrid, someone from the audience threw eggs at Rubiales.

Footage of the incident shows Rubiales attempting to confront the egg thrower, with security keeping the pair separated.

""I didn't know what he had in his hands,"" Rubiales told Radio Marca.

""I thought he might have a gun … I wasn't thinking about myself.""

Rubiales was fined 10,800 euros ($19,200) following his conviction in February, but was acquitted on a charge of coercion.

A Spanish court rejected Rubiales's appeal of his conviction in June.

Italy national team coach Gennaro Gattuso has refused to accept criticism after his team left it late to win their World Cup qualifying match against Moldova. The World Cup winning former midfielder insists his side dominated the game despite what the scoreline suggested as he hit out at the fans for the reaction at the full-time whistle.

Italy controlled the first half of the World Cup qualifying game with an impressive 82 percent possession and created multiple chances, but poor finishing kept the scoreline unchanged. The second half followed a similar pattern, with Moldova frustrating Italy's attempts to break the deadlock. This led to the introduction of Mateo Retegui and young striker Pio Esposito to inject energy into the attack. The changes paid off, as goals from Gianluca Mancini and Esposito late in the game finally secured a hard-earned victory for Italy.

Gattuso commented on the rotation, acknowledging that putting 11 new players on the pitch is always a challenge when he said: “It's fine, putting 11 new players out from the start is difficult.” 

He admitted he was concerned that so many changes could disrupt the balance of the squad and that Italy could even lose, but he praised his players for their performance, saying: “I felt within myself we could even lose today with so many changes, but I tip my hat to them, they did better than I expected.”

However, with the match still at 0-0 late on, Italy's small group of travelling fans protested, chanting that the players should 'go to work'. Gattuso disagreed with their criticism, insisting that the team had performed well.

""The protests from the fans are a disgrace, I'm sorry for what I heard today,"" he said. ""This isn't the time to tell the players to go to work: we need to stay united, because the team is struggling on the pitch, and hearing 500 fans protesting away from home is something I don't accept.

""I'm very happy with the lads. We've brought in a whole new team, and we knew we'd struggle. I'm satisfied, but I'm angry about what I've heard in the last 30 minutes. Having 500 fans telling you to go work makes me feel bad. I'm disappointed about this. I don't know where it comes from, but in Italy's history it's the first time we've won six games. I'm convinced we'll get what we need to get because these lads are strong. Winning seven games boosts self-esteem.""

Norway, Italy's rivals for the top spot in the group, beat Moldova 11-1 in September, but Gattuso discouraged any comparisons with Italy's result, saying: “If you were expecting an 11-1like Moldova had against Norway, then that is not my problem. There are no easy matches.""

Italy can still technically qualify for the World Cup as Group I winners. They are three points behind Norway - their opponents in the next and final match of the round - but it would take a massive win to overcome the deficit in goal difference. Instead, a place in the play-offs appears certain for the Azzurri, which will ramp up the pressure on the recently-appointed Gattuso.

The national team have not appeared in a World Cup since 2014, having failed to qualify in both 2018 and 2022 after painful play off defeats to Sweden and North Macedonia. The upcoming play offs now represent another high stakes hurdle in their bid to return to football's biggest stage.

Gattuso was critical of the qualification rules, arguing that despite being the second-best team in the table with a plus twelve goal difference, Italy should not have to go through another round to qualify. “In my day, the top team in each group would go through, plus the best runners up,” He said. “We have 18 points, we have won six games, and still we have to go into another two matches to qualify. It does not seem right.”

Italy will host Norway on Sunday at the San Siro while also keeping an eye on the teams they could face in the play offs next March, which will decide their qualification for the 2026 World Cup. ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Disney CEO Bob Iger hinted at ""productive conversations"" with unnamed AI companies that would protect IP but add new features to the studio's flagship streaming service.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



	Don't want to wait until 2027 for Frozen 3? Soon, you may be able to make your own.


	On the company's fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 earnings conference call, Disney CEO Bob Iger said Disney+ is “in the midst of rolling out the biggest and the most significant changes — from a product perspective, from a technology perspective — since we launched the service in 2019.”




	Changes will include games — or at least “a number of game-like features” — on Disney+ through its agreement with Epic Games, he said. (The Epic Games deal is actually more about Disney IP being used on Epic's platform.) And there will also be gen-AI short-form user-generated content (UGC) on Disney+ in the future.

	“The other thing that we're really excited about, that AI is going to give us the ability to do, is to provide users of Disney+ with a much more engaged experience, including the ability for them to create user-generated content and to consume user generated content — mostly short-form — from others,” Iger continued.


	It sounds a bit like Disney plans to encroach on Open AI Sora's territory. (Or maybe it will just use Sora 2…)


	A bit later in the call, Iger said that Disney had “productive conversations” with unnamed AI companies, and that he hoped the studio giant could reach an agreement that would also “reflect our need to protect the IP.”

	











	You can't let Lilo & Stitch get into the wrong hands.


The Hollywood Reporter reached out to Disney to request more information on its Disney+ gen-AI UGC plans, but we did not immediately receive a response.


	Read Disney's Q4 results here. The company's streaming profits grew as Disney+ alone added 3.8 million subscribers. Disney also announced it planned to invest $1 billion more in content in 2026 than it did in 2025, and provided (a bit of) an update on its ongoing carriage fight with YouTube TV.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin isn't useful for much of anything, and that likely won't change.

Cardano is useful for a lot of things, and it could be useful for even more in the future.

10 stocks we like better than Cardano ›

Optionality is exciting, but successful investments typically have more to offer than optionality alone. If you're looking to deploy $1,000 of your capital into a leading cryptocurrency today, that distinction is key, because there are plenty of blockchains that claim to offer numerous options for how they might grow in the future, and only a few that can make a strong case to support the premise that they will actually durably grow in value over time.

That's the divide between Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Cardano (CRYPTO: ADA). So which asset is the better choice to invest $1,000 in?

Bitcoin's core advantages are both structural and durable.

Per its design, it gets harder to mine more Bitcoin over time, and only 21 million total Bitcoin will ever exist. That ceiling gets more claustrophobic for new buyers about every four years, when the protocol's halvings cut the rate of new issuance by 50%. And more than 19.9 million of those 21 million have already been mined.

This creates the conditions for an everlasting supply squeeze: If demand for the coin remains steady, a falling rate of issuance should put upward pressure on prices. Recently, the case that there will be persistent demand for new coins over the long term has been shored up by investment vehicles that buy and hold Bitcoin on investors' behalf, such as spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and digital asset treasury (DAT) companies. Both of those new classes of buyers have deployed large, punctuated waves of capital into the crypto throughout 2024 and 2025. And in early October, weekly crypto ETF inflows set a new record high.

The investment thesis for Bitcoin is that it does not need new tech development in the form of faster throughput, a new virtual machine, or a killer app to stay relevant. It just needs to keep being scarce, credibly neutral relative to fiat currencies, and easy to own through mainstream wrappers. If those conditions persist, its floating supply will keep shrinking relative to potential buyers, and over multiyear horizons, the price will tend to adjust upward to clear the market.

In other words, Bitcoin can continue to gain value without changing anything substantive about itself.

In stark contrast to Bitcoin, Cardano is constantly under development, and as a result, it has plenty of tools and features that could drive growth in its use, and therefore in its demand.

It has a decent smart contract stack, albeit one that's being used by a much smaller pool of developers than its chief competitor, Ethereum. It also has a defined maximum supply of 45 billion ADA, which some investors cite as a comfort. And its chain has an ecosystem with a few decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, as well as other decentralized applications (dApps), and it has some stablecoins too.

The difficulty lies in getting some traction in any of the segments where it's vying for capital in the face of intense competition.

Based on objective usage and value-capture metrics, Cardano is not the favorite option in any major crypto segment today. Its DeFi footprint remains modest relative to leading chains -- its total value locked (TVL) is about $271 million, while its top competitors have tens of billions of dollars in TVL. Likewise, Cardano's on-chain activity shows the presence of a few committed communities and consistently improving developer tooling, but its network has yet to debut a breakout application or demonstrate category leadership that reliably pulls capital and developers from elsewhere at scale.

Could that change eventually? Possibly, but it would require Cardano to overcome some stiff barriers, like the network effects enjoyed by peers with vastly larger capital bases.

Assuming that Cardano dramatically deepens its main liquidity assets like stablecoins and creates clearer pathways for financial institutions to operate on its chain with confidence, it might climb the rankings. But that is a multistep process, and its competitors will not be standing still in the meantime. Other smart contract platforms are already entrenched, commanding the mindshare, liquidity, and integrations Cardano needs to dislodge.

Whereas Bitcoin benefits from a one-variable story about its supply that strengthens as the rate at which new coins can be mined falls, Cardano will need multiple things to go right at once. That stack of dependencies makes it a riskier bet, and one that's a lot less likely to pay off. The relative appeal of Bitcoin only gets stronger when considering that Cardano will need to continue to reinvent itself over time as the competitive landscape it lives in keeps evolving.

Therefore, if you're looking to allocate $1,000 today, Bitcoin is the better option. Its scarcity and institutional adoption make it a hard asset to beat for investors looking for an asset that can grow in value for years to come.

            A strong Pacific storm is bringing soaking rain to Southern California and raising the risk of life-threatening flooding, mudslides and debris flows, especially near burn scars in the Los Angeles area.
    


            A mix of heavy rain and strong winds moved through northern and central California on Thursday. Widespread rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches were observed along the coast into Friday morning, with isolated amounts of 3 to 5 inches in the coastal mountain ranges.
    


            San Francisco received nearly an inch and a half of rain Thursday, almost  75% of November's average. November marks a transition into the rainier winter season, with December to February marking the wettest months of the year in the Bay Area.
    


            Winds in the higher elevations gusted 60 to 80 mph Thursday with San Francisco gusts topping 50 mph.
    


            The winds started to ease as the system dropped into Southern California early Friday, but the flood threat is intensifying as an atmospheric river feeds moisture from the ocean into the storm.
    


            Parts of the region – including much of the Los Angeles area – are under a Level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall on both Friday and Saturday, according to the Weather Prediction Center.
    


            An initial wave of heavy rain for southern California caused flooding and a mudslide late Thursday night on portions of Highway 101 in southern Santa Barbara County, according to the National Weather Service. This round of rain is expected to ease by Friday afternoon.
    


            A second, more intense wave will move into the region Friday night into Saturday, with prolonged heavy rain possible. Rainfall rates could be as high as an inch per hour at times.
    


            This second round of rain will also have the added danger of falling over already-wet ground, which struggles to absorb additional rain and will start flooding quicker than dry ground.
    


            There's also the potential for isolated severe thunderstorms embedded within the heavier rain Friday night into Saturday. Some of these storms could produce damaging wind gusts, hail and perhaps a short-lived tornado.
    


            Much of the Los Angeles area is under a flood watch through 10 p.m. Saturday. The National Weather Service warns that the storm could trigger life-threatening debris flows, knock out power and flood roads.
    


            Burn scar areas from recent wildfires in the region will be particularly vulnerable to mudslides and debris flows. Not only do wildfires destroy vegetation that would normally soak up some of the rainfall, but their extreme heat can alter the soil, creating a water-repellent layer just below the surface.
    


            Officials have warned residents near the recent Palisades, Hurst and Sunset fires' burn scars to be prepared to evacuate.
    


            “Residents, especially those in vulnerable areas, should start taking precautions immediately to prepare for the storm and protect their interests,” the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said. “This scenario would potentially create many significant impacts area-wide, including possible debris flows in the burn areas, significant ponding of roads and highways, mudslides through the canyons, fallen trees, etc.”
    


            Residents can pick up sandbags at Fire Stations throughout the City, with sand also available for free at select locations.
    


            The heaviest rain should ease late Saturday, but the region isn't in the clear right away. Showers linger into Sunday, and the ground will be saturated. It won't take much rain to trigger more minor flooding or keep roads slick, especially in spots that usually drain slowly after big storms.

            Ukraine struck a key oil terminal in the Russian port city of Novorossiysk overnight, causing infrastructure damage and igniting a blaze, as deadly overnight Russian strikes pounded Kyiv.
    


            The depot, one of Russia's largest oil export facilities, was targeted by Ukrainian forces in an attack acknowledged by officials from both countries that highlights Kyiv's escalating efforts to target a key source of war revenue for Russia.
    


            The Ukrainian General Staff said damage was caused to “valuable” infrastructure at the port and oil terminal, as well as a launcher from Russia's S400 air defense system.
    


            Ukrainian weapons were used in the attack on Novorossiysk, including long-range Neptune missiles and various types of strike UAVs, the General Staff said. Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine had launched the domestically produced long-range Neptune cruise missiles at Russian targets, without specifying where.
    


            “This is our entirely justified response to the ongoing Russian terror,” Zelensky said in a social media post.
    


            Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said this week that Ukraine was “increasing the effectiveness” of the use of domestic long-range weapons, including Neptune and Flamingo missiles, as well as jet drones.
    


            Earlier, a source within the Security Service of Ukraine said forces struck the “second-largest oil export center in Russia,” damaging oil tankers, pipeline infrastructure and pumping stations.
    


            The operation ignited a “major” fire at the facility, which remained burning on Friday morning, according to the source, who added that anti-aircraft missile systems were also hit.
    


            The Russian governor of Krasnodar Krai, Veniamin Kondratiev, confirmed the attack on the oil depot in Novorossiysk, claiming that fragments of downed Ukrainian drones had hit the oil depot.
    


            According to Kondratiev, at least four people were wounded as a result of Ukraine's attack on the port city, adding that at least four apartment buildings and two private homes had been damaged. A state of emergency has been declared there, he said.
    


            Overall, Russia's defense ministry said it had intercepted a total of 216 Ukrainian drones overnight.
    


            Meanwhile, residents of Kyiv experienced another heavy night of Russian aerial attacks. The Russian strikes on Ukraine's capital killed at least six people and injured dozens more, local authorities said.
    


            A married couple, aged 71 and 73, were among those killed, Kyiv police said.
    


            Two more people were killed in a Russian attack on the Black Sea city of Chornomorsk on Friday morning, according to the head of the Odesa regional military administration.
    


            Meanwhile, Russia's security service has claimed it foiled a plot by Ukraine to assassinate a high-ranking Kremlin official inside Russia as the alleged target visited a graveyard.
    


            Ukrainian special services were planning to target the unnamed man, described as “one of the highest-ranking officials of the Russian state,” while he was visiting the graves of his relatives at a cemetery outside Moscow, according to a Friday statement by Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB).
    


            The FSB also claimed in its statement that Ukraine is planning similar attacks inside Russia.
    


            CNN could not independently verify Russia's claims. The Security Service of Ukraine denied the report, telling CNN, “They are churning out fake news and statements non-stop. Our position is not to comment on their nonsense.”
    


            Assassinations have become a hallmark of the war between Russia and Ukraine. Targeted killings inside Russia and Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine have surged since 2022, according to monitoring group Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED).
    


            Ukraine has also seen assassinations. In July, a Ukrainian security services officer was gunned down in broad daylight in Kyiv, with authorities blaming Russia's security services for the killing.

China has warned that potential military involvement by Japan in the Taiwan issue would be treated as aggression and met with a forceful response. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi recently suggested her country could intervene in the Taiwan Strait. 

Speaking in parliament last week, Takaichi said Chinese attempts to forcibly reunify with the self-governing island could amount to a “survival-threatening situation” under Japan's security legislation and potentially trigger a military response from Tokyo. Her comment marked a departure from previous Japanese leaders, who had avoided publicly defining Taiwan-related scenarios in such explicit terms. 

On Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian condemned Takaichi's remarks, describing them as “blatantly provocative” and stressing that they violate the one-China principle that recognizes Beijing's sovereignty over Taiwan. 

“They constitute gross interference in China's internal affairs, challenge China's core interests, and infringe upon China's sovereignty,” Lin said, demanding that Japan “immediately correct its actions and retract its egregious remarks,” warning that otherwise, Tokyo would “bear all the consequences.” 

Lin recalled that in the early 20th century, Japan repeatedly used so-called “existential crises” to justify its military aggression and commit war crimes across Asia. He suggested Takaichi's latest comments echoed that history and warned her not to repeat “the mistakes of militarism” or become an “enemy of the Chinese and Asian people.” 

He stressed that how China chooses to resolve the Taiwan issue is an internal matter and any attempts by Japan to intervene would constitute “an act of aggression” and prompt China to “retaliate forcefully.” 

Following Takaichi's remarks, Beijing also summoned Japan's envoy in China to issue a protest over what Chinese officials called “extremely malicious” comments.  

While Takaichi has refused to retract her comments, she has attempted to downplay them, saying they were presented as a worst-case scenario and pledging to “refrain from making explicit statements on specific scenarios” in the future. 

Takaichi was elected as Japan's first female prime minister last month. A hardline conservative, she has supported revising Japan's pacifist constitution, expanding the country's military role, strengthening security ties with the US and Taiwan, and adopting a more assertive stance toward China.

By Fyodor Lukyanov, the editor-in-chief of Russia in Global Affairs, chairman of the Presidium of the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, and research director of the Valdai International Discussion Club.

Donald Trump is not, by instinct, a president who seeks war. But he is a president who believes deeply in projecting strength. And in the US, strength is almost always performed on the world stage.

Assessing American policy from the outside is notoriously difficult. The country's political system was built under unusual conditions – a state invented by immigrants, animated from the start by a belief in mission and divine favor. The early American republic saw itself as a righteous outpost opposing corrupt European empires. Later came the great land grab across the continent, then the mass immigration that built a continental power, and finally the leap to full global hegemony. This peculiar historical trajectory shapes a political system unlike any other.

To be fair, every major country is unique. All powers are shaped by their history, culture, and mythology. What stands out about the United States is that a nation so idiosyncratic in its development became the model others were expected to follow. Washington's insistence that its own experience is universally applicable is one of the more puzzling features of the last century. And one of the least examined.

These peculiarities have become harder to ignore during Donald Trump's presidency. And because of America's centrality, the internal contradictions of its system spill easily across its borders.

Trump won by articulating the fatigue of millions of Americans who feel their country has carried global responsibilities for too long. Yet, ironically, one year into his term he is most visible not at home but abroad. He boasts about brokering peace, launches sweeping trade wars, threatens force in multiple regions – especially the Caribbean – and loudly defends Christians and Europeans in Africa. Most recently he has revived loose talk of nuclear testing and a race for new strategic weapons.

This is happening while his domestic position looks far from assured. Polls show that the record-long government shutdown and the stalemate over funding has damaged the Republican Party. Local elections, including those in New York, were encouraging for his opponents. Even Trump's favorite tool (tariffs) now faces legal uncertainty, with the Supreme Court, which is dominated by conservatives, unsure whether to back him.

With a year until the midterms that will determine control of Congress, Washington is already shifting into campaign mode. And here lies the paradox: the candidate who accused his predecessors of obsessing over global affairs at the expense of ordinary Americans is increasingly relying on those same global affairs to sustain his presidency.

There is also a more personal calculation. The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded one month before Americans vote. Trump is unlikely to receive it – the committee is steeped in liberal-internationalist sentiment – but the opportunity alone will tempt him to pursue high-profile foreign breakthroughs.

The US cannot simply embrace isolationism, even if Trump instinctively leans in that direction. Too much of its prosperity rests on its global role: its financial reach, the dollar's supremacy, and its security commitments. A serious retreat would destabilize the system from which it benefits most. Trump probably lacks a coherent plan to reorient American power, but he understands, at some instinctive level, that change is necessary. Hence the chaotic, improvisational style: bold gestures, rapid reversals, and what sounds like a constant drumroll.

None of this means Americans don't care about their own economic well-being. Domestic concerns will always outweigh diplomatic theatrics. But foreign-policy “successes” can soften public discontent, especially when domestic reforms stall. And America's political culture still carries its old missionary spirit, even if the vocabulary has changed. Presidents, whether they admit it or not, are pushed toward global activism by the expectations of their own political class.

For the rest of the world, the conclusion is unavoidable. Washington's pace abroad will remain intense, and may well accelerate. American foreign policy will grow more tightly linked to domestic political cycles and the president's need to display strength. Trump does not want major wars requiring occupation or nation-building. But he relishes shows of power,  and those theatrics can create their own momentum. One can always be drawn into escalation while trying to avoid it.

This is the central point: Trump is not a warmonger, but a performer. His slogan, peace through strength, captures it perfectly. The risk is that the performance becomes the policy. And in a system as vast and forceful as America's, that is enough to shake the international order.

MOSCOW, November 14. /TASS/. Kiev is prepared to take any measures, including information provocations, to force young Ukrainians back from Europe as potential recruits, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters.

""There is intel indicating that the Kiev clique, despite officially lifting the ban on men aged 18 to 22 traveling abroad, is ready to take any measures — including staging information provocations — to force potential recruits who fled the country to return,"" the diplomat said. ""To this end, the regime has decided to exploit the growing sentiment among Europeans in favor of not abolishing but significantly reducing the benefits and preferences granted to the Ukrainians who have flooded the continent.""

""The emphasis will be placed on curtailing the Kiev regime's temporary protection programs and projects supporting Ukrainian emigrants. Western partners will advertise EU initiatives to return refugees to their homeland. They will also apply their own methods, such as provocation, denunciation, and discrediting of forced migrants. In particular, they will simulate the negative perception of Ukrainians by citizens of European Union countries,"" the spokeswoman said.

The diplomat stressed that one of the tasks set by the West for Vladimir Zelensky is ""the elimination of the Ukrainian population.""

""So what does all this mean? Zelensky is expected to kill more Ukrainian citizens. Now, everyone understands this because, apart from redistributing colossal funds and schemes with weapons, his task is also to destroy the citizens of Ukraine and this region,"" Zakharova added.

""As for the hatred toward Russia and everything Russian, we raise this issue constantly. <...> I would like to emphasize that it is now impossible to deny that one of the objectives set by the aggressive West, or the global minority represented by liberal Western regimes, is the destruction of the Ukrainian population. There is simply no other way to interpret or explain what is happening,"" the diplomat concluded.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, November 14. /TASS/. Russia will always remember the North Korean military's vital role in the hazardous and challenging task of clearing mines in the Kursk Region, Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday.

""We will never forget this assistance [from North Korea in mine clearance of the Kursk region],"" he said at a news briefing. ""This work continues, it is dangerous and difficult.""

""And indeed, our Korean friends are helping us immensely, we highly appreciate it,"" Peskov said in response to a question about the Kremlin's assessment of the North Korean military's assistance to clear the Kursk Region of mines.

Mine-clearing operations in the Kursk Region, which was earlier freed from Ukrainian forces, are still underway. Alongside Russian specialists, combat engineers from North Korea are taking part in the difficult task of clearing the area from explosive devices.

A unit of North Korean combat engineers was formed and deployed to the region by order of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The decision followed bilateral agreements based on a comprehensive strategic partnership deal inked during his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Pyongyang in June 2024.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Marine Mammal Center in Morro Bay and local harbor patrol teamed up for mission to reunite pup with its mother

It was a foggy October afternoon on the central California coast when the Marine Mammal Center got a call on their public hotline: there were distressed cries coming from the frigid waters in Morro Bay.

The center's experts were able to determine that the calls – which sounded almost like a human baby screeching – were coming from a roughly two-week-old sea otter pup that had been separated from its mother.

That could be deadly for young sea otters, according to Shayla Zink, who works at the center in Morro Bay.

“That pup is really relying on everything it learns from the mother to be able to survive in the ocean,” Zink said, adding that a mother sea otter cares for her pup for up to nine months, often carrying her small baby on her chest.

The employees at the center, with the help of the Morro Bay harbor patrol, jumped into action in what would be an hours-long journey.

First, they put the baby otter, who they named Caterpillar, into a safe container where it wouldn't overheat. Then, they recorded the sound of the pup's frantic cries.

The plan was to boat around the area blasting the sound of the baby through a Bluetooth speaker to attempt to lure the mother towards the boat. They used a recording because they were worried that the pup would get tired and stop screaming, leaving them without any way to let the mom know that her pup had been found.

It wouldn't be easy, but it wasn't the first time that a sea otter pup had been reunited with its mother that way – a similar technique had been used in 2019.

The center presides over marine mammals that live across approximately 600 miles (about 966km) of California coastline, but the small crew was determined, searching for two hours and playing the screeching cry nonstop, Zink said.

“Our intern had kept hitting play every once a minute,” she said. “I think we all went home and it was still playing over and over in our brains.”

Eventually, a female otter popped her head above water and followed the boat, which is behavior that Zink said wasn't normal since otters typically only sleep, eat and groom their thick, furry coats – uninterested in humans on boats.

But this female otter was persistent, Zink said. Zink played the speaker on one side of the boat and then ran to play it on the other – and each time the otter followed her.

Eventually, once they felt certain that the otter was looking for her baby, the Zink lowered the pup into the water. Video shows the mother swimming over to her baby, who floats helplessly on its back. Eventually, the mom grabs her baby in her arms and appears to smell him, running her small hands over its dense fur.

“I definitely cried a bit,” Zink said.

The reunion has bigger significance to the region, where sea otters play a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of marshy banks and preserving biodiversity.

By the 1920s, sea otters were nearly wiped out by centuries of industrial-scale hunting for their fur pelts, decimating a global population that once stretched from Alaska to California, as well as into Russia and Japan.

Hunting bans and habitat restoration efforts helped southern sea otters recover some of their former range, but Zink said that there are still only roughly 3,000 southern sea otters located in the California region.

“It's just a really special moment to be able to reunite this threatened species with its mother, because any and every individual in this population is so, so important to keeping it going and bringing it back from that threat status,” Zink said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

As he faces scrutiny amid latest Epstein email release, US president seeks to use Department of Justice to investigate opponents including Bill Clinton



The president continued to post on Truth Social today, notably saying that he will direct attorney general Pam Bondi and the FBI to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's “involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, JPMorganChase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him”.

Trump went on to claim, baselessly, that this is “another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats”.

Flight logs state that former president Bill Clinton travelled on Epstein's private jet several times. According to several emails from Epstein, released by the House oversight committee, Clinton never visited his private island. Meanwhile, Reid Hoffman – the longtime Democratic donor and venture capitalist – has said he engaged with Epstein in a fundraising capacity for the Massachussets Institute of Technology. Larry Summers, former treasury secretary under Clinton, was a friend of Epstein's and several emails between the two appear in the committee's most recent release.

In the tranche of documents published this week, Epstein said that Donald Trump “spent hours” at Epstein's home with one of his victims in an email to co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell. The president has maintained the correspondence released by House Democrats was part of the ongoing “hoax” around Epstein, and simply a deflection from their performance during the government shutdown.

Tom Homan, the president's border czar, has hit back against the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, after they issued a rare condemnation of the administration's immigration agenda.

“Secure borders save lives, and I wish the Catholic church would understand that,” Homan said, speaking to reporters outside the White House today. “So the Catholic church is wrong, I'm sorry. I'm a lifelong Catholic … I think they need to spend time fixing the Catholic church in my opinion.”

The border czar declined to comment on whether options for land strikes in Venezuela had been presented to Trump, or whether ICE agents would soon be conducting their next major operation in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Further to my last post on the announcement of a framework agreement, the White House has said in a statement that the US, Switzerland and Liechtenstein aim to conclude negotiations to finalize their trade deal by the first quarter of 2026.

Of the $200bn pledged Swiss investments in the United States, at least $67bn will come in 2026, it said, adding that the investments will target a range of sectors including pharmaceuticals, medical devices, aerospace and gold manufacturing.

Earlier we reported that US trade representative Jamieson Greer said that the US has “essentially reached a deal with Switzerland”, after the country was hit with a 39% tariff on Swiss exports to the US.

My colleague Callum Jones reports that Donald Trump has agreed to slash US tariffs on Switzerland to 15% as part of a new trade pact, lowering duties that strained economic ties and hit Swiss exporters.

The two countries have signed a “non-binding memorandum of understanding”, the Swiss government announced, following bilateral talks in Washington and intense lobbying by Swiss firms.

The Trump administration agreed to limit US tariffs on Switzerland and Liechtenstein “to a maximum of 15%” under the deal, according to a statement from the Swiss government.

This brings US tariffs on Switzerland in line with those on the European Union – allowing Swiss exporters the same treatment as rivals in neighboring countries.

In return, Switzerland will reduce tariffs “on a range of US products”, the statement said. “In addition to all industrial products, fish and seafood, this includes agricultural products from the US that Switzerland considers non-sensitive.”

Swiss officials also committed to granting a series of quotas for US goods that can be exported to Switzerland on a duty-free basis, including 500 tonnes of beef, 1,000 tonnes of bison meat and 1,500 tonnes of poultry.

“The date for implementing these market access concessions will be coordinated with the US to ensure that customs duties are reduced at the same time,” the statement said.

A series of exchanges between child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Larry Summers, the former US treasury secretary, showing a relationship as confidantes emerged among the emails released by Republican legislators this week.

The exchanges, from 2013 to early 2019, showed the two men sharing personal – and sometimes unseemly – views about politics and relationships.

“I'm trying to figure why [the] American elite think if u murder your baby by beating and abandonment it must be irrelevant to your admission to Harvard,” Summers wrote to Epstein in a 2017 email. “But hit on a few women 10 years ago and can't work at a network or think tank. DO NOT REPEAT THIS INSIGHT.”

At the time, Harvard was wrestling with an admissions debate after a formerly incarcerated woman's admission to a PhD program. Summers, a former president of the university who lost his position in a scandal after making sexist comments about female academics, went on to say in the email to Epstein: “I observed that half of the IQ In [the] world was possessed by women without mentioning they are more than 51 percent of population.”

After the Wall Street Journal revealed a previous tranche of emails between Epstein and Summers in a 2023 piece, a spokesperson for Summers told the paper that he “deeply regrets being in contact with Epstein after his conviction”.

In the massive trove of 20,000 emails from the Epstein estate released by Republican lawmakers this week are documents that show that Summers maintained congenial contact with the convicted child sex trafficker well into 2019, with the last email exchange occurring only months before Epstein's arrest.

Trump wrote on Truth Social today that he would be asking the DOJ and the FBI to investigate Epstein's “involvement and relationship” with Summers, among other prominent Democrats and business leaders.

In the emails, Summers and Epstein discuss politics – particularly Summers' contempt for Trump – as well as the details of philanthropic social networking – and women. Summers, 70, confided in Epstein in a 2019 exchange about his romantic gestures toward an unnamed woman, and being rebuffed.

“shes smart. making you pay for past errors,” Epstein wrote in an exchange on 16 March. “ignore the daddy im going to go out with the motorcycle guy, you reacted well.. annoyed shows caring., no whining showed strentgh.”

Summers reiterated his regret to the Harvard Crimson on Wednesday. “I have great regrets in my life,” he wrote. “As I have said before, my association with Jeffrey Epstein was a major error of judgement.”

The only remaining criminal case against Donald Trump has been revived after the head of Georgia's prosecutor's council appointed himself to replace Fani Willis, the Fulton county district attorney, who was removed from the election interference case in September.

Pete Skandalakis, a Republican and the executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia, the state body that provides legal training and is often charged to mitigate prosecutorial conflicts, wrote in a statement on Friday that he would be taking over for Willis.

A grand jury in Atlanta indicted Trump and 18 others in August 2023, using the state's anti-racketeering law to accuse them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn Trump's narrow 2020 loss to Joe Biden in Georgia. The alleged scheme included Trump's call to the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, urging him to help find enough votes to beat Biden.

The case remains the only criminal prosecution of Trump remaining, but it has been on life support after Willis was disqualified by the Georgia supreme court, which ruled that her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, revealed in dramatic court filings in January 2024, created an impermissible appearance of a conflict of interest.

Four people have pleaded guilty. Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty. While president, Trump is protected from state-level prosecutions, but the other 14 remaining defendants are still subject to prosecution.

“The filing of this appointment reflects my inability to secure another conflict prosecutor to assume responsibility for this case,” Skandalakis said. “Several prosecutors were contacted and, while all were respectful and professional, each declined the appointment.”

Trump's move, to focus on his rivals' affiliations and relationships with Epstein, is seemingly his latest effort to distance himself from the renewed focus on his own relationship with the disgraced financier, who died by suicide in federal prison in 2019, and the extent to which he was aware of his conduct.

The president continued to post on Truth Social today, notably saying that he will direct attorney general Pam Bondi and the FBI to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's “involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, JPMorganChase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him”.

Trump went on to claim, baselessly, that this is “another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats”.

According to several emails from Epstein, released by the House oversight committee, Clinton never visited his private island. Meanwhile, Reid Hoffman – the longtime Democratic donor and venture capitalist – has said he engaged with Epstein in a fundraising capacity for the Massachussets Institute of Technology. Larry Summers, former treasury secretary under Clinton, was a friend of Epstein's and several emails between the two appear in the committee's most recent release.

In the tranche of documents published this week, Epstein said that Donald Trump “spent hours” at Epstein's home with one of his victims in an email to co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell. The president has maintained the correspondence released by House Democrats was part of the ongoing “hoax” around Epstein, and simply a deflection from their performance during the government shutdown.

Several Republican senators have expressed disapproval about a provision tucked into the stopgap spending bill passed this week, which would allow lawmakers to sue the federal government because their phone records were subpoenaed in 2023 by the special counsel investigating Donald Trump's effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

“There needs to be accountability for the Biden DOJ's outrageous abuse of the separation of powers, but the right way to do that is through public hearings, tough oversight, including of the complicit telecomm companies, and prosecution where warranted,” said senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, one of the eight lawmakers whose phone data the FBI sought and obtained.

For his part, House speaker Mike Johnson has pledged to repeal the provision next week, and many House Republicans are incensed about the language in the bill.

“Interesting seeing my colleagues express outrage over this provision yet still vote for it when they could have been strong and not let the Senate jam the House,” said GOP member Greg Steube, who represents the Florida suncoast. “There was no reason this needed to be in the bill to reopen the government. The Senate used a crisis to pass an unethical provision and now the House is complicit.”

Donald Trump has claimed on social media that Democratic lawmakers are doing “everything in their withering power to push the Epstein Hoax again”. This comes after emails released this week by the House oversight committee seem to suggest that the president may have known about Jeffrey Epstein's conduct.

In his post on Truth Social a short while ago, Trump added that the latest batch of documents are being used to “deflect” from Democrats' “bad policies and losses, specially the SHUTDOWN EMBARRASSMENT, where there party is in total disarray and has no idea what to do”.

The president has yet to address the emails, or the wider record release, which included more than 20,000 pages. On Thursday, he took no questions from reporters at an executive order signing in the East Room. He has, however, been resolute about his stance online. White House officials have recapitulated his claims that the new information is merely a distraction.

“Some Weak Republicans have fallen into their clutches because they are soft and foolish,” Trump wrote on Friday. “Epstein was a Democrat, and he is the Democrat's problem, not the Republican's problem! Ask Bill Clinton, Reid Hoffman, and Larry Summers about Epstein, they know all about him, don't waste your time with Trump. I have a Country to run!”

Americans should “raise hell” to protect US national parks through the “nightmare” of Donald Trump's presidency, according to a former National Park Service director, amid alarm over the impact of the federal government shutdown.

Jonathan Jarvis claimed the agency is now in the hands of a “bunch of ideologues” who would have no issue watching it “go down in flames” – and see parks from Yellowstone to Yosemite as potential “cash cows”, ripe for privatization.

Jarvis, who led the NPS from 2009 to 2017, faced intense scrutiny, a five-hour grilling in Congress and calls for his resignation after closing all 401 national park sites during a previous shutdown, in October 2013.

He was certain, despite the backlash, that it was the right thing to do: keeping them open with a skeleton staff would have put parks and their visitors at risk, his team concluded.

Over the past month, hundreds of NPS veterans including Jarvis, 72, have watched aghast as most of the agency's workers were furloughed during the longest shutdown in US history – while the Trump administration kept all national parks open.

There have been consequences.

A fire at Joshua Tree national park burned through about 72 acres. Yosemite faced a wave of illegal Base jumping. Yellowstone grappled with bear jams.

Vandalism included graffiti in Arches national park. A stone wall at Gettysburg national military park was damaged. Trash started to gather at various sites.

Thousands of NPS workers are typically around to guide visitors safely through parks, point them in the right direction, swiftly rescue them from danger, keep traffic moving, monitor wildlife and protect the landscape.

“You take all of that away – all of those employees – you basically are, on one hand, creating unsafe conditions for the visitor,” Jarvis said, adding: “And you're putting basically these irreplaceable resources at risk.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Documents include emails depicting coordinated effort to influence online search results and journalists

Jeffrey Epstein and his associates worked to suppress negative press and rebuild his image in the years after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to state charges in Florida of solicitation of prostitution and of solicitation of prostitution with a minor, newly released documents reveal.

The documents, among 20,000 pages released on Wednesday by Republican members of the House oversight committee, include emails and memos that depict a coordinated effort to influence online search results and journalists, and restore Epstein's reputation.

In December 2010, Epstein, who was released from jail in July 2009, exchanged a series of emails with Al Seckel, an eccentric collector who appeared to be helping manage Epstein's online reputation. An obituary says Seckel died in France in 2015.

“The google page is not good,” Epstein complained on 11 December. “After sept when you told me you thought it would take appox twenty thousand to clean up and hopefully in time for Nov 1, then another ten thousand, and another ten thousand and your emails about how you are all about results.”

Seckel sent Epstein screenshots of the first page of Google search results for Epstein's name, assuring the financier that the “daily beast article is gone” from the list, and that “the other ones, including the powerful Huffington Post, are about to be pushed off”.

The screenshots show a HuffPost story titled “Jeffrey Epstein, Convicted Pedophile and Former Hedge Fund Titan Now a Free Man” published on 21 July 2010, as the seventh link on the list of search results.

A few days later, on the 15th, Seckel informed Epstein that “the bots did the sweep”.

“You only have one negative article left on front page of google, which is the Huffington Post article,” Seckel said. “The Huffington Post is extremely hard to move, because it is so powerful, has millions of links to it, and uploads massive new and original content it on a daily basis with posting from outside readers.”

Still, he claimed that he had been able to “push it down the page”. In the attached screenshot, the HuffPost story was now eighth on the search results.

Seckel also claimed that “toxic suggested search engine terms that popped up automatically when you typed in your name” had also been removed.

In the email, Seckel celebrated what he described as an “important victory” when it came to Epstein's Wikipedia page. “The headlines do not mention convicted sex offender or pedophile,” he said, “instead, Philanthropic work, Epstein Foundation, Promotion of Scientists.

“Your wiki entry now is pretty tame,” he claimed, adding that “bad stuff has been muted” and pushed to the bottom. “We hacked the site to replace the mug shot and caption, and now has an entirely different photo and caption,” he added. “This was a big success.”

Wikimedia, the non-profit organization that hosts Wikipedia, did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.

But Seckel warned that while the results were “up and in the direction we hoped” they were “still new, and subject to volitility, especially if new original content is not added on a minimum of a weekly basis”. He told Epstein that the work “needs to be maintained” and told the financier that payments were “now due if you want to continue”.

Epstein pushed back, responding that he was “never told never that there was a 10K fee per month” adding: “you initially said the project would take 20..then another 10. then another 10.”

Seckel replied that while his “initial estimate” was “25”, the job was “far far worse” than “originally expected” and told Epstein: “You have a dedicated group of people trying to undo and damage you, including now.”

Later in the email, Seckel wrote: “I spend literally four months of non-stop work, creativity and my own political capital to get you this so far, which not only saved you time, but countless dollars and isn't something that can be readily bought.

“We were trying to fix up your mess,” he added. “I didn't create it. Just thought it would be something to help. This was NEVER about pulling money out of you.”

In another email that month, Seckel wrote that they had “managed to knock out Daily Beast again” and they had “managed to push” the HuffPost piece near the bottom of the page of search results, and said that it could be “pushed off” but that it would “take a bit more work”.

The HuffPost story, according to the screenshot shared, was now down to the 10th on the search list.

The documents also show associates making efforts to shape media coverage. In March 2011, R Couri Hay, a New York-based publicist, who, in 2019, told Town & Country that he had spoken with Epstein three times and that Epstein had come to him for help with his image, wrote to Epstein saying that a Newsweek reporter was working on a story about him, focused on Epstein's “reemergence in New York post your previous problems”.

“If you hire me I feel confident that I can positively affect this feature on your behalf,” Hay, who told the New York Times in 2019 that he ultimately declined to work for Epstein and had misgivings about Epstein's sincerity, wrote. “That does not mean I can control it completely or that they would reference past problems. However, I can assure you that the story will be fair and balanced and that your side will be represented intelligently.”

Hay suggested arranging interviews with people who “have seen the good things that you have done in business, science, and philanthropy”.

In a message several days later, Hay wrote that the story was being “written without your input” and tells Epstein that he has been “subtly guiding” the reporter “on your behalf”. In the email, Hay added that he would like to “formalize this job with your attorneys and then I would really need to give names and numbers of pro Jeffery power brokers” for the reporter to call.

Hay did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.

A June 2011 memo from public relations firm Osborne & Partners, titled “Issues of Reputation”, is also among the documents, and appears to have been put together for Epstein and outlines a strategy to repair his image. The Guardian reported earlier this year that in 2012 Epstein had been in contact with Ian Osborne, who ran the PR firm. Osborne & Partners did not respond to a request for comment for this story.

The memo advises minimizing any mentions in the tabloid press, restoring “your profile” in select media, political and philanthropic circles, establishing “you as a pioneering support of science and technology” and suggests hosting “some kind of annual event which brings together your business and philanthropic interests”.

Under “tabloid press attention”, the memo stated: “Since it is an unambiguous objective of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday to take down Prince Andrew, it is disastrous for you to be seen in any way to facilitate his lifestyle, or to help with his well documented issues.

“Their sole interest in you and Ghislaine is as a means to attack Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson,” the firm added. “You need to studiously avoid any involvement whatsoever with the couple, which will lessen the interest and we can establish a constructive relationship on your behalf with them.”

The firm also suggested a “clean-up” of search results on “all major search engines where your name is part of a search query”, describing it as an “urgent priority”. The firm also advised engaging with “top editors and columnists”, especially “serious business and financial journalists”.

In July 2011, Epstein emailed prominent publicist Peggy Siegal urging her to reach out to Arianna Huffington to enlist HuffPost to investigate “Andrews accuser”, seemingly referencing the late Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's most prominent accusers who also alleged that she had been sexually assaulted by Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. He has consistently denied the allegations and settled Giuffre's sexual assault case in 2022.

In the email, Epstein wrote that Huffington “should champion the dangers of false allegations” and “send a reporter or reporters to investigate” Giuffre. “The palace would love it,” he added.

“The girl in the photo, was nothing more than a telephone answerer, she was never 15, according to her version she worked for trump, first at that age, at MAra lago [sic],” Epstein added.

Siegal replied that “if you rewrite your last email in better grammar (and so I have a better understanding) I can cut and paste and send it to Arianna Huffington from me”. Epstein responded with a rewrite.

In a phone call on Thursday, Siegal told the Guardian that she never forwarded Epstein's edited email to Huffington and had “no reason to call her”.

“It was preposterous for him to think that I would get involved in his idiotic nefarious affairs and jeopardize my good relationship with Arianna,” Siegal said, adding that she had a working relationship with Huffington, who published her Oscar diaries every year.

“Jeffrey was completely delusional and lived in his own fantasy of a world that revolved around him as he always thought he was the smartest person in the room,” she said. “He was a complete ego-maniac who was obsessed with his own false sense of power.”

In a statement, a spokesperson for HuffPost said: “Arianna Huffington has not been affiliated with HuffPost since 2016. To the best of our knowledge, no talk of this coverage ever made it to HuffPost.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Taiwan's leadership strengthens the world, and the world deserves access to solutions proposed by Taiwan, he said.

Lai thanked Drew for his remarks at the UN General Assembly this year, including urging the international community to support Taiwan's engagement and underscoring the importance of stability across the Taiwan Strait.

Noting that this is Drew's third visit to Taiwan since taking office in 2022, he congratulated the prime minister on being awarded a Most Influential People of African Descent Lifetime Achievement Award this year.

Yesterday's meeting came one day after the arrival of the Saint Kitts and Nevis delegation led by Drew, which includes Minister of Foreign Affairs Denzil Douglas, Ambassador-at-large Leon Natta-Nelson and Ambassador to Taiwan Donya L. Francis.

Also present at the meeting were Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍) and Ambassador to Saint Kitts and Nevis Edward Tao (陶令文).

Drew during the visit is also overseeing the signing of sister-city partnership agreements between Taipei and Tainan, and Saint Kitts and Nevis' capital, Basseterre.

The visit is to conclude on Monday.

Editor's Note: Updated at 1:58 PM Kyiv time with new commentary from Ukraine's Security Service.

Ukrainian drones struck the Russian port city of Novorossiysk, Krasnodar Krai, on Nov. 14, damaging an oil terminal and sparking a large fire, multiple Russian Telegram channels and local officials reported.

The attack hit the Sheskharis oil complex, damaging infrastructure facilities and sparking a blaze. The facility is a major oil export terminal that serves as the endpoint for pipelines run by Russia's state-run Transneft, the world's largest oil pipeline company.

The Krasnodar Krai operational headquarters reported the hit at the oil terminal and said it had damaged several coastal facilities. Officials claimed they had extinguished the fire at the Sheskharis complex. 

Russian state media RIA Novosti also resported that a civilian vessel in the port was hit during the mass UAV strike, leaving three crew members injured.

Subsequently, Ukraine's Security Service, or SBU, told the Kyiv Independent that they and elements of Ukraine's armed forced were behind the attack, hitting ""oil-loading arms at the wharves, pipeline infrastructure and pumping installations."" 

The SBU said that powerful fires continued at the terminal as of just before 2 PM Kyiv time on November 14. 

Russian air defense units shot down 66 drones over Krasnodar Krai overnight, the Russian Defense Ministry said. 

The Kyiv Independent could not confirm these claims at the time of publication.

Andrii Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation, commented on the attack on social media. 

""This is the oil terminal in Novorossiysk after the strike,"" he wrote on Telegram. ""Meanwhile, Russia is hitting residential buildings and energy infrastructure.""

The strike on Novorossiysk came as Russia pounded Kyiv with waves of drones and missiles during a massive attack that left at least 14 people injured and a dozen apartment buildings in flames.Novorossiysk, a key hub for Russia's Black Sea logistics and energy infrastructure, has been repeatedly targeted in Ukrainian strikes. Kyiv considers Russian oil refineries and petrochemical facilities to be valid military targets as they help fund Moscow's war efforts.

Serhii Vlasenko, 35, has served in Ukraine's Emergency Service for 15 years and was on duty as a shift supervisor when the attack occurred.

If carried out, the deportation would mark the highest number of Ukrainians removed from the U.S. in recent years, the Washington Post reported.



 Pokrovsk, a city that held back some of Russia's fiercest assaults for over a year, is now on the verge of falling. The Kyiv Independent's Francis Farrell explains how the battle reached this point and what Pokrovsk's fall could mean for the wider defense of Donetsk Oblast. 

Alvarez & Marsal has been tapped as the investment advisor for the U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal, officials announced on Nov. 14, the latest step in a widely-watched agreement to invest in Ukraine's critical resource sectors.

An Iskander-type missile fell on the embassy's territory, causing an explosion that damaged its facilities and service vehicles, Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry said. 





The statement follows reports that President Volodymyr Zelensky's former business partner Timur Mindich had been tipped off about possible searches and left the country beforehand.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius also announced that Berlin has agreed to allocate an additional 150 million euros ($175 million) in military aid to Kyiv under the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) initiative.

At least 11 apartment buildings throughout the city were struck in the overnight attack, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.

Ukrainian drones struck the Russian port city of Novorossiysk on Nov. 14, damaging an oil terminal and sparking a large fire, multiple Russian Telegram channels reported.

""We do not accept this obviously unlawful solution contrary to European values,"" Orban said on a weekly radio show. ""We are turning to the European Court of Justice.""

The two leaders will discuss bilateral cooperation in the ""energy, economic, and defense fields,"" as well as progress in preparing security guarantees for Ukraine under the ""Coalition of the Willing"" framework.

Russia has actively recruited, hoodwinked and kidnapped workers for its war machine from across the developing world.

An unidentified drone was sighted over a gunpowder plant in southwestern France on Nov. 12, following similar incidents just two days earlier, French news channel BFM TV reported, citing prosecutors.

The incident is the latest in a string of suspicious drone sightings across European airports, defense factories, and other strategic civilian and military sites in recent months.

The factory, located in the Bergerac commune and capable of producing 1,200 tons of artillery gunpowder annually, is owned by Eurenco, one of Europe's leading ammunition and explosives companies.

Two illegal drone overflights were previously recorded over the plant on the evening of Nov. 10, BFM TV reported.

Despite searches, the drone operators have not been identified. Local authorities have launched an investigation into the incidents.

General Marc Le Bouil, the French commander of air defense and air operations, told lawmakers on Nov. 12 that the drone appeared to be a commercially available model made by the Chinese firm DJI.

Recent drone sightings have caused disruptions in several European countries, including Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands. As investigations continue, local authorities have not ruled out that Russia may be behind the incursions.

In recent weeks, unidentified drones have been spotted in Belgium over a nuclear power plant, Brussels Airport, and the Kleine Brogel Air Base. The country's military has issued orders to open fire against drones in case of further incursions.

The unexplained drone sightings were preceded by Russian aircraft and drones violating NATO airspace on several occasions.

Polish forces shot down several Russian drones that entered their airspace during an attack on Ukraine in early September. Incursions by Russian warplanes were later reported over Estonian and Lithuanian territory.

The incidents prompted calls for a more forceful response, including downing Russian aircraft and drones if necessary.

The second round of infrastructure plans includes long-term bets on energy and critical minerals considered vital to future trade and industrial needs

Prime Minister Mark Carney has unveiled the second round of projects to be considered for fast-track approval because of their perceived national importance. All the projects announced Thursday are related to energy and critical minerals mining, resources that are considered vital to future trade and industrial needs.

But not all the projects are going swimmingly. One is entangled in opposition from neighbouring First Nations. At least one has faced a long delay. And some just need a lot of money.

Here are roundups of the strengths and weaknesses of the projects that made the second round and are being referred to the Calgary-based Major Projects Office. The office was set up to speed along infrastructure and resource development proposals, as part of Mr. Carney's efforts to deliver on his campaign promise to reduce Canada's economic reliance on the United States amid President Donald Trump's trade war.

LNG project faces Indigenous opposition 

The Nisga'a Nation-backed Ksi Lisims LNG project is a planned export terminal that would enable liquefied natural gas to be sent from northwest British Columbia. But the project has faced opposition from nearby Indigenous groups and climate activists.

Construction costs alone for Ksi Lisims are expected to reach $10-billion, plus another $12-billion for the Prince Rupert Gas Transmission (PRGT) pipeline project, which would transport natural gas more than 750 kilometres from northeast B.C. to Pearse Island located on Nisga'a territory. Two floating production platforms are to be constructed in South Korea for Ksi Lisims, while various other LNG infrastructure would be built in B.C.

Ksi Lisims would rely on natural gas from PRGT, which is co-owned by the Nisga'a and Houston-based Western LNG.

The Nisga'a, Western LNG and a group of natural gas producers named Rockies LNG are partners in Ksi Lisims.

Shell PLC-led LNG Canada started shipping natural gas in liquid form to Asia from Kitimat, B.C., in June, when it became the country's first LNG export terminal.

Ksi Lisims is facing two separate legal challenges in Federal Court, with one launched by the Lax Kw'alaams Band and the other by the Metlakatla First Nation from the Prince Rupert area.

Other Indigenous representatives in northwest B.C. who oppose LNG include Gitanyow hereditary chiefs.

The dispute risks escalating into a repeat of the conflict over the Coastal GasLink pipeline.

A group of Wet'suwet'en Nation hereditary chiefs has led a campaign opposing Coastal GasLink, the first export pipeline for natural gas across northern B.C., which is supplying gas to the LNG Canada site in Kitimat.

John Ridsdale, a climate activist whose Wet'suwet'en hereditary chief name is Na'Moks, is among the Indigenous leaders who opposed Coastal GasLink and is now also criticizing Ksi Lisims and PRGT.

Northern B.C. transmission line still requires financing

A worker walks in the BC Hydro Skeena Substation while under construction in Terrace, B.C., on Thursday.ETHAN CAIRNS/The Canadian Press

BC Hydro's North Coast Transmission Line (NCTL) project would effectively twin the existing 450-kilometre transmission route in British Columbia from the Williston substation near Prince George to the Skeena substation near Terrace.

Details yet to be worked out include how the $6-billion in capital costs would be financed.

BC Hydro has said that it would normally take eight to 10 years to devise and construct a major transmission project, in collaboration with First Nations. The hope is that the timing could be fast-tracked so that the first phase might be completed by 2032, with construction starting in 2026.

With the eventual addition of spur lines, the goal is to supply or increase electricity to B.C. customers such as the Port of Prince Rupert, mining companies and the proposed Ksi Lisims LNG project.

“The North Coast Transmission Line is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to drive economic growth in B.C.'s Northwest – powering traditional industries and unlocking new ones,” B.C. Energy Minister Adrian Dix said in a statement on Thursday.

The Canada Infrastructure Bank, a federal Crown corporation, said on Thursday that it has finalized a $139.5-million loan to BC Hydro to help back early activities on NCTL.

In September, Ottawa referred the concept of the “northwest critical conservation corridor” in B.C. to the Major Projects Office for consideration. The corridor would support development such as projects for critical minerals and hydroelectricity.

“We're ready to build the infrastructure that will support jobs, attract investment and deliver clean, reliable energy to fuel B.C.'s next chapter,” BC Hydro president Charlotte Mitha said in a news release.

Nickel project in Northern Ontario with a US$2-billion price tag 

Canada Nickel Co.'s Crawford Nickel Project is touted as the world's second-largest nickel-sulphide reserve. The junior miner has been working to advance the development, located 42 kilometres north of Timmins, Ont., since acquiring it in 2019.

With a price tag of more than US$2-billion, the project is aimed at supplying the electric vehicle and stainless steel markets with nickel as well as chromium, cobalt, platinum and palladium over its 41-year life. The development will include ore crushing and processing facilities as well as carbon-removal in the form of tailings carbonization technology that could store 1.5 million tonnes of carbon per year.

The government's referral of the Crawford project to the Major Projects Office will help attract international investors and potential offtake partners to chip in for construction as well as put its remaining permits in the priority line, Canada Nickel chief executive Mark Selby told reporters on Thursday. In addition, it can help the company take advantage of other government programs as it nears construction, he said.

To help stay afloat during the mine planning and permitting stages, Canada Nickel sold equity stakes in the company to Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd., South Korea's Samsung SDI, British Anglo American PLC and Taykwa Tagamou Nation. The company also has benefits and contracting agreements with the Mattagami, Matachewan, and Flying Post First Nations.

Its funding plans include $1-billion of equity, including federal refundable tax credits and carbon capture and storage tax credits worth more than US$600-million, $100-million from exercise of a Samsung SDI offtake option, up to $300-million from federal and provincial and well as G7 sources.

It is also planning on US$500-million of debt financing from Export Development Canada, $500-million from another Canadian government institution and any remaining needs from private investors.

Bid to disrupt China's dominance in graphite mining

Nouveau Monde Graphite Inc. is developing its Matawinie Mine 120 kilometres north of Montreal. Expected to come online in 2027 or 2028, it is slated to produce roughly 106,000 tonnes of graphite concentrate annually over its 25-year life. Natural flake graphite is used in lithium ion battery anodes, fuel cells, aerospace components and advanced coatings for defence and infrastructure. 

The Quebec government in 2021 issued authorization for Matawinie. NMG is now advancing financing discussions toward a final investment decision on the second phases of both the mine and the company's Bécancour Battery Material Plant, which will process graphite from Matawinie. 

NMG is being included on the major projects list after Ottawa signed an offtake agreement with the company for 15,000 tonnes of graphite concentrate each year. The government plans to stockpile the product to challenge China's dominance of the industry. Another 15,000 tonnes will be offered to allied countries or companies. 

Tim Hodgson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, announced the agreement on the sidelines of the G7 Energy and Environment Ministers Summit in Toronto last month. 

Eric Desaulniers, NMG chief executive, told media Thursday that Canada is the only G7 supplier of graphite. Dominic LeBlanc, Minister of Internal Trade, added that including NMG on the major projects list sent a “very strong signal about the potential of this project for Canada's economy and for Canadian sovereignty.”

“Once the mine and the plant are operational, Canada will be able to secure a supply of a critical mineral, which is an essential component in clean energy technologies like electric vehicle batteries and energy storage systems,” he said. 

The company has also secured commercial offtake agreements with Panasonic Energy Co. and Traxys North America LLC, and is in negotiations with an unnamed established anode manufacturer, according to its website. Together, those deals and the one with Ottawa would cover almost all of the flake graphite that would be produced by the second phase of the Matawinie mine.

New Brunswick tungsten project has been stalled for a decade

The Northcliff Sisson project is a New Brunswick tungsten-molybdenum mine that, according to a 2013 feasibility study, will haul 30,000 tonnes of ore out of the ground per day, drawing from one of the largest tungsten deposits in the world. 

The project will include on-site processing and is expected to employ approximately 200 to 300 people, with a mine lifetime of 27 years. 

“These are very important critical minerals that can shape the future of Canada and its allies,” said Andrew Ing, chief executive of Northcliff Resources Ltd., in an interview. 

Tungsten production is dominated by China, which produces 80 per cent of global supply. There are no producing tungsten mines in Canada or the U.S. In February, Beijing added the critical mineral to its export restriction list, sending prices higher and sparking questions about mineral sovereignty. 

But the Sisson project has been stalled at the pre-construction phase for over a decade. 

The project has struggled to secure private investment, Mr. Ing said. China can flood the market to keep competition out and this deters investment. 

Mr. Ing is hoping Ottawa will follow this announcement with price-floor guarantees for tungsten.

In October, G7 environment ministers gathered in Toronto unveiled a Canada-led critical minerals pact that will involve purchase agreements, price floors and stockpiling of critical minerals. 

Without follow-through on the price floors and purchase agreements for tungsten, the project is unlikely to get off the ground, said Brian Buss, a mining consultant who specializes in financing. 

“The model China uses currently is the model North America will need to adopt,” he said. 

In the past seven months, the Sisson project has received $29-million in combined funding from the Canadian and U.S. governments. These funds will go toward updating the original 12-year old feasibility study, which should be completed in the second quarter of 2026, Mr. Ing said. Construction is expected to begin mid-2027 and last two years. 

New Zealand-based, family owned conglomerate the Todd Corporation is the primary shareholder of Northcliff Resources Ltd. The Todd Corporation also has a 11.5-per-cent direct stake in the Sisson project.

Inuit-owned hydro project aims to stabilize electricity costs

The notion of building hydroelectric dams near Iqaluit, the largest community in Nunavut with a population of about 7,400, first surfaced two decades ago, but progress has been elusive. The latest proposal, backed by an Inuit-owned developer, was referred to the Major Projects Office Thursday.

Nunavut Nukkiksautiit Corp. (NNC) aims to build a hydroelectric dam in a remote location along the Kuugaluk River, about 60 kilometres northeast of the community. With a proposed capacity between 15 and 30 megawatts, it's expected to cost around $500-million. It would be among Canada's northernmost hydroelectric dams.

“This is a breakthrough for Arctic sovereignty and sustainability,” Mr. Carney asserted Thursday. “It will save $1.9-billion in diesel costs over the next 50 years, while providing affordable, reliable, emission-free power.”

Earlier this year, the territorial government identified the project as one of four priority projects it urged the federal government to back. The Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency committed up to $6-million in February to support the early engineering work, following on $7-million provided by the Northern Affairs department in 2021.

Sprawling and thinly populated, Nunavut lacks a territorial power grid: each community is served by its own distribution system and a diesel-powered power plant. The cost and logistical challenges associated with shipping diesel high into the Arctic contribute to some of the country's priciest power bills. 

The developer says the project would stabilize and possibly reduce electricity prices, while also eliminating air pollution and odour; Iqaluit's diesel plant would remain in service for backup and emergencies. 

“We've heard loud and clear from Inuit that they've been waiting a long time for renewable energy to come to Nunavut,” said Jess Puddister, NNC's manager of strategy and operations.

“Inuit are really tired of having to be diesel-dependent. It's not something they ever asked for in the first place.”

NNC said earlier this year it planned to make a final investment decision in 2029; construction could commence in 2030. Ms. Puddister said that with additional funding and quicker data collection for the project, it might begin as early as 2028.

Crown utility Qulliq Energy Corp. is the territory's sole electricity provider. It considered a hydro project around Iqaluit in 2005, eventually proposing a 12.5-megawatt dam at Jaynes Inlet, 60 kilometres southwest of the city. But Qulliq, which operates about two-dozen aging diesel generators, couldn't finance the project and put it on hold in 2014.

NNC is now negotiating a power purchase agreement that will determine how much electricity Qulliq will agree to buy from the project, at what price and on what terms. Ms. Puddister said her company expects to provide an update on those talks by the end of this year.

After months of wrangling, the government has decided not to reintroduce conscription. But all 18-year-old males will have to fill in a questionnaire, and young men will soon have to undergo mandatory physical exams.

Although the German armed forces, the Bundeswehr, needs tens of thousands more soldiers, there will be no return to compulsory military service, according to the governing parties. ""The new military service is initially based on voluntary service,"" is the key sentence of the draft bill, which will go before the German parliament in December. In future, however, there will be mandatory physical assessments for all 18-year-old men.

Defense Minister Boris Pistorius from the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) plans to launch the new voluntary military service — with better conditions and pay than old-style conscription — at the start of January.

""Other European countries, especially Nordic ones, have shown that the principle of voluntary service combined with attractiveness works — and I expect it to be the same here, "" said the Social Democrat after the coalition leaders reached an agreement. ""The number of applicants is increasing, the recruitment figures are rising,"" stressed Pistorius. The aim is to recruit 20,000 new volunteers by 2026. They will receive €2,600 ($3,025) per month before tax.

The governing parties have been at loggerheads over recent months over whether the armed services could recruit enough volunteers to satisfy Germany's defense needs. The Bundeswehr currently has around 182,000 soldiers. Yet at least 260,000 will be needed by 2035 to fulfil NATO requirements.

Politicians from the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), argued that this ambitious goal could only be achieved with a return to compulsory military service, or at least with a mechanism that automatically triggered a return to compulsory military service in the event that there were not enough volunteers.

The Social Democrats, however, strictly rejected a return to compulsory military service. Now the parties have reached a compromise. If volunteer numbers don't tally up, the Bundestag will have to decide whether to introduce ""compulsory military service on demand"" for a certain number of young men.

The CDU / CSU parliamentary group has also praised the agreement. Alexander Hoffmann (CSU) described it as achieving the ""right mix of free will and obligation.""

Although military service remains voluntary, all 18-year-old men will have to fill out questionnaires, called a ""declaration of willingness,"" from 2026. They will have to answer questions about their physical fitness and their willingness to serve in the armed forces.

All 18-year-olds will, in fact, receive a QR code that links to the survey. Women can choose to fill it in and express their willingness to serve in the Bundeswehr. But this will not be mandatory because Germany's Basic Law stipulates that only men can be conscripted.

From July 2027, all 18-year-old men will also be subject to a medical examination to see if they are fit for duty, starting with men born in 2008. Around 300,000 young men per year will be affected. The defense minister argues that this is the only way for the Bundeswehr to get an idea of who could be called up in the event of a conflict.

District conscription offices, dotted across the country, used to be responsible for these inspections. With the end of compulsory military service in 2011, these offices were abolished. The Defense Ministry is now rushing to create a new infrastructure and is already inspecting properties for this purpose. Pistorius emphasized that the Bundeswehr's new ""career centers"" should not be anything like the dusty offices of bygone years. They should be modern, bright and airy, just like in Sweden.

The government's compromise on military service has been met with criticism, particularly from those affected. School student body representative Quentin Gärtner criticized the agreement as inadequate. In an interview with German news organization Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND), the BSK Secretary General called for the Military Service Act to be accompanied by ""a campaign for the education and mental health of young people"" funded to the tune of €100 billion. ""There is not even the slightest signal that the state is prepared to take responsibility for us,"" said Gärtner.

Criticism also came from opposition politician Sören Pellmann, parliamentary group leader of the socialist Left Party in the Bundestag: ""Everyone in the coalition is trying to chalk up the agreement on military service as their own success — the young generation is being thrown under the bus.""

Pellmann said the coalition had simply postponed the dispute. ""You don't have to be a prophet to realize that compulsory military service is coming."" The Left Party wants to offer young people advice, for example, if they want to refuse to serve in the armed forces. Regardless of whether military service remains voluntary or becomes compulsory again in the future, the Basic Law guarantees the right to conscientious objection.

“No human being, immigrant or not, should be subjected to these horrendous conditions,” said one of the plaintiffs.

People held at the Core Civic-run Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) jail in Kern County, California are denied medical care, access to their attorneys, and, for disabled detainees, the most basic accommodations, according to a class-action lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and others this week in the the U.S. District Court for Northern California.

The complaint says people at the California City Detention Facility are also subjected to solitary confinement and brutal attacks by staff.

“No human being, immigrant or not, should be subjected to these horrendous conditions,” Gustavo Guevara, one of seven named plaintiffs in the suit, said in a statement. “It's not right that because we're immigrants they feel they can treat us this way.”

Earlier this year, CoreCivic entered into a contract with ICE to reopen the jail, which had previously operated as a prison and closed in 2023. Currently there are more than 800 people held at the jail, although that number is expected to significantly grow.

With the capacity to hold up to 2,560 people, the lock-up is the largest immigration jail in California. CoreCivic predicts the jail will bring in approximately $130 million annually once “the activation is complete.”

The Trump administration has been a financial boon to the private prison industry. In advance of CoreCivic's third quarter earnings call, which was held on November 6, the company announced its total revenue for the quarter was $580.4 million, an increase of 18.1 percent from the prior year's quarter.

“Ongoing demand for the solutions we provide, particularly from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), contributed to a solid third quarter,” Damon T. Hininger, CoreCivic's Chief Executive Officer, said in a statement.

“We expect detainee populations to continue to grow as ICE implements its interior enforcement plan, contributing to a strong 2025,” he continued.

Their fortune is built on — and only possible because of — mass suffering.

The complaint says:

Sewage bubbles up from the shower drains, and insects crawl up and down the walls of the cells. People are locked in concrete cells the size of a parking space for hours on end, and officers threaten them with violence and solitary confinement. Food is paltry and people go hungry. Temperatures are frigid; those who cannot afford to buy sweatshirts from the exorbitantly priced commissary suffer in the cold, some wearing socks on their arms as makeshift sleeves.

“Some of the people I'm detained with don't even have soap — they take showers without soap — and they're losing weight because they don't have enough to eat,” plaintiff Sokhean Keo said in a statement.

Medical care at the jail is atrocious, according to the complaint. Yuri Alexander Roque Campos, one of the plaintiffs, has been denied his heart medications for days at a time, which has resulted in two hospitalizations. During the last hospitalization, a doctor said he could die if this were to happen again. Yet, he has not seen a cardiologist and still does not consistently receive his medication, the suit says.

Another named plaintiff, Fernando Viera Reyes, has been waiting for months for a biopsy so he can receive a formal diagnosis of prostate cancer and begin treatment, according to the complaint.

“Mr. Viera Reyes is experiencing increasingly abnormal bloodwork results and bleeding with urination,” the suit says. “Although he still has not seen a specialist, these results indicate that his cancer may have metastasized while he has been waiting for an appointment.”

Plaintiff Fernando Gomez Ruiz, who has lived in California for more than twenty years, was abducted by ICE while he was eating at a food truck outside a Home Depot.

An insulin-dependent diabetic, he's been denied regular doses of insulin while detained at the jail. He has a large ulcer on the bottom of his foot “which he is forced to cover with soiled bandages and bloody shoes.”

The suit says that Gomez Ruiz fears that without proper medical care, his foot will have to be amputated.

The plaintiffs allege that people with disabilities are denied necessary accommodations, including wheelchairs, sign language interpreters. When plaintiff Jose Ruiz Canizales, who is deaf, tries to speak with staff “they often shrug their shoulders, walk away, or laugh at him,” according to the complaint. Since he arrived at the jail in August, he has only interacted with a sign language interpreter once, and that was through a video call.

Earlier this month, California City staff confiscated custom orthopedic shoes and insoles from a man who has amputated toes, “which cause an imbalance when he walks,” according to the complaint.

“He previously fractured his remaining toes from walking with that imbalance, leading his podiatrist in the community to order these accommodations for him,” the suit says. “He spoke to both an officer and a nurse at California City to request the custom shoes and insoles as a disability accommodation, but neither provided them.”

Staff routinely brutalize detainees. In one incident, officers entered the cell of a man in solitary confinement, who was handcuffed. The suit says they hit him with riot shields, threw him to the ground, and held him down with their knees on his back.

In another incident, an officer was speaking to a person who did not speak English and did not understand the officer. When the man turned to walk away, the officer pepper sprayed him, according to the suit.

In September, detainees organized a hunger strike and sit-ins to protest their conditions, and sent the warden a list of demands:

Medical. We have medical needs and records that prove it. Give us medical care.

Cease oppressive behavior. Stop threatening us with solitary confinement for requesting these basic necessities. Stop threatening us with retaliatory transfers for asserting our rights. Stop keeping us locked in our cells for the majority of the day. Let us have contact visits with our family.

Legal resources and access. Let us access a law library. Let us make copies of documents for our cases free of charge. Give us pens. Allow us access to our mail and phone calls.

Hygiene and Health. Unclog our toilets. Give us drinkable water. Clean the prison or at least give us the proper supplies to do so. Properly handle our food, and give us nutritious food.

Property. Give us back our property, including our books and religious items that were confiscated.

Staff placed many protesters in solitary confinement, and medical staff threatened to withhold medication from hunger strikers unless they ceased their protest.

“Conditions remained bleak for people civilly detained at California City, resulting in a widespread sense of hopelessness, desperation and, in some cases, self-harm and suicidal ideation,” the suit says.

At least three people at the jail have attempted suicide, according to the complaint.

On October 9, a man hung himself in his cell. Detainees screamed for help. It allegedly took staff about ten minutes to cut him down. Those who did not immediately return to their cells after the incident were given disciplinary tickets, according to the complaint.

Keo, one of the plaintiffs, was friends with the man and saw him hanging in his cell. The suit says he remains haunted by flashbacks.

“ICE is playing with people's lives, and they treat people like they're trash, like they're nothing,” he said in a statement. “This is bigger than me, but filing this lawsuit feels like something I can do to call for help for myself and everyone else here.”

Polls suggest 74 percent of voters in the state will back a ballot initiative to counter the effects of Citizens United.

Fifteen years after a landmark Supreme Court case turbocharged corporate spending in the political process, a group hopes it may have a way to finally rein in some of the outsized influence of the ultrawealthy. The 2010 ruling on Citizens United v. FEC opened the floodgates of political spending in elections. Every year since then, untraceable financial political contributions, largely from corporations and wealthy individuals, have increased dramatically. Now, the state of Montana is on the verge of being the first in the nation to counter the impact of Citizens United via a 2026 ballot measure using an innovative legal maneuver that other states could adopt.

The idea is the brainchild of Tom Moore, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. Moore, who laid out his reasoning in a white paper on September 15, 2025, is arguing that states have the legal authority to define corporate charters and therefore can redefine them at any time. When I interviewed Moore for my weekly radio show, he explained: “The states' authority is absolute in terms of how they define their corporations and which powers they decide to give their corporations.” This is considered “basic foundational corporation law,” and all states have essentially given corporations the same, extremely broad charters.

Until 2023, Moore worked as chief of staff for Commissioner Ellen Weintraub at the Federal Election Commission (FEC). During that time, he met and collaborated with Montana Commissioner of Political Practices Jeff Mangan. Moore remained friends with Mangan even after he left the FEC. “I sent [Mangan] a draft of the [white] paper,” said Moore, “and he called back that night and said, ‘We are doing this in Montana.'”

That was in fall 2024. Almost immediately the wheels began turning, and in April 2025, Mangan launched the Transparent Election Initiative to put Moore's theory into practice. In June, the “The Montana Plan,” based on a draft of Moore's paper, was born. That plan is the basis of the Transparent Election Initiative's constitutional amendment as a ballot measure to be put before Montana voters in 2026. The measure asks voters whether or not their state should redefine corporate charters to disallow spending in elections.

The Montana Plan is wildly popular. An October 2025 poll by the pro-democracy group Issue One found that 74 percent of voters in the state, including majorities of Republicans and independents, support the ballot initiative.

“It's a red state, which is useful, I think,” said Moore, explaining that the plan's popularity there enables “the country to see that it's not just lefty liberals who don't like dark and corporate money in their politics.”

Montana has a history of fighting corporate spending and is a fitting state to spearhead the beginning of the end of Citizens United. Since 1912, corporations were banned from spending money to influence elections under the state's Corrupt Practices Act. A hundred years later, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned that act to ensure compliance with Citizens United.

“The people of Montana have not forgotten that,” said Moore. “They are fiercely independent. They don't like other people coming in and telling them what to think.”

Montana's amendment doesn't aim to overturn the Citizens United ruling. If passed, it would merely render the ruling ineffective within Montana because businesses operating in the state would have to abide by its definition of corporations.

It's notable that Montana's amendment doesn't aim to overturn the Citizens United ruling. If passed, it would merely render the ruling ineffective within Montana because businesses operating in the state would have to abide by its definition of corporations. This makes it immune to national legal challenges and the whims of a Supreme Court that's even more conservative than its 2010 iteration. “This isn't a regulation,” said Mangan, “it's a different way of looking at transparency under First Amendment grounds.”

In order for the Supreme Court to override the desires of Montana voters, it would have to rule that states do not have the right to define corporations. “This is foundational corporation law,” said Moore. “If you start pulling the foundation blocks out from the building, it could really destabilize American business. I don't think they want to do that.”

Moreover, even a single state passing such an amendment can have a big impact nationally. Moore explained that in almost every state, “no out-of-state corporation can exercise any power in the state that a domestic corporation can't exercise. So, what that means is, if you're in Montana and you pass this, your corporations are out [of political spending] everywhere. But it also means that 49 states worth of out-of-state corporations also can't spend in your politics. Because if you no longer give the power to your domestic guys, then out-of-state corporations don't have that power either.”

Montana's effort hit an early and predictable snag however, when the state's Attorney General Austin Knudsen blocked the ballot measure. Knudsen's reasoning was that the redefinition of corporate charters was too big for a single vote and that each component of the ballot initiative would have to be voted on separately.

Even a single state passing such an amendment can have a big impact nationally.

Mangan, who expected such a response, doesn't buy it. “It wouldn't make sense to have a separate vote on each of those components,” he said, for they only make sense when viewed as a whole. The Transparent Election Initiative is suing the attorney general's office and expects the Montana Supreme Court to rule in its favor in time to begin gathering signatures. “We're very confident that we'll prevail at the [state] Supreme Court,” said Mangan.

While he awaits the Montana Supreme Court's ruling on its legal challenge to the attorney general's office, Mangan is spending his time educating Montana voters and generating excitement about the ballot initiative.

The Transparent Election Initiative expects to oversee a massive statewide signature-gathering effort from January to June 2026 to get the initiative on Montana's ballot. In order to qualify for the ballot, the organization needs just over 60,000 signatures from active voters across 40 legislative districts.

To be on the safe side, Mangan is aiming for 100,000 signatures across 50 districts, in an effort that will be largely volunteer-run. “It's going to take a lot of work,” said Mangan. “We're looking for a lot of volunteers, a lot of grassroots organizational efforts.”

Rina Moore worked as the election administrator in Cascade County, Montana, for 16 years and said, “I watched firsthand as thousands of voters complained about the vast amounts of mailings and the commercials and were clear that they wanted it all to stop.”

Moore is among an early cohort of volunteers lining up to ensure the Montana Plan makes it onto the 2026 ballot. “I am excited about gathering signatures because this is something that the voters on both sides agree with,” she said.

It's not just Montanans who are disgusted with the way in which corporate spending has taken over the nation's elections. Increasingly, political candidates are eschewing corporate money as a mark of pride and authenticity, and proof that they are unbought by special interests.

Nearly 80 percent of Americans believe that outside spending on elections is corrupting or gives the appearance of corruption.

Take the high-profile election of New York City's new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, who made it a point to raise small-dollar donations directly from supporters. In that November 2025 race, outside spending was a liability, not an asset. Mamdani's opposition included more than 20 billionaires who, in spite of pouring millions of dollars into anti-Mamdani super PACs, were unable to convince enough New Yorkers to vote against the democratic socialist.

The 2010 Citizens United ruling remains hugely unpopular. Issue One's poll found nearly 80 percent of Americans believe that outside spending on elections is corrupting or gives the appearance of corruption. That includes a majority of Republicans and independent voters.

Tom Moore said he was working with numerous states on ballot initiatives and legislation in line with Montana's efforts. “I think it's gonna end up moving in a number of states very quickly,” he said. “If it gets on the ballot anywhere in the country, it will pass. This is wildly popular.”

“It's one of the few issues that … truly unites Americans these days,” he added. “They'd really like to get their politics back … This actually gives people some hope. It gives them some agency.”

• Vote next week: House GOP leaders are bracing for a significant number of Republicans to break from Trump and support the bipartisan bill calling for the Justice Department to release the Epstein case files. Earlier today, Trump slammed “weak Republicans” for siding with Democrats on the release.
    


            • DC's gradual reopening: With the longest-ever government shutdown over, federal employees are expected to start receiving their back pay, and SNAP food aid is set to be restored by Monday.
    


            • Ripple effects: The shutdown likely led to a loss of 60,000 private-sector jobs, according to Trump's top economic adviser. Questions also still remain about when flight cancellations will end. Altering your Thanksgiving travel plans? Tell us about it.



            It's been a busy Friday at the White House and on Capitol Hill.
    


            We are closely following the latest developments as lawmakers are set to vote on releasing the full Jeffrey Epstein case files next week, and President Donald Trump looks to deflect from the effort.

CNN's Ella Nilsen, René Marsh, Alayna Treene, Alicia Wallace, Elisabeth Buchwald and Andy Rose contributed reporting to this post.



            JPMorgan Chase ended its relationship with Jeffrey Epstein “years before his arrest on sex trafficking charges,” spokesperson Patricia Wexler said in a statement today, after President Donald Trump said he was asking the Justice Department to probe the bank's ties to the disgraced financier.
    


            JPMorgan paid $290 million in 2023 to settle a class action lawsuit filed by Epstein's survivors that alleged it turned a blind eye to unusual cash transactions that they claimed enabled Epstein's sex trafficking. JPMorgan also paid $75 million to settle with the US Virgin Islands. The bank did not admit or deny any wrongdoing in either settlement.
    


                    “The government had damning information about his crimes and failed to share it with us or other banks,” Wexler said. “We regret any association we had with the man, but did not help him commit his heinous acts.”
                





Earlier: Trump named several high-profile figures in his announcement about the DOJ probe today, including Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, “and many other people and institutions.”
    


            The president made this extraordinary move just days after Democrats released emails from the late Epstein that mention him.

            Food stamp recipients in Maryland will receive their full Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits beginning on Tuesday, the state Department of Human Services announced today.
    


            Maryland enrollees who were due their SNAP benefits received at least half their allotments this month, while the federal government's shutdown disrupted the issuance of the assistance. Distribution is normally staggered throughout the month.
    


            After saying it did not have the money to provide November's food stamp benefits, the US Department of Agriculture last week authorized states to make partial payments after a federal court ordered it to do so. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore announced that he would direct $62 million in state funds to support SNAP recipients, as well as $10 million in emergency food assistance.
    


            As of November 13, the state issued nearly $47 million in benefits to nearly 218,000 households to ensure they received at least half of their usual allotments.
    


            Residents who regularly receive their SNAP assistance before Tuesday will continue getting at least half their benefits, with all of these enrollees receiving the remainder of their allotments on that day. Those who are scheduled to receive their benefits on or after Tuesday will receive their full benefits.
    


            President Donald Trump said Friday he will ask Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's ties to many other high-profile figures, including some of his perceived political opponents, again blasting Democrats following the release earlier this week of emails from the late Epstein that mention him.
    


                    “Now that the Democrats are using the Epstein Hoax, involving Democrats, not Republicans, to try and deflect from their disastrous SHUTDOWN, and all of their other failures, I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
                





More context: The president has sought to dismiss questions over Epstein for months, pressuring Republicans to block a discharge petition in the US House forcing a vote on the release of the Justice Department's Epstein files — which the House speaker has said he'll schedule for next week.
    


            “This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats,” Trump wrote on Friday.
    


            CNN is reaching out to the Department of Justice and JP Morgan, as well as the people Trump named, about his comments.
    


            President Donald Trump lashed out at congressional Democrats — and some “weak Republicans” — Friday over the push to release the Jeffrey Epstein files, criticizing those Republicans as “soft and foolish” for backing the effort.
    


            “The Democrats are doing everything in their withering power to push the Epstein Hoax again, despite the DOJ releasing 50,000 pages of documents, in order to deflect from all of their bad policies and losses, especially the SHUTDOWN EMBARRASSMENT, where their party is in total disarray, and has no idea what to do,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
    


            “Some Weak Republicans have fallen into their clutches because they are soft and foolish,” Trump added.
    


            He went on the argue that Epstein is the Democrats' “problem,” not Republicans'.
    


            CNN has reported that House GOP leaders are bracing for a significant number of Republicans to support the bipartisan bill led by GOP Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna that would compel the Justice Department to release the Epstein files.
    


            The president has yet to respond on camera to this week's House Oversight Committee release of Epstein emails that mentioned Trump, not stopping to answer reporters' questions on Thursday during an event in the East Room.
    


            Jeffrey Epstein has been back in the news this week, and the rift between lawmakers and the Trump administration over releasing more information isn't going away any time soon.
    


            The House is expected to vote on a bill compelling the release of all of the Justice Department's Epstein case files next week – earlier than expected.
    


            So, here's what to know.
    


CNN's Annie Grayer, Ellis Kim, Alison Main, Manu Raju, Kristen Holmes and Sarah Ferris contributed reporting to this post.



            The sprawling 2023 racketeering indictment case against President Donald Trump and several allies for their efforts to overturn his 2020 electoral defeat in Georgia will continue and is now in the hands of a new prosecutor.
    


            The case was assigned in September to Peter Skandalakis, director of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia, a bipartisan collaboration of six district attorneys and three solicitors general from across the state.
    


            Skandalakis previously said he could also take the case himself if he could not find another prosecutor willing to take it on.
    


            “This morning, an Administrative Order appointing me to the case of State of Georgia v. Donald J. Trump, et al. was filed with the Clerk of the Superior Court of Fulton County,” Skandalakis wrote in a statement this morning.
    


Remember: Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis had launched the case, but was removed after a legal fight over her authority.
    


            Visitors will be able to go to many of the Smithsonian museums this weekend, after they were closed for more than a month due to the government shutdown.
    


            Here's when they are opening, according to the Smithsonian.
    


Friday:



Saturday:



By Monday:



            The Smithsonian previously said most museums, except for the museums of American History and Air and Space, would reopen Monday.
    


            In addition, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, which is not part of the Smithsonian Institution, will partially open today and fully open tomorrow.
    


            Republicans in Washington successfully defused the 43-day government shutdown without surrendering to Democrats' demands to spend billions more to offset spiking health insurance costs.
    


            Now, the GOP is under mounting pressure to figure out its own plan.
    


            Enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies are set to expire in just weeks  — which would more than double the cost of premiums nationally for tens of millions of Americans.
    


            And it's causing deep anxiety among some in the party, particularly in battleground seats, who worry Republicans will end up doing nothing to prevent those price hikes and enter a critical midterm year with the issue of health care haunting them once again.
    


            GOP leaders in the House have begun work on their own package, which is unlikely to extend those subsidies and instead will seek other ways to reduce costs, according to multiple people familiar with the discussions.
    


            But Republicans are not committing to doing anything on health care by December 31, when those subsidies expire and premiums are set to spike.

            People flying home for Thanksgiving will have one more thing to be thankful for this year: H.R. 5371, the funding bill President Donald Trump signed to end the longest shutdown in US history.
    


            The move is a step closer to normalcy for flyers after FAA-mandated cuts led to thousands of flight delays and cancellations at major airports across the country.
    


            But the disruptions aren't over. More than 600 US flights have been canceled as of early today and over 500 are delayed, according to FlightAware data. This is down from the nearly 1,000 flights canceled yesterday.
    


            The flight disruptions are primarily due to a combination of air traffic controller staffing issues and the mandated flight reductions — but also include unrelated flight cuts.
    


            Here is what we know about the plans to get more planes back up in the skies – and the uncertainty that remains.
    


            The past few weeks have been a wild ride for air travelers, who have seen flight cancellations and staffing shortages related to the US government shutdown, on top of the annual Thanksgiving crush still to come.
    


            Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said this week that he expects flight issues to be resolved before Thanksgiving travel ramps up.
    


            Still, we know this year, the thought of traveling may be even more stress inducing than usual given the recent disruptions. Did you change your holiday travel plans? Do you have a plan to get through possibly chaotic travel days? CNN wants to hear from you.
    


            More than a million federal employees went unpaid during the longest government shutdown in US history, while nearly 42 million Americans were left in limbo when the Department of Agriculture announced it could not distribute food stamps for November.
    


            Now that the government has reopened, agencies are working to get back to business as usual.
    


            Here's what we know about the post-shutdown timeline for various paychecks and benefits:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Exclusive: Thousands of parents, guardians of migrant kids arrested in Trump administration crackdown","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/parents-arrested-migrant-children-ice","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 09:00:00 GMT","


            When Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested a woman at a Chicago day care this month, it sparked local uproar over ICE's tactics. But it also provided a window into the Trump administration's latest enforcement initiative — an intense effort to crack down on parents and guardians who paid for children to come across the border.
    


            The arrest of Diana Patricia Santillana Galeano, who after a vehicle stop fled into the childcare center where she taught, came weeks after her sons, ages 16 and 17, had crossed the US-Mexico border. They were transferred to a shelter in the Chicago area under the care of the Health and Human Services Department, which is responsible for migrant kids who crossed the southern border alone until they can be placed with a so-called sponsor, like a parent or relative, in the United States.
    


            But instead of leading to her being reunited with her kids, their arrival led to the government accusing Santillana Galeano of smuggling children.
    


            On Thursday, she was released following a judge's order. “We will continue to pursue her immigration claims to stay in the United States,” said Charlie Wysong, one of her attorneys.
    


            Senior Trump officials have focused for months on minors who crossed the US southern border alone under former President Joe Biden, when an unprecedented surge of kids overwhelmed federal resources. Recent moves involving multiple agencies, which have not been previously reported, signal the administration is doubling down on the targeting of those children — and their caretakers.
    


            So far, a pair of operations launched this year targeting parents, guardians or potential caretakers of migrant children have yielded nearly 3,000 arrests, according to federal data reviewed by CNN. A Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement to CNN that the arrests are “primarily the result of human smuggling investigations where an (unaccompanied child) was encountered as part of the smuggling incident.”
    


            White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller and other administration officials who favor the push see it as a relatively easy way to ramp up deportations of people who, unlike some migrants, can easily be located by the government, according to two people involved in the discussions. Trump officials believe it can also be portrayed effectively as a humanitarian effort, given the dangerous journey many migrant children make to the US.
    


            “Unless we put our foot down and say that we're not going to accept this as a nation, that we don't want kids smuggled across the border, it's going to continue unless there's a punishment for it,” a Health and Human Services official told CNN.
    


            As part of that concerted effort, ICE launched an initiative this week with state and local law enforcement leveraging standing agreements to fan out local authorities to conduct welfare checks on children, CNN exclusively learned. The UAC Safety Verification Initiative, as it's being called, began on Monday in Florida and will expand nationwide.
    


            Another operation, launched last month, builds on that by tasking Homeland Security agents with arresting sponsors if they are unlawfully present in the United States, used a smuggler, or have a criminal history, among other circumstances, according to two of the sources.
    


            Agents have been directed to see if they can levy charges, like smuggling if applicable, against those caretakers, leaving the children they're looking after in limbo or potentially placed back in US custody.
    


            “ICE HSI utilizes its federal authority/statutes to prosecute any individual and/or organization when a criminal offence has been committed to include but not limited to any violations of federal immigration law. We have been clear, anyone not legally authorized to be in this country is subject to removal,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
    


            The effort has dramatically reshaped the way the US addresses one of the most vulnerable immigrant populations, according to advocates who work with migrant children — and rapidly turned a tiny HHS office charged with caring for and uniting migrant kids with their guardians into yet another branch of President Donald Trump's sprawling mass deportation force.
    


            In a matter of months, the administration has mounted multiple additional hurdles for parents or guardians trying to retrieve the children from government custody, including the fact that the adults are at risk of being detained or arrested themselves in the process if they are undocumented. The administration is also setting up a call center, looking for leads on kids that the government can't locate.
    


            “It is putting so much pressure on the children, knowing their families are at risk in this way, and we've had children beg their sponsors not to go. They'll sacrifice themselves and stay in detention because they're too scared for their parent,” said Mickey Donovan-Kaloust, director of legal services at Immigrant Defenders Law Center.
    


            Though the volume increased during the Biden administration, unaccompanied migrant children have been arriving at the US southern border for years. Children are typically fleeing dangerous or deteriorating conditions in their origin country and reuniting with a parent or family member in the United States. It's a difficult trek — and one that often requires payment to a smuggler, as with anyone else crossing the border.
    


            “There's a lot that happens on the journey for these kids that has nothing to do with the family member here. … The ones that end up here have gone through the most and survived it somehow with or without the family's help,” said Marie Silver, managing attorney of the Immigrant Children's Protection Project at the National Immigrant Justice Center.
    


            The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which has been in place for more than two decades, provides protections for unaccompanied migrant children who arrive and reside in the US, including being screened to see if they are victims of human trafficking or have a credible fear of persecution in their home country.
    


            While an immigration judge determines if a child has protections in the US, case managers work to find a suitable sponsor, like a parent or relative, to care for them and therefore remove them from a detention setting. Many guardians of unaccompanied migrant children are undocumented.
    


            CNN previously reported Immigration and Customs Enforcement had taken hundreds of children into government custody this year following so-called welfare checks, either because their situations were deemed unsafe or because of immigration enforcement actions against sponsors, the majority of whom are the kids' parents or other family members. The administration also tried to abruptly remove hundreds of Guatemalan children who were in custody.
    


            New federal data reviewed by CNN provides more insight on who is being targeted. Homeland Security Investigations arrested more than 450 sponsors of unaccompanied children, according to internal federal data shared with CNN. The Department of Homeland Security told CNN many had committed crimes, though data shows that agents also detained caretakers without a criminal record who were in the country illegally.
    


            “Sponsors illegally in the United States are in violation of federal law, and as such, will be placed in removal proceedings. Parents always have the option to leave with their children,” the Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement.
    


            DHS provided a list of individuals accused of crimes who served as caretakers for unaccompanied children released to them, including a woman from Venezuela who sponsored three migrant children while in possession of fentanyl, a Honduran man who was arrested for alleged forced labor of two teenagers, and two men who DHS said “exploited” two kids by forcing them to work illegally.
    


            DHS has fanned out nationwide to conduct welfare checks of kids residing in the country and interviewing sponsors before children are released from custody. Under the Trump administration, DHS has had access to a trove of data housed at HHS identifying the whereabouts of migrant children in the United States.
    


            According to the HHS official, information sharing between HHS' Office of Refugee Resettlement and ICE is limited, though the various agencies work together in a war room set up at HHS to swap information relevant to ongoing operations.
    


            The intense scrutiny has sharply slowed the release of migrant children to sponsors; HHS data shows it handed just 118 kids over to guardians in the US in September, down from the more than 5,000 being released each month at the tail end of the Biden era. The average length stay for children in HHS' care has more than doubled over that same period.
    


            Advocates who work with children in custody told CNN that there's been an uptick in parents detained when completing new requirements despite passing all background checks and vetting.
    


            One child's father, who did not have a criminal history and passed vetting, was detained in Texas when presenting for his ID check, the last step in the process to retrieve his son from government custody. Now, both are detained, according to Alexa Sendukas, managing attorney of the Immigrant Children and Youth Program at the Galveston-Houston Immigrant Representation Project (GHIRP). In another case, a brother of an unaccompanied minor was arrested at his ID appointment.
    


            “They're languishing in detention for extended periods of time with no explanation. We had several cases that were approved and then remanded,” Sendukas said. “The kids are asking us, ‘Why can't I go home to my mom?' It's very sad. The detention fatigue is extremely palpable.”

            In the latest judicial blow to President Donald Trump's push to detain and deport undocumented immigrants en masse, a judge ruled Wednesday hundreds of people arrested in an Illinois immigration operation must be released.
    


            The detained people must be granted bond by the end of next week, the judge ruled, but big questions remain about how the process will play out – including locating those arrested, some of whom have been moved across the country, plaintiffs say.
    


            Here's what we know – and what we don't know – about what happens next.
    


            US District Judge Jeffrey Cummings, who was nominated by former US President Joe Biden in 2023, sided with attorneys from the National Immigrant Justice Center and the ACLU, who filed a lawsuit alleging federal agents violated a 2022 settlement agreement over warrantless arrests in the Chicago area.
    


            Last month, Cummings ruled agents violated the previously agreed upon consent decree.
    


            Under the decree, if ICE seeks to make a warrantless arrest, it must meet conditions like establishing probable cause that someone is in the country illegally, assessing their community ties and whether they could be a flight risk.
    


WLS: Judge orders release of hundreds arrested in Illinois immigration crackdown



            The plaintiffs alleged more than 3,000 people were arrested between June and October in “Operation Midway Blitz,” the federal government's immigration crackdown in Chicago and surrounding areas.
    


            The settlement remains in effect until February 2, 2026, and says if someone is arrested in a way “that violates the settlement in the Chicago Area of Responsibility — which includes in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Kansas, Kentucky, and Missouri — they may be able to seek individual remedies —including immediate release from detention.”
    


            Of the 3,000 people arrested between June and October, 615 – one-fifth – are not subject to mandatory detention and don't have final orders of removal, the ruling says. Those who remain detained out of that group, as long as they don't pose a high public safety risk, must be granted bond by noon on November 21, according to the ruling.
    


            But two challenges will remain: locating people and figuring out who and how their bond will get paid.
    


            “What's challenging is at this point, they've moved these people all over the country,” Fleming told CNN on Thursday. “Let's say we were able to post bond for a lot of these people and we were working on it with families, with other organizations … I'm not certain that the government is going to bring them back to Chicago and so they will drop them in the middle of nowhere where they've detained them.”

            The organization believes at least 1,100 of the 3,000 arrested individuals have voluntarily left the country, saying they “gave up” fighting their cases, Fleming said during a news conference Wednesday.
    


            “They are people who disproportionately had no interaction with the immigration or criminal justice system,” Fleming told CNN. “Who've lived in the community for years, have families, have businesses, you name it, who were stopped in the community, whether driving to work, picking up kids at school.”
    


            Government attorneys have requested a stay of Cummings' order until next Friday, according to Fleming; the legal pause could prevent the government from deporting or detaining someone until the court decides next steps.
    


            But immigration officials seem undeterred in their mission.
    


            “If (Pritzker is) pleased that he thinks operations are being ratcheted down, well, just the opposite is going to occur,” Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official leading Operation Midway Blitz, told Fox News on Thursday.
    


             “We're ratcheting operations up in Chicago,” he said.
    


            In response to the ruling, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the decision is putting the lives of Americans at risk.
    


            “At every turn, activist judges, sanctuary politicians, and violent rioters have actively tried to prevent our law enforcement officers from arresting and removing the worst of the worst,” McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN Wednesday. “Now an ACTIVIST JUDGE is putting the lives of Americans directly at risk by ordering 615 illegal aliens be released into the community.”
    


            The Trump administration filed a notice Thursday saying it will appeal the ruling and asked Cummings to put his order on hold while the appeal is heard. Cummings did not immediately rule on the request, instead asking the plaintiffs to respond by midday Monday.
    


            Meanwhile, Bovino left Chicago Thursday morning with his CBP agents and will head next to Charlotte, North Carolina, according to a source familiar with the planning.
    


            DHS declined to comment on his exact whereabouts, with McLaughlin saying Bovino “has multiple bounties on his head from Latin Kings and other cartels.” Bovino told Fox News later that day he was in West Virginia.
    


            Bovino and other federal agents have faced scrutiny, including from a federal judge, for alleged heavy-handed tactics and violent use of force against people getting arrested and protesters.
    


            “All of this, all of the tactics of Bovino, all of the tactics of (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) have been unlawful in the vast, vast majority of arrests,” Fleming said Wednesday.
    


            ICE will continue to carry out immigration enforcement operations in Chicago, McLaughlin previously told CNN, while other immigration legal challenges move through the courts.
    


            State advocates have alleged “inhumane” conditions at a federal immigration facility in a Chicago suburb, where protesters have been demonstrating for weeks, with some leading to arrests. Those protesters and news outlets are at the center of another legal battle as they claim federal agents violated their First Amendment rights by repeatedly using tear gas and other weapons on them.
    


            The state of Illinois and Chicago have also sued the Trump administration over its move to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago amid protests against the federal government's immigration enforcement campaign.

Thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee offer a new glimpse into what Jeffery Epstein's relationships with business executives, reporters, academics and political players looked like over a decade.

They start with messages he sent and received around the time he finished serving his Florida sentence in 2009 and continue until the months before his arrest on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019.

During that time, Epstein's network was eclectic, spanning the globe and political affiliations: from the liberal academic Noam Chomsky to Steve Bannon, the longtime ally of President Donald Trump.

The emails don't implicate his contacts in those alleged crimes. They instead paint a picture of Epstein's influence and connections over the years he was a registered sex offender.

Here's the latest:

Democratic members of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure asked federal officials for an explanation of the decision to cut up to 10% of flights at 40 major airports during the shutdown, along with details on staffing levels and how airports were chosen.

“It appears that the administration made this decision without adequate coordination with key aviation stakeholders,” said Friday's letter to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford, .

The group requested a briefing and written response by Nov. 20.

The FAA on Wednesday froze reductions at 6%, shortly before a deal was reached to end the shutdown. Requests for comment were sent to the department and FAA.

The president is planning to attend the World Economic Forum's meeting in Switzerland in January, according to a senior White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity to share plans that were not yet publicly announced.

The annual meeting in the Swiss Alps draws world leaders, business executives, celebrities and, sometimes, U.S. presidents. Trump attended in his first term in 2018 and 2020.

By Michelle L. Price

Immigration and Customs Enforcement is working with state and local law enforcement agencies to carry out welfare checks on roughly 450,000 migrant children.

They said the program kicked off Nov. 10 in Florida.

The administration launched a similar effort earlier  this year, but this one includes state and local law enforcement agencies authorized to work with ICE.

Migrant children traveling alone initially stay in government shelters before being released to sponsors.

Under the Biden administration, officials tried to release children to eligible sponsors within 30 days, reuniting many families quickly.

But there were problems, including some children released to adults who forced them to work illegally.

Migrant advocates are suspicious that the Trump administration's efforts could end up being a way to deport sponsors or children.

The effects of the rush to redraw U.S. political maps ahead of next year's midterm elections can be seen in the contrasts between two very different places now in the same Missouri congressional district.

The 18th and Vine area in Kansas City is predominately Black, once known for jazz joints and the meeting that created professional baseball's National Negro League when the established major leagues barred Black players. Boonville is a small, mostly white town set in an area teeming with cattle and row crops.

People in both areas worry about being ignored in the new district.

The incumbent is Democrat Emanuel Cleaver, who preached about racial justice as a Methodist minister and has worked for decades for federally funded projects in 18th and Vine. Boonville's decades-long project is a trail favored by cycling enthusiasts.

But their differences are deeper and extend to issues such as health care, education and gun rights.

A union representing federal prison workers is suing the Bureau of Prisons after the agency said it was canceling its collective bargaining agreement.

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in Connecticut federal court, seeks an injunction to block what the Council of Prison Locals union called an “arbitrary and capricious” move that has jeopardized the livelihoods of the agency's nearly 35,000 employees.

Bureau of Prisons Director William K. Marshall III announced the termination for the collective bargaining agreement Sept. 25, citing President Trump's executive order in March that exempts certain federal agencies from collective bargaining or recognizing employee labor unions.

Marshall said the union had become “an obstacle to progress instead of a partner in it.”

The union, in its lawsuit, contends the Bureau of Prisons failed to provide “any reasoned explanation” for its decision, as required under federal law.

The Swiss government says it's reached a deal with the United States to reduce U.S. tariffs on the rich Alpine country to 15% from 39%, which had been the steepest Trump administration tariff level faced by a developed Western country.

The Swiss Federal Council, the country's seven-member executive branch, said “Thank you President Trump for the constructive engagement” in a post on its X account.

Steve Sadow said he's confident that “fair and impartial review” will lead to a dismissal of the case against Trump.

“This politically charged prosecution has to come to an end,” he said in an email.

The president kicked off his Friday with posts on social media complaining about Democratic lawmakers focusing on thousands of documents from Epstein's estate released this week by the House Oversight Committee.

Trump called it a “hoax” and a distraction from Democrats' policies and the “EMBARASSMENT” of the government shutdown and decried “Weak Republicans” who “have fallen into their clutches because they are soft and foolish.” Trump seemed to be referring to the House Republican who are joining Democrats in a push to release files related to the sex trafficking investigation into Epstein.

Trump said Epstein is “not the Republican's problem” and “don't waste your time with Trump. I have a Country to run!”

“While it would have been simple to allow Judge McAfee's deadline to lapse or to inform the Court that no conflict prosecutor could be secured — thereby allowing the case to be dismissed for want of prosecution — I did not believe that to be the right course of action,” Pete Skandalakis wrote in a statement. “The public has a legitimate interest in the outcome of this case. Accordingly, it is important that someone make an informed and transparent determination about how best to proceed.”

That included those charged in Georgia. But that doesn't affect state charges.

The leader of a nonpartisan organization announced he will take over the Georgia election interference case against President Trump and others after Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis was removed from the case.

The Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia was tasked with finding someone to lead the case after Willis was disqualified over an “appearance of impropriety” created by a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she'd chosen to lead it. The organization's executive director, Pete Skandalakis, said Friday that he would take the case on himself.

While it's unlikely that any action against Trump could proceed while he's the sitting president, there are 14 other people still facing charges in the case, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former New York mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani.

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on CNBC on Friday that the White House plans to post details of the deal online Friday.

Greer said the agreement will see Switzerland move manufacturing of some pharmaceuticals, gold smelting and railway equipment to the United States.

Antifa-Ost — a German network suspected in attacks on people it perceived as fascists — was among four European left-wing groups designated as terrorist organizations by the Trump administration Thursday.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Josef Hinterseher said at a regular news conference in Berlin that his ministry has “taken note” of the designation. Asked whether the German government was contacted beforehand, he replied that “the U.S. decided independently on this.”

Interior Ministry spokesperson Sarah Frühauf said “we don't evaluate the decisions and assessments of other states, so I also have no assessment of whether we consider this proportionate or disproportionate.”

Trump does not have any pubic events on his schedule for today, but this evening he will travel to Mar-a-Lago.

Trump's administration on Thursday designated four European left-wing groups as terrorist organizations, following through on his vow to crack down on leftists after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

The networks targeted by Trump's administration all appear to be based in Europe, with no operations in the U.S. They are an Italian anarchist front that sent explosive packages to the then-president of the European Commission in 2003, two Greek networks believed to have planted bombs outside riot police and labor department buildings in Athens, and an anti-fascist group whose members were prosecuted by German authorities for a hammer attack against neo-Nazis in Dresden.

Europe has a long history of left-wing political violence, while in the United States political violence has been more likely to come from the right in recent decades, according to multiple studies, including by the Justice Department. However, there's been an uptick in American political attacks across ideologies in recent years, culminating in the September fatal shooting of Kirk by a gunman who prosecutors contend was driven by hostility toward Kirk's stance against transgenderism and other positions.

The frameworks are about increasing the ability of U.S. firms to sell industrial and agricultural products in these countries, according to a senior administration official who insisted on anonymity as a condition for briefing reporters on a call about the agreements.

The White House also released statements on the frameworks, which have yet to be finalized and are expected to be signed within roughly two weeks. It's all part of a broader effort by President Donald Trump to rewrite the rules of global commerce through the use of broad tariffs.

President Javier Milei of Argentina hailed his country's first bilateral trade framework with the U.S. in nearly a decade as “tremendous news.”

“As you can see, we are strongly committed to making Argentina great again,” he said.

Epstein emailed current and former political figures on all sides, sending news clips and discussing strategy or gossip often in short, choppy emails laden with spelling and grammatical errors.

In several emails in 2018, Epstein advised Bannon on his political tour of Europe that year after Bannon forwarded Epstein a news clip that the German media underestimated Bannon and that he was “As Dangerous as Ever.”

“luv it,” Epstein responded.

Epstein wrote that he'd just spoken to “one of the country leaders that we discussed” and that “we should lay out a strategy plan. . how much fun.”

Just a few months earlier, Epstein was insulting Trump — whose movement Bannon was a representative of — in emails to Kathryn Ruemmler, the former White House counsel under President Barack Obama.

Ruemmler sent a message to Epstein calling Trump “so gross.” A portion of that message was redacted, but Epstein replied, “worse in real life and upclose.”

Trump and Epstein were friends for years but at some point had a falling out, even before underage girls started to come forward to accuse Epstein of sexual abuse.

Journalists sometimes reached out to Epstein, perhaps hoping he might have dirt to spill on Trump. One of those writers was Michael Wolff, who has written extensively about Trump. In a 2019 email to Wolff, Epstein mentioned that one of his best-known accusers, Virginia Giuffre, had worked at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.

“She was the one who accused Prince Andrew,” Epstein wrote.

Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year, had said that Epstein's longtime companion Ghislaine Maxwell recruited her from Mar-a-Lago to give sexualized massages to Epstein. And Trump had long claimed that he banned Epstein from coming to Mar-a-Lago.

Epstein said in an email to Wolff that Trump hadn't asked him to resign from the club, because he hadn't been a member.

“Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,” Epstein added.

By the time Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, he had established an enormous network of wealthy and influential friends. Emails made public this week show the crime did little to diminish the desire of that network to stay connected to the billionaire financier.

Thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday offer a new glimpse into what Epstein's relationships with business executives, reporters, academics and political players looked like over a decade.

During that time, Epstein's network was eclectic, spanning the globe and political affiliations: from the liberal academic Noam Chomsky to Steve Bannon, the longtime ally of President Donald Trump.

Some reached out to support Epstein amid lawsuits and prosecutions, others sought introductions or advice on everything from dating to oil prices. One consulted him on how to respond to accusations of sexual harassment.

Epstein was charged with sex trafficking in 2019, and killed himself in jail a month later. Epstein's crimes, high-profile connections and jailhouse suicide have made the case a magnet for conspiracy theorists and online sleuths seeking proof of a cover-up.

By the time Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, he had established an enormous network of wealthy and influential friends. Emails made public this week show the crime did little to diminish the desire of that network to stay connected to the financier.

Thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday offer a new glimpse into what Epstein's relationships with business executives, reporters, academics and political players looked like over a decade.

They start with messages he sent and received around the time he finished serving his Florida sentence in 2009 and continue until the months before his arrest on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019.

During that time, Epstein's network was eclectic, spanning the globe and political affiliations: from the liberal academic Noam Chomsky to Steve Bannon, the longtime ally of President Donald Trump.

Some reached out to support Epstein amid lawsuits and prosecutions, others sought introductions or advice on everything from dating to oil prices. One consulted him on how to respond to accusations of sexual harassment.

Epstein was charged with sex trafficking in 2019, and killed himself in jail a month later. Epstein's crimes, high-profile connections and jailhouse suicide have made the case a magnet for conspiracy theorists and online sleuths seeking proof of a cover-up.

The emails do not implicate his contacts in those alleged crimes. They instead paint a picture of Epstein's influence and connections over the years he was a registered sex offender.

Epstein emailed current and former political figures on all sides, sending news clips and discussing strategy or gossip often in short, choppy emails laden with spelling and grammatical errors.

In several emails in 2018, Epstein advised Bannon on his political tour of Europe that year. Bannon first forwarded Epstein a news clip that described the German media as “underestimating” Bannon and that he was “As Dangerous as Ever.”

“luv it,” Epstein responded. 

Epstein wrote that he'd just spoken to “one of the country leaders that we discussed” and that “we should lay out a strategy plan. . how much fun.” 

Several months later, Epstein sent some advice: “If you are going to play here , you'll have to spend time, europe by remote doesn't work.”

“its doable but time consuming,” Epstein continued in a follow-up email, “there are many leaders of countries we can organize for you to have one on ones.” 

Just a few months earlier, Epstein was insulting Trump — whose movement Bannon was a representative of — in emails to Kathryn Ruemmler, the former White House counsel under President Barack Obama.

Ruemmler sent a message to Epstein calling Trump “so gross.” A portion of that message was redacted, but Epstein replied, “worse in real life and upclose.”

In other emails with Ruemmler, Epstein detailed a whirlwind of well-known people he appears to have been meeting, hosting or speaking with that week, including an ambassador, a tech giant, foreign business people, academics and a film director.

“you are a welcome guest at any,” he wrote.

Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokesperson for Goldman Sachs, where Ruemmler now works, declined to comment.

The financier emailed often with people in the upper echelons of wealth around the world, brokering introductions and chatting about politics and foreign affairs.

That included Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, who Epstein sent an email to in 2014 saying “that was fun , see you in 3 weeks.”

Four years later, Epstein asked if Thiel was enjoying Los Angeles, and, after Thiel said he couldn't complain, replied “Dec visit me Caribbean.” It's unclear if Thiel ever responded.

In emails with Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, an Emirati businessman, Epstein complimented Bannon, saying in 2018 that “We have become friends you will like him.”

“Trump doesn't like him,” responded Sulayem.

A year earlier, Sulayem asked Epstein about an event where it appeared Trump would be in attendance, asking, “Do you think it will be possible to shake hand with trump.”

“Call to discuss,” Epstein wrote back.

In January 2010, biotech venture capitalist Boris Nikolic was attending the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and Epstein emailed to ask, “any fun?”

Nikolic replied that he had met “your friend” Bill Clinton, as well as then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy and “your other friend,” Prince Andrew, “as he has some questions re microsoft.”

But then Nikolic said he was getting sick of meetings. Later, he wrote Epstein that “it would be blast that you are here.” He mentioned flirting with a 22-year-old woman.

“It turns out she is with her husand. Did not have chance to check him out. But as we concluded, anything good is rented ;)” Nikolic wrote.

The theoretical physicist and cosmologist Laurence Krauss was among them. In 2017, Krauss reached out to Epstein via email for advice on responding to a reporter writing a story about allegations of sexual harassment against him.

“Is this a reasonable response? Should i even respond? Could use advice,” Krauss asked Epstein.

In an explicit exchange, Epstein asked Krauss if he'd had sex with the person in question and then suggested he should not reply to the journalist. 

“No. We didn't have sex. Decided it wasn't a good idea,” replied Krauss.

Krauss said in an email to The Associated Press that he never hid the fact that he knew Epstein, and interacted with him several times.

“I sought out advice from essentially everyone I knew when false allegations about me were circulated in the press in 2018,” said Krauss. “I was as shocked as the rest of the world when he was arrested” in 2019.

In an August 2015 email exchange, Epstein told Chomsky, the famed linguist and social scientist, to only fly to Greece if he feels well, joking he previously had to send a plane for another “lefty friend” to see a doctor in New York.

In the same exchange, which dipped into academic arguments about warning signs on currency collapses, behavioral science models, and Big Data, Epstein offered his residences for Chomsky's use.

“you are of course welcome to use apt in new york with your new leisure time, or visit new Mexico again,” Epstein wrote. 

The emails also show that Epstein kept up a friendly relationship with Larry Summers, who was the treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and former Harvard University president, and bantered about the 2016 presidential race and Trump.

Other emails showed a closer relationship. In 2019, Summers was discussing interactions he had with a woman, writing to Epstein that “I said what are you up to. She said ‘I'm busy'. I said awfully coy u are.”

Epstein replied, “you reacted well.. annoyed shows caring. , no whining showed strentgh.”

Summers issued a statement saying he has “great regrets in my life.”

“As I have said before, my association with Jeffrey Epstein was a major error of judgement,” the statement said.

Chomsky, Thiel, Bannon, and Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem did not immediately respond to requests for comment, which were sent through email addresses available on their own or their organizations' websites.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Unapproved peptide drugs have become a trendy new hack among wellness influencers, fitness coaches and celebrities, pitched as a way to build muscle, shed pounds and look younger.

Online stores will offer injectable vials for $300 to $600 each. Longevity and wellness clinics offer in-office evaluations and injections, sometimes with membership fees of thousands of dollars per month.

But many of the products have never been extensively studied in humans, raising concerns that they could cause allergic reactions, metabolic problems and other dangerous side effects.

Here's a closer look at the science, the hype and the potential risks surrounding the trend.

Within the human body, peptides are short chains of amino acids that perform essential functions. 

Insulin, for example, controls blood sugar levels and helps break down foods into energy. Likewise the popular weight loss drugs, GLP-1s — short for glucagon-like peptides — are based on a hormone found in the intestines that helps regulate blood sugar.

The Food and Drug Administration has approved both substances as drugs. But there are many more peptides that have never been approved by regulators as safe and effective, though some have shown interesting study results in rodents and other animals.

This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well.

Synthesized peptides are not new. Some doctors have prescribed them for decades off-label, or for unapproved uses, in patients with gastric ulcers, nervous system disorders and other conditions.

In recent years, peptides have become a focus for wellness gurus and other public figures with large online followings. That's driven interest in using obscure peptides for unsubstantiated uses like healing injuries, improving complexion and even extending life. Peptides in this group include an alphabet soup of injectable compounds, including BPC-157, thymosin alpha, GHK-Copper and many more. Some are banned by sports regulators as doping substances.




Experts who have studied the field are particularly concerned that some people are combining multiple peptides.

“These influencers are often advocating taking a stack of peptides each month, so it could be two, three, four different peptides,” said Dr. Eric Topol of Scripps Research Translational Institute. “This is really what I consider dangerous.”

Interest in the trend is being amplified by celebrities. 

Joe Rogan has repeatedly talked about using BPC-157 to recover from injuries. Jennifer Aniston has talked about using weekly peptide injections to improve her skin and currently serves as a paid spokesperson for a company selling peptide-enriched supplements.

“If any celebrity is using a peptide, and they're saying this is what worked for me, then of course it's going to be more mainstream and people are going to be looking into it,” said Kay Robins, a clinical nurse and operator of Pure Alchemy Wellness, a clinic outside of San Diego that sells peptide infusions and injections. 

Robins says she no longer offers BPC-157 and other peptides that have been targeted by the FDA.

Most of the unproven peptides promoted online are technically being sold illegally.

Any substance that is injected to produce a health benefit or prevent a medical condition is classified as a drug, which cannot be sold without FDA approval.

The agency considers many peptides to be biologics, the most complicated and potentially high-risk type of drugs, requiring extra precautions in their manufacture and storage. In recent years, the agency has added more than two dozen peptides to a list of substances that should not be produced by pharmacies due to safety risks.

Some companies market their peptides as dietary supplements, particularly those sold as pills, gummies or powders. 

While dietary supplements are less tightly regulated than drugs, the FDA still requires them to only contain ingredients found on a list of approved substances. Most peptides are not on that list and therefore are ineligible to be sold as supplements.

Experts generally agree that consuming peptides by mouth likely has little or no effect, since they will dissolve in the gut.

Most of the injectable peptides sold in the U.S. are produced by compounding pharmacies, which custom-mix medications that aren't available from drug manufacturers. Pharmacies are regulated at the state level and are generally not subject to the same scrutiny as companies overseen by FDA.

In recent years, compounding pharmacies have jumped into the market for blockbuster GLP-1 drugs. Under FDA regulations, compounding pharmacies can produce their own versions of a prescription drug when there's a shortage.

Earlier this year the FDA determined that the shortage of GLP-1s had ended, meaning compounders were expected to halt production. But many have continued making custom versions of the drugs — adding extra ingredients like vitamin B, which they say benefits patients.

“There had never been the monetary incentive to push the envelope of what is legally permissible with compounding before,” said Nathaniel Lacktman, a lawyer specializing in FDA-related issues. “The dollars weren't there.”

Some of the industry's new production capacity has gone into producing unapproved peptides, such as BPC-157.

The trend recently caught the attention of the FDA, which has added more than two dozen peptides to an interim list of substances that should not be compounded due to safety concerns.

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is among those who have touted the potential benefits of peptides. He has repeatedly vowed to end “FDA's war” on peptides, which have become popular among many followers of his Make America Healthy Again movement.

Some of Kennedy's friends and associates are also prominent marketers of peptides, including self-described “biohacker” Gary Brecka and functional medicine physician and author Dr. Mark Hyman.

Some in the peptide field expect Kennedy to roll back FDA's restrictions on the industry, which could include releasing a list of peptides that the agency will no longer try to keep off the market.

ATLANTA (AP) — It was the worst summer in years. Sechita McNair's family took no vacations. Her younger boys didn't go to camp. Her van was repossessed, and her family nearly got evicted — again.

But she accomplished the one thing she wanted most. A few weeks before school started, McNair, an out-of-work film industry veteran barely getting by driving for Uber, signed a lease in the right Atlanta neighborhood so her eldest son could stay at his high school.

As she pulled up outside the school on the first day, Elias, 15, stepped onto the curb in his new basketball shoes and cargo pants. She inspected his face, noticed wax in his ears and grabbed a package of baby wipes from her rental car. She wasn't about to let her eldest, with his young Denzel Washington looks, go to school looking “gross.”

He grimaced and broke away.

“No kiss? No hugs?” she called out. 

Elias waved and kept walking. Just ahead of him, at least for the moment, sat something his mother had fought relentlessly for: a better education.

Last year, McNair and her three kids were evicted from their beloved apartment in the rapidly gentrifying Old Fourth Ward neighborhood of Atlanta. Like many evicted families, they went from living in a school district that spends more money on students to one that spends less.

Thanks to federal laws protecting homeless and evicted students, her kids were able to keep attending their Atlanta schools, even though the only housing available to them was in another county 40 minutes away. They also had the right to free transportation to those schools, but McNair says the district didn't tell her about that until the school year ended. Their eligibility to remain in those schools expired at the end of last school year.




Still wounded by the death of his father and multiple housing displacements, Elias failed two classes last year, his freshman year. Switching schools now, McNair fears, would jeopardize any chance he has of recovering his academic life. “I need this child to be stable,” she says.

Bianca Vázquez Toness covers the intersection of education and children's well-being. She led the nation in showing how many students were missing school after the pandemic — work that was honored as a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.

With just one week before school started, McNair drove extra Uber hours, borrowed money, secured rental assistance and ignored concerns about the apartment to rent a three-bedroom in the Old Fourth Ward. At $2,200 a month, it was the only “semi-affordable” apartment in the rapidly gentrifying ward that would rent to a single mom with a fresh eviction on her record.

On Zillow, the second-floor apartment, built in 2005, looked like a middle-class dream with its granite countertops, crown molding and polished wood floors. But up close, the apartment looked abused and held secrets McNair was only beginning to uncover.

The first sign something was wrong came early. When she first toured the apartment, it felt rushed, like the agent didn't want her to look too closely. Then, even as they told her she was accepted, the landlord and real estate agent wouldn't send her a “welcome letter” laying out the agreement, the rent and deposit she would pay. It seemed like they didn't want to put anything in writing.

When the lease came, it was full of errors. She signed it anyway. “We're back in the neighborhood!” she said. Elias could return to Midtown High School.

But even in their triumph, no one in the family could relax. Too many things were uncertain. And it fell to McNair — and only McNair — to figure it out.

Midtown is a high school so coveted that school administrators investigate student residency throughout the year to keep out kids from other parts of Atlanta and beyond. For McNair, the day Elias returned to the high school was a momentous one. 

“Freedom!” McNair declared after Elias disappeared into the building. Without child care over the summer, McNair had struggled to find time to work enough to make ends meet. Now that the kids were back in class, McNair could spend school hours making money and resolving some of the unsettled issues with her new apartment.

McNair, the first person in her family to attend college, studied theater management. Her job rigging stage sets was lucrative until the writers' and actors' strike and other changes paralyzed the film industry in 2023. The scarcity of work on movie sets, combined with her tendency to take in family and non-family alike, wrecked her home economy.

The family was evicted last fall when McNair fell behind on rent because of funeral expenses for her foster daughter. The teen girl died from an epileptic seizure while McNair and everyone else slept. Elias found her body.

McNair attributes some of Elias's lack of motivation at school to personal trauma. His father died after a heart attack in 2023, on the sidelines of Elias's basketball practice.

On his first day back at school this August, Elias appeared excited but tentative. He watched as the seniors swanned into school wearing gold cardboard crowns, a Midtown back-to-school tradition, and scanned the sidewalk for anyone familiar. 

If Elias had his way, his mom would homeschool him. She's done it before. But now that he's a teenager, it's harder to get Elias to follow her instructions. As the only breadwinner supporting three kids and her disabled uncle, she has to work.

Elias hid from the crowds and called up a friend: “Where you at?” The friend, another sophomore, was still en route. Over the phone, they compared outfits, traded gossip about who got a new hairdo or transferred. When Elias's friend declared this would be the year he'd get a girlfriend, Elias laughed.

When it was time to go in, Elias drifted toward the door with his head down as other students flooded past.



Hours later, he emerged. Despite everything McNair had done to help it go well — securing the apartment, even spending hundreds of dollars on new clothes for him — Elias slumped into the backseat when she picked him up after class.

“School was so boring,” he said.

“What happened?” McNair asked.

“Nothing, bro. That was the problem,” Elias said. “I thought I was going to be happy when school started, since summer was so horrible.”

Of all of the classes he was taking — geometry, gym, French, world history, environmental science — only gym interested him. He wished he could take art classes, he said. Elias has acted in some commercials and television programs, but chose a science and math concentration, hoping to study finance someday.

After dinner at Chick-fil-A, the family visited the city library one block from their new apartment. While McNair spoke to the librarian, the boys explored the children's section. Malachi, 6, watched a YouTube video on a library computer while Derrick, 7, flipped through a book. Elias sat in a corner, sharing video gaming tips with a stranger he met online.

“Those people are learning Japanese,” said McNair, pointing to a group of adults sitting around a cluster of tables. “And this library lets you check out museum passes. This is why we have to be back in the city. Resources!”




McNair wants her children to go to well-resourced schools. Atlanta spends nearly $20,000 per student a year, $7,000 more than the district they moved to after the eviction. More money in schools means smaller classrooms and more psychologists, guidance counselors and other support.

But McNair, who grew up in New Jersey near New York City, also sees opportunities in the wider city of Atlanta. She wants to use its libraries, e-scooters, bike paths, hospitals, rental assistance agencies, Buy Nothing groups and food pantries.

“These are all resources that make it possible to raise a family when you don't have support,” she said. “Wouldn't anyone want that?”

On the way home, the little boys fall asleep in the back seat. Elias asks, “So, is homeschooling off the table?”

McNair doesn't hesitate. “Heck yeah. I'm not homeschooling you,” she says lightly. “Do you see how much of a financial bind I'm in?”'

McNair pulls into the driveway in Jonesboro, the suburb where the family landed after their eviction. Even though the family wants to live in Atlanta, their stuff is still here. It's a neighborhood of brick colonials and manicured lawns. She realizes it's the dream for some families, but not hers. “It's a support desert.”

As they get out of the car, Elias takes over as parent-in-charge. “Get all of your things,” he directs Malachi and Derrick, who scowl as Elias seems to relish bossing them around. “Pick up your car seats, your food, those markers. I don't want to see anything left behind.” Elias would be responsible for making the boys burritos, showering them and putting them to sleep.

McNair heads out to drive for Uber. That's what is necessary to pay $450 a week to rent the car and earn enough to pay her rent and bills.

But while McNair is out, she can't monitor Elias. And a few days after he starts school, Elias's all-night gaming habit has already drawn teachers' attention.

“I wanted to check in regarding Elias,” his geometry teacher writes during the first week of school. “He fell asleep multiple times during Geometry class this morning.”

Elias had told the teacher he went to bed around 4 a.m. the night before. “I understand that there may be various reasons for this, and I'd love to work together to support Elias so he can stay focused and successful in class.”

A few days later, McNair gets a similar email from his French teacher.

That night, McNair drives around Atlanta, trying to pick up enough Uber trips to keep her account active. But she can't stop thinking about the emails. “I should be home making sure Elias gets to bed on time,” she says, crying. “But I have to work. I'm the only one paying the bills.”

Ever since McNair rented the Atlanta apartment, her bills had doubled. She wasn't sure when she'd feel safe giving up the house she'd been renting in Clayton County, given the problems with the Atlanta apartment. For starters, she was not even sure it was safe to spend the night there.

A week after school started in August, McNair dropped by the apartment to check whether the landlords had made repairs. At the very least, she wanted more smoke detectors. 

She also wanted them to replace the door, which looked like someone had forced it open with a crowbar. She wanted a working fridge and oven. She wanted them to secure the back door to the adjoining empty apartment, which appeared to be open and made her wonder if there were pests or even people squatting there.

But on this day, her keys didn't work.

She called 911. Had her new landlords deliberately locked her out?

When the police showed up outside the olive-green, Craftsman-style fourplex, McNair scrolled through her phone to find a copy of her lease. Then McNair and the officer eyed a man walking up to the property. “The building was sold in a short sale two weeks ago,” he told McNair. The police officer directed the man to give the new keys to McNair. 

The next day, McNair started getting emails from an agent specializing in foreclosures, suggesting the new owners wanted McNair to leave. “The bank owns the property and now you are no longer a tenant of the previous owner,” she wrote. The new owner “might” offer relocation assistance if McNair agreed to leave.

McNair consulted attorneys, who reassured her: It might be uncomfortable, but she could stay. She needed to try to pay rent, even if the new owner didn't accept it.

So McNair messaged the agent, asking where she should send the rent, and requested the company make necessary repairs. Eventually, the real estate agent stopped responding. 



Finally, McNair moved her kids and a few items from the Jonesboro house to the Atlanta apartment. She didn't allow Elias to bring his video game console to Atlanta. He started going to bed around 11 p.m. most nights. But even as she solved that problem, others emerged.

It was at Midtown's back-to-school night in September that McNair learned Elias was behind in most of his classes. Some teachers said maybe Midtown wasn't the right school for Elias.

Perhaps they were right, McNair thought. She'd heard similar things before.

Elias also didn't want to go to school. He skipped one day, then another. McNair panicked. In Georgia, parents can be sent to jail for truancy when their kids miss five unexcused days. 

McNair started looking into a homeschooling program run by a mother she follows on Facebook. In the meantime, she emailed and called some Midtown staff for advice. She says she didn't get a response. Finally, seven weeks after the family's triumphant return to Midtown, McNair filed papers declaring her intention to homeschool Elias. 

It quickly proved challenging. Elias wouldn't do any schoolwork when he was home alone. And when the homeschooling group met twice a week, she discovered, they required parents to pick up their children afterward instead of allowing them to take public transit or e-scooters. That was untenable. 

Elias wanted to stay at home and offered to take care of McNair's uncle, who has dementia. “That was literally killing my soul the most,” said McNair. “That's not a child's job.”

Hell, no, she told him — you only get one chance at high school.

Then, one day, while she was loading the boys' clothes into the washing machine at the Atlanta apartment, she received a call from an unknown Atlanta number. It was the woman who heads Atlanta Public Schools' virtual program, telling her the roster was full.

McNair asked the woman for her opinion on Elias's situation. Maybe she should abandon the Atlanta apartment and enroll him in the Jonesboro high school.

Let me stop you right there, the woman said. Is your son an athlete? If he transfers too many times, it can affect his ability to play basketball. And he'd probably lose credits and take longer to graduate. He needs to be in school — preferably Midtown — studying for midterms, she said. You need to put on your “big mama drawers” and take him back, she told McNair.

The next day, Elias and his mother pulled up to Midtown. Outside the school, Elias asked if he had to go inside. Yes, she told him. This is your fault as much as it's mine.

Now, with Elias back in school every day, McNair can deliver food through Uber Eats without worrying about a police officer asking why her kid isn't in school. If only she had pushed harder, sooner, for help with Elias, she thought. “I should have just gone down to the school and sat in their offices until they talked to me.”

But it was easy for her to explain why she hadn't. “I was running around doing so many other things just so we have a place to live, or taking care of my uncle, that I didn't put enough of my energy there.”

She wishes she could pay more attention to Elias. But so many things are pulling at her. And as fall marches toward winter, her struggle continues. After failing to keep up with the Jonesboro rent, she's preparing to leave that house before the landlord sends people to haul her possessions to the curb.

As an Uber driver, she has picked up a few traumatized mothers with their children after they got evicted. She helped them load the few things they could fit into her van. As they drove off, onlookers scavenged the leftovers. 

She has promised herself she'd never let that happen to her kids.

BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Luis Rubiales was pelted by eggs thrown by his own uncle when the former head of Spain's soccer federation was presenting a memoir late Thursday relating his downfall after kissing a player at the 2023 Women's World Cup.

Rubiales was seated on a stool on a low stage when he jumped up and spun quickly trying to avoid three eggs hurled his way. One impacted on the back of his dark jacket, and another splattered against a screen behind him as he charged into the small audience.

“A man entered who I later saw was my uncle, who is a troubled man, and always has been,” Rubiales told reporters. “He had some eggs and threw some at me, but I didn't know what he had in his hands, and when I first saw him I thought he might be carrying a weapon.”

Spanish media reported that the uncle was Luis Rubén Rubiales, an actor who has appeared in several domestic television shows.

Spanish police told The Associated Press they arrested the egg thrower. No motive was immediately given for the incident. A video shows a group of men in the audience grabbing the uncle immediately after he launched the eggs and escorting him away.

Rubiales also had a falling out with another uncle, Juan Rubiales, several years ago when Juan was working for him at the federation.

His book “Matar a Rubiales” (Killing Rubiales) is a 500-page version of his professional demise after kissing Spain forward Jenni Hermoso during the 2023 Women's World Cup awards ceremony. 




According to its publisher, Rubiales says he was the victim of a “conspiracy of different powers of Spanish public life” including the government and “the profitable world of feminism.”

Rubiales has always denied he kissed Hermoso without her consent. After initially clinging to power amid a national uproar, he stepped down under immense pressure from the government, soccer officials, women players and fans. 

Earlier this year he was found guilty of sexual assault for the unsolicited kiss by a Spanish court.

Rubiales, 48, is also under scrutiny by Spanish authorities probing his 2020 deal to move the Spanish Super Cup to Saudi Arabia.

Royal commentator Hilary Fordwich breaks down the royal family drama on Fox & Friends Weekend.

King Charles is reportedly weary and withdrawn as he marks his 77th birthday, burdened by the shadow of his disgraced brother's ongoing scandals.

Royal experts told Fox News Digital that the monarch will spend his birthday focused on duty — a hallmark of his reign. Yet behind palace walls, they say Charles remains deeply troubled by how ex-Prince Andrew's controversies continue to cast a long, painful cloud over both his family and the monarchy he leads.

Fox News Digital reached out to Buckingham Palace for comment.

""During Remembrance Sunday at the Cenotaph Parade, King Charles was particularly emotional, shedding a tear while standing in silence,"" British royals expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News Digital.

""He was withered and withdrawn, with one able to observe the toll the Andrew nightmare had taken on him. He appeared to be somewhat resolute. He is also known to be wanting to double down on duty, rather than anything verging on a shallow or frivolous celebration.""

""While Andrew, of course, will always remain his brother, now that he's a private citizen, the king is likely to further publicly distance himself,"" Fordwich shared. ""We won't be seeing Andrew at any birthday festivities. He's actually made it worse for himself due to his pride and pervasively privileged attitude, thinking he's still entitled.""

Fordwich claimed that the former Duke of York, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, is ""refusing to negotiate residence terms."" She noted this has ""merely served to widen the gulf between himself and the family at large."" 

A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace previously told Fox News Digital they don't answer for Andrew as he's not a working royal.

""Charles is purportedly ‘fed up' with Andrew and, to the greatest extent possible, will be barring Andrew from any royal events,"" Fordwich added.

On Oct. 30, Buckingham Palace announced that Charles was removing his brother's titles and evicting him from his palatial Royal Lodge home over his relationship with late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Ongoing pressure has loomed over the palace to punish the 65-year-old over new revelations about his friendship with Epstein and renewed attention on sexual abuse allegations by one of Epstein's victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre. Her posthumous memoir was published last month.

Charles stripped Andrew of his princely title, one that he'd had since birth. But the scrutiny surrounding the late queen's favorite son is far from over.

On Tuesday, Democratic members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee made public tens of thousands of additional pages of documents from the estate of the late disgraced financier.

Emails included in the files referenced Andrew in connection with Giuffre, who accused him of sexually abusing her on three separate occasions in 2001 when she was a teenager after Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell trafficked her.

Andrew has consistently denied Giuffre's allegations and claimed he has no memory of meeting her. However, several emails included in the documents and obtained by The Telegraph and Sky News appeared to cast doubt on Andrew's denials, including statements that he made during a 2019 interview on BBC's ""Newsnight.""

In one email that Epstein sent to a journalist, he seemed to contradict a suggestion made by Andrew during the interview that a now-infamous photo showing the former prince with an underage Giuffre was fake.

The image, which allegedly showed Andrew with his arm around Giuffre's waist and Maxwell in the background, was first made public in February 2011 and became key to the controversy surrounding the royal.

In the newly released correspondence, which was sent in July 2011, Epstein appeared to confirm the image's authenticity and claimed ""many"" of his employees also took photos with Andrew.

""King Charles may be choking on his birthday cake as more allegations over Andrew are revealed,"" royal expert Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital.

""There is little more the king can do to further punish his erstwhile brother,"" he said.

In a 2015 federal lawsuit that Giuffre filed against Maxwell, she claimed that she met and was recruited by the socialite in the summer of 2000 when she was 16 and working as a spa attendant at President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.

In her book ""Nobody's Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice,"" Giuffre — who died by suicide at the age of 41 earlier this year — provided further details about meeting Maxwell and how events unfolded afterward.

""Nobody can prove whether or not that photograph has been doctored, but I don't recollect that photograph ever being taken,"" Andrew continued.

""From the investigations that we've done, you can't prove whether or not that photograph is faked or not because it is a photograph of a photograph of a photograph,"" he added.

In another 2011 email obtained by The Telegraph from the newly released files, Andrew appeared to express distress over the mounting public and media scrutiny over his relationship with Epstein and Giuffre's allegations.

According to the outlet, a reporter from the Mail on Sunday emailed Epstein on March 4, 2011, to ask for comment on the relationship that he, Maxwell and Andrew had with Giuffre.

Per the outlet, Andrew appeared to reply directly to Maxwell after the email was forwarded to him, writing, ""Hey there! What's all this? I don't know anything about this. You must SAY [sic] so please. This has NOTHING To do with me.""

Fordwich noted that on his birthday, the king will be supported by his heir and beloved daughter-in-law as the royals navigate the media storm.

""Given the current fervor regarding Andrew, birthday celebrations for the king are likely to be subdued with a greater emphasis on service,"" said Fordwich. ""They will demonstrate all the dedication to duty the monarchy stands for to ensure continuity.""

""They project stability and are focused on the future of the monarchy. They are intimately involved in succession planning, international engagements and global initiatives. Both of them are projecting a more reform-focused monarchy, only including a narrow inner circle with a far greater emphasis on accountability.""

British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard told Fox News Digital that for Charles, the show must go on.

""The king's decision to keep his birthday celebrations low-key is a reflection of his philosophy that the monarchy should serve, rather than celebrate itself,"" she explained. ""Instead of hosting a lavish reception, he will be engaging in official duties. A private celebration with Queen Camilla and a public cutting of a birthday cake will be on the menu.""

""The relationship between Charles and Andrew is strained,"" said Chard. ""The king's inner circle has also shrunk, with some now pushing for an even stronger stance against Andrew as he's still making headlines for all the wrong reasons.""

""Andrew's downfall was brought on by his hubris. Despite these challenges, the king remains committed to his role.""

Zack Cozart, a 2017 National League All-Star, is holding strong regarding his stance on minors receiving sex changes.

The former Cincinnati Reds shortstop claimed in a post on social media Friday that he has ""been told [his] reputation is ‘tarnished'"" for his conservative views and thinking minors should not be able to ""change their sex.""

""Let me be clear . . . if those things are true [because] I don't think a child should be allowed to change their sex, then so be it…"" Cozart proclaimed. ""[You] turn 18, do whatever [you] want, but when [you] can't get a tattoo until 18, I'm prob on the right side of the argument saying [you] shouldn't be able to change [your] sex under 18.""

Cozart has also voiced his opinion on transgender athletes in girls' and women's sports.

""Imagine being against this lol,"" Cozart posted on X in July 2024 in response to a post that quoted President Donald Trump as saying, ""We will not have men playing in women's sports. That will end immediately.""

""Wow they just now found it?"" he wrote. 

Cozart did say he would no longer support Trump if the United States went to war back in June, but he reversed course after a cease-fire was announced at the time.

""I'll gladly eat my words for what has transpired today… lesson learned to trust the man,"" he wrote on X.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Hegseth announces Operation Southern Spear to remove ‘narcoterrorists from our hemisphere'","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense/3886847/hegseth-operation-southern-spear-narcoterrorists/","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 00:58:08 GMT","

War Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the commencement of Operation Southern Spear on Thursday evening, an operation he said is aimed at protecting the Western Hemisphere from “narcoterrorists.”

The announcement comes after months of U.S. Southern Command strikes in the Caribbean on alleged drug-trafficking boats, many of which the Pentagon said were suspected of sailing from the shores of Venezuela. Hegseth made the operation announcement in a post on X, noting that President Donald Trump ordered the action.

“Led by Joint Task Force Southern Spear and @SOUTHCOM, this mission defends our Homeland, removes narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere, and secures our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people. The Western Hemisphere is America's neighborhood – and we will protect it,” Hegseth said.

The Trump administration ordered a 20th strike on a suspected drug-smuggling boat Tuesday, killing four people in the Caribbean.

Hegseth's announcement of the operation follows the arrival of the Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier strike group in the Caribbean as the Pentagon bolsters its military presence in the region.

Venezuela has begun organizing its defense forces, with Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López announcing this week that the “entire country's military arsenal” is “on full operational readiness.”

The Pentagon referred the Washington Examiner to Hegseth's X post in response to requests for comment on further information about Operation Southern Spear.

The Pentagon also pointed to SOUTHCOM's Oct. 10 press release on the creation of the Joint Task Force Southern Spear, which Hegseth said will lead Operation Southern Spear.

“This is principally a maritime effort, and our team will leverage maritime patrols, aerial surveillance, precision interdictions, and intelligence sharing to counter illicit traffic, uphold the rule of law, and ultimately better protect vulnerable communities here at home,” Lt. Gen. Calvert Worth, designated JTF commander, said in the October release.

In late January, the Navy announced an “Operation Southern Spear” in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility. 

VENEZUELA ORDERS MAJOR MOBILIZATION AS US AIRCRAFT CARRIER ARRIVES IN NEARBY WATERS

The operation's deployment was “to help determine combinations of unmanned vehicles and manned forces to provide coordinated maritime domain awareness and conduct counternarcotics operations,” according to a January press release.

“Southern Spear will operationalize a heterogeneous mix of Robotic and Autonomous Systems (RAS) to support the detection and monitoring of illicit trafficking while learning lessons for other theaters,” Commander Foster Edwards, hybrid director of the U.S. 4th Fleet, said in a January statement.

The sweeping racketeering case accusing President Donald Trump and several allies of attempting to overturn Georgia's 2020 election results will move forward under a newly appointed prosecutor. It follows weeks of uncertainty surrounding who, if anyone, would take over the prosecution following Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis's removal from the case.

Peter Skandalakis, director of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia, appointed himself to lead the case Friday after an unsuccessful, weekslong effort to find an outside prosecutor willing to take it. Skandalakis, a former Coweta County district attorney whose council is composed of district attorneys and solicitors general from across the state, said no other prosecutor agreed to step in despite multiple attempts.

“The filing of this appointment reflects my inability to secure another conflict prosecutor to assume responsibility for this case,” he wrote in a filing in Fulton County Superior Court on Friday. “Several prosecutors were contacted and, while all were respectful and professional, each declined the appointment. Out of respect for their privacy and professional discretion, I will not identify those prosecutors or disclose their reasons for declining.”

His decision came just hours before a deadline imposed by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who said the case would be dismissed entirely if no prosecutor had been appointed by Friday morning. 

“With Judge McAfee's deadline now upon us and my review still ongoing, I have determined that the best course of action is to appoint myself to the case,” Skandalakis said. He added that the move would allow him to complete a comprehensive review and “make an informed and transparent determination” about the future of the prosecution, citing the public's legitimate interest in its outcome and his own prior involvement in the related investigation of now-Lt. Gov. Burt Jones (R-GA).

The reassignment underscores that the lawfare surrounding Trump in the lead-up to the 2024 election has not subsided even after his return to the Oval Office. While it is widely understood that Trump is unlikely to be prosecuted while serving as president until 2029 due to constitutional and practical barriers, the case's continuation illustrates that the criminal prosecutions that ensued after his 2020 election defeat continue to shadow his presidency.

The indictment, which resulted in the mugshot of Trump that was later used as a campaign symbol of resistance, was left in limbo earlier this year after the Georgia Court of Appeals disqualified Willis over conflicts of interest tied to her former special prosecutor, Nathan Wade.

Willis launched the investigation in early 2021 and brought the sprawling racketeering indictment in August 2023, naming Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, and a slate of political aides, lawyers, and Republican electors as co-defendants. It became one of the most closely watched criminal proceedings in the country, leading up to the 2024 election.

Four defendants have already pleaded guilty: bail bondsman Scott Hall, who admitted to misdemeanor conspiracy charges; former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, who pleaded guilty to six misdemeanor counts; Trump legal adviser Jenna Ellis, who pleaded guilty to a felony count of aiding and abetting false statements; and attorney Kenneth Chesebro, who pleaded guilty to a felony count of conspiring to file false documents. The remaining defendants still fighting charges include Giuliani, Meadows, John Eastman, Jeffrey Clark, Ray Smith, Austin Cheeley, Scott “Matt” Shafer, Shawn Still, Caroline Wooten Kutti, Harrison Floyd, Kurt Hilbert, Mike Roman, David Lee, and Robert Cheeley, all of whom have pleaded not guilty.

The landscape of the case has also shifted politically in recent days. Last Friday, the Trump administration issued federal pardons to Meadows, Giuliani, and several others who were accused of supporting efforts to overturn Georgia's election results — a move that removed federal exposure for several figures but does not affect state-level criminal liability.

Additionally, it is possible for Skandalakis to make the decision on his own to dismiss the case, should he wish not to proceed with the prosecution any longer.

TRUMP'S 2020 ALTERNATE-ELECTOR PARDONS SEEK TO DERAIL REMAINING CRIMINAL CASES

Trump's lead Georgia defense attorney, Steve Sadow, again called for the case to be dismissed following the announcement that Skandalakis would take it over. 

“This politically charged prosecution has to come to an end,” Sadow told the Washington Examiner. “We remain confident that a fair and impartial review will lead to a dismissal of the case against President Trump.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Human brains were not meant to think about trillions of dollars.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

Numbers are too big now. Just before Halloween, Nvidia made headlines for becoming the first $5 trillion company in history. A week later, Tesla's shareholders approved a pay package for Elon Musk that could be worth about $1 trillion in a decade. At a certain point, figures this large become uncomfortably meaningless. A million dollars is a lot of money. A billion dollars is a heck of a lot—so much that if you had it, you'd be a billionaire. Now try to imagine how rich you would be if you were pulling in $8 billion every month for the next 10 years, as Musk is effectively about to do. It's impossible. “The numbers are so big, they are hard to comprehend,” Jeff Sommer recently wrote in The New York Times. And he's the paper's finance columnist.

Sommer was referring to the stock market, which has been on an outrageous tear, with the gains concentrated among a tiny number of unfathomably valuable companies. The S&P 500 has doubled since October 2022, which is impressive on its own, but the combined market cap of the Magnificent Seven—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla—has more than quadrupled. These firms are all heavily invested in generative AI, a technology based on training computers to make connections among quantities of data that are completely beyond human understanding. Large numbers are generating large numbers.

Records are being broken before they've had time to sink in. Nvidia's $5 trillion valuation last month surpassed the first-ever $4 trillion valuation, which was also achieved by Nvidia, in July. The planet didn't even have a single trillion-dollar company until Apple hit that milestone in 2018. This was considered a big deal at the time. Now the equivalent of the most valuable corporation in history circa 2018 can be generated in three months.

Matteo Wong and Charlie Warzel: Here's how the AI crash happens

These wild numbers make all other sums sound trivial, even when they aren't. On Tuesday, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank disclosed that it had sold its entire $5.8 billion stake in Nvidia to fund other investments. That was important enough to make news basically everywhere. But we're talking about one one-thousandth of Nvidia's market cap here. Is $5.8 billion a lot, or is it lunch money?

As a species, we aren't ready for this. People basically can't tell the difference between any number that ends in -illion, and the more zeros you add, the worse things get. One experiment at the University of Richmond asked a group of students and graduates to plot numbers on a line. Half of them thought it made sense to evenly space 1,000, 1 million, and 1 billion. Another study asked people to rate the effectiveness of proposed COVID-relief packages. Responses differed sharply when the options were presented in per-capita amounts (giving everyone $1,200 was deemed much less effective than $24,000) but hardly at all when they were presented as total amounts ($100 billion versus $2 trillion), even though the ratio was the same in each case.

As the numbers grow, our understanding of reality dims. This is true even for some of our most influential thinkers. On Monday, Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that the United States would forfeit $2 trillion in revenue should the Supreme Court strike down his tariffs. The very next day, the president claimed that the number was $3 trillion. Even the smaller number would, if true, have been enough to completely wipe out the federal deficit. In fact, the U.S. has raised only about $200 billion in customs duties in the past fiscal year. The total U.S. debt, meanwhile, has risen to $38 trillion, a number so self-evidently absurd that the mind resists dwelling on it. It must be funny money. If it weren't, it could never have gotten so big.

Rogé Karma: The debt is about to matter again

The prospects for democratic self-governance are not good. Raising and spending money is one of the most fundamental functions of government. If neither citizens nor their leaders can wrap their heads around these numbers, how will anyone make informed decisions about how the country is run? A trillion here, a trillion there, and pretty soon you're talking real money.

Nor can our age of hyper-numbers be easily dismissed as the familiar product of inflation. Everyone grows up hearing about how cheap things were when our parents were kids—how you could buy a new Chrysler back then for the cost of a mattress today. Then you get older and have the same experience, puzzling over how movie tickets could possibly cost $16. But economic growth is generally understood to be exponential. The nature of exponential change is that it looks just like non-exponential change, right up until it doesn't. Economists model growth as a constant percent, such as 3 percent annually. This sounds innocuous but leads to absolute numbers that elude our comprehension. If you plot out the value of an economy that grows by just a few percentage points a year, and you set a long-enough time frame, your chart will look like a plateau that suddenly explodes into a vertical line.

That is exactly what linear graphs of the U.S. stock market look like right now, which suggests that we have achieved escape velocity and entered the vertical part of the curve. (The geniuses who put historical stock-market graphs together tend to conceal this fact by using a logarithmic scale, which makes big jumps look much smaller.) The bigger the numbers get, the faster they grow in absolute terms. In just a few years, a $5 trillion valuation might sound as quaint as a $2,000 two-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn does today. The recent stock-market surge has brought about this moment sooner than it otherwise would have arrived, and a bursting bubble could defer it, but not forever. Nvidia could lose half of its value, and it would still be worth $2.5 trillion.

One solution, childish in its simplicity, is for the government to unilaterally deflate the currency by decreeing that all dollar figures will henceforth be reduced by an order of magnitude—that is, they will drop a zero—like a stock split on the dollar. This would render Nvidia a mere $500 billion company and buy us all some time to absorb that fact. This technique is known as redenomination. It has been used to reduce nominal prices in countries experiencing out-of-control inflation, but to my knowledge, it has never been deployed to ease the cognitive burden of a stock market that is performing too well. Alas, like all perfect ideas, this will never happen. Instead, the numbers will keep growing, faster and faster, and we will remain strapped against our will to this exponential rocket, hurtling into the Milky Way, which contains only about 400 billion stars, tops. But who's counting?

Noah Baumbach's new film, Jay Kelly, takes a gamble with its fantastically successful protagonist.

Noah Baumbach loves to find sympathy in unsympathetic subjects—the awkward title character of Greenberg, the caustic writer played by Nicole Kidman in Margot at the Wedding, the bitter divorced couple of Marriage Story. But he's usually done it by mixing in plenty of bitter with just a touch of sweet. For his new movie, Jay Kelly, that formula is reversed in service of another character who might struggle to earn the viewer's pity: a bored, aging movie star worried that he's lived life the wrong way. It's hard to know why anyone should feel a pang of understanding for Jay Kelly (played by George Clooney), but Baumbach relishes the challenge.

Jay Kelly is Baumbach's fourth movie in a row that will be released to Netflix, with a short theatrical release. In his collaboration with the streaming studio, his scope has widened far beyond the small-scale indie dramedies that began his career—acerbic triumphs such as Kicking and Screaming, The Squid and the Whale, and Mr. Jealousy. His last work was a fascinating, flawed, staggeringly ambitious adaptation of Don DeLillo's White Noise; with Jay Kelly, he's charting a gentler, more familiar path, in terms of plot and setting.

Another director might have had a hard time getting audiences to care about the prosaic concerns of this beloved millionaire, but Baumbach, in casting Clooney, chose a star who himself has seemed a little lost at sea. After spending years mostly directing his own projects, usually to middling reviews, Clooney has recently turned in a couple of performances that felt like pale facsimiles of former glories, in the rom-com Ticket to Paradise and the action-thriller Wolfs. Both whiffs only further reminded me what a top-tier star Clooney used to be, and these staid recent efforts help meta-textually burnish Jay Kelly's initial setup. The film is about an actor, still well known and ostensibly successful, who feels dissatisfied with his creative choices and disconnected from the people around him. When an old mentor dies, at the funeral Jay runs into Timothy (Billy Crudup), a friend from his early days as an actor. Their reminiscing quickly turns sour, sending Jay into an emotional tailspin, and he impulsively flies to Italy rather than make his next movie.

Read: A couples therapist analyzes the marriage in Marriage Story

I won't even bother to play the world's tiniest violin for Jay; after all, who among us hasn't wanted to jaunt to Tuscany rather than face their contractual obligations? And Jay gets to have a particularly luxe midlife crisis, fueled by the resources of a rich movie star. But Baumbach smartly renders the character's breakdown as more farcical than tragic. As Jay jets away from Hollywood, an ecosystem of assistants and managers fires into action. His bedraggled manager, Ron (Adam Sandler), arranges for a lifetime-achievement award to await him in Europe; his publicist Liz (Laura Dern) runs interference on the viral videos that start to leak out of a hapless Jay stumbling around train cars, looking confused in the unfamiliar environment.

The gag of Baumbach's screenplay, co-written with the actor and writer Emily Mortimer, is perfectly pitched. Jay is feeling melancholy about the prosaic direction of his career, and the fact that his younger daughter went abroad with her school friends rather than hang out with him in Hollywood. But externally, what manifests is a lot of stumbling, silly comedy, as Jay hilariously fails to navigate regular life. If he walks through a town anywhere in the world, people notice him and swarm, like he's some Armani-clad messiah. Clooney nails the character's mix of embarrassment and joy at these interactions, while the team around him hurriedly tries to maintain his malfunctioning reality-distortion field.

The closest comparison to Jay Kelly I could think of is the more anarchic films of Federico Fellini, such as La Dolce Vita and 8 ½, where the Italian director started to wrestle with his own success. Jay Kelly isn't nearly as good as those, but it's interesting to see Baumbach take this sillier approach (down to the Tuscan setting) for a showbiz satire. Yes, some of the side characters have an acidic touch, particularly the wonderfully aggrieved Ron, who has chosen to ignore his family to tend to Jay's nervous breakdown. But Baumbach never lets the material get particularly heavy, perhaps aware that the audience won't buy that someone as famous as Jay could really experience suffering.

Instead, it all builds to the biggest circus of all: an international film festival designed to celebrate a man who isn't sure if he's accomplished anything meaningful besides starring in a bunch of blockbusters. The final notes of Jay Kelly are played for pure sympathy, and it's Baumbach's biggest storytelling gamble. Can his viewer tolerate one big gulp of pure sentimentality after two-plus hours that have largely skirted that tone? For me, yes—Clooney's a strong-enough star to sell Jay's achy heart, even amid the glitz and glamour. Baumbach's odyssey into more treacly territory is an attention-worthy gambit, though one hopes he doesn't lock the grouchiness away forever.

Republicans went after Epstein only when it was politically useful.

The Epstein files were the most important issue in the world, until they weren't.

“Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? This guy's been talked about for years. Are people still talking about this guy? This creep? That is unbelievable,” Donald Trump scolded a reporter who asked about Epstein in July. Trump went on to suggest that the question was a “desecration” of the memory of those who had recently died in floods in the Texas Hill Country.

It was a strangely aggressive reaction from the man whose most fervent supporters had spent years talking about Epstein, the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender who died in prison before his last trial, in which he faced charges for the trafficking of minors. (His associate Ghislaine Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison on child sex-trafficking charges.) During the 2024 campaign, Trump, when asked, pledged to release documents related to the investigation, commonly referred to as the “Epstein files.” A key tenet of the cult of personality around Trump was the belief that his second presidency would result in the Epstein documents revealing a secret cabal of Democratic pedophiles.

“Trump says he will release the Epstein client list if elected,” the right-wing propagandist account Libs of TikTok wrote in September of 2024. “The Democrat elites are shaking rn.”

Well, a year later, someone is certainly shaking.

On Wednesday, congressional lawmakers released thousands of emails from the Epstein estate. House Democrats highlighted three, including one in which Epstein told Maxwell that one of the women who accused him of abuse had “spent hours at my house” with Trump. “Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,” Epstein wrote in 2019 to the journalist Michael Wolff. In another email exchange between them, from 2015, Epstein was trying to game out how Trump might respond if asked by reporters about their relationship. “I think you should let him hang himself,” Wolff advised. Or “you can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt.” (There are yet more Epstein files that the Trump Justice Department is trying to keep under wraps; a House vote on the matter is coming next week.)

Asked whether Trump had spent “hours” at Epstein's home with one of his victims, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt provided an angry word salad that was missing the crucial ingredient: a denial.

Trump is now calling the whole thing a “hoax,” his favorite term to communicate to his supporters that they should ignore any evidence of potential Trump wrongdoing. But he's been trying to hush his supporters up on Epstein for a while. In July, Trump posted a screed on Truth Social insisting that people should not “waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about.” A few days later, The Wall Street Journal reported on the existence of a signed birthday note for Epstein allegedly from Trump, which included Trump's familiar signature below an outline of a naked female figure. Trump sued the Journal over the article, and right-wing media got the message: no more Epstein talk.

The Fox News host Jesse Watters went from accusing Democrats of “running interference for a dead pedophile” to claiming that Democrats' calls to release the Epstein files were “just another political attack.” The right-wing podcaster Michael Knowles said in September that the “vast majority of” Epstein victims were “just hookers threatening to reveal the names of their johns.” As Matt Gertz wrote in July, mentions of Epstein on Fox News dwindled following Trump's demand.

Explaining what happened here is relatively easy. As long as conservatives believed that the Epstein files would provide a pretext for persecuting “Democrat elites,” it was politically advantageous to speculate about who might be implicated or suggest that those people had Epstein killed. As soon as it became clear that Trump himself was in said files, all those right-wing media influencers, who had promised their audience a lib bloodbath, began to drop or downplay the issue. The DOJ's attempt to block the release of more files does not necessarily mean they contain a smoking gun or other damaging information; although Trump has an almost supernatural lack of shame, his overdeveloped sense of pride often motivates irrational and odd behavior. Nevertheless, what we already know about Trump's relationship with Epstein is disturbing.

When the emails were released on Wednesday, the former Fox News host Megyn Kelly insisted on some curious distinctions, saying about Epstein on her podcast, “I'm definitely not trying to make an excuse for this. I'm just giving you facts, that he wasn't into, like, 8-year-olds. But he liked the very young teen types that could pass for even younger than they were, but would look legal to a passerby.” Well, as long as we're not making excuses!

The flip on Epstein reflects a consistent pattern. Some on the right have exploited the fear of and fascination with lurid sex crimes as a convenient pretext for persecuting LGBTQ people. For the past few years, some right-wing activists and politicians have relentlessly accused gay and trans people of “grooming” children. That word usually refers to predators manipulating vulnerable victims in an attempt to abuse them, but in this context it's applied to people telling kids it's okay to be gay or trans. Fears of such “grooming” have been used as a justification to push for discriminatory laws, ban art or literature featuring LGBTQ themes or by LGBTQ artists, and deny gender-affirming medical care to those who need it.

Conservatives did this even as they supported a candidate for president who was not only caught on audio bragging about sexual assault, but who was found liable for sexual abuse in a court of law, and who then proceeded to appoint Cabinet officials who were credibly accused of sexual assault or of covering it up. No one in the Trump administration has talked seriously about how America might reduce or prevent sexual violence through public policy—if anything, the government is pushing policies that would make it easier to get away with abuse or harassment, such as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's promise to the military that there will be “no more frivolous complaints, no more anonymous complaints, no more repeat complaints, no more smearing reputations.” One could argue, as a matter of opinion, that the #MeToo movement was overzealous; but as a factual matter it did not spare prominent Democrats and was concerned with preventing sexual assault and harassment across lines of party and ideology.

By contrast, the moment that documentation emerged of Trump's associations with Epstein, his defenders started drawing fine distinctions between different kinds of child sexual abuse, just in case. As long as sex crimes might justify rumormongering about a political rival, or a smear campaign against a marginalized group, right-wing media incessantly promoted conspiracy theories about the issue. But as soon as one of their own became implicated, they conveniently lost interest, or began minimizing Epstein's crimes.

“Remember when we learned that our wealthiest and most powerful people were connected to a guy who ran a literal child sex trafficking ring?” future Vice President J. D. Vance posted on Twitter in 2021. “And then that guy died mysteriously in a jail? And now we just don't talk about it.”

Well. Now I guess we know why.

Is the actress really having the worst week ever? Why does everyone care?

When regular people talk about a celebrity having “literally the worst week ever,” it's never actually the worst week a person could ever have. What they mean is that a famous person is dealing with famous-people problems that regular people never deal with, combined with attention that civilians will never endure.

That in mind: For a celebrity, Sydney Sweeney is having literally the worst week ever.

Sweeney, the star of HBO's Euphoria and The White Lotus and the big screen rom-com Anyone But You, bombed at the box office; her new movie Christy, a middling biopic about boxer Christy Martin, barely made $1 million in its opening weekend. That's awful. For some perspective, the 2020 re-release of The Nightmare Before Christmas (a movie that was about as old as Sydney Sweeney at the time) made $1.3 million when Disney brought it back to theaters — about the same money that Sweeney's movie made.

Rubbing salt in the wound, on social media a journalist posted a query they received from Sweeney and the movie's PR team, urging them to change the narrative of a box office bomb because the movie has a high “popcornmeter rating” (an audience feature on Rotten Tomatoes).

Sweeney's box office bust coincided with an evasive GQ interview about her infamous American Eagle jeans ad from earlier this year. The ad featured wordplay, smirking at the idea that Sweeney has good genes while also possessing good jeans. Sweeney's ad and the backlash it spurred got so much attention that President Donald Trump weighed in, praising the ad and Sweeney. Asked if she understood the optics of a white person with blonde hair and blue eyes implying genetic superiority, Sweeney gave a non-answer: “I think that when I have an issue that I want to speak about, people will hear.”

Celebrities and concerned members of the public have been calling out Sweeney's interview for its lack of clarity and its implications, mainly that Sweeney seems to be winking and nodding at, if not cosigning, racist ideas and white supremacy.

On top of this, there are reports this week that Zendaya, arguably the most famous celebrity in Sweeney's proximity, is refusing to do press with Sweeney to promote their show Euphoria because of Sweeney's politics.

Together, it's all being billed as the worst seven days in Sydney Sweeney's existence. But it's hard to really believe this is the worst week of Sydney Sweeney's life — mainly because we're still talking about her. It'd be worse for Sweeney, or any famous person, to fade away into obscurity.

That's easier said than done, because Sydney Sweeney, and the team behind Sydney Sweeney, has put in so much work to make sure that never happens. It's perhaps her most valuable skill as an actress, maybe even more valuable than her acting.

For so many celebrities today, media attention is currency. For a lot of them, attention can be more valuable than a good TV show or a well-regarded indie movie. There are even actors and actresses whose acting careers feel a bit like loss leaders, in the sense that their personal brands are more lucrative and successful than any acting project they could be in. Sweeney is no exception.

Sweeney herself told the Hollywood Reporter in 2022 that to court a generation raised on the internet, she needed to think about exposure beyond TV and movies. “If I just acted, I wouldn't be able to afford my life in LA. I take deals because I have to.”

Jessica Goodman, a novelist whose book is in the process of being adapted into an HBO series starring Sweeney, told THR: “When we met, it was immediately obvious to me that Sydney was very savvy, that she was very self-aware about the way she is viewed in the world and that she wanted to take charge of her own career.”

Sweeney's ability to parlay public interest in Sydney Sweeney into interest in her projects has often worked out for her.

Back in 2023, during the production and promotion of Anyone But You, she and co-star Glen Powell created an are-they-or-aren't-they showmance through social media, public appearances together, and photographs from the set. Both were dating other people at the time; Sweeney was engaged to her then-fiancé Jonathan Davino. Neither would confirm if they were dating, an ambiguity that only threw gasoline on the fire and helped make the movie a box office success.

In the context of Sweeney's business moves and how she manages her self-image, her American Eagle jeans ad certainly feels like another extracurricular aimed at keeping our attention. It doesn't seem to matter if that attention is scandalous, if not caustic. That ad followed a stunt this summer in which Sweeney collaborated with men's grooming brand Dr. Squatch to sell a bar of soap “infused” with Sweeney's bathwater. Sweeney's bathwater soap debuted to a chorus of horny awooga awoogas among the various straight guy pockets of the internet, along with eye-rolls and various iterations of “gross” elsewhere. Sweeney later blamed women for the backlash to her selling her bathwater soap to men.

Given how much attention is paid to culture wars, it's not totally unexpected that Sweeney has now created an is-she-or-isn't-she narrative surrounding her politics. The parties she attends and whom she's photographed with all feel like Easter eggs. Sweeney has provided more than enough evidence (she is reportedly a registered Republican and attended a MAGA-themed birthday party for one of her relatives in 2023) about where she stands. Yet it's a testament to how Sweeney has gamed everyone's interest that every interview, including this past week's viral GQ one, aims to clarify Sweeney's politics.

That question mark keeps her relevant in a way that actors who are openly conservative are not. Those actors and actresses (see: Zachary Levi, Gina Carano, etc.) polarize audiences and tend to be seen by studios as liabilities. (For example, Levi recently implied that Broadway star Gavin Creel — who died in September at 48 from an aggressive form of cancer — died from the Covid-19 vaccine). By contrast, Sweeney's semi-plausible deniability keeps that window of opportunity cracked open.

She'd also be disproportionately less captivating, much less so than some of her peers, if she were a staunch Democrat. If Sweeney were a Democrat in an industry full of Democrats, her celebrity image wouldn't be as intriguing or as edgy as it is now. There would be no viral interviews and no public guessing game about whom and what she supports.

The most pertinent question about Sydney Sweeney isn't what her definitive politics are, or why she's selling bathwater, or how she's in movies that no one watches. Rather, it's why so many people care so much about Sydney Sweeney's politics, bathwater, or her success. They do, so all of it — even her worst week ever — feels like it's part of the design.

The current media landscape isn't offering much hope for the next Carrie Bradshaw.

Though it's still early in its first season, I Love LA is already being compared to previous character-driven sitcoms about aimless young people in big cities, namely Girls — only there's an element of that show that's noticeably missing from this new one.

I Love LA follows aspiring talent manager Maia (Rachel Sennott) and her tight-knit group of friends, including her formerly estranged, influencer bestie Tallulah (Odessa A'zion), whom she represents as a client. Right off the bat, it's clear the show wants to establish the sort of relatable, “which one are you?” type of TV ensemble. However, their personalities, aside from Maia's straight-man boyfriend, aren't all that distinguishable. Maia, in particular, is an oddly nonspecific protagonist whose voice resembles Twitter more than an actual person. Everyone speaks in the same dry, “cool-girl” tone. Maybe this is an accurate depiction of Gen-Z Angelenos nowadays, but it doesn't really work for a show that's aiming to make you invested in its characters.

This could very well change as the season progresses. Still, sitting through I Love LA brings to mind a larger question: Are we in a TV character drought? Will we ever have someone as iconic and knowable as Carrie Bradshaw or Don Draper on our screens again?

It's been declared ad nauseam that TV is in its “mid” era, post-Succession. The explosion of streaming has wrought countless shows that are perfectly adequate or plainly bad. It isn't just the streaming that has made TV protagonists less of a fixture in pop culture, though. If TV characters seem less relevant now, it might be that the confluence of reality TV and social media have allowed ordinary people to replace these imagined figures.

To be clear, the sort of TV character that you can easily reference in conversations and dress up as for Halloween isn't totally obsolete. The Roys from Succession, Carmy from FX's The Bear and, more recently, Dr. Robbie on HBOMax's The Pitt, come to mind — although, the latter example is still maybe more of a niche, social-media obsession. ABC's Abbott Elementary, one of the last remaining network shows that it feels like everyone is watching, has an ensemble with distinct characters who have really seeped into viewers' households.

Even then, it might be unfair to compare these few contemporary examples to the influence of “Golden Age” antiheroes like Bradshaw, Mad Men's Don Draper, The Sopranos' Tony Soprano, Breaking Bad's Walter White, and the titular Fleabag. According to Vulture critic Kathryn VanArendonk, it took a few seasons for these now-legendary names to “harden into our collective cultural consciousness.” They've also managed to claim real estate in our minds due to our current nostalgia-driven culture.

Still, it's hard to ignore that TV is increasingly being made in a way that allows viewers to be less invested in what's happening on-screen, let alone be required to pay attention to the quirks and nuances of a particular character — if there are any.

Take the critically panned, Kim Kardashian-starred Hulu show All's Fair. The characters mostly function to flaunt designer outfits and deliver ridiculously vulgar dialogue that will presumably warrant viral screenshots and clips on TikTok.

It epitomizes a particularly vapid, spare form of TV writing that's becoming more common, as TV is being referred to and oftentimes feels like a casual, background viewing experience. During the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, writer and producer Justine Bateman, who served as AI consultant for the union's negotiating committee, told the Hollywood Reporter that multiple showrunners had complained about networks telling them their writing wasn't “second screen enough.” In a Guardian piece from January, Netflix showrunners, who weren't explicitly instructed to dumb down their writing, discussed the inevitability that the average TV viewer is probably also looking at their phones. This state of affairs hardly inspires vivid character-building.

The competition between TV screens and phones has fed into a growing suspicion that some TV writers have instead become hyperfocused on writing quips and shocking dialogue for the sake of being memed and clipped. Many writers have denied this incentive. But it's hard not to feel this expectation for virality watching something like All's Fair, where Sarah Paulson calls people “c—burgers” and says things like “greedy little pig bottom.”

Even shows with a goal to really engage and stimulate viewers in a more traditional sense are hindered by shorter seasons and inconsistent schedules. In its first season, the HBO teen drama Euphoria established itself as an explicitly character-driven show, with each episode dedicated to the backstory of one of the show's dysfunctional teens. Since 2019, though, the series has only aired two eight-episode seasons. Apple TV's Severance is another “appointment TV” series whose storytelling viewers seem especially gripped by. Still, fans have had relatively little of the show to actually consume since it premiered in 2022.

The past few years have also witnessed an increasingly popular approach to TV characters that's less in-the-moment and propulsive, which VanArendonk sees as a feature of older episodic TV writing. Instead of focusing on plot, the writers are constantly gesturing at characters' pasts. Many critics have argued that this sort of reverse character development inhibits a lot of initially promising TV shows, notably The Bear, which has been scrutinized in its later seasons for relying too heavily on backstory and flashbacks. VanArendonk argues that characters are more engaging and impressionable when we consume them through their active choices.

“I do want to know things about [a character's] past,” VanArendonk says. “But just tell me who they are right now and what they are doing today, and what they care about and what their weird quirks are. I promise you that giving me a huge chunk of clues about how they became the person that they are is actually a less important and less effective way of making them feel like a real person.”

If there are names in TV that are constantly referenced and familiarized with in our popular consciousness, they seem to come from real life. Reality shows like the Real Housewives franchise, The Kardashians, Love Island, Selling Sunset, and more recently The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives, have been extremely successful in creating household names and recognizable archetypes that stick around for years.

These shows benefit from having longer seasons than many prestige, scripted shows nowadays. But these personalities also remain relevant thanks to years-long tabloid coverage and the stars' own social-media activity. The past few years have also seen an uptick in spin-off series like The Traitors and Love Island Games that re-cast already familiar reality stars. Even network staples like The Bachelorette, which recently made Mormon Wives star Taylor Frankie Paul its latest titular star, are constantly reinforcing the presence of these personalities in our media consumption now.

“The surge in reality-TV popularity is unmistakable, and it has taken over social media conversation in the way that Mad Men used to,” says Salon's Coleman Spilde. “People are watching Love Island and Severance the same way. And then there's just the basic truth that a lot of people would rather spend their time on TikTok than watch narrative television or are only interested in narrative television if an influencer or TikTok star is in it.”

As Spilde suggests, reality TV isn't the only avenue where the average individual is eclipsing fictional characters in our attention economy. From influencers to podcasters — and influencers with podcasts — to bonafide celebrities caught up in legal scandals, we're becoming more parasocial in the way we spectate. Social-media personalities, compared to characters confined to fictional settings, are constantly delivering intimate content on a frequent basis. The interactive function of social media also allows us to participate and even alter the storylines and drama we watch unfold online. Real Housewives, for example, has become increasingly centered around online gossip and backlash from viewers.

Even the average person who doesn't identify as an influencer has the ability to become the main character of the week or month in our current surveillance culture — the latest example being the Astronomer CEO who was caught cheating with his head of HR on the Jumbotron at a Coldplay concert earlier this year.

This interest in online personalities is bleeding back into television, as more familiar faces from the internet are attempting to revive the medium with varying results. Of course, the comedian/influencer-to-TV-star pipeline isn't new. But it's become a reliable formula that doesn't feel innovative or even fruitful at this point. This year alone has seen Overcompensating starring internet comedian Benito Skinner; Adults, featuring podcaster Owen Thiele; the Meg Stalter comedy Too Much; and the aforementioned I Love LA. (The most dire example in the category is pretty firmly All's Fair.) Additionally, it was just announced that the viral internet comedian and Therapuss podcaster Jake Shane is working on a scripted comedy based on his life.

Who knows whether these shows will be capable of producing memorable, era-defining characters further down the line? Right now, though, this trend feels less experimental and more representative of a lack of imagination and general distrust in audiences to become absorbed in the unfamiliar. In the case of a show like I Love LA, for instance, a familiar face isn't nearly as exciting as discovering a fresh, enigmatic character week after week.

﻿Millions of Americans will soon go without insurance. We spoke with some of them.

Unless Congress acts in the next month, up to 4 million Americans are expected to become uninsured, because they can no longer afford their health insurance premiums.

While Congress has finally reached a deal to end the longest government shutdown on record, during which Democrats pressed Republicans to lower people's health insurance costs, Democrats relented without a compromise that would avert the country's imminent health care policy catastrophe. The two sides now need to agree on a deal to prevent the millions of Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces from facing an average 30 percent premium hike next year.

If lawmakers don't act, health insurance premiums are poised to climb to five or six times what some policyholders paid just last year.

More than 20 million people buy insurance on the marketplaces, and now, many are experiencing sticker shock as they realize their insurance options are much more expensive or that they have lost all of their assistance and are completely priced out of medical coverage.

Democrats have forced Republicans to agree to a vote on restoring people's health insurance subsidies by mid-December as a condition of ending the shutdown. Bipartisan negotiations are happening in the House and Senate to figure out a deal to reauthorize the subsidies and bring down costs.

But lawmakers are running out of time; open enrollment for coverage ends on December 15. To understand the human stakes of these policy negotiations, I spoke with four people who are facing significant ACA premium hikes and are now considering going uninsured.

Hussein Cabrera, 45, is, ironically enough, an IT contractor for a health insurance company in South Carolina, but because he's not technically a full-time employee, he doesn't receive coverage through his work.

He, his wife, and their daughter have gotten insurance through the ACA for the past few years. Last year, the family paid $53 for a plan that covered Cabrera's wife, who has an autoimmune disease, while he and his daughter were on a separate, even cheaper plan.

But when he logged onto HealthCare.gov this year, he couldn't believe it: His wife's plan now costs $285 per month.

“I stopped right there. I didn't even look for my policy,” he told me. He knew they would struggle to afford her plan alone. Instead, his first stop was the internet. He researched the feasibility of cost-sharing ministries, which he ultimately decided were a bad deal, and crowdsourced other solutions on Reddit, where he posted his dilemma in r/healthinsurance, a subreddit forum. There, he encountered dozens of similar posts from people trying to figure out alternative ways to pay for medical bills or who took the chance on going uninsured.

Cabrera is now contemplating a previously unthinkable choice: To keep his wife's ACA plan, ensure her access to her doctors and medicines, but let coverage lapse for him and his daughter. The family can no longer afford a second plan for them now that his wife's coverage is five times as costly as it was in 2025.

Cabrera knows the risks he's courting, but, he told me, he just doesn't feel like he has a choice.

“If I cannot get insurance, or if either of us, we're gonna go back to the old way of doing things. We're gonna have to go to the emergency room for stupid shit,” Cabrera said.

When I spoke to Cabrera, he expected to go uninsured, along with his daughter, but he won't make a final decision until next month. Until then, Cabrera is planning to schedule a bunch of appointments and refill his prescriptions before the end of the year, which is when his current coverage runs out.

What's the plan after that? “Pray and see what happens,” he said.

Ian is 36; living in San Antonio, Texas; and working part-time while also helping take care of his parents, who have serious medical conditions. He has been enrolled in the ACA for most of the past decade, because his employment has been temporary or contractual — working multiple jobs at any given time — including at a local grocery chain and in community relations for the NBA's San Antonio Spurs, which he told me he just wrapped up.

Last year, he said, he was able to sign up for a health insurance plan that cost him less than $100 per month and had no deductible. But when he checked on next year's prices, the cheapest plan he could find was $282 per month and came with a $10,000 deductible.

“Do I really need health insurance at this point?” he said when we spoke by phone recently.

But he does need it. Ian told me that he has had asthma for most of his life and, while he's generally kept it under control, a recent Covid-19 infection has made the condition a daily struggle. He needs medical attention. For each inhaler, Ian might pay $50 or more without insurance — but without an inhaler, his symptoms could get worse and cause permanent damage to his lungs. He coughs several times while we are on the phone.

I asked Ian whether he'll sign up for health insurance on the marketplace, as he has in the past, or if he'll go without. “At this point, I'm 50-50, to be honest,” Ian told me.

Texas, his home state, has the highest uninsured rate in the country, and, in an ironic twist, this might work in his favor if he decides to join the ranks. Because so many people don't have health insurance, the state's health care providers strive to provide access to some basic services at a lower cost. He's contemplating whether to use discount drug sites like GoodRx for albuterol, his asthma medication; the local hospital system in San Antonio also has a discount patient price program.

But all of his options now are suboptimal. “Health care needs to be fixed,” he said.

Samuel, 47, was a long-time government contractor who had access to good health insurance — about $300 a month for a plan with a low, $450 deductible — through his work before he decided to start his own business in the past year.

But after he went out on his own, it was much harder to find an affordable option. When he logged onto the ACA marketplaces last year, Samuel — who asked me to only use his first name for privacy while sharing personal financial details — signed up for a plan that cost $480 per month with a $7,500 deductible. It wasn't great, but it was doable.

This month, Samuel logged onto the ACA marketplaces, and the only plans that covered the doctors and hospitals in his local area were both more expensive — now up to $580 per month — and with worse benefits. The deductible would be $8,500.

Samuel is a single guy with no serious health problems; he's considering whether he could risk going uninsured. But the current moment is forcing people like him to consider some ghoulish scenarios. He reviewed some of the detailed benefits documents for next year's plans, and he said that, even if he ended up in a car accident, he might not hit his new deductible and end up paying the whole bill out of pocket anyway.

But at the same time, he worries about hospitals being unwilling to treat him if he's uninsured. (Federal law requires hospitals to care for someone in an emergency, but anecdotal reports of hospitals refusing to follow that rule are not hard to find.)

“I don't trust the hospital,” he told me. “Most likely, the way I'm looking at it now, because a hospital could potentially deny me service for not having health insurance, that basically forces my hand.”

It's another impossible dilemma foisted upon him by the US health system. For now, he's planning to pick up extra work to cover the cost of his health insurance plan. But he's hoping Congress will act and bring plan costs down before the open-enrollment window closes.

When I called Steven, a retiree in his late 50s who lives in New Jersey, he was waiting on an HVAC worker to come and fix his furnace. It had died last week, and, with colder weather on the way, the water pipes were going to freeze soon. “Health care is only part of my aggravation,” he told me.

Up until last year, his family of three was covered by his wife's insurance, provided by the large corporation for which she worked. It was $500 a month with a low deductible. But then, the company shut down her division, she decided to retire, and the couple and their son enrolled in the same plan on the state's ACA marketplaces.

They couldn't get such a great deal, but they found something usable: about $1,000 per month — pricey, but they were able to keep all of their doctors, who were in network. Their deductible was about $4,600.

But next year, their current plan would cost $2,700 every month to keep, and their deductible would be higher — up to $5,300. They could consider dropping their college-aged son off the plan, but he would struggle to afford health insurance on his own, and it would only save his parents $300 a month.

Steven says he feels trapped. Given their age, he and his wife don't feel they can afford to go without insurance. But they're now going to have to pull money out of their retirement accounts to cover the cost of their health plan.

“We cannot wing it and not have health insurance,” Steven said. “I'm spending a lot of money that I really do not have on health care.”

He's done the math. If he kept his same plan, paid all of the premiums, and paid the maximum out-of-pocket costs, he could spend $50,000 on health care out of pocket — even with a health insurance plan.

“It kinda seems like the two political parties want to be right and not care about people,” he told me.

If you don't want a synthesized AI voice outliving you, get a lawyer now.

Before Franz Kafka died in 1924, he had a simple wish for his friend and literary executor Max Brod: burn all of Kafka's unpublished writing and papers.

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

Fortunately for the rest of the world, Brod largely ignored what Kafka had said, which is why today we have works like The Castle and The Trial, not to mention the word “Kafkaesque.” But Kafka's story does raise the question of what rights artists, musicians, writers, and celebrities more generally should have over their work once they die. And those questions are going to be more important in the age of AI, when it's not just someone's work that could live on after them, but their actual voice.

The AI audio startup ElevenLabs, which generates amazingly realistic synthetic speech, just rolled out an “Iconic Voices” marketplace that lets companies legally license AI versions of well-known voices — some living, many deceased — for ads and other content.

On the living side, the actors Matthew McConaughey and Michael Caine have both signed on. McConaughey — an investor in the company — plans to use his synthetic voice to translate his “Lyrics of Livin'” newsletter into Spanish, which shows how the technology can be used to localize content across the world. (Muy bien, muy bien, muy bien, as Spanish AI McConaughey might put it.) Caine, one of the most celebrated actors in England, is joining the marketplace as a marquee voice and has argued that the move should be seen as amplifying human storytellers, not replacing them.

As weird as it is to imagine an AI speaking with Caine's inimitable Cockney accent — and frankly, no AI can do Caine better than these two guys in The Trip — at least he made the active choice while alive to sign it away. But ElevenLabs has also struck estate deals that let users hear narration in the voices of historical figures, like Judy Garland, James Dean, Maya Angelou, and AI pioneer Alan Turing. (That's right, the genius who once said that if computers became smarter than humans, “we should, as a species, feel greatly humbled,” will now be lending his posthumous voice to the machines.)

This is a long way from projecting a holographic Tupac Shakur for a “duet” with Snoop Dogg at Coachella in 2012. We're generating new readings in the vocal style of someone who can't consent today.

The incentives are obvious. Synthetic voices are cheaper than staging a hologram tour and more scalable than booking an A-list narrator. With a modest archive, you can generate hours of multilingual audio that sounds plausibly like the original. In the company's defense, ElevenLabs says its marketplace routes everything through deceased figures' rights holders to address ethics and misuse concerns. That means heirs get paid, and it's better than a deepfake AI-for-all, but the core fact remains: Once a voice is an asset, the estate becomes a product manager for a digital ghost.

This is where the Kafka lesson comes in. If you're a famous person who wants control over posthumous AI content based on yourself — or really anyone who works in creative fields — get an estate lawyer to write those demands down now. Do you permit the creation of a synthetic voice after death? If so, for what? Are archival restorations and documentaries okay, but not ads, political content, or interactive chatbots? Who holds the kill switch: a literary executor, a family council, an independent trustee? If you don't want your AI voice talking on ChatGPT 55.7 in 2060, don't leave that decision to a board meeting taking place well after you've ended up on the Oscars “In Memoriam” segment.

Kafka's fame is a standing argument that, sometimes, betraying an artist's last wish serves the world. But if you, famous person, absolutely don't want to leave the fate of your voice to chance, learn from the example of British fantasy novelist Terry Pratchett. Per his very specific wishes, a hard drive containing his unfinished books was ceremoniously flattened by a steamroller in 2017. Try reconstructing that.

Remember when Reels was dismissed as Meta's attempt to clone TikTok?

Well, now the five-year-old app is on track to generate $50 billion a year. It's turned into a huge win for Meta, and it has become one of the biggest ""creator economy"" businesses in the world.

But that number also makes something else clear: The creator economy's biggest winners aren't creators. It's the platforms that depend on them.

That's because almost every one of those platforms depends on the labor of creators — a shorter way of describing ""people who make and/or own content"" — but shares very little of the revenue those creators' stuff generates.

The one major exception is Google's YouTube, which is also a $50 billion business, and which, until recently, shared about half of all the money its videos made with the people who made the videos. Everyone else —Meta, TikTok, Snap — offers a different deal, which goes like this: Give us your stuff, for free. Maybe we'll give a small subset of you some kind of bonus from a ""creator program"" or something like that. But for the most part, we'll make money selling ads against your stuff on our platform — and you'll have to find another way to make money. You're welcome!

This is not news to people in and around the creator economy (again: you could just say ""media business""). But Meta's boast about its success — made by Mark Zuckerberg last month, during his Q3 earnings call — puts it in sharp relief.

It's hard to build a $50 billion a year business doing anything, anywhere. But a $50 billion business built on other people's content that you get more or less for free? That's pretty special.

Even better for Meta and its peers: There's no sense that any of this is going to change. Every so often, someone will tell me about their plan to make it happen: They'll convince a bunch of content creators to take their stuff off the non-sharing platforms unless they get a better deal. It never happens.

And Meta and its peers have a pretty good argument for why that doesn't happen, though they generally don't say this out loud (I've asked Meta for comment). It's that their massive platforms offer creators the promise of exposure, which they can parlay into businesses they can build on their own.

Sure, maybe Meta isn't going to give you a meaningful cut of the money it makes selling ads against your videos. But someone else may pay you a bunch of money to feature their product in one of your videos. Win, win. And if you don't like it, go find another huge platform that gives you a better deal. Good luck.

Again, there is one place to get a better deal, which is YouTube. The world's biggest video site kicked off the creator economy way back in 2007, when it launched its ""partner program,"" which still exists today. That one gives (most) big YouTube video-makers 55% of any ad dollars attached to their videos. And while YouTube creators have spent years complaining about that split, it's still the best deal in town.

Why haven't other platforms tried to do the same thing? I ask them all the time. Sometimes they'll mention that it's difficult to figure out how to share revenue for videos you swipe past in a vertical feed. But the real answer is that they've found they don't have to — why pay for something you can get for free? The margins are way better.

Even YouTube, the one platform that built real economics for creators, is backing away a bit. Shorts — its TikTok clone — gives creators a smaller cut, and ties payouts to a shared pool of ad money, not their actual videos. The message is clear: Even the platform that started out sharing the pie would like to keep more of it.

Why not? It works for Meta, and everyone else.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Sonder employees describe chaos after Marriott breakup: Confusion, crying guests, and no severance","https://www.businessinsider.com/sonder-workers-chaos-no-severance-marriott-breakup-bankruptcy-employees-staff-2025-11","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 14:45:00 GMT","

Lianna Frausto, who worked as a sales coordinator for Sonder in San Antonio, said she woke up Sunday morning to a whirlwind of confusion.

After the news broke that Marriott had terminated its licensing agreement with Sonder, a short-term apartment rental company, she spent the day reaching out to other employees and trying to figure out what it would mean for their jobs.

""I can't believe how many people I had to hear it from before I got it from the horse's mouth,"" she told Business Insider.

Frausto received an email from the company on Sunday evening that said Sonder was ceasing operations, but she said she still wasn't sure if that meant she was immediately out of a job. ""Nobody told us that we were fired until the next day,"" she said.

Business Insider spoke to four Sonder employees who described how they coped as they dealt with spotty communication and upset guests, all while confronting an uncertain future.

""My employees looked to me for answers, and I didn't know what was going on because I hadn't been told anything,"" a manager at a Sonder hotel in New York, who learned of the situation from a crying guest, said.

As Business Insider has reported, the breakup between the company and Marriott also caused mayhem for guests who were told they needed to leave by 9 a.m. on Monday and that existing reservations would not be honored.

Sonder managed 140 Marriott-licensed properties and about 7,700 apartments as of September, according to Marriott's latest earnings report. On Monday, Sonder announced it was filing for bankruptcy protection and ceasing operations. The company had 1,421 employees as of the end of 2024.

Francis Davidson, the cofounder and former CEO of Sonder, told Business Insider on Thursday he was stunned by the company's downfall. Davidson stepped down earlier this year after Sonder completed its integration with Marriott. ""We all felt good about the positive momentum we were seeing in June when I left,"" he said, ""and so to then see that the business has now run into a brick wall, it's just shocking to me.""

Neither Sonder nor Marriott responded to a request for comment.

The New York manager said everything at work was normal on Sunday morning until the guest appeared at 11:30 a.m. and said she'd received a phone notification from Marriott that the company was no longer affiliated with Sonder and that her reservation had been canceled.

More started to show up at the desk looking for answers, but the employees didn't have any. As of Sunday night, staff had not been officially told they were being let go, the manager said.

Employees showed up for work on Monday to help guests depart by the 9 a.m. deadline, even though, at that point, ""we all knew we didn't have jobs the next day,"" the manager said.

Logan Ford, a manager of a group sales team at Sonder, said the confusion continued Monday with mixed messages about whether that would be his last day or if he might be asked to stay until Thursday to help close things out with clients.

""Monday, I sat there and waited to hear anything from the senior leadership team, but it was just dead air. Silence,"" Ford said.

A Sonder employee who worked in customer support said employees who believed they were all going to be laid off started saying their goodbyes on Slack.

Confirmation came in the form of a termination notice email on Monday shortly before 5 p.m.

It said they would be paid through November 10 and that their healthcare would remain in place until the end of the month. Employees were told to return their laptops, phones, and other company property.

""The Company's severance policy has been discretionary and, given the Company's financial circumstances at this time, the Company is not in a position to offer terminating employees severance pay,"" the memo, which was signed by interim CEO Janice Sears, said.

Soon after, the employees said, their accounts were shut down and their laptop access was cut.

Ethan Werchniak, a guest at a Sonder hotel in Montreal, told Business Insider that he learned he had to vacate the property on Monday morning because an employee knocked on his door to say his reservation had been canceled.

Werchniak said the employee told him, ""I'm very sorry to be very blunt with you, I'm losing my job right now. My last task is to tell people that they need to leave.""

""I'm like, OK, this guy's probably having a worse day than I am,"" Werchniak said. ""So I don't tear him a new one.""

Nvidia is navigating some growing pains as its enterprise software sales team onboards massive clients in highly regulated industries.

Nvidia has been hitting astronomic highs amid the AI boom and even became the first $5 trillion market cap company last month.

At the same time, internal emails sent this summer by senior sales employees in its Worldwide Field Operations — which works with customers to deploy its technology — reveal it's contending with some hurdles as it tries to tell clients a ""comprehensive software story"" and sell those products alongside its highly sought-after AI hardware.

""Everyone is hacking their own decks together and we need to come up with one company message,"" one of the emails said.

The emails refer to sales of Nvidia AI Enterprise (NVAIE) and other software products, including Run:ai, which helps companies manage GPUs; Omniverse, a platform for simulating 3D worlds; and vGPU, which enables multiple workers to share GPUs.

Nvidia AI Enterprise is a suite of tools that helps clients make their own AI apps. It was launched in 2021 and designed to run with Nvidia's AI chips and CUDA, a Nvidia software package that allows the chips to handle a wide range of computing tasks. NVAIE's customer list includes Nasdaq, the IRS, and AT&T.

These internal discussions focus on the sale of those Nvidia business software products — not CUDA.

Nvidia declined to comment.

Nvidia specializes in designing GPUs and other AI hardware, which is the company's main business, and it doesn't break out revenues for business software in earnings reports.

While software is a smaller part of its business, it helps the company generate recurring revenue for a wider range of AI products across both hardware and software and deepen customer dependence.

Despite some hiccups, Nvidia is forecasting healthy software sales.

One internal email, sent in July, features a sales chart for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 in North and Latin America that shows stand-alone software is projected to hit 110% of sales targets. Software sold alongside hardware was expected to reach only 39% of its goal.

Overall, software sales forecasts were $78.7 million for the quarter, driven by NVAIE, which was forecast to hit 186% of the target.

The July email states Nvidia's sales partners and account managers need to develop a ""comprehensive software story"" around NVAIE and other software products. It mentions plans to create a workshop for customers to use NVAIE and other product libraries to plan potential AI ventures.

An email in August detailed the need for additional education — both internally and when negotiating with clients.

""Biggest pain point will be educating [a prospective client's] procurement and legal teams on what our AI Enterprise software is/isn't,"" the August email reads.

That email also says there is a ""fundamental disconnect"" between Nvidia and clients' legal and procurement teams in understanding Nvidia's software sales processes during negotiations — ""particularly within highly regulated industries,"" such as finance and healthcare.

Data security and indemnity obligations, which are Nvidia's legal responsibility in the event that a client is sued, were other sticking points in negotiations, according to the August email.

Other concerns included requesting higher damages caps — the maximum amount that Nvidia would have to pay if something goes wrong — than Nvidia is comfortable with.

Nvidia is far from alone in contending with uneven AI adoption, as some companies view the white-hot technology as too early to deploy widely, according to a recent Goldman Sachs report.

The demise of a key consumer protection agency could push relief for student-loan borrowers further out of reach.

Attorneys for Russell Vought, acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, wrote in a legal filing on November 10 that the administration ""anticipates exhausting"" the CFPB's available funds in early 2026, meaning that after that point, the agency created in 2011 to protect Americans from another financial crisis will be defunct.

Vought wrote in a memo that the CFPB's funding structure, which relies on money from the Federal Reserve, is not constitutional, marking the Trump administration's most significant step to date in attempting to shut down the agency. Vought argued that the agency can only draw from the Fed when the central bank is turning a profit, which it has not done in recent years.

Getting rid of the CFPB would remove a level of oversight on financial institutions — and also raises increased risks for student-loan borrowers, John Rao, a senior attorney with the National Consumer Law Center, told Business Insider.

""Earlier administrations have worked closely with the CFPB to ensure that servicers comply with the contracts they have to service student loans, and also to make sure that the laws are carried out as they should,"" Rao said. ""And I don't think any of us have any confidence at this point that that's going to occur.""

Do you have a story to share about student loans? Contact this reporter at asheffey@businessinsider.com.

Since the CFPB was created, it has fined student-loan servicers for misleading borrowers about payments and debt relief, sued major student-loan lenders, and returned millions of dollars to borrowers who the CFPB determined were affected by predatory behavior. It also took on private student debt — the CFPB sued servicer PHEAA in 2024 over accusations that it illegally collected borrowers' private loans that were already discharged through bankruptcy.

The agency's work, however, was halted soon after President Donald Trump took office. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent ordered CFPB employees to cease most of their work in February, and in an April memo, the agency's chief legal officer said that the CFPB will ""deprioritize"" student-loan oversight.

Should the CFPB run out of funding next year, Rao said that oversight of the student-loan industry would likely fall into the hands of the states, and the level of oversight would vary depending on each attorney general's priorities.

""A lot of those offices are strapped for resources,"" Rao said. ""So it would be hard to say that they would be an equal replacement for the CFPB, but that is a possibility, and that's not going to happen in every state.""

The Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that the CFPB's funding is constitutional, siding with the agency over payday lenders who brought the lawsuit. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who helped create the CFPB, said in a statement that Vought's latest move to shut down the CFPB is ""plainly illegal, and federal judges have already rejected his fringe theory. If the courts continue to uphold the law, Vought will fail again.""

With or without the CFPB, student-loan oversight has dwindled this year. The Department of Education has slashed its staff as part of Trump's larger goal to shut down the agency altogether, meaning there are limited resources to ensure student-loan servicers are complying with their contracts and meeting their obligations to borrowers.

Still, the department announced in September that it would develop a new ""common manual"" intended to serve as a centralized place for servicing and debt collection practices, with the idea that consistent guidelines for borrowers and servicers would make it easier for the department to pursue enforcement actions.

Oversight over the industry will become more critical next year; the Trump administration is set to implement its sweeping changes to student-loan repayment plans, which include new borrowing caps on graduate and professional student loans and fewer repayment plan options.

Rao said that, absent the CFPB, servicers will face less pressure from regulators to ensure they're following the law.

""Things could get worse rather than better because there's not effectively a regulator, another regulator saying you need to do this,"" Rao said.

The threat of AI has sent shockwaves through the software sector, hammering share prices and creating, in the words of analysts at RBC Capital Markets, a rare opportunity for ""opportunistic"" buyers.

Once-high-flying software companies are now trading at deep discounts as investors worry about how generative AI could upend SaaS business models. That same anxiety, the analysts argue, is laying the groundwork for a new wave of dealmaking.

According to RBC, software M&A activity has surged 78% this year, with private-equity deal volume more than doubling as sponsors hunt for bargains.

""We continue to see software underperform on concerns around AI and as this underperformance drags on in spite of better-than-expected results, we may see more buyers opportunistically step in and take advantage of dislocations, particularly in private equity,"" the analysts wrote in a recent note to investors.

While noting they have no knowledge of any such deals, the analysts listed potential targets, all of which have solid customer bases and cash flow but limited AI narratives. Private-equity buyers, less constrained by quarterly earnings pressure, could move quickly to take these companies private, reset expectations, and rebuild them for an AI-first world.

While regulatory scrutiny remains a hurdle for mega-cap tech acquirers, financial sponsors are freer to strike. RBC expects deal momentum to accelerate as sentiment stabilizes and valuations remain depressed. For investors, the AI scare that crushed software stocks might soon become the catalyst for a new consolidation boom, one driven not by hype, but by hard-nosed value hunting.

Here's RBC's view on which software companies are potential mergers and acquisitions targets and why:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I left a big paycheck in Tokyo to start over in rural Japan. I didn't just want a new job — I wanted a new life.","https://www.businessinsider.com/left-job-tokyo-start-over-japanese-countryside-surfing-detox-retreats-2025-11","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 00:14:00 GMT","

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Levi Pells, 32, a life coach and retreat leader in Japan. It's been edited for length and clarity.

I spent five years as a recruiter in Tokyo.

From my high-rise apartment in Roppongi, with Tokyo Tower glowing in the distance, I had everything I thought I wanted: a steady paycheck, a girlfriend, and the trappings of success. Yet I felt completely alone.

My achievements were measurable; my happiness wasn't. So I walked away — from Tokyo, and the life I'd built — to start over in the Japanese countryside.

I was born in Texas and raised in Hawaii. As a teenager, I became interested in the Japanese language and culture. I dated a Japanese girl and watched a bunch of movies and TV shows. After a family trip to Japan when I was 20, I was hooked.

After graduating from Boston College, I joined the JET Program, a government initiative that sends foreign graduates to teach English in Japan.

While most wanted to be placed in Tokyo or Kyoto, I requested a location that was remote. They sent me to a mountain village on Shikoku Island. The village had about 670 people, and it took an hour to get to the nearest supermarket.

The village taught me patience and humility. Every interaction required effort; even buying bread was a small victory in broken Japanese. My classes were small, and I joined a local volleyball team composed mostly of people in their 70s.

It was the most connected I'd ever felt.

After two years, someone at a career fair pitched me the dream of recruitment in Tokyo: fast money and faster promotions. I went for it. My second interview landed me a job at a recruitment agency, where I began cold-calling investment bankers at firms like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan.

Within a few years, I was managing a small team and earning more than I ever imagined. I was surrounded by ambition, but also exhaustion. My happiness rose and fell with my quarterly performance.

When my father was diagnosed with late-stage cancer in 2020, I flew back to Hawaii before flights were grounded. I stayed nine months, working remotely and learning to surf with my brother on empty beaches.

For the first time in years, I felt grounded.

When I returned to Japan, I realized that the one thing I was certain of was my desire to surf.

So I left Tokyo for Chiba, a quiet beach town an hour away. I surfed at sunrise, worked remotely, and spent weekends helping local farmers. Covered in dirt and sweat, I felt more fulfilled than I ever had in an office. That's when I realized I didn't just want a new job — I wanted a new life.

I quit recruiting and started my own coaching practice in 2024. This year, I hosted my first digital detox retreat.

Most of my clients are expats in high-pressure jobs — recruiters, consultants, UX designers — who want to disconnect from screens and reconnect with themselves.

Retreat activities I've organized include organic farming, meditation, yoga, sauna sessions, cold plunges, art therapy, and group coaching. Meals and accommodations are included, often in renovated countryside homes near the coast.

In May, four people joined my first retreat — one a former coaching client, the others from LinkedIn. I charged 58,000 yen, about $380, each and barely broke even. But their positive feedback convinced me I was onto something.

Since then, I've run three retreats at two venues, raised the price to 85,000 yen, and now make a profit of about $500 to $600 per session. I pay local partners — the family who hosts meals, a yoga teacher, a sound healer, and a sauna business — about $1,000 per retreat.

In addition to the retreats, I offer one-day farm excursions, priced at $120 for adults and $60 for children, which include lunch at a farmhouse and optional temple walks or visits to hot springs. I also offer life coaching sessions and consulting for recruiters. I even sell peanuts with local farmers — a random but fun side gig.

At my peak as a recruiter, I earned 10 times what I do now, but I also spent far more. With lower costs and a slower pace, even a fraction of that feels like enough. I'm aiming to earn enough to cover my $2,800 monthly living costs.

I now live in a two-story apartment near the ocean with my girlfriend. The view isn't glamorous, but I'm minutes from the surf and surrounded by rice fields.

The community here feels closer than what I had in the city. I cook most meals at home with vegetables from my neighbors and meet friends — both Japanese and foreign — for morning surf sessions, followed by a cup of green tea.

My girlfriend works for the government and is an avid hunter. We spend weekends hiking, foraging, and cooking what we catch. If we ever had kids, I'd want to raise them in Japan, maybe we'd throw in a few years in Hawaii, too.

My life now follows a rhythm that feels honest and alive: far from skyscrapers, deadlines, and performance reviews.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Reformed hacker who made millions stealing identities warns of 3 rising cyber threats — and how to stay safe","https://www.businessinsider.com/former-hacker-stole-millions-3-alarming-rising-cyber-threats-protect-2025-11","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 14:17:00 GMT","

Brett Johnson spent over a decade breaking into systems, stealing identities, and selling stolen credit cards on the dark web. He stole millions of dollars, often making over $100,000 a month through tax-return identity theft.

He's worked with the Secret Service and private companies as a consultant to help stop the kinds of crimes he once perpetrated. He told Business Insider's Carter Thallon in a recent interview that the crime world he helped invent is mutating into something harder to see — and almost impossible to stop.

Cybercrime is becoming increasingly organized, and that's a problem, he said. The next wave of cybercrime will come from entire operations powered by artificial intelligence, where machines write the scams, fake the evidence, and even talk to the victims in real time.

Here are the three rising cyber threats that alarm him most.

Johnson said deepfakes that convincingly mimic real people will become central to online fraud. Criminals already use them to forge voice messages and fake live video calls. Soon, this technology will make it impossible to trust what we see or hear online, Johnson said.

""In order for me to defraud you, I have to get you to trust me,"" he said. However, deepfakes enable criminals to essentially bypass the effort of gaining trust by posing as an already trustworthy person, accelerating the process of victimizing you.

One finance clerk, last year, for example, was conned into approving overseas transfers amounting to more than $25 million, Shubham Agarwal reported for BI. The clerk had been instructed to do so during a video call that turned out to be full of deepfakes recreations of his real coworkers, including the organization's chief financial officer.

""We get to the point where we're no longer able to trust anything that we see or hear in an online environment, and that becomes really dangerous,"" he said.

That threat is compounded by the speed of AI tools, which can mimic speech patterns, create realistic faces, and write messages tailored to a target's personality.

Gone are the days when fraudsters acted alone, Johnson said. Scam farms are becoming the new norm.

Scam farms are buildings packed with workers — who are often trafficked or forced into slave labor — running simultaneous cons.

Some of these operations specialize in ""pig butchering,"" long-term relationship scams that drain victims' savings.

That's exactly what happened to Ahmet Tozal, who recently told BI's Matthew Loh of a relationship he built with a supposed woman online.

Over several weeks, the woman convinced him to invest over a year's worth of his wages into a cryptocurrency that didn't exist. He ultimately had to move from Turkey to Uzbekistan alone to find a higher salary to support his family.

These scam farms are structured businesses, with workers rotating shifts and supervisors overseeing them. ""That's something we didn't see back then,"" Johnson said about the time he was scamming people in the 90s and early 00s.

""Back then, you did see criminals working together, networking in a co-op type fashion. But these days it's much more organized,"" he added.

The same automation fueling deepfakes is driving identity fraud to a new level.

Johnson calls synthetic identity fraud — a blend of real and fake personal data used to create a new digital person — the No. 1 form of identity theft in the world.

It's especially concerning because ""synthetic fraud is almost invisible because that person doesn't really exist,"" he said, adding that ""it's 80% of all new account fraud. It's 20% of all credit card chargebacks, 5% of all credit card debt. It's huge.""

Once a fake identity establishes credit, it can be used to open bank accounts, apply for loans, or facilitate money laundering. Banks often discover the fraud only after the accounts vanish. If synthetic IDs continue to rise, it could make fraud detection exponentially harder.

Fraud is easier to achieve now than ever before. ""A criminal now doesn't have to understand any aspect of the crime. They can immediately buy tutorials, take live instruction classes, buy anything that they need online, and immediately start being successful and profitable at crime,"" Johnson said.

So it's important to know how to protect yourself. Johnson told BI's Manseen Logan earlier this year, six ways to lower your risk of hacking:

When high-powered Democratic attorney Kathryn Ruemmler — now the top lawyer at Goldman Sachs — needed to vent about Donald Trump's rise in politics, she turned to their mutual acquaintance, Jeffrey Epstein.

""Trump is living proof of the adage that it is better to be lucky than smart,"" she told Epstein in an email in August 2015, while planning a visit to his Manhattan mansion.

Later, Ruemmler expressed alarm about Trump's climb in the polls.

""The Trump success is seriously scary,"" she wrote in February 2016.

The two chatted frequently about the 2016 presidential election and transition. (In one email, Ruemmler seemed to criticize Trump's Cabinet picks as ""moronic."") They shared gripes well into Trump's first term, as well as news articles on everything from Trump's approach to Big Tech to the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

""Trump is truly stupid,"" Ruemmler wrote in one 2017 email. ""Trump is so gross,"" she said a few months earlier.

The emails, released by the House Oversight Committee this week, were exchanged during Trump's first term in office and before Ruemmler joined Goldman Sachs five years ago.

Ruemmler has previously said she regrets her association with Epstein.

""​​The personal emails exclusively occurred before Kathy worked at Goldman Sachs, when Ms. Ruemmler was the global head of the White Collar Defense practice at Latham and Watkins,"" Goldman Sachs spokesperson Tony Fratto told Business Insider Thursday. ""As we've said before, and has been repeatedly reported, Ms. Ruemmler had a professional relationship with Mr. Epstein when she was at Latham & Watkins.""

The newly released emails suggest a deeper relationship between Ruemmler and Epstein than was previously known.

Ruemmler confided in Epstein when a rival law firm tried to poach her, when looking for a New York City apartment, and when she was being vetted for consideration as attorney general of the United States. She also turned to him for minor issues, like what it's like to fly Emirates, the airline.

""When I go to Dubai on Emirates, do I need to go first or is business class good enough given that I only care about slepeping?"" Ruemmler asked Epstein after telling him Apple had hired her for a patent lawsuit.

Epstein said ""biz is ok,"" but offered her a ride on a friend's private jet. Ruemmler said she'd stick with the commercial airline.

The exchanges span from 2014, shortly after Ruemmler left her job as White House Counsel under President Barack Obama, until June 2019, a month before Epstein was arrested on sex-trafficking charges. Nothing in the emails, which the House Oversight Committee obtained from Epstein's estate, suggests Ruemmler had knowledge of the alleged conduct.

At the time, Ruemmler worked at the Big Law firm Latham & Watkins, which had previously said Epstein was never a client of the firm; it did not respond to requests for comment about the latest emails.

Ruemmler was widely viewed as a legal star in the Democratic Party. She was floated as a possible Supreme Court pick and had served as a lawyer in Bill Clinton's White House.

Ruemmler moved to Goldman Sachs in 2020 and now serves as the investment bank's chief legal officer and general counsel. She serves on Goldman Sachs' Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee, according to the bank's website.

Epstein — a financier with connections to titans of finance, science, and global politics — killed himself in his Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial in 2019. He had previously pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting an underage girl for sex.

It is unclear from the emails whether Epstein ever hired Ruemmler as a lawyer. At least three emails from Ruemmler to Epstein were redacted for what was described as ""privilege."" A lawyer for the executors of Epstein's estate, which provided the emails to the House Oversight Committee, didn't respond to a request for comment about the redactions.

On several occasions, Epstein looped Ruemmler into email discussions with other prominent attorneys he had personally hired, including Alan Dershowitz, Ken Starr, Martin Weinberg, and Darren Indyke.

Epstein and Ruemmler often emailed each other asking to speak on the phone. He included her in emails with other attorneys about responding to press inquiries about his relationship with Trump and Clinton. Epstein also forwarded to her a plan that the writer Michael Wolff presented to him in 2016 about countering the impending negative press from the James Patterson book ""Filthy Rich,"" which is about Epstein.

In a January 2019 draft of his will, Epstein named Ruemmler as the backup executor to his estate, according to a copy released by the House Oversight Committee earlier this year. The final edition of the will, completed while Epstein was incarcerated and shortly before his death, replaced her with Boris Nikolic, a former science advisor to Bill Gates. Epstein's estate was ultimately co-executed by his first choice: Indyke and accountant Richard Kahn.

In October 2014, news publications reported that Ruemmler turned down an offer from then-President Barack Obama to serve as the head of the Justice Department, replacing Eric Holder.

Some of the most intense discussions between Epstein and Ruemmler took place in the weeks leading up to the public announcement that Holder would step down, as Ruemmler considered whether to take his job. Epstein compared the indecision to Shakespeare's ""Hamlet.""

Ruemmler said she had recently found a high-rent apartment in New York. And she was unsure she would secure enough votes to be confirmed in the US Senate.

""I signed the lease in my name for a year, so I think I am pretty stuck,"" she told Epstein. ""It is $11,000 a month and Latham reimburses me $8000 a month.""

Days before The White House's public announcement about Holder stepping down, Ruemmler confided in Epstein that she wanted to lead the nation's most powerful law enforcement agency.

""I think I should do it,"" she wrote.

At another point in the discussion, Epstein advised Ruemmler to ""talk to boss"" about taking the job.

""Agreed, but I need to be prepared to say yes before I talk to him,"" Ruemmler responded.

In the same conversation, Epstein offered to introduce her to powerful people in his network, including Leon Black, Woody Allen, Peter Thiel, Larry Summers, and Nikolic.

Earlier, in 2016, Ruemmler had sought other career advice from Epstein. She forwarded emails from a recruiter with Hogan Lovells, another big law firm, seeking to hire her.

Epstein suggested she push for more details about compensation.

""ask him for a financial proposal,"" he wrote. ""Subject to Mutually acceptable conditions.""

Some of the emails are cryptic. On one occasion, Epstein asked, ""how did musk call go?""

""Well, I think, but not because of me,"" Ruemmler responded. ""The existential crisis thing is not a PMS or menopausal pose.""

In a July 2018 email, Ruemmler sent a context-free message to Epstein about Trump.

""​​Your boy should distance himself from Trump. Quick,"" she wrote.

Business Insider Edition 

Rising violence in Mali has forced Ivory Coast to implement an emergency border lockdown. Officials say the measure is necessary to manage the sudden influx of refugees fleeing attacks in the southern part of the Sahel nation.


        Ivory Coast has strengthened security along its northern border following an unexpected surge in refugees fleeing violence in neighbouring Mali. 



        The development, described by authorities as “several unusual flows of refugees,” reflects the persistent volatility in the Sahel and its spillover effects on coastal West African nations.
    


        According to a statement issued on Thursday, Ivory Coast's National Security Council (NSC) linked the sudden influx to “attacks against civilians by armed terrorist groups in several areas of southern Mali.”
    


        The council said it has moved swiftly to ensure that those arriving are properly documented, noting that “The National Security Council has instructed its Executive Secretary to take all necessary steps to register these asylum seekers.”
    


        In addition to the humanitarian response, the government has directed the military to increase its presence along the northern frontier.
    


        The NSC added that “the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces has been instructed to take appropriate measures to strengthen security at our country's northern borders,” signalling heightened concern about potential cross-border infiltration by armed groups.
    


        The refugee influx arrives at a pivotal moment for Côte d'Ivoire, which recently held its presidential election on 25 October 2025 and continues to garner international recognition for its sound economic management.
    


        The country has been widely lauded for maintaining macroeconomic stability and a predictable policy environment that reduces investor risk, strengthening its position as one of West Africa's most attractive investment destinations.
    


        In 2024, Côte d'Ivoire ranked third in Africa for foreign direct investment, drawing $3.80 billion, a remarkable 53 percent year-on-year increase compared to the previous year.
    


        This momentum has carried into 2025, highlighted by the commissioning of a 3-million-metric-tonne Dangote Cement plant in Attingué.
    


        However, the escalating instability in Mali continues to cast a shadow across the region. The recent surge of refugees is linked to renewed attacks by Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), the al-Qaeda-affiliated coalition at the heart of Mali's insurgency.
    


        Formed in 2017 through the merger of several jihadist factions, JNIM has steadily expanded its operations beyond Mali into Burkina Faso, Niger, Ghana, Benin, Togo, and Ivory Coast.
    


        In October, the group carried out its first confirmed attack in Nigeria, killing a soldier and seizing ammunition and cash.
    


        The insurgent group has also sought to pressure Mali's military authorities by blocking key transport routes from Senegal and Ivory Coast, creating fuel shortages and causing severe economic strain in Bamako.
    


        As the crisis deepens, Mali has suspended school and university activities nationwide due to the worsening fuel shortage.
    


        Several countries, including Italy, the US, and France, have issued travel warnings to their citizens, citing growing security risks as the government faces mounting pressure from al-Qaeda-linked insurgents enforcing the blockade.



        The latest assault on the town of Loulouni, roughly 50km from the Ivorian border, forced hundreds of residents to flee this week, adding to the humanitarian burden on neighbouring countries.
    


        Ivory Coast, which already hosts about 90,000 refugees from Burkina Faso, now faces additional demands with the arrival of Malian nationals.

Millions of Americans could see their health insurance premiums climb by a staggering average of 75% next year.

Enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies — which lower the cost of marketplace coverage for middle- and low-income households — are set to expire December 31. And, without a healthcare spending agreement from Congress, it's likely they won't be renewed. With open enrollment underway for those plans, Americans could be facing a new round of insurance sticker shock.

Extending these ACA tax credits has been a key goal of Democrats, contributing to the stalemate at the heart of the recently-ended government shutdown. While the government reopened on November 12 after a record 43 days, lawmakers failed to take action on the subsidies, although the deal reopening the government provides for a fresh debate over them next month. They also didn't reverse President Donald Trump's changes to Medicaid, another goal for Democrats.

For Americans, this all could mean less access to health insurance and higher costs for care.

Low- and middle-income households will feel the brunt of losing enhanced ACA subsidies.

Passed in 2021 under the Biden administration, the expanded tax credits boosted the amount of relief that Americans on marketplace plans could receive. Over the past decade, marketplace enrollment has jumped from 11 to over 24 million. This is partially because the enhanced subsidies were available to middle-income Americans up to 400% of the poverty line — which is $128,600 for a family of four — making marketplace plans more affordable.

Without these credits in place, people on ACA plans could see their out-of-pocket premium costs increase by an average of over 75%, a KFF analysis shows. Some enrollees would see their financial relief shrink and others would be disqualified entirely, depending on their income, with some premiums increasing by over $1,000 annually. On top of the direct loss of the enhanced subsidies, many insurers are likely to increase premiums to offset a projected decline in enrollment among healthier Americans.

Last year, nearly 20 million Americans received these enhanced ACA subsidies.

Medicaid recipients could also see an increase in their healthcare costs. Despite negotiations and the government shutdown, Congress didn't agree to reverse Trump's changes to that program from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

In the legislation, the president called for new Medicaid qualifications that would require non-exempt Americans to work 80 hours a month to qualify for insurance. The law also limits the amount of money states can funnel from provider taxes toward Medicaid. This means that hospitals will lose funding and some Medicaid recipients will experience higher out-of-pocket costs over the next several years.

Hospitals in rural areas and low-income Americans are likely to be highly impacted. Most Medicaid recipients live near the federal poverty line, though the exact threshold varies by state. As of mid-2025, about 83 million Americans were enrolled in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program.

President Donald Trump on Friday said that he is asking the Department of Justice to investigate relationships between notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and former President Bill Clinton, JPMorgan Chase, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, billionaire tech investor Reid Hoffman, and others.

Trump's statement comes as he faces renewed pressure over his own past friendship with Epstein, who killed himself in August 2019 after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.

In a Truth Social post, Trump claimed that ""Democrats are using the Epstein Hoax ... to try and deflect from their disastrous SHUTDOWN, and all of their other failures.

Because of that, he wrote, ""I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,.

""This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats,"" Trump wrote ""Records show that these men, and many others, spent large portions of their life with Epstein, and on his 'Island.' Stay tuned!!!""

Trump's post comes two days after he hosted business leaders, including JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, at a White House dinner.

A spokesman for JPMorgan, in a statement to CNBC on Friday, said, ""The government had damning information about [Epstein's] crimes and failed to share it with us or other banks.""

""We regret any association we had with the man, but did not help him commit his heinous acts,"" said the spokeswoman, Patricia Wexler. ""We ended our relationship with him years before his arrest on sex trafficking charges.""

Epstein had been a longtime customer of JPMorgan, and also had been friends with former JPMorgan executive Jes Staley.

In 2023, JPMorgan, without admitting wrongdoing, settled separate lawsuits by victims of Epstein and the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands, who had accused the bank of facilitating and benefiting from Epstein's sex trafficking of young women. The bank agreed to pay the group of victims $290 million, and to pay the USVI $75 million.

CNBC has requested comment from Clinton, Summers, Hoffman, as well as from the White House and the DOJ, about Trump's post.

Emails released by the House Oversight Committee this week show Epstein and others talking about Trump.

In a 2018 email thread about Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleading guilty charges related to hush money payments on behalf of Trump, Epstein wrote, ""I know how dirty donald is.""

In another thread that same year, Epstein wrote of Trump: ""its wild. because I am the one able to take him down.""

Trump also faces a looming vote by the full House of Representatives on a petition demanding the release of criminal investigative files about Epstein that the DOJ refuses to make public despite prior promises to do so by Attorney General Pam Bondi and other Trump administration officials.

Trump has denied having known about Epstein's decades-long abuse of underage girls and young women.

The two men had a falling out in the early 2000s.

Among the email threads released Wednesday by the House Oversight Committee is one written in April in which Epstein told author Michael Wolff that Trump ""knew about the girls."" The email does not explain what Epstein meant by that

In another email, written in April 2011, Epstein told his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell: ""I want you to realize that the dog that hasn't barked is trump.""

Epstein, in the same thread, said that a person whose name was redacted in the email but whom lawmakers identified as a victim of his ""spent hours at my house with"" Trump.

""He has never once been mentioned,"" Epstein added.

The U.S. and Switzerland have reached a trade deal, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC on Friday.

Duties will be reduced to 15%, the Swiss government said in a post on X, adding that further details will be announced at 4 p.m. local time.

As part of the deal, Swiss companies have pledged to invest some $200 billion in the U.S. by the end of 2028, which includes funding for education and training, according to a statement by the Swiss government.

""We've essentially reached a deal with Switzerland,"" Greer told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Friday morning.

""They're going to send a lot of manufacturing here to the United States — pharmaceuticals, gold smelting, railway equipment — so we're really excited about that deal and what it means for American manufacturing.""

Greer added that more details on the deal, which he said had ""really been in the works since April,"" would later be published on the White House website.

The deal means the country-specific tariff imposed on Swiss goods will match the rate levied on those brought to the U.S. from the European Union.

""Like all the president's deals, we keep a tariff,"" Greer said on Friday. ""We retain a tariff on these countries because we have to get the trade deficit under control. But because Switzerland, for example, has agreed to manage its trade surplus with the United States, in terms of making sure that things where they have a trade surplus with us — pharmaceuticals, gold, et cetera — their companies are going to build here, so it's going to eliminate some of the sources of that surplus.""

He pointed to Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche, which pledged earlier this year to invest $50 billion in the U.S.

""The announcement of the reduction in additional US tariffs on Swiss imports will serve to stabilise bilateral trade relations,"" the Swiss government said in its Friday statement. ""Although overall tariffs remain higher than before the additional tariffs were introduced in April, the agreed reduction in additional tariffs is expected to have a positive impact on the Swiss economy.""

Back in July, President Donald Trump announced Switzerland would be hit with a 39% tariff rate, which took hold when a Swiss delegation failed to secure a deal with U.S. officials during last-ditch talks in Washington.

That meant Switzerland was subject to one of the highest tariff rates imposed on an individual country by the Trump administration.

Switzerland, an export-driven economy, has already taken a hit from the tariffs. Last month, Swiss officials cut the country's economic growth forecast for 2026, citing the ""heavy burden"" of the U.S. duties on its industries.

Its biggest exports include watches, pharmaceuticals and precious metals, but the country is also renowned for its luxury goods, chocolate and skincare products.

The Swiss franc added 0.4% against the greenback following the trade deal announcements on Friday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","No one leaving New York City because of Mamdani, say two top real estate CEOs","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/14/new-york-city-mayor-zohran-mamdani-real-estate-ceos.html","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 15:55:40 GMT","



New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's views have sparked fears that there will be an exodus of companies and capital from the city. But two of the city's top commercial real estate executives say it's simply not true, based on leasing activity and new building investments being made, with no pullback in plans ever since it became clear Mamdani would win, and through the democratic socialist's official election.

""New York City is back,"" said Scott Rechler, CEO of RXR, at CNBC's Delivering Alpha conference in New York on Thursday. ""The people who work here, live here, they feel the energy, they have the conviction, and they have every right,"" he said.

""In our business right now, we are seeing CEO after CEO committing to the city,"" Rechler said. ""We're seeing a record level of leasing in office buildings. And it's not just for next year, it's for 2028, 2030, 2032,"" he added.

""We will hit over 40 million square feet in commercial office leases signed at the end of this year,"" said Bill Rudin, co-executive chairman of Rudin Management. ""Companies are growing here,"" he said. ""We haven't seen any diminishment in meetings with brokerage firms,"" he said of activity since Mamdani's election. ""People keep saying, 'Any impact?' No one has put their pencils down. No one is calling the moving trucks. Companies are expanding and taking space,"" Rudin said.

One good example: hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin of Citadel Securities, who is known for being outspoken with his conservative political views. Rudin, along with Steve Ross, Vornado Realty and Griffin, is breaking ground on a two-million square foot new office building at 350 Park Avenue. ""Ken is committed and will have more employees at 350 Park than in Miami,"" Rudin said. And while the plans pre-date Mamdani's rise, Rudin noted they recently filed for a building permit and Griffin is a partner in the project, ""so he is moving ahead and very excited about it and very much involved in the design and development of the project. ... How's that?"" Rudin added.

RXR just signed a 300,000-square-foot lease with a law firm moving in 2029, and Rechler noted that the firm came back last week after the election and said they need to expand by another 200,000 square feet. JPMorgan's new building already needs seats for another 5,000 workers beyond the 10,000 it already can hold.

Rechler noted his firm already has an anchor tenant for a 2.8-million-square-foot project that will replace a Hyatt hotel in the 2031-2032 timeframe. ""People believe in New York,"" he said. RXR has $7 billion in project financing and ""you don't get that if people don't believe in the future of New York,"" he added, though he said it may require ""a little bit of a longer lens.""

But even right now, he said, in the wake of Mamdani's election, the correct word to use with tenants in the high quality office space market is ""urgency"" to sign deals, with reports he is hearing of companies signing leases that would normally take them a year to agree to within 21 days. ""That's the market. ... enormous pipeline on the office side I've never seen my whole career, never seen it as strong as it is right now in tenant demand,"" Rechler said.

""As of today and yesterday, the information we are getting in real time is that tenants are still in the market and looking for good high quality space,"" Rudin said.

One reason for the bullish outlook on New York's real estate market is the need to attract and retain young professional talent.

""The people they want to be working in the companies are here in New York City,"" Rudin said.

""Every young professional wants to be in New York,"" Rechler added, citing a 1.5% vacancy rate in the multi- family property real estate market in the city. ""People want to be here,"" he said.

Their view of the mayor — both real estate executives have met with him — isn't without reservations.

""Mamdani is not necessarily consistent with the capital of capitalism,"" Rechler said. ""That's the biggest risk. We have a guy who is caricature, not a character, but a caricature,"" he said, and that could set Mamdani up to easily be defined as a socialist with no experience and just riding on social media savvy, he added.

It is a risk that Rechler says he is seeing play out among overseas institutional investors specifically. ""When I leave the city and travel the world, they all have this big anxiety,"" he said. ""It may impact foreign investors in multi-family projects in New York. They hear 'rent freeze,' just hear that word ... and maybe there is a pullback there,"" Rechler said, citing the fact that the mayor has power to appoint officials to a board overseeing those policies.

That perception is leading some institutional investors with whom RXR was talking about large investments in New York City to ""pull back and say they want to see how it plays out,"" Rechler said. He added the tone of these conversations implies that there could be a ""chill in capital flows"" among these investors.

""I've been in the Middle East and Europe and the first thing people want to talk about is Mamdani,"" he said. Rechler is also on the board of directors of the New York Fed, and he said the topic of conversation is the same. ""In the boardroom of the New York Fed they want to talk about it and their staff traveling around the world is being asked as they travel.""

But the real estate CEOs both stressed that for a city that has survived and prospered through Covid, the financial crisis, 9/11 and the administration of Bill de Blasio, the fears seem hyperbolic. They also noted that when Michael Bloomberg was mayor, New York had a $60 billion budget. Now it is a budget of $116 billion, which leads them to believe Mamdani may become more realistic in his management approach than his campaign platform would suggest.

""When he first started running, there was no private sector in housing. He has moved off of that,"" Rudin said. He added that a ""very liberal Greenwich Village congressman Ed Koch"" realized when he became mayor he needed to move to the center to get things done. ""Hopefully, Mayor-elect Mamdani understands he needs to manage and operate a $116 billion budget,"" he said.

Rudin said the issues the Mayor-elect has raised, such as housing affordability and availability, are legitimate issues, ""and we will try to work with him,"" he said.

""What's driving Mamdani's success is the same thing that drove Trump's success,"" Rudin said, citing a disenfranchised segment of the economy, particularly among younger people, who feel they will not have the same economic opportunities as prior generations. ""There is frustration with big business and government and they want an answer,"" he said. ""Now, the Mayor-elect gave them a simple answer, which frankly is not really executable,"" he said.

But Rudin noted since Mamdani's earlier campaigning, he has pulled back from a policy of having government wholly dictate housing, and has expressed willingness to work with the private sector, and he added, it is now ""incumbent on us to show him the pathway of how to create the housing we need.""

""I talked to him before the election,"" Rudin said. ""My sense is a very smart young man willing to listen and hear feedback on the issues.""

The housing affordability crisis will not be a simple one to fix. Rudin noted that the administration of Mayor Eric Adams set up Mamdani for success by changing zoning laws across boroughs within the last year, but the real estate executives both said wage, labor union, sustainable development policies, and changes in tax provisions that make it less attractive financially to put up buildings over 100 units are all issues that stand in the way. ""So it has to be a moment where labor, the governor, the city council, and the mayor have to come together ... if they want the housing, and we need it,"" Rudin said.

The real estate executives cited tax incentives created due to Covid which are allowing for the conversion of older office buildings into residential properties as another area where they can collaborate on affordable housing construction, with those incentives tied to buildings retaining 25% of units for affordable rents rather market rates.

Rechler noted that despite Mamdani's tax the rich rhetoric, the reality is that New York's governor has had significant fiscal authority over the city ever since the 1970s financial crisis. ""At the end of the day, the governor has the veto pen on taxes,"" Rechler said. ""And I had breakfast with her yesterday and she said income taxes won't be raised under her watch.""

He added there will be political pressure on Governor Kathy Hochul given her own election needs.

""We have a governor's race in a year and she has to serve as that firewall, and if she doesn't, she will not be governor in a year,"" Rechler said. ""The gubernatorial election will be about Mamdani.""

For now, Rechler said what is maybe most telling about his interactions with Mamdani are a comparison to with how former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio interacted with business leaders when his star was rising.

""I met with [Mamdani] for an hour alone and he came in prepared and he was pivoting from campaign to governing mentality and said all the right things,"" Rechler recalled of a meeting in September when it was clear to him the election outcome was certain. ""The proof will be in the pudding, but he realizes that he needs to lean into public-private partnerships, it's the only way to build the type of housing he wants.""

""I want to contrast that with when I met with de Blasio,"" Rechler added. It was a meeting of 12 business leaders, he said, and the former mayor, ""he looked around the table of business people and said 'none of you elected me and I'm not here to serve you.' And we lived with that for eight years. This guy at least starts with 'I know I need business people to work with to be successful.""

Many baby boomers aren't on track to retire with enough money. They have some options to adjust their trajectory, researchers said, but these come with trade-offs.

Just 40% of workers who are age 61 to 65 — the youngest members of the boomer cohort — are financially on track for retirement, according to recent research from Vanguard, an asset manager and retirement plan administrator. That group will have enough income to fund their current lifestyle into retirement, researchers estimate.

The rest are expected to fall short. The typical — or, median — 61- to 65-year-old will have a $9,000 annual deficit in retirement, representing a 24% shortfall in their funding needs, Vanguard estimates.

Its analysis assumes people retire and claim Social Security at age 65.

Stories for investors who are retired or are approaching retirement, and are interested in creating and managing a steady stream of income:

The findings come as a historic demographic shift, known as ""peak 65,"" is underway in the U.S. A record number of people — more than 4 million a year, or about 11,000 a day — are expected to turn 65 annually from 2024 to 2027.

Of course, knowing the ""right"" amount of money needed to retire is an impossibility. No one knows how long they will live or how much money they might need for future retirement expenses, such as health care or long-term care.

Yet boomers who suspect they won't be able to sustain their current standard of living are in a tough spot compared to younger generations.

Gen Z and millennials, for example, have decades to change course, perhaps by saving more for retirement and earning compound interest on those balances. Not so for near-retirees.

Compared to younger investors, boomers also generally hold fewer stocks — the typical growth engine of a retirement portfolio — to insulate their savings from market risk as they prepare to begin retirement withdrawals.

There may be negative implications for the U.S. economy if many boomers are ill-prepared for retirement and are forced to cut spending to make their nest eggs last.

""Some economists sound alarm bells: 'We have this [retirement] crisis, it's doom and gloom,'"" said David Blanchett, a certified financial planner and head of retirement research at PGIM, an investment manager. ""It's not nearly as bad as it seems.""

Boomers do have a few options to help close any retirement-readiness gap. However, the options may not be accessible or palatable to all households, he said.

Here are three of them.

Delaying retirement is a ""silver bullet"" when it comes to eliminating or shrinking a retirement funding gap, Blanchett said.

""Even pushing back retirement back a few years can do wonders for retirement outcomes,"" he said.

That's because working longer would yield more career-funded savings, higher Social Security income for life due to delayed claiming, and fewer years of retirement to fund, according to Vanguard's report.

For example, working two years longer — e.g., retiring and claiming Social Security benefits at age 67 — would increase the share of 61- to 65-year-olds who are prepared for retirement to 47% from 40%, Vanguard found.

However, not everyone will be able to work longer, even if this is something they plan to do.

""It's not an option that's available for all,"" said Kelly Hahn, head of retirement research in Vanguard's Investment Strategy Group.

In 2025, 40% of retirees said they left the workforce earlier than planned, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute's Retirement Confidence Survey. That share has been roughly similar for the past two decades, hovering around 40% to 50%.

Some of the reasons for an unexpectedly early exit include health problems and layoffs.

Among the reasons for boomers' somewhat precarious financial position relative to younger generations: The workplace retirement system shifted from a pension-heavy system to a 401(k)-type system, right as young boomers were in their peak earning years, Hahn said.

""They didn't really benefit fully from the pensions their parents or grandparents may have had,"" or from the newer 401(k)-type system of savings, she said.

However, the bulk are sitting on a large non-liquid asset, Hahn said: their homes.

The vast majority — 86% — of baby boomers own homes, a much larger share than younger generations, according to Vanguard calculations based on the Federal Reserve's most recent Survey of Consumer Finances.

The average boomer has $113,000 of home equity, according to Vanguard's report.

Tapping into that equity would increase the share of young boomers financially prepared for retirement to 60%, up from the baseline 40%, researchers estimated.

There are many ways to access those funds, experts said.

""The one that will give you the biggest bang for your buck from a quantitative standpoint"" is selling one's home outright and becoming a renter instead of a homeowner, Hahn said.

Homeowners might also consider selling their current home and downsizing, moving to a lower-cost area, or borrowing against their home equity via a reverse mortgage or a home equity line of credit.

However, tapping home equity is often a ""tricky topic,"" Hahn said.

Most people are reluctant to turn to their home as a piggy bank, viewing it instead as an asset of last resort, Blanchett said.

""The home is the largest tangible asset for most Americans,"" he said. ""It's a viable option in theory, but in the past it's been relatively unpopular.""

A home generally comes with a strong emotional attachment to one's identity, potentially making it difficult to sell, Hahn said.

Homeowners with a mortgage who secured their loan when rates were low may also feel locked in, given higher interest rates now, she said.

Additionally, accessing home equity via a reverse mortgage or HELOC can also be costly and time-consuming, Blanchett said. Homeowners need to get approved for the loan, which often comes with implicit or explicit costs, he said.

Social connectivity is also a ""very important aspect of a happy retirement,"" Blanchett said. Retirees would have to weigh the loss of their community and social network against the financial necessity of relocating, he said.

Of course, people might also consider spending less both before and during retirement, Blanchett said.

Saving more money toward the tail end of one's working years can help accomplish that goal by forcing households to live on reduced cash flow, he said.

The typical retiree experiences a 20% decline in their consumption when they enter retirement, perhaps because a lack of savings causes a reduction in their spending, according to Blanchett's research.

However, data suggests about 90% are moderately or very satisfied with their retirement, he said.

""These responses strongly suggest that despite perceptions of a retirement crisis, retirees are relatively content,"" he wrote.

President Donald Trump's administration said on Friday it was formally withdrawing a plan by his predecessor to require airlines to pay passengers cash compensation when U.S. flight disruptions are caused by carriers.

In December 2024, the U.S. Transportation Department under then-President Joe Biden sought public comment on writing rules to require airlines to pay $200 to $300 for domestic delays of at least three hours and up to $775 for longer delays.

In September, USDOT first disclosed it planned to withdraw the proposal. On Friday, USDOT said the rules would result in ""unnecessary regulatory burdens"" in explaining why it would not go forward.

Last month, a group of 18 Democratic senators urged the Trump administration not to drop the compensation plan.

""This is a common-sense proposal: when an airline's mistake imposes unanticipated costs on families, the airline should try to remedy the situation by providing accommodations to consumers and helping cover their costs,"" said the letter signed by Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal, Maria Cantwell, Ed Markey and others.

Airlines in the U.S. must refund passengers for canceled flights, but are not required to compensate customers for delays. The European Union, Canada, Brazil and Britain all have airline delay compensation rules. No large U.S. airline currently guarantees cash compensation for significant flight disruption.

USDOT said Friday in abandoning the compensation plan that it would ""allow airlines to compete on the services and compensation that they provide to passengers rather than imposing new minimum requirements for these services and compensation through regulation, which would impose significant costs on airlines.""

USDOT also announced in September it was considering rescinding Biden regulations requiring airlines and ticket agents to disclose service fees alongside airfares.

It also plans to reduce regulatory burdens on airlines and ticket agents by writing new rules detailing the definition of a flight cancellation that entitles consumers to ticket refunds, as well as revisiting rules on ticket pricing and advertising.

Airlines have pushed the Trump administration to go further and praised the action to rescind the Biden plan.

D.R. Horton, the nation's largest homebuilder, is tapping an artificial intelligence tool from Portland, Oregon-based startup Prophetic to build more homes and address the country's housing shortage.

Chronic underbuilding since the Great Recession has caused a deficit of roughly 4 million homes, according to analyses from several sources, including Zillow. The supply-demand imbalance has caused prices to rise over 50% from pre-pandemic levels.

Homebuilders are trying to respond but say that the cost of construction, along with the difficult and costly process for acquiring and developing buildable lots, is making that difficult.

""One of the largest challenges to providing affordable housing is the identification, acquisition and entitlement of land suitable for development. We are confident the insights provided by Prophetic are going to help us expand homeownership opportunities for hard-working American individuals and families,"" said Jason Jones, vice president of data analytics at D.R. Horton, in a release.

Prophetic has developed an AI-native platform for land acquisition and development analysis. For any potential parcel of land, Prophetic's software will pull every single zoning manual from every city and county in a state. The company said it is currently operational in 25 states and expects to be in all 50 by June.

""It's an incredibly large, tedious, detail-oriented process to take tens of thousands of these zoning documents and extract the rules, not only efficiently, but correctly,"" said Oliver Alexander, founder and CEO of Prophetic.

Among other things, the system looks at minimum lot size and minimum or maximum density setbacks, which differ by municipality and zone. It updates those quarterly. 

""Then it tells you where that information came from, which is the key differentiator,"" Alexander explained. ""When you have that section title and the page that it came from, that builds trust, and then it becomes ultra-efficient, where you can analyze development potential in 30 seconds instead of two to three hours.""

Alexander said there are a little over 440,000 different ways to describe what you're allowed to do on a piece of dirt in the states Prophetic has analyzed. Developers need to go through all of that information to figure out if they can build a single- or multifamily housing development on it. 

The AI's large language model-based analysis of these documents at scale can answer the questions and then feed that into search AI, which Alexander calls ""the major unlock"" – search plus the zone AI information together. At the ground level, with this AI, builders can figure out what they can build, where and how much at a much faster pace, making them more competitive with landowners.

""If you have that much of an edge in your speed to decision, you effectively control your entire market, because before anyone else can decide, you've tied it up,"" said Alexander.

In this article

Merck will acquire Cidara Therapeutics in a nearly $9.2 billion deal, gaining access to an experimental flu drug in its effort to diversify ahead of patent loss for its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda.

The drugmaker will pay $221.50 per share in cash for Cidara, the companies said on Friday, a premium of 108.9% from its last closing price.

Shares of Cidara, which has a market capitalization of $3.3 billion as of Thursday, doubled in value to $217.89, while Merck slipped 1.3%.

Merck, which is set to lose patents for Keytruda later this decade, has nearly tripled its late-stage pipeline since 2021 through in-house development and big deals such as the $11.5 billion purchase of Acceleron for pulmonary arterial hypertension drug Winrevair.

The company had in July signed a $10 billion buyout of UK-based Verona Pharma, gaining Ohtuvayre, a newly approved drug for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, commonly known as ""smoker's lung"".

""There definitely seems to be a sense of urgency at Merck to add growth to their pipeline via deals,"" said James Harlow, senior vice president at Novare Capital Management.

Cidara's experimental long-acting antiviral drug CD388 is not a vaccine and is expected to be efficacious in individuals regardless of immune status. It has the potential to be a single-dose, universal prevention against all flu strains.

""The non-vaccine nature of CD388 is notable given the uncertainty around the FDA and CDC's views on vaccines,"" Harlow said.

It aims to protect those at higher risk of flu, with the potential to provide season-long protection.

""While this deal is somewhat complementary, it is not perfectly 'plug and play' with the rest of the Merck portfolio,"" said Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen, calling Cidara ""essentially a single asset story"".

Breen said the deal provides late-stage, lower-risk revenue into the portfolio at the end of this decade, but costs due to diversification and market building may be heavy.

The flu drug belongs to a class known as drug-Fc conjugates that combines zanamivir, the active ingredient of GSK's FDA-approved influenza drug Relenza, with a clinically validated human antibody fragment.

It is being studied in a late-stage trial in adults and adolescents at higher risk of developing complications from influenza.

""We are confident that CD388 has the potential to be another important driver of growth through the next decade,"" said Merck CEO Robert Davis.

Cidara aims to achieve target enrolment of 6,000 participants by December, it said earlier this month. The drug has received breakthrough designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which could speed up its approval process.

A single dose of the antiviral gave up to 76% protection from symptomatic influenza over 24 weeks compared to placebo, in a mid-stage trial studying the drug in healthy unvaccinated adults aged 18 to 64.

Merck, through a subsidiary, will acquire all of Cidara's outstanding shares. The transaction has an equity value of $6.96 billion, according to a Reuters calculation.

The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026.

Artificial intelligence has become one of the biggest investment stories in the market, helping drive a surge of assets into thematic exchange-traded funds that let retail investors bet on major technology trends. But experts warn that these funds can fall as quickly as they rise. It's a simple yet important point for investors to keep in mind as tech stocks look more vulnerable, and are leading the market lower in recent days. The Nasdaq has been flirting with a fall below its 50-day moving average for the first time since the April downturn and posted its third-straight losing session on Thursday.

""We have nearly 400 ETFs at ETF Action that we classify as thematic,"" Mike Akins, founding partner at research firm ETF Action, said on CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" on Monday. ""The top performer is up over 150% year to date ... there's several negative 10%,"" he said.

Investors are drawn to thematic ETFs covering trends from AI to quantum computing, clean energy and defense technology, but they often overlook the risks, including how volatile the portfolios can be. Because thematic ETFs focus on specific sectors or technologies rather than just tracking broad indexes, they can deliver strong gains when a theme is in favor, but momentum may fade.

ETF Action divides the thematic ETF universe into 12 major categories with many subgroups. Within the disruptive technology category alone, which includes artificial intelligence, flows have been enormous this year. ""AI disruptive tech has seen almost $20 billion in flows year to date,"" Akins said. Roughly $15 billion of that, he said, has ""AI"" in the ETF name.

The surge has helped lift funds like the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (AIQ) which has grown to about $7 billion in assets, attracting about $3 billion in net flows since the beginning of the year, according to ETF.com. Its top holdings are Advanced Micro Devices, Alphabet, Samsung, Tesla and Alibaba. Another example from Global X is the Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ), which has around $3 billion in assets under management. Its top holdings are Nvidia, ABB, Fanuc, Intuitive Surgical and Keyence.

Thematic ETFs do require more research than traditional funds. Case in point: among the 18 ETFs that ETF Action classifies as AI-focused, Akins said there is a performance spread of 60% this year.

""Every time you see a new ETF come to market, it introduces significant tracking error from just investing in the market,"" he said.

Through the first nine months of 2025, close to 800 ETFs were launched, besting a record for ETF launches set just last year, according to Reuters. Morningstar data indicates there are now more ETFs (over 4,300 U.S. listed ETFs) than individual stocks traded in the U.S.

Akins described the growth of the ETF market as ""overwhelmingly positive"" to the investor experience, but added that the growing number of opportunities also implies more risk.

Some of the themes that led the early wave of thematic investing can lose momentum as stand-alone investment stories even as the trends remain fundamental to the technology sector and market, Akins said. ETFs constructed around the themes of cloud computing and next-generation connectivity, for example, have seen billions of dollars in outflows over the past few years as the companies that were top holdings matured and became part of broad-based stock market indexes already held by investors. 

He stressed that is not a statement about whether cloud computing or connectivity are good or bad investment themes right now, but simply that there is a ""lifecycle"" to a theme which can lead to less attention and less flows as the theme matures. Ultimately, that can mean themes don't offer the same high-growth opportunities as they did when they first became popular.

But Akins added that the timeline for each trend's momentum is hard to pin down.

""I think every theme is unique to itself, so some are going to play out longer than others,"" Akins said. ""That's part of the story with this space ... there's definitely the idea I'm going to invest in this because I believe it's going to play out over the next three to seven years.""

Despite the recent jitters in the stock market and tech stocks specifically, it is important to note that the Nasdaq is less than 5% off an all-time record level and has gained close to 250% since its Covid low point. Akins said thematic investing is worthwhile for investors who understand what they are buying and can tolerate short-term volatility.

Seizing moments of opportunity in the market can also be key with thematic strategies. ""Themes can run very, very quickly, so you should be taking advantage,"" Akins said. Significant gains in a short period of time may lead investors to consider taking some profits. ""You still want to have an allocation to the theme, but maybe take some off the top,"" he added.

As a handful of the world's most valuable companies set out to spend $1 trillion over the next five years on data centers for artificial intelligence, one line item is on the minds of executives and investors: depreciation.

In accounting, depreciation is the act of allocating the cost of a hard asset over the course of its expected useful life. It's an increasingly important concept in the tech industry, as companies predict how long the hundreds of thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs, they're purchasing will remain useful or retain their value.

Infrastructure giants like Google, Oracle and Microsoft have said their servers could be useful for up to six years. But they could also depreciate much sooner. Microsoft said in its latest annual filing that its computer equipment lasts two to six years.

That's a lot to consider for the investors and lenders financing the giant AI buildouts, because the longer equipment remains valuable, the more years a company can stretch out depreciation and the less it hurts profits.

AI GPUs represent a particular challenge because they're still relatively new to the market. Nvidia's first AI-focused processors for data centers came out around 2018. The current AI boom started with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. Since then, Nvidia's annual data center revenue has jumped from $15 billion to $115 billion in the fiscal year that ended in January.

There's no real track record for how long GPUs last when compared with other types of heavy equipment that businesses have been using for decades, said Haim Zaltzman, vice chair of Latham & Watkins' emerging companies and growth practice.

""Is it three years, is it five, or is it seven?"" said Zaltzman, who works on GPU financings, in an interview. ""It's a huge difference in terms of how successful it is for financing purposes.""

Some of Nvidia's customers say AI chips will retain value for a long time and that customers will continue to pay for access to older processors because they'll still be useful for other tasks. CoreWeave, which buys GPUs and rents them out to clients, has used six-year depreciation cycles for its infrastructure since 2023.

CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator told CNBC this week, following quarterly earnings, that his company is being ""data driven"" about GPU shelf life.

Intrator said that CoreWeave's Nvidia A100 chips, which were announced in 2020, are all fully booked. He also added that a batch of Nvidia H100 chips from 2022 became available because a contract expired, and they were immediately booked at 95% of their original price.

""All of the data points that I'm getting are telling me that the infrastructure retains value,"" Intrator said.

Still, CoreWeave shares plunged 16% after its earnings report as delays at a third-party data center developer hit full-year guidance. The stock is down 57% from its high reached in June, part of a broader sell-off reflecting concerns about overspending in AI. Oracle shares have plummeted 34% from their record high in September.

Among the most vocal skeptics of the AI trade is short seller Michael Burry, who recently disclosed bets against Nvidia and Palantir.

Burry this week suggested that companies including Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google and Amazon are overstating the useful life of their AI chips and understating depreciation. He pegs the actual useful life of server equipment at around two to three years, and said companies are inflating their earnings as a result.

Amazon and Microsoft declined to comment. Meta, Google and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.

There are a number of ways AI chips could depreciate before six years. They could wear out and break, or they could become obsolete as newer GPUs are released. They could still be useful for running certain workloads, but with much worse economics.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has implied as much. When Nvidia announced a new Blackwell chip earlier this year, he joked that the value of its predecessor, the Hopper, would deteriorate.

""When Blackwell starts shipping in volume, you couldn't give Hoppers away,"" Huang said in March at Nvidia's AI conference.

""There are circumstances where Hopper is fine,"" he continued. ""Not many.""

Nvidia now releases new AI chips on an annual basis, versus the two-year cadence it had before. Advanced Micro Devices, its closest GPU competitor, followed suit.

Nvidia reports quarterly results next week.

Amazon, in a February filing, said it decreased the useful life for a subset of its servers from six years to five years because it conducted a study that found ""an increased pace of technology development, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning.""

Meanwhile, other hyperscalers are extending their GPU useful life estimates for newer server equipment.

Although Microsoft plans to build AI infrastructure aggressively, CEO Satya Nadella said this week that his company is trying to space out its AI chip purchases and not overinvest in a single generation of processors. He added that the biggest competitor for any new Nvidia AI chip is its predecessor.

""One of the biggest learnings we had even with Nvidia is that their pace increased in terms of their migrations,"" Nadella said. ""That was a big factor. I didn't want to go get stuck with four or five years of depreciation on one generation.""

Nvidia declined to comment.

Dustin Madsen, vice president of the Society of Depreciation Professionals and founder of Emrydia Consulting, said depreciation is a financial estimate by management and that developments in a fast-moving industry like technology can change initial predictions.

Depreciation estimates, Madsen said, generally take into account assumptions such as technological obsolescence, maintenance, historical lifespans of similar equipment and internal engineering analysis.

""You're going to have to convince an auditor that what you're suggesting what its life will be is actually its life,"" Madsen said. ""They will look at all of those factors, like your engineering data that suggests that the life of these assets is approximately six years, and they will audit that at a very detailed level.""

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Yesterday was a rough day for the stock market. The three major indexes all notched their biggest one-day losses in more than a month as the artificial intelligence trade once again sputtered. Economic policy concerns also overshadowed investors' excitement around the federal government reopening.

Here's the breakdown:

Higher-income shoppers are looking for deals, and younger consumers are tightening their purse strings, according to recent earnings reports from consumer companies.

There are some notable exceptions — such as Coach and Swiss shoemaker On, which saw growth across all consumer segments — but shoppers' pullback could portend a rocky holiday retail period ahead. Investors will get more insight from next week's earnings reports, which include some of the biggest retailers: Walmart, Target, Gap and Home Depot.

Another economic warning sign: Data released yesterday showed new foreclosure starts in October jumped 20% from a year ago. As CNBC's Diana Olick notes, the uptick could signal cracks in a housing market that has been notoriously tight coming out of the pandemic.

Boeing defense workers voted to approve a new contract yesterday, ending the union's first strike since 1996. The stoppage, which lasted more than a three months, delayed production of Boeing's F-15 fighter jets.

The agreement includes increased up-front bonuses and 24% wage increases over five years. Employees rejected previous proposals that the union said didn't address their concerns.

We're also keeping an eye on the Starbucks barista strike that began yesterday in dozens of cities. The protest coincided with Red Cup Day, which has historically been a major sales event for the coffee chain.

The IRS released its 2026 guidelines for a variety of savings programs yesterday.

For 401(k) plans, the agency increased the employee deferral limit by $1,000 to $24,500. The caps for individual retirement accounts and Roth IRAs in 2026 each increased by $500 to $7,500.

The IRS also raised 401(k) catch-up contribution limits and increased income thresholds for Roth IRA contributions.

At CNBC's Delivering Alpha conference last night, attendees got expert examinations of today's market.

Mary Callahan Erdoes, CEO at JPMorgan Asset and Wealth Management, said AI should be viewed as an opportunity rather than a potential crisis. In fact, Erdoes called the idea of an AI bubble a ""crazy concept.""

Coatue Management founder Philippe Laffont, meanwhile, had a less optimistic take for the initial public offering market, calling it ""completely broken"" and ""beyond repair."" He noted that there are ""very few"" IPOs compared with prior decades.

It's been a busy week. Here are our recommendations for the weekend:

Bitcoin miner American Bitcoin (ABTC) reported a third-quarter profit and said revenue more than doubled from the year-earlier period as it expanded its mining capacity and completed its first full quarter as a publicly traded company.

Net income at the Miami-based company 20% owned by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump rose to $3.47 million, a turnaround from a $576,000 loss the year before, and revenue surged fivefold to $64.2 million, according to an SEC filing.

American Bitcoin became a standalone public entity after completing a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining and spinning out from Hut 8's (HUT) mining operations. Hut 8 retains a roughly 80% stake.

Shares of the company slid as much as 13% in pre-market trading as the price of bitcoin BTC$95,862.70 fell. The largest cryptocurrency dropped 7% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.

During the quarter, American Bitcoin added 3,000 BTC to take its total to 3,418 BTC. It now has 4,004, according to a post on X earlier this month. That corresponds to 432 satoshis per share. A satoshi is the smallest denomination of a bitcoin, representing one hundred millionth of the token.

Mining capacity expanded roughly 2.5 times in the period to 25 exahash per second (EH/s) with a fleet averaging 16.3 joules per terahash.

Oops, something went wrong

Strategy's co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor denied rumors that Strategy is selling its Bitcoin on X, after describing the firm's hunger for BTC as insatiable—no matter how far its price faults—in a Friday interview on CNBC.

The Bitcoin-buying firm will continue adding to its $62.3 billion stockpile, and remains undeterred by the asset's recent plunge below the $100,000 mark, he added.

“We are buying Bitcoin, [and] we'll report our next buys on Monday morning,” he said. “I think people will be pleasantly surprised. In fact, we've been accelerating our purchases.”

Meanwhile, onlookers speculated that Strategy could be selling its Bitcoin, citing on-chain movements identified by crypto intelligence platform Arkham Analytics. The movements could signal that Strategy is now using Coinbase as a custodian, Arkham added.

On prediction market Myriad, traders penciled in an 8% chance that Strategy would sell Bitcoin in 2025 on Friday, but those odds had jumped as high as 14% earlier in the day. (Disclaimer: Myriad Markets is a product of Decrypt's parent company, Dastan.)

Strategy has always maintained that it would never willingly sell Bitcoin, TD Cowen Analyst Lance Vitanza told Decrypt. There are conditions under which Strategy has acknowledged that it would essentially be forced to do so, but they are “highly unlikely,” he added.

Theoretically, Strategy could need to sell Bitcoin to satisfy the maturity of its debt, but the company doesn't have convertible bonds maturing until 2028, Vitanza noted.

The only selling that Saylor referenced on CNBC was on behalf of “OG holders,” who were taking profits at the $100,000 mark after sitting on their holdings for an extended period.

Last week, Strategy signaled that the debut of Euro-denominated preferred shares in Luxembourg would generate $715 million in proceeds.

Strategy Buys Bitcoin With Proceeds From Preferred Shares as Key Premium Evaporates

Strategy's stock price has dropped 32% over the past month as Bitcoin has shed a majority of this year's gains, with MSTR shares trading around $204, according to Yahoo Finance. Bitcoin recently changed hands at $96,365, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko, after falling to a six-month low under $95,000 earlier Friday.

Saylor said he's “fairly comfortable” with Bitcoin at its current price level, describing the asset's recent dip as something that formed a base for it to rally from. However, it's currently difficult to predict where the asset's price could be at the end of the year, he added.

In response to a question from CNBC's Joe Kernen, Saylor said the company is “always buying,” but there have been several periods where Strategy didn't announce a purchase, aligning with the end of each fiscal quarter. 

In addition to common stock, Strategy has issued a blend of products to fund its Bitcoin purchases, including convertible bonds and preferred shares that feature dividend payments.

The company's critics, including short sellers like James Chanos, have questioned the sustainability of Strategy's business, but Saylor conveyed confidence on Friday. 

Saylor said Strategy's balance sheet is stable, and that Bitcoin's price could fall 80% and the company would still be overcollateralized in relation to its debt. As of Friday, the company had raised $8.2 billion through convertible bonds, according to its website.

Since dividend payments on Strategy's preferred shares are declared by the board, Saylor added that there “is no credit default situation” for the products currently worth $7.6 billion.

As Bitcoin Plunges Below $95K, Is Crypto in a Bear Market?

Echoing Saylor's outlook on preferred shares, TD Cowen's Vitanza said “the company is not legally required to make any dividend payments,” but acknowledged that skipping or deferring payments “would obviously impact their ability to issue more preferred shares.”

What's more, Strategy has a dividend burden of around $735 million per year, and Vitanza said he would be “be very surprised if this were to become a legitimate issue.”

Saylor's remarks come as the company's go-to funding mechanism has lost its effectiveness. Historically, the company has issued common stock to grow its Bitcoin holdings, while capitalizing on a premium that its shares have over the value of its Bitcoin stockpile.

On Friday, Strategy had a market cap of $59 billion while owning $62.3 billion worth of Bitcoin, yielding a so-called mNAV, or a multiple-to-net asset value, of nearly 0.95x. Strategy's website places the informal metric around 1.2x, using a calculation that accounts for Strategy's debt.

Bitcoin's price plunged on Friday to below $95,000 for the first time in six months—but the altcoin market fared far worse, and traders who bet on rising prices are getting wiped out due to widespread liquidations.

Ethereum—the second-biggest digital coin—dipped below the $3,100 mark earlier Fridy and was recently trading for about $3,200 after a nearly 7% 24-hour dip. That makes it one of the worst-performing major cryptocurrencies of the day, according to CoinGecko data.

The coin's price is now more than 35% below its August record of $4,946.

An even bigger loser, though, has been Solana: After dropping more than 8% over a 24-hour period, the coin was priced at $142 Friday morning New York time.

The Solana price dip comes despite solid flows into new exchange-traded funds giving investors exposure to the asset. Since their October 28 debut, the funds have collected money from investors every single day, per data from Farside Investors.

But it hasn't been enough to sustain the sixth-biggest digital coin's price. Solana is now more than 52% below its January record of $293.

XRP, the fourth-biggest digital asset, also plunged, shedding about 8% of its value in a day. The coin, which also this week became available to American investors via a new spot ETF, was recently trading hands for $2.30.

Traders betting on the future price of cryptocurrencies have also lost money as their positions have been liquidated: CoinGlass data shows that $1.36 billion in futures positions have been closed over the past 24 hours. The vast number of those positions was up of long positions—$1.21 billion worth.

The overall crypto market is down more than 4% to $3.35 trillion, according to CoinGecko. Bitcoin has ticked back up to about $96,000, but remains down about 6.5% on the day.

Experts told Decrypt that the industry is currently in a bear market, with a drop in institutional demand due to macro and geopolitical uncertainties—and so far, crypto has had one of its worst fourth-quarter performances.

BitMine Immerision (BMNR), the largest corporate holder of ether ETH$3,181.38, said on Friday it has appointed Chi Tsang as its new chief executive officer, succeeding Jonathan Bates, who led the company from its early days through its listing on the NYSE American.

Shares are lower by 3.4% premarket alongside a continuing slide in crypto in general and ether in particular. Down 8.9% over the past 24 hours, ETH is now off nearly 6% year-to-date.

The company also named three new independent board members: Robert Sechan, founder of NewEdge Capital Group, Olivia Howe, chief legal officer at RigUp, and Jason Edgeworth, an asset manager for JPD Family Holdings.

The appointments are effective immediately, according to the press release.

The former bitcoin mining firm pivoted to an Ethereum-focused digital asset treasury strategy earlier this year with Wall Street veteran Thomas Lee as chairman. Since July, the firm acquired 3.5 million ETH, becoming the second largest crypto treasury trailing only Michael Saylor's Strategy. It aims to corner 5% of ether's outstanding supply, up from the current 2.9%.

The firm's stock slid over the past weeks as digital asset treasuries came under pressure in a broader crypto correction. BMNR was down another 4.5% pre-market at $35 after Thursday's nearly 10% decline.

Oops, something went wrong

New York, USA, Nov. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 



XRP has recorded another upward move in global trading markets, supported by strong liquidity and renewed interest from both institutional and retail participants. As XRP continues to gain traction, the broader conversation within the digital asset sector is shifting toward the operational frameworks that support long-term asset management.

Against this backdrop, CreditBlockchain is examining how cloud-based computing frameworks, combined with blockchain verification, can contribute to more structured and transparent digital asset operations.

XRP's Renewed Momentum and Market Interpretation

XRP's upward price trend this week follows a period of steady accumulation and growing activity within certain cross-border settlement channels. Analysts attribute the rise to improved market sentiment, favourable liquidity conditions, and increased usage of distributed ledgers in financial workflows.

Unlike previous market cycles led primarily by price speculation, this advance appears to be accompanied by heightened interest in the infrastructure behind digital assets—namely, how these systems process data, verify transactions, and support measurable outcomes for users.

A representative of CreditBlockchain noted:

“Rising asset prices often spark interest, but the underlying systems—verification, computing efficiency, and transparency—are what determine long-term confidence. Our research focuses on how cloud-based systems can strengthen these fundamentals.”

Credit Blockchain's Cloud-Integrated Approach

Credit Blockchain is evaluating how cloud computing, integrated with blockchain auditing, can assist in managing digital asset processes with greater consistency.Its operational framework is built around three primary components:

Cloud-Based Computational Automation Distributed computing resources handle repetitive tasks, performance assessments, and system monitoring without requiring user intervention.

Blockchain-Enabled Verification All operational outcomes, including resource allocation and settlement results, are recorded through smart contract mechanisms, ensuring traceable activity.

Energy-Efficient Infrastructure The platform utilises renewable energy sources and automated load balancing to maintain efficiency across its computing workflows.

This combination supports a more structured model of digital asset participation—one where outcomes are tied to transparent and verifiable processes rather than market volatility.

Illustrative Contract Parameters

Credit Blockchain manages several blockchain-validated computing contracts that operate using this integrated structure:



These figures are illustrative and may vary depending on system conditions, computational demand, and network activity.

Each contract is executed through smart contract logic, ensuring that all allocations and results remain visible on the blockchain.

A Broader Shift Toward Structured Digital Asset Systems

The recent rise in XRP has prompted renewed examination of blockchain-based operating models that emphasise clarity, sustainability, and operational discipline.CreditBlockchain's cloud-integrated structure demonstrates how digital assets can be supported through accountable systems rather than relying solely on market speculation.

“Digital asset markets benefit when users have access to transparent frameworks,” the CreditBlockchain spokesperson added.“Cloud integration helps maintain consistency, while blockchain provides the verification layer that anchors trust.”

About Credit Blockchain

CreditBlockchain is a UK-based developer of blockchain-integrated computing systems focused on traceable digital operations, renewable power usage, and verifiable smart contract governance.The organization supports responsible digital asset participation through structured computing frameworks compatible with assets such as BTC, ETH, and XRP.

Cambria launches Renown, a veNFT-inspired reputation system that tracks time and activity for NFT holders, aiming to reward loyalty and engagement in web3 ecosystems.

Eliza Crichton-Stuart

Updated Nov 14, 2025

Cambria has unveiled a new system called Renown, designed to provide a time and behavior-weighted reputation score for NFT holders. The system has been described as the “ve for NFTs,” referencing Curve Finance's veTokenomics (vote-escrowed tokens), which was introduced in 2020 to encourage long-term liquidity and engagement. 

Renown represents an evolution of Cambria's earlier Loyalty Score system, adding more nuanced tracking of NFT holder activity and engagement. The system addresses a common issue in the NFT market where long-term holders receive the same treatment as short-term, opportunistic buyers.

Without time-weighted recognition, early supporters are often disadvantaged when compared to users who rotate through projects quickly. As highlighted in Fishing Frenzy's litepaper on Proof of Contribution, “The core idea behind reputation tokens is that not all users are equal, and should not be rewarded equally.” Renown seeks to establish a similar hierarchy, differentiating holders based on their sustained involvement.

Renown generates a veNFTScore for each NFT holder, reflecting their time commitment, activity, and participation across the ecosystem. Scores increase when NFTs are held or staked over time, and through a system called Attunement, which links NFTs to in-game actions or ecosystem functions. For example, a Founder NFT could be bound to a specific game activity, guild, or digital asset, with its veNFTScore providing benefits such as cosmetic upgrades, yield, or other in-game perks. Transferring or selling an NFT resets the score, reinforcing the emphasis on sustained involvement.

This approach mirrors the principles of Curve's veTokenomics, which was designed to prevent yield-hopping and incentivize long-term loyalty. According to Curve co-founder Ben, veTokenomics “creates a temporal moat between builders and opportunists,” helping to maintain stability in the early stages of projects.

Cambria's Loyalty Score system, introduced in September 2024, tracked how long NFTs were held since minting or the last transfer. Holders who maintained their NFTs from the initial mint received recognition as First Founders, and the system offered perks and rewards to this group. Renown expands on this framework, integrating time-based scores with active engagement metrics and ecosystem participation. This allows the system to measure both passive holding and active contribution.

Renown offers several advantages for NFT ecosystems. By tracking loyalty history, it creates new design possibilities and allows for time-weighted recognition of long-term holders. It also provides a mechanism for controlling NFT supply more effectively and encouraging sustained engagement.

However, the system has potential limitations. It could overreward existing holders while discouraging new participants from entering the ecosystem. Early-stage NFTs may need to provide sufficient utility to make the system meaningful, and because NFTs are already less liquid than standard tokens, time-weighted incentives may further reduce market activity.

Cambria has already applied Renown in several ways, including weighting NFT reveals for Islands, conducting giveaways and raffles, and distributing NFTs and tokens. Looking ahead, the system may expand to offer governance power, emissions, discounts, and other ecosystem incentives tied to veNFTScores.

The introduction of Renown reflects a broader trend in web3 toward reputation-based systems. Similar initiatives have appeared in GLHFers' programmatic whitelist, Pixels' player reputation tools, and Fishing Frenzy's Proof of Contribution. These systems highlight a growing interest in sustainable reward models that emphasize loyalty, engagement, and long-term support.

What is Cambria's Renown system?Renown is a reputation system for NFT holders that tracks holding time and activity to create a weighted score called veNFTScore. It rewards long-term holders and active participants in the ecosystem.

How does Renown differ from the original Loyalty Score?While the Loyalty Score tracked only how long NFTs were held, Renown incorporates activity metrics, engagement, and Attunement, providing a more comprehensive measure of a holder's involvement.

What is Attunement in Renown?Attunement is the process of committing an NFT to specific in-game actions, assets, or ecosystem activities. It allows the NFT's veNFTScore to influence benefits like yield, cosmetics, or other perks.

Can selling an NFT affect my veNFTScore?Yes. Transferring or selling an NFT resets its veNFTScore, emphasizing long-term holding and active participation.

What future utilities could Renown offer?Cambria may expand Renown to include governance voting, emissions, discounts, and other ecosystem perks tied to a holder's veNFTScore.

Why are reputation systems becoming popular in web3?Reputation systems help differentiate long-term supporters from opportunistic participants, encouraging loyalty, engagement, and sustainable reward models for NFT ecosystems.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Early Access: Azuki Alley Escape on Telegram","https://egamers.io/early-access-azuki-alley-escape-on-telegram/","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 09:59:01 GMT","

In Brief:

Azuki Alley Escape has started its early access on Telegram, a strategic move by GAMEE in partnership with Azuki. This launch is not just about introducing a new game but is also Azuki's debut on the Telegram platform, a popular instant messaging service. This early access phase is crucial as it gives players a unique opportunity to start accumulating rewards such as coins, XP, and valuable gear ahead of the full game's release on November 20.

The strategic benefits of engaging in early access are numerous. Players get to perform pre-game tasks that reward them with coins, boxes, and XP. These aren't ordinary tasks; players can earn thousands of coins by following affiliated accounts, and inviting friends can unlock even more lucrative rewards like mini boxes and common boxes. These boxes in turn are vital as they contain gear items enhancing the player's power and capabilities in the game.

Engaging in the early access phase empowers participants to amass resources that will become scarcer once the game officially begins. Owning extra coins, boxes, and XP from the start sets a player notably ahead in the forthcoming leaderboard competitions, presenting substantial advantages when the full game phase commences.

Azuki is more than just a game. Originating from a collection of NFTs featuring anime-style characters by Chiru Labs, it has expanded into a broader universe including anime content and various collectibles. The brand's commitment to integrating anime with gaming continues as they prepare to launch Azuki TCG, a trading card game, by 2025 and develop AnimeChain, a blockchain platform catered specifically to anime-themed games.

GAMEE, acquired by Animoca Brands in 2020, has established itself as a mobile-first gaming studio adept at merging casual gaming with blockchain elements. Their successful launch of titles like Arc8 underlines their capacity to create engaging gaming experiences that dovetail with the latest in web3 technologies.

As the full game's release approaches, the early access period serves as a vital opportunity for players to fortify their inventory and skills. GAMEE has suggested that there will be a substantial prize pool associated with the leaderboard rankings by the season's end, although specifics of the prizes are still undisclosed. By engaging now, players can position themselves for potentially significant achievements as the gameplay advances.

Decentralized finance heavyweight Uniswap introduced Continuous Clearing Auctions (CCA), a new protocol aiming to facilitate token offerings through its infrastructure.

According to a Thursday announcement, Uniswap's CCA “helps teams bootstrap liquidity on Uniswap v4 and find the market price for new and low-liquidity tokens.” The company said this was just “the first of several tools” it is building to help projects launch and deepen token liquidity on the platform.

The announcement coincided with preparations for the first CCA-enabled sale. Privacy-focused Aztec Network opened its community-only AZTEC token sale on Thursday, with a public phase scheduled for Dec. 2.

The Aztec team claimed that it has “taken the community access that made the 2017 ICO era great and made it even better.” The team reportedly worked alongside Uniswap to develop the new protocol and “prioritize fair access, permissionless, on-chain access to community members and the general public pre-launch.” The team said the AZTEC token will be 100% community-owned once tokens unlock.

Uniswap and Aztec did not respond to requests for comment. 

A new token sale system

Uniswap said in the press release that “liquidity formation often happens behind closed doors,” leading to “information gaps, privileges a few players,” and sometimes “thin and unstable” markets. With CCA, the two partners hope to implement an onchain native market creation with transparent pricing, bidding and settlement, as well as gradual price discovery and automatic liquidity seeding to Uniswap's decentralized exchange (DEX).

“No gatekeepers or offchain deals,” Uniswap said.

CCA sales begin with projects defining the number of tokens on sale, the starting price, and the duration of the auction. They can also support running in tranches, verification tools such as ZK Passport (a privacy-enhanced, zero-knowledge proof-based Know Your Customer implementation), or entirely custom modules.

Users can then place their bids, specifying a maximum price and a total spend. Bids cannot be withdrawn while in range, but there is no limit on the number of bids. Each bid is automatically spread across the remaining blocks of the auction and only fills if the block's clearing price is at or below the limit price.

CCA's price discovery mechanism

At the end of each block, the protocol sets the highest price at which tokens were sold in that block. Higher bids fill first, then bids at the maximum price; everyone who fills in the block pays the same price.

Uniswap explained that as more bids divide the fixed per-block supply, clearing prices can either stay the same or increase. Early bidders are expected to get the better deals “since a larger portion of their bid can fill in earlier, cheaper blocks.”

The decentralized finance (DeFi) company announced that the CCA smart contract is now live and available to anyone. In the coming months, Uniswap also expects to release additional modules for the new token sale system.

The report came just days after Uniswap's token rallied by over 38% following the Uniswap Foundation and Uniswap Labs' proposal to activate a protocol-level fee mechanism to burn Uniswap (UNI) tokens. The team also announced a plan to burn 100 million UNI — roughly 16% of the UNI's circulating supply — from the treasury.

Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen back under $100,000, dimming expectations of a year-end push to new all-time highs. But as BTC cools, activity around its fastest Layer-2, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), is moving sharply in the opposite direction. After crossing $27 million in total funding on Thursday, the project has attracted an additional $500,000 in a matter of hours.

Now, Bitcoin Hyper is more than halfway to its next milestone at $28 million, which could be reached over the weekend – or even sooner – given the current pace of funding. A hefty $494,000 whale buy helped lift the presale to its new total and triggered the next pricing round at $0.013275 per token.

Early investors looking to join the current round have roughly 34 hours left before the next price increase, or even less if the funding target is reached early, as it was on Thursday.

After the record-breaking 43-day U.S. government shutdown came to an end – an event many risk-asset investors expected to lift crypto markets – Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto sector instead continued to decline. Coming into Friday, BTC has now slipped to $99,600 at the time of writing.

Ethereum fell 5% overnight to $3,229, Solana (SOL) dropped 4.5% to $145, and Ripple (XRP) slid 3.9% to $2.31.

The disappointing price action has investors questioning whether this downturn is simply a temporary rotation, with capital first flowing back into equities before returning to higher-beta assets like crypto. 

Still, it raises the broader question of whether BTC has enough momentum to reach the bullish price targets frequently floated by analysts, such as $200,000 or even $250,000. 

That uncertainty is underscored by analyst MMCrypto, who flagged the $99,329 zone as critical support in an X post, noting that it “must hold.” A decisive break below this level, as MMCryto's chart indicates, could open the door to much lower prices.

BITCOIN: THIS SUPPORT MUST HOLD!

Let me repeat that: IT MUST HOLD!

Yet, against this backdrop, Bitcoin Hyper presents a sharp contrast because it is seeing accelerating inflows when BTC struggles – including a massive whale allocation, as mentioned earlier, into the presale.



Source: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe390ae1d27c056b54a72ba52832c9b7a24158c93f4dff44ba1bdb6850a965905

So whether this whale is “buying when others are fearful” or simply recognizing Bitcoin Hyper's potential to both support BTC's next major move and deliver outsized returns for its own native token, HYPER, the timing is notable – and investors are carefully watching.

The reason why there's an increase in early investor participation in Bitcoin Hyper comes down to its architecture that gives BTC another avenue to derive demand from: utility.

Inside the ecosystem, developers can spin up applications using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), meaning those apps inherit Solana's speed and low-cost execution while every transaction still settles safely on Bitcoin's rock-solid base layer. In other words, users get the best of both worlds.

This setup works through a canonical bridge that ties everything back to Bitcoin. BTC gets locked down on the base layer, then re-minted inside the Bitcoin Hyper environment as a wrapped asset that can move around freely. 



That wrapped BTC becomes the currency of choice across SVM-powered apps, whether that's DeFi, gaming, or real-world utilities.

So in this model, BTC isn't just sitting pretty as a store of value – it's finally being put to work. 

And if developers continue rolling out applications that rely on BTC for everyday activity, it could open the floodgates to a new wave of demand, which not only cushions BTC from further decline but could help push it toward the ambitious targets many bulls are calling for.

While investors are betting that Bitcoin Hyper can unlock higher value for BTC itself, their immediate exposure in the presale comes through the HYPER token. And that exposure matters because HYPER sits at the center of the ecosystem's economic engine.

In Bitcoin Hyper's design, BTC serves as the medium of exchange across applications, but another currency must handle gas fees and network payments. That role belongs to HYPER, making it indispensable to the system's day-to-day activity.

Early investors are bullish because if the ecosystem captures even 0.5% of Bitcoin's supply – roughly $9.5 billion at current prices – that value would be transacting across applications that require HYPER every single time a user interacts with the network. This means anyone using the ecosystem also needs to buy HYPER, creating a built-in demand loop tied directly to BTC activity.

Ultimately, the investment thesis is simple: if Bitcoin Hyper expands what BTC can do, then HYPER becomes essential to that growth. That's why many early backers see it as the closest thing to a second chance at early-stage Bitcoin-style returns.

Even trusted crypto news site Cryptonews predicts HYPER could go 100x post-presale.



Getting HYPER tokens is currently only possible through the ongoing presale. To join, visit the Bitcoin Hyper website and buy HYPER using SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or even a credit card. 

Bitcoin Hyper recommends Best Wallet – one of the best crypto and Bitcoin wallets – where HYPER is listed under its Upcoming Tokens section, making it simple to buy, track, and claim once live.

The Best Wallet app is available for download on both Google Play and the Apple App Store.

The sharp rise in gold prices and the potential impact of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) on central bank balance sheets are among emerging areas in central bank accounting and disclosures which would gain prominence in coming days said Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Deputy Governor Shishir Chandra Murmu.

Stating that the recent sharp rise in gold prices has garnered a lot of attention and discussions globally with respect to its impact on the central bank balance sheets, Mr Murmu said this development needed wider discussion.

“The RBI conservatively revalues the gold holdings at 90% of the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) gold price. However, gold revaluation practices vary across countries and the impact of high movement in gold prices on central bank balance sheets and income needs wider discussion,” he said.

As of September 2025, the RBI held a total of about 880.8 tonnes of gold reserves valued at ₹95 billion. To keep gold prices in perspective, in the last 20 years, gold rates have gone up at CAGR of 12.5%. In the last 5-6 years, it has more than tripled, according to industry officials.

Mr. Murmu was delivering the keynote address at the first International Conference on Central Bank Accounting Practices on the subject Central Bank Accounting Practices: The Reserve Bank of India and Global Approaches. The event was organised by RBI jointly with the SEACEN Centre in Mumbai.

Mr. Murmu said the issue of potential impact of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) on central bank balance sheets had also been attracting lot of international research and discussions.

“Some research papers have tried to explore how the design choices for CBDCs adopted by central banks may shape people's behaviour with respect to adoption of CBDC and potential substitution of banknotes and/or bank deposits with CBDC,” he emphasised.

“It is also being discussed and debated globally whether and how this may impact central bank balance sheet structures and the need for liquidity operations,” the Deputy Governor pointed out.

He said these emerging aspects would require ongoing engagement and collaboration in future as central banks learn from their respective experiences. “We should work closely in these areas and share our experiences and research with each other, which will help all of us in making better decisions,” he told the audience.

On the accounting practice followed by the RBI, Mr. Murmu said since the entire ownership of RBI remains vested with the Government of India, the central bank prepares its financial statements and sets its accounting policies as per the RBI Act of 1934 and the RBI General Regulations of 1949.

“Over time, within this legal framework, these policies have evolved to keep up with changing needs and practices. The has a strong and resilient balance sheet, with adequate level of risk provisioning,” he said. “Over the years, RBI has consistently worked to align its accounting practices with global best practices, while staying true to core principles of prudence and conservatism,” he added.

Gold's soaring prices and central bank buying are prompting a global review of how gold is valued on sovereign balance sheets. The Reserve Bank of India is revaluing its gold at 90% of the LBMA price. Practices vary worldwide, necessitating wider discussion on the impact of gold price movements. This comes as India's gold reserves surpass $100 billion.

 Successful Trial Advances  Digital Asset Interoperability 

 HIGHLIGHTS 

 SINGAPORE, Nov. 14, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Citi and Swift today announced a landmark trial that proves the feasibility of settling payments between fiat and digital currencies, in a Payment-versus-Payment (PvP) workflow.

The trial demonstrates a powerful hybrid model for interoperability between traditional financial systems and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) networks.

This was achieved by leveraging existing Swift infrastructure, which was seamlessly augmented with institutional-grade blockchain connectors, orchestrators and smart contracts.

""These trials with Swift represent a significant leap forward in understanding and developing infrastructure required to support digital currency transactions,"" said Ayesa Latif, Head of FX Products. ""Our collaboration has demonstrated how existing financial systems can be enhanced with blockchain technology to unlock new levels of speed, transparency, and risk reduction in cross-currency settlements.""

 Jonathan Ehrenfeld, Head of Strategy at Swift, said: ""Swift is uniquely positioned to be the secure and trusted single point of access for seamless connection between the tokenized ecosystems and the established global financial community. This collaboration with Citi proves that we can leverage the reach of our existing network while introducing advanced capabilities required to orchestrate fiat-digital currency PvP.""

The initiative underscores Citi's commitment to delivering innovative, client-centric, and scalable solutions for the digital asset ecosystem.

The trials mark a significant milestone towards the development of market-ready solutions that can be scalable, standardized and integrated into global financial systems.

 Advancing Digital Asset Interoperability and Mitigating Settlement Risk The rapid growth of digital currencies, such as tokenized deposits and stablecoins, presents an unprecedented opportunity to revolutionize cross-border payments and financial infrastructure.

For stablecoins, Citi GPS has projected that total issuance market could reach USD1.9 trillion by 2030, driven by expanding use cases and increasing regulatory clarity. While stablecoin transaction volume is approaching USD1 trillion a month according to the report, they predominantly serve as an intermediary. Consequently, recipients of stablecoins – which are primarily US dollar denominated – often choose to exchange them for local fiat currency. 

Despite this demand, settlement between both fiat and digital currencies such as stablecoins remains challenging as they are fundamentally different in nature. Unlike fiat currencies that are typically held within accounts at correspondent banks, digital currencies are held by user wallets on various blockchains and generally do not allow for reversible transactions.

While FX messaging standards, such as MT30X, have been designed to identify digital assets and confirm FX deals on them, they are not meant to instruct synchronized settlement between fiat and digital currencies. The initiative between Citi and Swift aims to address this issue.

 How it Works:  Novel PvP ApproachCiti and Swift designed a holistic messaging standard capable of tracking the end-to-end process, from trade initiation to settlement confirmation.

This standard uniquely accounts for the distinct data fields and characteristics inherent in fiat-digital currency transactions.

The solution also incorporated an escrow mechanism to overcome the challenge of irreversible blockchain transactions, while ensuring PvP settlement and eliminating settlement risk of both parties.

A central orchestrator further managed the sequenced exchange of messages, coordinating between the fiat and DLT legs to ensure synchronization and finality. In the trial, Citi also utilized test USDC tokens from Circle on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet, to simulate a near-production environment.

Citi and Swift will continue to refine the approach in collaboration with the broader financial community and establish the messaging and operational standards necessary for scalable, institutional-grade digital asset transactions.

 *Payment versus Payment (PvP): While this mechanism mitigates settlement risk by ensuring both currency legs settle, the current implementation is not atomic. This is because the workflow spans two distinct technologies, meaning the payments are synchronized but not executed as a single indivisible transaction.

Oops, something went wrong

Cypherpunk Technologies (CYPH) is making headlines as it pivots from its biotech roots to a digital asset-focused future. The company is rebranding from Leap Therapeutics and investing heavily in Zcash after securing substantial funding. This bold transformation is shaking up market conversations.

See our latest analysis for Cypherpunk Technologies.

Cypherpunk Technologies' dramatic pivot and fresh capital sent its share price soaring 284% over the past week and 182% in the past month, even after a 14% pullback today. While the past year's total shareholder return is still down 36%, recent digital asset moves have clearly reignited market interest and strengthened short-term momentum.

If transformative stories like this have you rethinking what's possible, now is the perfect moment to explore fast growing stocks with high insider ownership.

Given such a dramatic rebranding and a multi-million-dollar crypto bet, is Cypherpunk Technologies' soaring share price a sign of undervaluation and untapped upside? Or is the market already factoring in all the future digital asset growth?

With Cypherpunk Technologies trading at a staggering price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 37, its recent closing price of $1.76 signals significant optimism compared to its US Biotech peers.

The price-to-book ratio measures how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of net assets on the company's balance sheet. For a biotech company with minimal revenue and ongoing unprofitability, this multiple is especially critical and can reflect either speculative growth expectations or risk tolerance.

Currently, Cypherpunk's P/B is far above the US Biotech industry average of just 2.5. This outsized premium suggests the market is either pricing in transformational prospects from its digital asset pivot or embracing substantial risk. Relative to historical and sector norms, such a premium is difficult to justify given a lack of forecast revenue and negative earnings trends. In short, the market's current enthusiasm appears well ahead of fundamental improvements.

See what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.

Result: Price-to-Book Ratio of 37x (OVERVALUED)

However, ongoing net losses and a total absence of revenue remain critical risks. These factors could quickly undermine investor enthusiasm if momentum stalls.

The rise of cryptocurrency has done more than just create new forms of investment. It has reshaped how people think about money itself. 

From international payments to online gaming platforms, crypto has introduced speed, transparency, and control into the mix that many traditional financial systems often struggle with.

This shift has changed what customers expect when making payments and has pushed businesses to rethink the way they process transactions. The casino industry, e-commerce platforms, and even global corporations have all felt the ripple effects of this technological disruption.

With that said, here is a closer look at why cryptocurrencies have created a change in expectations for payments. 

Before the rise of digital currencies, cross-border payments often involved long waiting times, high fees, and frustrating processes. 

International bank transfers could take days, and even domestic card payments sometimes faced unnecessary delays. Crypto changed that model by allowing users to send money across the world almost instantly.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other leading cryptocurrencies introduced the concept of peer-to-peer transactions without the need for banks or third-party institutions. People could now move funds directly, with lower fees and without intermediaries slowing things down. 

This was a revolutionary step for industries that thrive on fast, secure transfers, including online casinos and global trading platforms. The transparency of blockchain also gave users confidence. 

For example, every transaction could be tracked on a public ledger, reducing disputes and offering a level of clarity that traditional systems rarely provided. This was the first time that many people felt truly in control of their money.

The question for many people is no longer simply about which casino has the best games or the biggest promotions. Instead, payout policies are now a central factor in decision-making. People want to know where they will be treated fairly and where they can access their money without hassle.

That is why examining what is the best paying online casino has become an important part of the conversation. Players actively research which platforms offer not only strong return-to-player rates but also the fastest and most reliable withdrawal processes. 

The expectation is that if crypto can make payments nearly instantaneously, casinos should meet that standard, whether through blockchain itself or through improved traditional systems.

Crypto technology has set a new benchmark for what it means to be a ‘top-paying' casino. It's no longer only about the size of winnings but also how quickly and transparently those winnings reach the player.

Why players demand faster and transparent payouts

The gambling and casino sector has been one of the clearest examples of how crypto changed customer expectations. Players who experienced the speed of crypto withdrawals began to question why traditional payment methods took days to process winnings. 

Today's players expect payouts that are almost instant. They want to see their winnings reflected quickly and transparently, without hidden fees or unexplained delays. 

Crypto proved that this was possible, and the demand for this new way to pay for things and transfer value quickly increased. Even when players are not using cryptocurrency, they compare every experience to the speed and simplicity that blockchain first introduced.

Crypto has also become about more than just convenience and speed. Trust also plays a huge role. 

In industries where money changes hands quickly, customers are more likely to remain loyal to platforms that deliver on transparency and reliability. Delays in payouts create suspicion, while instant payments foster confidence.

The lesson of crypto payments extends far beyond online casinos. Businesses, for example, across multiple sectors, can learn from what blockchain technology has introduced to the payment landscape. Speed, transparency, and security are now essential, not optional.

The use of blockchain technology means customers expect quicker refunds and fewer complications when returning products, and for subscription-based services, it means clear billing with no hidden charges. It also means streamlined transfers for financial services that do not require waiting several business days.

Blockchain also teaches businesses about accountability. The fact that transactions can be traced on a public ledger makes companies think twice about imposing unfair fees or hiding behind complicated fine print. 

Customers today are more aware and less forgiving, largely because crypto has shown them what seamless payment systems can look like.

While not everyone uses cryptocurrency daily, its influence on payment expectations is undeniable and growing. Gradually, blockchain technology will no doubt become widely adopted and more integrated into mainstream financial systems, offering hybrid models where traditional currencies benefit from the speed and transparency of crypto infrastructure.

Central banks are even experimenting with their own digital currencies, inspired by the efficiency of blockchain. If these projects succeed, the line between crypto and traditional finance may blur further, leaving customers with payment systems that are faster, cheaper, and more secure than ever.

This bold new future could mean a complete transformation in how deposits and withdrawals are handled, for industries such as the iGaming sector, which is home to thousands of legally permitted online casinos.

It could mean seamless payments across borders with minimal fees for everyday online consumers. Finally, for businesses, it will mean adapting to a world where the old excuses of delays and opacity will no longer be tolerated.

Crypto did more than add a new asset class to the financial world. It redefined what people expect from payments. Speed, transparency, and user control are now the standard, and industries from casinos to global commerce are adapting in response.

As blockchain technology continues to develop, the businesses that thrive will be the ones that embrace these changes rather than resist them. 

Customers have seen what is possible, and there's no turning back. The future of payments will be faster, clearer, and more efficient, and it is all thanks to the disruption that cryptocurrency introduced.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","'No Truth to the Rumor': Michael Saylor Says Strategy Aggressively Accumulating Bitcoin","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/11/14/saylor-says-strategy-buying-bitcoin-shooting-down-rumors-of-sales","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 14:53:29 GMT","

Ignore the noise, says Strategy (MSTR) Executive Chairman Michael Saylor.



With bitcoin BTC$95,557.50 and Strategy's stock continuing their steep slides, Saylor in a Friday morning CNBC appearance said his company remains committed to its BTC accumulation strategy.



“We are buying bitcoin, we'll report our next buys on Monday morning,"" Saylor said, adding that the company is ""accelerating [its] purchases,"" as he hinted that recent activity on the firm's wallets will show aggressive accumulation.



That remark comes after online speculation earlier Friday suggested Strategy had been selling bitcoin as bitcoin and MSTR both tumbled. The rumors stemmed from on-chain data showing BTC moving out of company-controlled wallets.

Shortly following the CNBC appearance, Saylor took to X, saying ""There is no truth to this rumor.""

As for the plunge in bitcoin and what's next Saylor — per usual — advised frightened investors to zoom out, noting bitcoin was stuck in a range of $55,000-$65,000 only a bit more than a year ago. Even after the recent plunge, bitcoin at $95,000 today is still showing a pretty great return.

""We've put in a pretty strong base of support around here,"" said Saylor, who added he's comfortable BTC could rally from these levels.

MSTR is lower by 4% early Friday and below $200, now down nearly 35% year-to-date. Bitcoin is off its worst levels, but still 5.8% over the past 24 hours at $96,200.

For investors, the rumors weren't far-fetched. Strategy now holds more than 641,000 BTC — worth roughly $22.5 billion — while the company's market cap has fallen below that value. The gap has pushed MSTR's market-to-net-asset value (mNAV) below 1, a metric that suggests the stock may be undervalued. In that light, selling some bitcoin to stabilize the company might seem rational.

Bitcoin miner American Bitcoin (ABTC) reported a third-quarter profit and said revenue more than doubled from the year-earlier period as it expanded its mining capacity and completed its first full quarter as a publicly traded company.

Net income at the Miami-based company 20% owned by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump rose to $3.47 million, a turnaround from a $576,000 loss the year before, and revenue surged fivefold to $64.2 million, according to an SEC filing.

American Bitcoin became a standalone public entity after completing a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining and spinning out from Hut 8's (HUT) mining operations. Hut 8 retains a roughly 80% stake.

Shares of the company slid as much as 13% in pre-market trading as the price of bitcoin BTC$95,557.50 fell. The largest cryptocurrency dropped 7% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.

During the quarter, American Bitcoin added 3,000 BTC to take its total to 3,418 BTC. It now has 4,004, according to a post on X earlier this month. That corresponds to 432 satoshis per share. A satoshi is the smallest denomination of a bitcoin, representing one hundred millionth of the token.

Mining capacity expanded roughly 2.5 times in the period to 25 exahash per second (EH/s) with a fleet averaging 16.3 joules per terahash.

BitMine Immerision (BMNR), the largest corporate holder of ether ETH$3,172.64, said on Friday it has appointed Chi Tsang as its new chief executive officer, succeeding Jonathan Bates, who led the company from its early days through its listing on the NYSE American.

Shares are lower by 3.4% premarket alongside a continuing slide in crypto in general and ether in particular. Down 8.9% over the past 24 hours, ETH is now off nearly 6% year-to-date.

The company also named three new independent board members: Robert Sechan, founder of NewEdge Capital Group, Olivia Howe, chief legal officer at RigUp, and Jason Edgeworth, an asset manager for JPD Family Holdings.

The appointments are effective immediately, according to the press release.

The former bitcoin mining firm pivoted to an Ethereum-focused digital asset treasury strategy earlier this year with Wall Street veteran Thomas Lee as chairman. Since July, the firm acquired 3.5 million ETH, becoming the second largest crypto treasury trailing only Michael Saylor's Strategy. It aims to corner 5% of ether's outstanding supply, up from the current 2.9%.

The firm's stock slid over the past weeks as digital asset treasuries came under pressure in a broader crypto correction. BMNR was down another 4.5% pre-market at $35 after Thursday's nearly 10% decline.

Ethereum's ether ETH$3.172,64 fell sharply from Thursday to Friday, plunging over 10% from peak to trough a broad-market crypto selloff accelerated with bitcoin breaking below the $100,000 level.

The second largest cryptocurrency tumbled from $3,565 earlier on Thursday to $3,060 by early Friday, erasing all of past week's rebound. It recently stabilized just below $3,200, still down roughly 8% over the past 24 hours.

The move coincided with broad-market selloff on U.S. markets with stocks and bonds falling in tandem with cryptos. The U.S. government shutdown, which has just ended, weighed on liquidity conditions. Also adding to the pressure is the increasing probability of the Federal Reserve leaving rates unchanged during the December meeting.

Since the Federal Reserve's late October meeting, when chairman Jerome Powell threw cold water on near-universally expected December rate cuts, U.S.-listed spot ether ETFs have seen $1.4 billion in net outflows, Farside Investors data shows. Thursday's nearly $260 million outflow was the biggest single-day bleed in a month.

On top of that, long-term holders are also heading towards the exit door. Glassnode's blockchain data showed that long-term holders spanning 3-10 years accelerated selling to approximately 45,000 ETH (around $140 million at current prices) daily on a 90-day moving average, the highest distribution pace since February 2021.

Blockchain data also suggest deteriorating fundamentals. Monthly active addresses on the network have fallen to 8.2 million, down from over 9 million in September, while transaction fees over the past month collapsed by 42% to just $27 million, Token Terminal data shows.

ETH shattered a critical support level at $3,325, establishing a clear bearish trend with consecutive lower highs, CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model suggested.

How mRNA Vaccines Could Transform Cancer Treatment

From COVID shots to cancer therapy, mRNA is changing medicine.

By Kendra Pierre-Louis, Rowan Moore Gerety, Fonda Mwangi, Alex Sugiura & Jeffery DelViscio 

J Studios/Getty Images

Kendra Pierre-Louis: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Kendra Pierre-Louis, in for Rachel Feltman.

Cancer: it's a diagnosis that most of us have learned to fear. On the one hand decades of medical advancements have increased treatment and survival rates. A number of people who in the past might have died from cancer now go on to live long, full lives without recurrence.

But not everyone is so lucky. For certain kinds of cancers, including cancer of the pancreas, effective treatments largely remain elusive, so increasingly, researchers are looking to a perhaps unexpected tool for help: vaccines.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

It turns out that before mRNA vaccines became a key tool to protect people against COVID-19, researchers were initially eyeing them as a way to target cancer. That work continues.

To learn more about how mRNA vaccines can help battle cancer we're talking to reporter Rowan Moore Gerety. He covered this topic for the December edition of Scientific American. 

What inspired you to write this story?

Rowan Moore Gerety: When this first came on my radar about a year ago, partly, I was just surprised to be reading kind of frank mentions of cancer vaccines because, you know, growing up we think of vaccines as one of these miraculous interventions in public health that can basically eradicate a disease, right? So it's important to note that, in the cancer context, these are therapeutic vaccines, so it's not about providing immunity on the level of the population. But all the same it's the same kind of mechanism, and so I was just really interested to understand, “Wow, like, this is an approach that is seeming like it may be viable for cancer.”

That seemed like kind of a paradigm shift to me because my father's a cancer survivor. I have, as we all have, grew up hearing of people becoming gravely ill and dying with different forms of cancer, and it often just seems like a roll of the dice. To some extent it still is. But just the notion that there are interventions that might have, what I guess in my sort of layperson's brain, like, a vaccine level of effectiveness seemed kind of astounding. And so I was really interested to learn more.

Pierre-Louis: Before we get into sort of, like, what makes these vaccines so unique, I think kind of on the, like, the specter of cancer and, like, the living with cancer, in the story you talk to Barbara Brigham, a woman who has been in remission from pancreatic cancer for four years. And that's a disease where most people don't make it five years. What was that kind of, like talking to someone who, absent this treatment, should be dead?

Moore Gerety: It was really inspiring. I mean, she is a very rye personality; this maybe came across a little bit in the piece. She has what I associate with a kind of grandmotherly wisdom and very sort of upbeat spirit. But I think, if you have known anybody who gets a pancreatic cancer diagnosis, often it's something that is sort of diagnosed as a terminal illness. There is nothing to do but sort of treat it and see, “Can we get a few more months—or a few weeks, even?”

And as I note in the story, you know, she has been able to do quite a lot: She welcomed a new grandchild. She got to see all these volleyball games of her other grandchildren. She saw one grandchild get married and another start graduate work. And she lives on Shelter Island, which is near the tip of Long Island, and she sort of has had a very active and full social life, partly, not necessarily as, like, a cancer-survivor support group, but the way she explained her—she has these weekly get-togethers where they play mah-jongg and eat dessert together, which sounds just lovely.

But she's in her late 70s. The people around her, I think, are [in] their late 70s or 80s or even, in some cases, 90s. And so there's a little bit of a quality of support group to, I think, any socializing you do in that phase of life. Everybody has lost spouses, siblings; parents are long gone. And so I think it has been really meaningful for her to be able to convene a group of people and talk about surviving and talk about enjoying life on a day-to-day level. One thing I love that she said to me was her mother said you should try to have a little bit of adventure every single day. And she's adopted that as kind of a maxim over these last four years, and I think it's really served her well.

Pierre-Louis: I also like that, like, the thing that is ailing her the most right now, at least that you put in the piece, is, like, her touch of arthritis. Meanwhile [laughs], she had pancreatic cancer. And it's funny that, like, the thing that she's like, “Ah, the arthritis,” you know? [Laughs.]

Moore Gerety: And she also survived breast cancer, actually, I should note ...

Pierre-Louis: Oh, wow.

Moore Gerety: In the interim. This did not make it into the story. While she's been in remission from pancreatic cancer she has fought off a bout of breast cancer, as I understand it. That actually was communicated to us since I spoke to her.

Yeah, she has gone through a lot and, obviously, has maintained a kind of positive point of view.

Pierre-Louis: Can we talk a little bit about how mRNAs work against some cancers and how that sets them apart from existing treatments or existing understanding of, like, how cancer works?

Moore Gerety: So one of the things that makes cancer unique among diseases, or relatively unusual, is that it's not like a virus, where, you know, you have this pathogen that's introduced into the body and the body goes, “Oh, my God, you look really, really different. I better go after you and attack you with all my might.” Cancer, because it arises from these genetic mutations in our own cells, a tumor's genetics end up looking quite similar to the rest of your body's genetics. And so it creates a kind of a quandary for the immune system of figuring out, “Where is that line?”

Researchers talk about “self” versus “not self,” and one of the kind of riddles of cancer treatment for a very long time has been how the body manages to make that distinction and how we can kind of put our thumb on the scales with medical interventions to accelerate immune responses to cancer.

The earliest interventions into cancer were major surgery, right: “Let's just cut out much of the organ, or all of the organ, that's being affected. And to some extent that still happens. And then you have chemotherapy and radiation, which are targeting still pretty broad parts of the body, or systems within the body. And so naturally, through all those things, there's a lot of collateral consequences. If you've ever talked to somebody who's going through chemotherapy, they're really tired. It's, like, an extremely exhausting, taxing process. And part of that's because, like, you are absorbing these chemicals into your body that are pretty toxic. Like, so these are not things that you would do to yourself absent having a life-threatening disease.

What is different about mRNA vaccines—and in this they're kind of part of this newer generation of treatments that are called immunotherapy—is that they are trying to leverage that immune response.

And there's one more distinction to draw here, which is that about 30 years ago researchers started to have success with something called checkpoint inhibitors. So in our body we are always fighting off pathogens of one kind or another. And the body's always deciding, like, “Do I need to pay attention to you, or, oh, is this thing over here more serious?” And so part of what controls that immune response is a group of proteins called checkpoint proteins, and cancers can actually kind of trick the body using those checkpoint proteins to say, “Hey, don't worry about me. It's all good over here. We can turn off your T cells,” those killer cells that would normally come after a tumor, “and instead just let the tumor grow.” So checkpoint inhibitors are a class of drugs that has been around for 20, 25 years that act on that capacity that tumors have to sort of shut off your T cells using checkpoint proteins.

And so that's sort of the basic hallmark of immunotherapies: they're trying to intervene in the immune response. But in order to intervene there has to be an immune response. And what's new about mRNA vaccines is that mRNA is really just a set of genetic instructions. And so rather than your body needing to know, “Hey, this is what your cancer looks like,” the mRNA vaccine can actually tell your body, “Hey, this is what your cancer looks like.” And in that way it can help your body form what people call a de novo, or a brand-new, immune response rather than just amplifying the existing immune response, which is what earlier forms of immunotherapy have done.

Pierre-Louis: And my understanding is researchers who are using the mRNA, it's not, like, a standalone thing. You don't just get a one-and-done shot, and you're on your merry way. It's, like, used in conjunction with other immuno treatments.

Moore Gerety: That's right. So because cancer's so serious, and I think because of, you know, the Hippocratic injunction “Do no harm,” you can't just say, “Well, to find out if this works we're gonna withhold the cancer treatments that we know work a little bit and just give you the shot and kind of see what happens.”

So the people who participate in early studies, or really any study, of mRNA vaccines—and this is now quite a huge area; there are 50-some-odd trials going on right now. All of those people are getting kind of state-of-the-art treatment, whether it's chemotherapy and immunotherapy, surgery or radiation and immunotherapy, right—whatever the sort of cocktail of interventions that researchers determine is, like, the best treatment for that form of cancer—and then they're also getting these shots over the course of a few months or a year.

Pierre-Louis: One of the [things] that surprised me in your piece was that, you know, for most of the world, and I think for most people in the U.S., mRNAs are sort of synonymous with the COVID vaccine; that's the thing that we think of. But we're kind of thinking of it a little bit backwards, which is they were tinkering with this treatment in order to treat cancer, and then the COVID pandemic broke out, and they were like, “Hey, we actually think we can use this as an inoculate against this, you know, very deadly virus.”

Moore Gerety: Yeah, this is a fascinating story and one that I was not familiar with through the pandemic even though, you know, I have, at this point, many mRNA shots in my arm.

Pierre-Louis: [Laughs.]

Moore Gerety: So two of the people who have been really critical in this history are the founders of BioNTech, which is one of the companies that came up with the first sort of viable COVID-19 vaccine right at the end of 2020. So this is a Turkish couple in Germany named Ugur Sahin and Özlem Türeci. And they first became interested in mRNA as cancer researchers 30 years ago because they were looking at precisely this question of: “How can we find a way to boost the immune response, and how can we personalize the response?”

So, you know, a little while ago I was talking about how cancer really looks like any other part of your body. Your cancer is gonna look more like you, perhaps, than it'll look like my cancer, and my cancer's gonna look more like me than our cancers will look like one another in some sense, right? They're mutations that arise from our own genes. And so even, you know, a generation ago the founders of BioNTech were really interested in figuring out, like, “How can we personalize treatment?” And they decided to kind of bet on mRNA as a platform.

And the reasons that they took this approach is that mRNA is a set of genetic instructions, and one of its real strengths is that it's very flexible. When you change between one patient and another or one disease and another you don't need to start from scratch. You can just go in and basically splice out a portion of those genetic instructions and say, “Okay, now go look for this genetic mutation,” and everything else in the molecule can remain the same.

And so when I say everything else, what that means is the cap and tail that essentially say to the mRNA, “Go to this part of the body. Try to be stable,” right—the body's kind of a messy place. “Don't get corrupted or kind of thrown off your axis by whatever's going on inside us. And deliver your jolt,” right? So they spent, like, decades, really, tinkering with that cap and tail, the rest of the mRNA molecule, in order to say, “Hey, how can we make this really stable? How can we make it persistent? And also, how can we make it powerful enough that it will engender a really strong immune response?”

When you're going after a virus your body produces antibodies, and those antibodies can then go throughout your body and sort of do their thing and go after it. When you're going after cancer it's actually the immune cells themselves that need to attack the cancer cells. And so what that means is, in terms of the demands of your body's immune response, it's much, much larger. I think they told me you have somewhere on the order of, like, tens of thousands of cells that would need to be active and creating an adequate immune response to fight off a virus, because those antibodies are always circulating, looking for the first signs of an invasion, but [for] a cancer response you might need billions of T cells to be engaged. And so in order to sort of customize the mRNA they had to figure out, “How can we make this molecule work so that it can generate a big enough immune response?”

So they spend decades doing this: kind of tinkering with the mRNA, finding a form they like. Along comes the pandemic, and they say, “I think mRNA could really help here because it's so flexible. Each time the COVID-19 virus changes we can just tinker with that middle section and then spit out a new vaccine in a few weeks.” And lo and behold that's exactly what happened, and that's what allowed us all to get boosters throughout the pandemic that were tailored to the genetic versions of the pathogen that was sort of most in evidence around the world so that when Omicron became a thing the vaccine's tailored to Omicron, and you can suppress whatever wave is happening that looks like Omicron.

So then after the pandemic, again, they realized, “Now we have this incredible proof of concept. All of that decades of work we did sort of pursuing mRNA vaccines as a good platform for cancer treatment, now we have shown people that it's safe, we have learned a lot about how to manufacture them effectively, and now we can kind of pivot and go back towards our original research interest.” And of course, BioNTech is not the only company that was going through that journey.

Pierre-Louis: You know, so far we've been talking about this technology and how wonderful it is and how it saved lives, but there's, like, a dark side, which is kind of the combination of people more broadly becoming anti-vaccination and partly because of the rise of the Trump administration gutting the National [Institutes] of Health. This research is maybe not quite at risk but, like, potentially moving a lot more slowly and helping less people than it could otherwise. And I was wondering if you could talk more about what you've seen in that regard, what researchers have told you. Like, what are we facing in terms of, like, actually having this technology be deployable on, like, larger scale?

Moore Gerety: So we are in a really hopeful moment in terms of the science here. A lot of the technological advances that have made mRNA vaccines possible and practical as a form of cancer treatment in this moment are things that just weren't around five or even 10 years ago. It's now really, really cheap to do a genetic sequence of a tumor. You have all these tools, these algorithms that can predict how different kinds of proteins will appear in the body, and that's important to sort of figure out which of the different mutations in a tumor we might go after with a vaccine.

So all of these exciting developments have kind of converged on this field at a moment when, all of a sudden, cancer research is kind of taking it in the chin. We saw what I think a Senate report estimated to be a [roughly] 30 percent reduction in federal funding for cancer research just in the first few months of the second Trump administration earlier this year. We have since seen cuts to major federal grant programs that supported mRNA vaccines for other diseases, so those haven't yet targeted the ongoing mRNA vaccine trials for cancer, but certainly, that is an anxiety that a number of researchers expressed to me.

And I think you also have, for Americans, this new reason to question the sort of primacy of the American research establishment on a global level. And institutions that are used to getting the absolute best and brightest scientists who are up and coming from around the world flocking to New York and flocking to L.A. and Boston, wherever it may be, to, you know, go and implement their bright new ideas, those people are now starting to kind of wonder. I had a couple conversations with folks just about how different it feels to recruit young postdocs who are figuring out, “Well, where does it make sense for me to start my researching life? Is the decades-long support for the kind of science I wanna do going to be there if I decide to make that choice in the U.S.?”

And so, as hopeful a moment as it is, I think there's a very long shadow over the field at this moment because these things take generations to develop, in some ways. Even the tissue samples in the study that developed a vaccine for Barbara Brigham, you know, the people who provided the earliest tissue samples that went into that study had, you know, died years earlier. And so there's this really long-term dimension to cancer research that is very, very important, and I think the longer the sort of interruption or pause or even just sort of uncertainty persists, the more people worry, “Are we going to be able to rebuild or sustain the institutions that have made this research possible?”

Pierre-Louis: It also feels like, a little bit, like—I don't wanna say that the people, you know, who died early on were choosing to sacrifice themselves, but it is a sort of sacrifice to say, “I know that I'm not gonna survive. I'm gonna allow myself to be kind of poked and prodded for medical science so that, you know, the future generations can survive.” And it seems like we're really at risk of kind of losing that sacrifice.

Moore Gerety: A hundred percent. You need to give people a reason to feel that what they are doing is going to matter to somebody.

I think it's great that people are willing to participate in studies, but as you say it's not that it's going to negatively impact their treatment, but the sales pitch is basically, “Hey, we don't know if this thing will work. You're at the, like, most difficult moment of your life. You may have limited time left with your family, whatever you wanna accomplish in your career. You have all kinds of new metaphysical thoughts about mortality and these things. And we're asking you to spend an extra day at the hospital, to meet with one more specialist, to allow our graduate students to be in the room, to go through a kind of selection process where we determine, ‘Are you, in fact, eligible for this kind of new line of treatment?'”

And so even if it does hold out a little bit of hope for improved health, it's not always, I've gotta think, an easy trade-off. And we should really cherish people's willingness to participate in what is really a sort of an act of solidarity not only just across place, but across time, and try to support that as best we can.

Pierre-Louis: That's really beautiful, and I think that's a really good place to end this, so thank you so much for your time.

Moore Gerety: Thank you.

We Had a Name for ‘Galaxies' before We Knew They Existed

Centuries before other galaxies were known to exist, astronomers called them “spiral nebulas.” Today the defunct term still sparks confusion

Astronomy can be a difficult topic for newcomers. Like any scientific field, it has its own jargon and buzzwords—and terms with meanings that can be not only odd but downright counterintuitive.

The most obvious one is astronomers' use of the word metal to mean any element heavier than helium. Lithium? Metal. Oxygen? Metal. Carbon? That's a metal, too, as far as astronomy is concerned.

Using a single term to cover these heavier-than-helium elements makes some sense because the universe is overwhelmingly made up of the lighter stuff, so lumping everything else into one group makes the math easier. I wish our astronomical forebears had picked a better term, but here we are.

There are many more examples. The words that really irritate me are not only confusing but also obsolete. These are terms we should dump in favor of others that better reflect our more modern understanding. A great example of this is Population I, II and III stars—these really refer, in order, to stars with more metals in them, stars with fewer metals and stars that were the very first in the universe, which is ridiculously confounding.

But to our credit, astronomers do sometimes drop terms when they become outdated. It can just take a long time.

For example, I remember reading articles in older books about “spiral nebulas” when I was much younger. Nebula is a fairly generic term; it's Latin for “fog” and means any sort of diffuse deep-space object we see in the sky. Some, such as the great Orion Nebula, have little overall shape, while others, such as the Ring Nebula, are highly structured. We now know these are all immense clouds of gas and dust, and while they have a broad range of very different structures and origins, grouping them together as cosmic fuzzies is helpful in understanding them because they do have many characteristics in common.

But what about spiral nebulas?

“Spiral nebula” is a centuries-old term rich in science history. While stars appear (usually) as sharp points through a telescope, nebulas are extended and sometimes indistinct. A couple of centuries ago, when telescopes got big enough to resolve more structural details in nebulas, some were seen to have a pinwheel shape, with one or more spiral arms winding around a somewhat brighter core.

One of the best examples of such a strange body was M51, the 51st object in the catalog of the great French comet hunter Charles Messier, who made a list of fluffy, irksome objects he found that he thought could be mistaken for the comets he held precious and scoured the heavens for. (The irony: today that list comprises most of the brightest and most beautiful deep-space objects in the sky.) When English astronomer William Parsons, the third Earl of Rosse, observed M51 in 1845 using his 1.83-meter reflecting telescope, an instrument so large at the time that it was called the “Leviathan of Parsonstown,” he saw that it had spiral arms, and further observations confirmed this. It became known as the Whirlpool Nebula, the first of many spiral nebulas to be characterized as such.

Astronomers posited that the nebulas were nascent planetary systems (which we now know do sport spirals of a different sort) or stars that were colliding and flinging away material, among other things. Hypotheses abounded. Most were fanciful; none completely explained what was seen. But that started to change in the early 20th century.

At this time the commonly accepted idea was that the Milky Way was the entirety of the observable universe. Everything we saw in the sky was inside the Milky Way, so that perforce included the spiral nebulas. Many, perhaps most, astronomers thought these were in fact nebulas in the classic sense, clouds of gas inside our Milky Way.

But by the 1920s, doubts about this interpretation were on the rise. Astronomer Heber Curtis noted that the Andromeda Nebula—one of the most famous of these spiral nebulas, easily seen by the naked eye in dark skies—hosted several novae. These were stars that suddenly got much brighter than usual, then faded over many weeks. Novae were not well understood at the time but had often been seen in the Milky Way. The ones in Andromeda were much fainter than normal, though, implying that it was at a vast distance. Andromeda also had dark lanes similar to those in the Milky Way throughout its spiral structure. And observations indicated that Andromeda had a large Doppler shift, which meant it was moving very rapidly relative to the Milky Way, a peculiar property for such an object.

This led to the Great Debate, an actual formal debate on whether these nebulas were inside the Milky Way (an idea championed by astronomer Harlow Shapley) or, as Curtis argued, “galaxies” in their own right. The term galaxy itself traces back at least 600 years, well before anyone had any inkling of more than one, and is derived from the Greek galaxias, meaning “milky,” which is, of course, a reference to our own Milky Way.

It was only a few years later that a team led by Edwin Hubble showed that the spiral nebulas were in fact at great distances, millions of light-years removed from us, and were in fact galaxies. Soon most astronomers had changed their minds about the true scale of the universe, which was far larger than they had thought. Eventually galaxy became the generic handle for all such objects, no longer reserved for the Milky Way alone.

That brings us back to the term nebula. I distinctly remember that, when I was a kid, I heard astronomers still refer to the “Andromeda Nebula,” which I now find rather funny. This term was obsolete a half-century before, so any astronomer who used it back then probably did so out of habit.

This led to a wonderful discovery as I researched this column. Looking at old issues of Scientific American, I stumbled upon an article called “The Dynamics of the Andromeda Nebula,” written by famed astronomer Vera Rubin (the namesake of the recently activated Vera C. Rubin Observatory). Note her terminology; she wrote the article in 1973! That vindicates my memory of seeing the term used when I was younger. I'll add that Rubin was born in 1928, years after the Great Debate. Astronomers at the time still called them nebulas—astronomer Henry Norris Russell called the Milky Way a spiral nebula in a SciAm article in 1929—so just as I had, Rubin probably grew up hearing the term used, and it became habit.

I don't know exactly when the old term finally fell out of use, but it couldn't have been much later. While I did see it here and there when I first started reading about astronomy as a tyke, galaxy was far more common.

Words matter. What we call something shapes our understanding, our framing of how we see it. A nebula now means something quite different to a modern astronomer than a galaxy, as well it should!

It's worth thinking about how our terminology guides our thinking, and it's very much worth relitigating some terms when they cause more confusion than clarity—or keep us holding on to outdated notions better left in the history books.

Raccoons Are Showing Early Signs of Domestication

City-dwelling raccoons seem to be evolving a shorter snout—a telltale feature of our pets and other domesticated animals

With dexterous childlike hands and cheeky “masks,” raccoons are North America's ubiquitous backyard bandits. The critters are so comfortable in human environments, in fact, that a new study finds that raccoons living in urban areas are physically changing in response to life around humans—an early step in domestication.

The study lays out the case that the domestication process is often wrongly thought of as initiated by humans—with people capturing and selectively breeding wild animals. But the study authors claim that the process begins much earlier, when animals become habituated to human environments.

“One thing about us humans is that, wherever we go, we produce a lot of trash,” says the study's co-author and University of Arkansas at Little Rock biologist Raffaela Lesch. Piles of human scraps offer a bottomless buffet to wildlife, and to access that bounty, animals need to be bold enough to rummage through human rubbish but not so bold as to become a threat to people. “If you have an animal that lives close to humans, you have to be well-behaved enough,” Lesch says. “That selection pressure is quite intense.”

Proto-dogs, for example, would have dug through human trash heaps, and cats were attracted to the mice that gathered around refuse. Over time, individual animals that had a reduced fight-or-flight response could feed more successfully around humans and pass their nonreactive behavior on to their offspring.

Oddly, tameness has also long been associated with traits such as a shorter face, a smaller head, floppy ears and white patches on fur—a pattern that Charles Darwin noted in the 1800s. The occurrence of these characteristics is known as domestication syndrome, but scientists didn't have a comprehensive theory to explain how the traits were connected until 2014. That's when a team of evolutionary biologists noticed that many of the physical traits that co-occur with domestication trace back to an important group of cells during embryonic development called neural crest cells. In early development, these form along an organism's back and migrate to different parts of the body, where they become important for the development of different types of cells. The biologists hypothesized that mutations that hamper the proliferation and development of neural crest cells could later result in a shorter muzzle, a lack of cartilage in the ears, a loss of pigmentation in the coat and a dampened fear response—leading to a better chance of survival in proximity to humans.

Lesch says the neural crest cells are the most salient hypothesis scientists have to explain domestication syndrome right now, but they are still gathering and evaluating evidence for or against it. One piece of the puzzle would be seeing if domestication syndrome was observable in real time with wild animals. For the new study, she and 16 graduate and undergraduate students gathered nearly 20,000 photographs of raccoons across the contiguous U.S. from the community science platform iNaturalist. The team found that raccoons in urban environments had a snout that was 3.5 percent shorter than that of their rural cousins.

The findings fit with observations of urban foxes and mice and “indicate that once wild animals start spending time in the proximity of people, they become a little bit less afraid and perhaps even start showing physical signs of domestication syndrome,” says Adam Wilkins, a biologist at Humboldt University of Berlin, who first posited the neural crest cell explanation but was not involved in the new study.

Lesch would like to investigate further, perhaps trapping raccoons and comparing the genetics or stress hormones between urban and rural animals. She and her colleagues could also test if patterns hold true for other species such as armadillos and opossums. “I'd love to take those next steps and see if our trash pandas in our backyard are really friendlier than those out in the countryside,” she says.

In some cities, cyclists and pedestrians seem as rare as unicorns. And in others, such as Wageningen in the Netherlands—the world's top biking city, according to a recent study—they're as numerous as bees in a hive.

The authors of the study, which was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, used data from Google to determine walking and cycling rates in 11,587 cities in 121 countries, a far larger sample size than in any previous research. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they found that cities with lots of cyclists and pedestrians tend to be dense and filled with bike lanes.

The authors also found that higher gas prices meaningfully increase national walking and cycling rates. “You need carrots and sticks,” says John Pucher, an emeritus urban transportation researcher at Rutgers University, who was not involved in the study. “You need incentives for cycling and walking [combined with] disincentives to car use.”

Cities' steep terrain can discourage cycling. But the study showed that climate—even frosty winters, scorching summers and ample precipitation—is not a major barrier to high walking and biking rates. In fact, some of the world's most bike-friendly cities are windy and rainy, Pucher says.

Walking can be a necessity rather than a choice. Carole Turley Voulgaris, an urban planning researcher at Harvard University, who was not involved in the study, suspects that poverty drives high walking rates in countries such as Haiti, and she notes that car ownership provides an economic boost to low-income households.

Still, a car-free lifestyle has broader perks. The study's authors estimate that if every city had a bike network like Copenhagen's, private vehicle emissions would fall 6 percent, and annual health benefits would total $435 billion, partly because of reduced cardiovascular disease.

Besides Copenhagen, other “success stories,” according to the study's authors, include Osaka, Japan, where slow-moving cars coexist with walkers and bikers on narrow streets, and Nairobi, Kenya, which commits at least 20 percent of its transportation budget to nonmotorized travel.

In the U.S., as of the past decade only about 1 percent of trips were taken by bicycle, in contrast to 28 percent in the Netherlands. “It's not that Dutch people are genetically predisposed to cycling; it's that most Dutch cities have really good infrastructure for cycling,” says study lead author Adam Millard-Ball, an urban planner at the University of California, Los Angeles. “If it were quicker and safe to walk or bike to their kids' school or to the store or to work, then Americans would do that just as much as anyone else.”

Tar was often used to seal coffins and not an usual part of the find, but the metal bars and layers of fabric archaeologists found with the coffins raised some questions.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The only way into the sealed crypt beneath the Church of St. John the Baptist and the Five Martyrs required archaeologists to tunnel beneath the monastery complex in Kazimierz Biskupi, Poland. Once they got inside the subterranean room under the church's altar—it took a month using modern mining techniques—the team was surprised with what they discovered. 

According to a translated statement from the Kazimierz Biskupi government, the crypt featured three layers of coffins stacked on top of each other, totaling six burials, with one layer was separated by metal rods. There was also an unusual layer of a fabric and tar mixture likely used to seal a burial. 

“Such a layered sandwich of fabric and tar has never been encountered in any research, at least not in my own studies,” said Malgorzata Grupa of the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, according to the Polish Press Agency. “I'm not aware of such a case in any publication.” 

The tar and fabric mixture were likely present because of a delayed burial. Tar was commonly used to seal coffins, so using some sort of fabric may have allowed for additional layers of tar on the coffin, possibly since the deceased was traveling from a significant distance to reach the monastery's crypt.

The employment of metal rods used to separate the first layer of coffins stuck out to the archaeologists. “It must have been a significant figure, since they didn't want to place the subsequent coffins directly on top of this person's coffin,” Grupa said. “This happens occasionally, but this is the first time we've encountered such a clear situation in Poland.” 

Getting to the site wasn't easy. The crypt was walled with brick, and the team needed to mine for over a month to tunnel 23 feet into the site under the church. Investigating the crypt has only just started. “We have to carefully remove them,” Grupa said of the layers of coffins. “The two underneath aren't attached to the walls. Once we remove the largest one, we'll see the state of preservation of the lower ones.” 

It's only after the coffins get to the lab can the team start to learn more about the history of the burial, including the date and who may have been buried there. 

Entering the crypt has been a few years coming, as researchers first started work in 2022 to investigate the remains of at least 100 people from dozens of coffins in the church's vaults. Built as a church and monastery complex between 1513 and 1520, the Polish Press Agency reported the site likely held the remains of the Bernardines, owners of the monastery, and local notables. Burials there likely started in the 17th century. 

With the remains removed from much of the crypt, teams have cleaned the site and plan to open them to the public, displaying artifacts found inside, such as two women's dresses, liturgical garments likely used in the church, and other pieces of clothing. The human remains will be repositioned in a side crypt.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Physicians and fitness gurus alike know that exercise wards off some of the most debilitating age-related maladies. Now, a growing body of evidence suggests that the brain can equally benefit from a rigorous mental workout, and one of the best ways to pump some cognitive iron is to speak more than one language—preferably, many languages.

This isn't necessarily a new revelation. Studies dating back to at least 2010 have analyzed the phenomenon of bilingualism and its impacts on brain health, including diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer's. However, many of these studies relied on small sample sizes, and tracked aging in ways that made findings impossible to confidently generalize. 

“We wanted to address one of the most persistent gaps in aging research, which is if multilingualism can actually delay ageing,” Agustín Ibañez, a co-author of the study—published in the journal Nature Aging—from Adolfo Ibáñez University, told Nature.

Ibañez, along with an international team of scientists, set out to definitively discern whether multilingualism led to improved mental aging outcomes. They did so by analyzing more than 86,000 people across 27 European countries and ranging in age from 51-90, data for whom was compiled as part of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) dataset. For each participant, the team developed what they call a “biobehavioral age gap,” which the authors define as “the difference between an individual's chronological age and predicted age based on the interplay of positive and adverse risk factors.” 

Positive attributes include things like functional ability and education, while adverse ones involve things like cardiometabolic conditions, sensory impairments, and even the sex of the individual—women are twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's disease as men. A high biobehavior age gap could either mean that someone was aging particularly fast or particularly slow, depending on the gap's orientation. 

When combing through the SHARE data, the team compared biobehavior health gaps to self-reported levels of multilingualism (how advanced someone was in a particular language was not reported), and found that language-learning positively correlated to lower biobehavioral age gaps (as compared to monolingual individuals). The effect became more pronounced with each additional language learned. 

“Just one additional language reduces the risk of accelerated aging. But when you speak two or three this effect was larger,” Ibáñez told Nature. 

This study arrives at an important time for language-learning broadly. In the U.S., for example, language-learning at the university levels has steadily declined since 2010, and the arrival of artificial intelligence has experts worried that people will give up on learning another tongue entirely (though new recent research suggests that might not be the best idea). While this study has its limitations—especially in its exclusive focus on Europe—the authors hope that their research will spur action to shore up language-learning globally, both for fostering stronger social connections between different peoples and for our brain's overall health. 

“Our findings underscore the key role of multilingualism in fostering healthier aging trajectories,” the authors wrote in the study. “Ultimately, embedding multilingualism into public health and educational frameworks holds promise for improving healthy aging on a global scale.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists find a molecule that mimics exercise and slows aging","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251113071620.htm","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 04:58:19 GMT","

A new study in the journal Cell from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Xuanwu Hospital Capital Medical University explains how exercise helps the body stay youthful. The researchers also highlight betaine -- a metabolite produced in the kidney -- as an oral compound that can imitate many of the rejuvenating effects normally linked to physical activity.

Betaine is a small molecule found in foods like beets and spinach, but the body also makes it on its own. In this study, it emerged as an important signal that helps coordinate the anti-aging benefits of long-term exercise.

How the Body Responds to Exercise

The research team followed 13 healthy men over six years to observe how the body reacts to both short-term and long-term exercise. Using multiomics tools that track genes, proteins, metabolites, and gut bacteria, the scientists compared the body at rest, after a single 5 km run, and after a 25-day running program.

Their results showed that the kidney plays a central role in managing the body's response to exercise. During sustained training, the kidney produced large increases in betaine, which helped send protective, anti-aging signals throughout the body.

Solving the Exercise Paradox

The study also helps explain the ""exercise paradox,"" where a single intense workout causes stress but long-term training improves overall health. A short run triggered temporary inflammation and ""metabolic chaos,"" while regular training restored balance and strengthened the immune system.

Consistent exercise improved gut bacteria, boosted antioxidant defenses, and reversed age-related changes in T cells by stabilizing DNA and adjusting epigenetic marks such as reducing ETS1 expression. The kidney also increased its production of betaine through activity of the enzyme CHDH. Remarkably, giving betaine alone created many of the same benefits as training, including better metabolism, improved cognitive function, reduced depressive-like behavior in older mice, and lower inflammation across the body.

How Betaine Reduces Inflammation

The researchers found that betaine binds to and blocks TBK1, a kinase that drives inflammation. By suppressing TBK1 and its downstream IRF3/NF-κB pathways, betaine helps silence chronic inflammation, also known as ""inflammaging.""

This mechanism ties together the exercise paradox: short-term activity triggers survival pathways (IL-6/corticosterone), while long-term training activates the kidney-betaine-TBK1 system that promotes youthfulness. Because betaine is considered safe and effective, it may be useful for people who cannot exercise regularly. ""This redefines 'exercise as medicine',"" says co-corresponding author Dr. Liu Guang-Hui. ""This study gives us a fresh way to turn how our body works into something we can target with chemicals. It opens the door to geroprotective treatments that can tweak how multiple organs work together.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Hypersonic breakthrough could enable planes that fly 10 times the speed of sound","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251114091854.htm","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 14:45:44 GMT","

If it ever becomes achievable, hypersonic flight could dramatically reshape international travel. What currently requires an entire day could become a short trip lasting no more than a feature length movie. A route such as Sydney to Los Angeles, which now takes about 15 hours, might be reduced to only one hour.

""It really shrinks the planet,"" says Professor Nicholaus Parziale, whose work centers on turning hypersonic travel from aspiration into reality. Parziale recently received the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in recognition of his research into fluid mechanics at extreme speeds. ""It will make travel faster, easier and more enjoyable.""

The Challenges of Flying at Mach 10

Covering half the world in just one hour may seem impossible, yet the technology is not as far away as it appears. Some military aircraft already reach speeds of Mach 2 or Mach 3, which means two or three times the speed of sound. Mach 1 equals about 760 miles per hour. To travel from Los Angeles to Sydney in sixty minutes, an aircraft would need to reach Mach 10. The major obstacles are the extraordinary turbulence and heat produced during flight at these extreme speeds.

There is a fundamental difference between how air behaves around an aircraft at lower speeds and how it behaves at higher speeds. Engineers describe these conditions as incompressible flow and compressible flow. In incompressible flow, which occurs at lower speeds (below about Mach 0.3 or 225 miles per hour), the density of the air stays nearly the same. This consistency simplifies aeronautical design. Once an aircraft moves faster than the speed of sound, the airflow becomes compressible instead. ""That's because a gas can 'squish,'"" Parziale explains, meaning it can compress.

Why Airflow Behavior Matters for Hypersonic Design

When air compresses, its density changes in response to variations in both pressure and temperature. These shifts influence how an aircraft interacts with the air around it. ""Compressibility affects how the airflow goes around the body and that can change things like lift, drag, and thrust required to take off or stay airborne."" All of these factors play a major role in aircraft design.

Engineers already understand airflow fairly well for aircraft that fly below or near the speed of sound, a range called ""low Mach"" numbers. Creating hypersonic aircraft requires a much deeper understanding of how air behaves at Mach 5, Mach 6, or even Mach 10. Much of that behavior is still uncertain, except for guidance provided by Morkovin's hypothesis.

Morkovin's Hypothesis and the Mystery of Hypersonic Turbulence

Developed by Mark Morkovin in the mid 20th century, the hypothesis proposes that when air moves around Mach 5 or Mach 6, the fundamental nature of turbulence remains surprisingly similar to turbulence at lower speeds. Although high-speed airflow involves larger shifts in temperature and density, Morkovin suggested that the general pattern of turbulent motion stays mostly consistent. ""Basically, the Morkovin's hypothesis means that the way the turbulent air moves at low and high speeds isn't that different,"" Parziale says. ""If the hypothesis is correct, it means that we don't need a whole new way to understand turbulence at these higher speeds. We can use the same concepts we use for the slower flows."" This also suggests that future hypersonic aircraft may not require a completely different design philosophy.

Despite its importance, the hypothesis has lacked solid experimental validation. That gap led to Parziale's recent research, described in his study Hypersonic Turbulent Quantities in Support of Morkovin's Hypothesis, published in Nature Communications on November 12, 2025.

A Laser and Krypton Experiment Eleven Years in the Making

In the study, Parziale's team introduced krypton gas into a wind tunnel and used lasers to ionize it. This process briefly created a straight, glowing line formed by the krypton atoms. High-resolution cameras then captured how this illuminated line bent, twisted, and distorted as it moved through the airflow, similar to how a leaf drifts and spins within small swirling currents in a river.""As that line moves with the gas, you can see crinkles and structure in the flow, and from that, we can learn a lot about turbulence,"" Parziale says. He notes that developing the experimental setup required 11 years of effort. ""And what we found was that at Mach 6, the turbulence behavior is pretty close to the incompressible flow.""

Parziale's group received early support from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research Young Investigator Research Program (YIP) in 2016 and from the Office of Naval Research (ONR) YIP in 2020, with the latest work also funded by ONR.

What the Findings Mean for Future Flight and Space Access

While Morkovin's hypothesis is not yet completely proven, the new results move scientists closer to understanding how to design aircraft that can withstand hypersonic speeds. The findings indicate that engineers may not need to reinvent the fundamental approach to aircraft design for these extreme conditions, which simplifies the challenge significantly.

""Today, we must use computers to design an airplane, and the computational resources to design a plane that will fly at Mach 6, simulating all the tiny, fine, little details would be impossible,"" Parziale explains. ""The Morkovin's hypothesis allows us to make simplifying assumptions so that the computational demands to design hypersonic vehicles can become more doable.""

Parziale adds that the same principles could transform future access to space. ""If we can build planes that fly at hypersonic speed, we can also fly them into space, rather than launching rockets, which would make transportation to and from low Earth orbit easier,"" he says. ""It will be a game-changer for transportation not only on earth, but also in low orbit.""

Brain tumors, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and brain metastases, present a notable clinical challenge. Recent research highlights the presence of intratumor bacteria across many tumor types, yet the microbiome of brain tumors remains largely underexplored. Here we show that the microbiome of 322 brain tumors differs markedly by tumor type and location. Using multiple approaches to visualize, culture and sequence bacterial communities, we found that brain metastases harbor higher bacterial richness and diversity than GBM, with distinct microbial compositions. Moreover, metastases in posterior brain regions exhibited greater diversity than those in anterior regions. Pathway analysis revealed enrichment of bacterial metabolic pathways associated with tumor spread and metastasis in brain metastases while GBM was enriched with pathways supporting alternative phosphorus use. These findings provide valuable insights into the microbial landscape of brain tumors, highlighting tumor-type-specific and location-specific variation and suggesting potential roles for bacteria in brain tumor biology.

Source data

(a) Permanova results corresponding to Fig. 4a, showing tumor type-specific explained variance (R²) in the ordination space. Significance was assessed using a two-sided Permanova test with 999 permutations, followed by pairwise post hoc comparisons. P-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction. Reported values represent explained variance (R²) and adjusted P-values for tumor-type–specific sample groups. (b-c) Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on Jaccard dissimilarity indexes, comparing bacterial species profiles in GBM, breast cancer brain metastases (BCBrM), and lung cancer brain metastases (LCBrM) from (b) samples collected at Rambam and Galilee medical centers together (c) samples from all medical centers.

(d-e) Volcano plots demonstrating the differential distribution of bacterial taxa (order, class and phylum level) between (d) GBM and breast cancer brain metastases, (e) GBM and lung cancer brain metastases. A two-sided Wilcoxon test was used to calculate the P values. Dot size reflects the FDR value, with larger dots indicating lower FDR values. Significant taxa are color-coded according to the associated tumor type, meeting thresholds of effect size >5%, P-value < 0.05, and FDR-corrected Q value < 0.1. (f) Box plots showing Bray-Curtis beta diversity comparisons between matched and unmatched pairs of primary lung tumors and brain metastasis. Matched pairs represent samples from the same patient (n = 5 patients); For each patient, two samples from each condition (primary and metastasis) were included when available, resulting in multiple pairwise comparisons per patient. Unmatched comparisons include pairs from different patients. The two-sided Wilcoxon test was used to calculate the P-values. Box plots show medians as central lines. Boxes represent the interquartile range (IQR), and whiskers extend to 1.5×IQR or to the minimum/maximum values if no point exceeds that range. No outliers were removed from the plots.

Dot size reflects the FDR value, with larger dots indicating lower FDR values. Significant taxa are color-coded by tumor location, meeting thresholds of effect size >5%, P-value < 0.05, and FDR-corrected Q-value < 0.05. BrM, All brain metastases samples. P-values were calculated using a two-tailed Student's t-test for (a–f), and a one-sided binomial test for (h,i). (a-f) Box plots show medians as central lines. Boxes represent the interquartile range (IQR), and whiskers extend to 1.5×IQR or to the minimum/maximum values if no point exceeds that range. No outliers were removed from the plots. All “n” values indicate the number of independent biological replicates (patient-derived brain metastasis samples) analyzed. No technical replicates were used for statistical testing. Control groups are defined by anatomical location (different brain regions).

P-values were calculated using two-sided Fisher's exact test. (e) Box plot showing the Shannon diversity index per sample in GBM tumors compared to all brain metastases in anterior (GBM: n = 94 patients, BrM: n = 51 tumor samples from n = 38 patients) and occipital (GBM: n = 7 patients, BrM: n = 16 tumor samples from n = 12 patients) brain regions. P-value was calculated using a two-tailed Student's t-test. (f) Scatter plot showing the effects of bacterial pre-conditioned media on the response of two human glioma cell lines (T98G and U251) to TMZ treatment. Each point represents one of 30 bacterial species from genera that were identified to be prevalent in GBM tumors (n = 30 bacterial species). The x- and y-axes represent the rescue score (rScore) as explained in the methods section, where positive values represent PCM-mediated resistance and negative values represent an additive or synergistic effect between the PCM and TMZ. Colored dots represent different bacterial genera. A linear regression line is shown to illustrate the relationship between responses across cell lines. BrM, All brain metastases samples.

Human exposure to microplastics and nanoplastics (MNPs) is an emerging concern with potential implications for health. As awareness of this issue grows, it has prompted increasing scientific attention toward understanding if, and how, MNPs accumulate in human tissues. In a recent study, Nihart et al.1 used the analytical technique of pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Py-GC–MS) to detect MNPs in human liver, kidney and brain, reporting the highest concentrations in the brain, with polyethylene as the predominant polymer. The study as reported appears to face methodological challenges, such as limited contamination controls and lack of validation steps, which may affect the reliability of the reported concentrations. In this Matters Arising, we highlight methodological limitations that have general relevance for advancing robust and reproducible MNP detection in human biomonitoring studies.

There is an urgent need for targeted, evidence-based interventions to build resilience to misinformation among social media's most avid users: adolescents. Research on misinformation susceptibility is mostly focused on adults. However, adolescents encounter different types of (mis)information and undergo rapid social, emotional and cognitive changes. These changes can increase vulnerability to misinformation through social influence, emotional manipulation and cognitive biases, while also offering unique opportunities for resilience. Taking a developmental perspective, we outline how adolescents' susceptibility to misinformation differs from that of adults, propose a research agenda to systematically study these processes and introduce a Bayesian framework of belief updating tailored to social media contexts. Finally, we highlight how these insights inform age-appropriate interventions to promote resilience. This Perspective underscores the vital role that social sciences have in understanding and combating the harmful influence of misinformation on youth's beliefs and behaviours, while leveraging their strengths.

China has made no secret of its goal to attract the world's best scientists. In the past three years, a parade of highly accomplished researchers has emigrated there. 

Wolfgang Baumeister, a molecular biologist, started working in China in 2019, following nearly three decades at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Munich, Germany.

Baumeister is the pioneer of cryogenic-electron tomography, which enables researchers to construct 3D images of large molecules and the insides of cells. For this work, he was awarded Hong Kong's Shaw Prize for life science and medicine this year. Now based at the iHuman Institute at the ShanghaiTech University in China, he continues to study the molecular machinery involved in type 2 diabetes.

Nature met with Baumeister in Hong Kong. The following is an edited version of that conversation, and his talk to journalists at the Hong Kong Laureate Forum 2025.

My colleagues and I had a big European Research Council grant for work on neurotoxic aggregates inside cells. But we have mandatory retirement in Germany. My contract was extended beyond the normal retirement age, and my colleagues in China knew that and said, ‘Why not come to China and you can continue?'

I also had offers from the United States to continue my research there, but they would have requested that I move there permanently. With ShanghaiTech University, I can come and go. I have been there six times this year, typically for two weeks at a time.

There are things I had to get used to. For instance, human resources departments at universities are more powerful here. In my role as managing director of the institute in Munich, I always tried to make sure that administration serves the scientists and does not command them.

In Germany, when we bought an instrument, I was used to making that decision myself. What happens here is that the university wants the responsibility for such a decision to be with a committee, who are often non-experts. Very often I say, okay, we can pay for the instrument and then I will be told that the committee will meet in two months and then make the decision. This is often a waste of time.

But when it comes to purchasing very expensive, high-end instrumentation, such as a $15 million electron microscope, I just talked to the president of the university for 10 minutes and he approved it. The very big things are often decided spontaneously by the leadership. That is pretty good.

On Election Day, Peter Hubbard was one of two Democratic candidates who took a decisive—and surprising—victory in Georgia. Hubbard was elected to the Georgia Public Service Commission, the body that regulates the state's electric utility. It's the first time Democrats have taken statewide seats in Georgia in nearly two decades.

Residents have complained for years about a series of rate hikes from the PSC. But during Hubbard's campaigning, he noticed another topic coming up again and again with his future constituents.

“The number one issue was affordability,” he says. “But a very close second was data centers and the concern around them just sucking up the water, the electricity, the land—and not really paying any taxes.”

Georgia has become a hot spot for data center development over the past few years: Some research indicates it's one of the fastest-growing markets for data center development in the country (thanks, in part, to some generous tax breaks). It's also now a nexus for organizing against those same data centers. Community opposition to data centers, a new report finds, is on the rise across the country. And red states, including Georgia and Indiana, are leading this wave of bipartisan opposition.

The new report was released by Data Center Watch, a project run by AI security company 10a Labs that tracks community opposition to data centers across the country. The company has been keeping eyes on this topic since 2023, and released its first public findings earlier this year. (While 10a Labs does offer risk analysis for AI companies, report author Miquel Vila says that the Data Center Watch project is separate from the company's main work, and is not paid for by any clients.) But this week's report finds that the tide has turned sharply in the months since the group's first public output. The second quarter of this year, the new report finds, represented “a sharp escalation” in data center opposition across the country.

Data Center Watch's first report covered a period from May 2024 to March of 2025; in that period, it found, local opposition had blocked or delayed a total of $64 billion in data center projects (six projects were blocked entirely, while 10 were delayed). But Data Center Watch's new report found that opposition blocked or delayed $98 billion in projects from March to June of 2025 alone—eight projects, including two in Indiana and Kentucky, were blocked in those three months, while nine were delayed. One of those projects, a $17 billion development in the Atlanta suburbs, was put on hold in May after the county imposed a 180-day moratorium on data center development, following significant pushback from local residents.

There are some “methodological caveats” to the new Data Center Watch report, Vila acknowledges. The new report, which is based solely on public documents including media reports, legal filings, and social media, covers a period of time when data center construction in the US exploded: Industry website ConstructConnect estimates that US spending on data construction by August of this year exceeded all spending in 2024. More data center projects may simply mean more communities are reacting to ones coming to their backyards; more media attention on these projects also may juice up opposition. But the sharp increase in other data observed by Data Center Watch between March and June—including nearly 50,000 signatures on petitions opposing specific data centers across the country in that time period—indicates that there has been “a turning point” in the issue, Vila says.

“Before, [resistance] was something that could happen,” he says. “Now it seems that it's very likely that when you are developing [a data center], potentially someone is going to organize.”

Hubbard, who won the Georgia PSC seat, isn't the only political candidate who has had opposition to data centers play a role in their race, nor is Georgia the only battleground. In Virginia, the country's data center hub, governor-elect Abigail Spanberger said she wanted to have data centers “pay their own way” for power. Last week, climate journalism site Heatmap profiled John McAuliff, a former Biden climate adviser who won his election based in large part on opposition to data centers. Separate polling from Heatmap, also released last week, shows that less than half of Americans from all political persuasions would support a data center.

Josh Thomas is a Virginia state delegate from Loudoun County, which, the county claims, has the highest concentration of data centers in the world. He introduced multiple bills during the last legislative session to rein in data centers in Virginia, and data center issues figured prominently in his most recent election. (His opponent, a Republican, alleged that Thomas did not go far enough in trying to stop data center sprawl.)

Thomas, who won reelection last week, points to the local pushback against the proposed Prince William Digital Gateway, which would put more than 30 data centers on the edge of a national reserve located in the north of the state. A group of homeowners have challenged the project in court, and a judge voided zoning in August, which temporarily halted construction.

“The little guy finally won, which rarely happens in any industry, let alone where the Magnificent Ten play,” he says, referring to the US's biggest tech companies. “I think that rallied people politically in Virginia.”

Thomas, like Hubbard, also says he sees a lot of his constituents concerned about how data centers will affect their electricity bill. “People are just a lot more cost-conscious,” he says. Energy bills, Thomas says “are something that was kept relatively static for a number of years.” But in Virginia, electricity load from data centers are helping to drive up utility bills, Thomas says.

Both Thomas and Hubbard are Democrats, but opposition to data centers, the Data Center Watch report stresses, has been thoroughly bipartisan. And some national Republican politicians, including Sen. Josh Hawley, Rep. Thomas Massie, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, have begun to speak out against them.

“People you have got to pay close attention to your local city, county, and state approvals of data centers and demand your water and energy bills be protected!!!” Greene, who has criticized data center expansion for months, posted on X on November 7.

Big tech companies have to date made few public statements about pushback to data center projects. While some, like Meta, provide public-facing information on their data centers, others in the industry lean heavily on nondisclosure agreements when building new data centers, providing little to no information to communities about these projects—including which tech companies may be involved.

In a statement, Dan Diorio, the vice president of state policy for the Data Center Coalition, a leading industry group, said that the industry is continuing to see “significant interest” from communities across the country in hosting data centers and that members are committed to “continued community engagement and stakeholder education,” as well as “being responsible and responsive neighbors in the communities where they operate.”

“The US data center industry provides significant benefits to local communities—creating hundreds of thousands of high-wage jobs across the nation, providing billions of dollars in economic investment, and generating significant local, state, and federal tax revenue that helps fund schools, transportation, public safety, and other community priorities,” Diorio said. “All told, US data centers supported 4.7 million jobs and contributed $162 billion in federal, state, and local taxes in 2023.”

The sea change in public sentiment may not be enough to stem the market enthusiasm for data center build-out. While $93 billion in delayed and blocked investments is certainly not a small number, it's chump change compared to the massive influx of cash from big tech companies that is, analysts say, currently driving the US economy. (Meta alone said last week that it will invest $600 billion into AI infrastructure, including data centers, over the next three years.) And even though some communities are successfully pushing back against data centers, those wins can be temporary. The ruling on the Prince William Digital Gateway, for instance, was stayed in October, allowing construction to resume as the case moves towards trial next year.

Still, Thomas has big plans for data center reform in Virginia's next legislative session, including reintroducing a reform bill of his that passed the legislature in May but was vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin.

“I have Republicans and Democrats coming to me saying, ‘How can we help with this issue? My constituents are talking about it like they never have before,'” he says. “Our coalition of data center reform-minded legislators has just grown to a very large number.”

Obesity wonder drugs Wegovy and Zepbound are already showing that they can reduce the risk of cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease in addition to helping people lose weight. Now, a US-wide trial will test whether tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound, may be an effective treatment for people with long Covid.

Part of a class of drugs known as GLP-1s, tirzepatide acts on receptors in the gut and the brain to regulate appetite. As a result, people shed pounds by eating less. But decreased body weight doesn't fully explain the positive effects on the heart and kidney. Mounting evidence suggests that the drugs have a broad anti-inflammatory effect on the body—a mechanism that's of interest for treating long Covid.

As many as 20 million people in the US have experienced long Covid, a chronic condition that lasts for at least three months after an initial infection. While more than 200 symptoms of long Covid have been documented, some of the most common include coughing, shortness of breath, brain fog, fatigue, mood changes, trouble sleeping, and body aches.

Scientists still don't fully understand how and why long Covid occurs, but they've found persistent inflammation in many patients. This chronic inflammation may be caused by lingering traces of virus in the body or by misdirected antibodies, known as autoantibodies, that attack a person's own cells and tissues. The hope is that tirzepatide could tamp down this inflammation to improve patients' symptoms.

“The rationale for a GLP-1 drug is its powerful body-wide and brain anti-inflammatory properties,” says Eric Topol, a cardiologist and the director of the La Jolla, California-based Scripps Research Translational Institute, which is sponsoring the trial.

Scripps researchers are recruiting 1,000 people across the country who are 18 years of age or older and have medical documentation of long Covid. Unlike most medical studies, which typically require multiple in-person visits, the Scripps trial is fully remote. Participants will be randomized to receive either tirzepatide or a placebo by mail and will take it for a year. They'll receive a fitness tracker so that researchers can measure their step count, an important indicator of fatigue. Participants will also get a smart scale and will weigh in regularly. Since GLP-1s are used for weight management, study investigators want to make sure participants don't lose too much weight during the trial.

Julia Moore Vogel, coprincipal investigator of the trial who herself has long Covid, says the remote design of the trial was intentional. “For the long Covid population, it's so crucial, because if you're requiring people to come into a clinic, you're systematically excluding the most severely affected folks who are housebound or bedbound. It was really important to us to make sure that those people are included.”

In-person drug trials for long Covid have struggled to recruit patients because the debilitating nature of the condition makes it difficult for patients to travel for studies.

A lack of investment from the pharmaceutical industry has also stalled research. And despite a hefty $1.8 billion investment into long Covid research under the Biden administration, progress on finding effective treatments has been slow. Getting vaccinated remains the best way to prevent long Covid, and studies have found that taking the antiviral Paxlovid during an infection can also reduce the risk of developing it.

“There is an urgent need for investment in long Covid clinical trials, and in decentralized clinical trials like this one in particular,” says Hannah Davis, cofounder of the Patient-Led Research Collaborative, a long Covid research and advocacy group. “Tirzepatide has shown to have anti-inflammatory, metabolic, and cardiovascular effects that could be promising to long Covid patients.”

One published study found that in 47 people with mast cell activation syndrome, or MCAS, a condition in which white blood cells release inflammatory chemicals, 89 percent benefited from a GLP-1, especially at low doses. The findings are relevant for long Covid, which shares many symptoms with MCAS.

David Kaufman, a private practice physician who specializes in MCAS, chronic fatigue syndrome, autoimmune diseases, and chronic infections, has been treating long Covid patients with small doses of tirzepatide at his clinic, the Center for Complex Diseases, in Seattle and Mountain View, California.

He started prescribing GLP-1s off-label after some of his patients started taking the drugs for weight loss but were also reporting less fatigue. “I want to be cautious. This doesn't cure everything. What it does is it seems to move the needle so patients can become more functional, but they may still need some fine tuning with the other medication,” he tells WIRED.

To avoid unwanted weight loss and the gastrointestinal side effects that come with GLP-1s, Kaufman typically starts patients out on one-tenth of the standard starting dose of 2.5 milligrams. He currently has 40 to 50 long Covid patients who are taking microdoses of tirzepatide. At a long Covid workshop in September, Kaufman presented his and other providers' experience treating more than 350 patients with microdosing. They have found a 60 to 90 percent decrease in fatigue, brain fog, pain, and MCAS symptoms.

The Scripps trial, meanwhile, is using the standard 2.5 milligrams of tirzepatide as the starting dose. An NIH-sponsored trial also plans to test a GLP-1 drug for long Covid.

Although GLP-1s are showing knock-on benefits for a variety of symptoms and conditions, there's reason for caution. Given the spectrum of symptoms associated with long Covid, there's unlikely to be a one-size-fits-all treatment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Airports and Airlines Are Crawling Out of the Shutdown","https://www.wired.com/story/airports-and-airlines-are-crawling-out-of-the-shutdown/","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

On Wednesday evening, the longest government shutdown in US history ended. Fliers hoped it would also end the looming specter of airport cancellations and delays. Thanksgiving is coming, and with it the Sunday after Thanksgiving, the busiest travel day of the year.

Travelers should expect scattered delays and cancellations, aviation experts say, as airlines get their crews and aircraft back into place after weeks of acute staffing shortages. Last week, the US Federal Aviation Administration began requiring airlines to cancel flights, up to 6 percent of them earlier this week in 40 airports, some of the country's busiest. The agency said the measure was necessary to keep airspace safe as controllers and security professionals missed their second straight paychecks. The effects of that decision were compounded by an inadequate number of controllers on duty, which led to delays and cancellations across the country.

For the next few days, though, it'll be difficult to sort shutdown-related delays from the standard chaos of the holiday season. “It'll be hard to get everything up and running quickly, “ says Tim Kiefer, a former air traffic controller who is now a professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. “But you would have experienced some delays because of weather, equipment issues, or staffing, whether there was a government shutdown or not.”

“Airlines cannot flip a switch and resume normal operations immediately after a vote—there will be residual effects for days,” Chris Sununu, the president and CEO of the airline trade group Airlines for America, said in a written statement.

Some residual effects could last longer, as workers in the aviation system grapple with yet another interruption to their work and pay schedule. Federal employees have gone through four shutdowns in the past two decades. Controllers especially have worked long hours amid worker shortages for nearly 15 years, as years of underhiring, mandatory retirements at age 56, and Covid-era interruptions in training have made it hard to get new controllers certified and into facilities. It can take around two years—and as long as five—to train new workers to be air traffic controllers.

Unlike in past shutdowns, the FAA kept open its academy in Oklahoma City, so workers didn't have to halt their training (though they and their instructors went without pay). Still, the process of hiring new controllers stopped during the shutdown. The FAA did not respond to questions about how and when it might restart the hiring process.

“Does this deter from recruitment?” says Kiefer. “There is that potential of [prospective controllers] saying, ‘I don't want to be subject to the appropriations process every 16 months and not get paid.'”

And speaking of pay: It might take weeks for federal workers to be made whole. In 2019, Kiefer said, he didn't get his complete paycheck until about five weeks after Congress reopened the government.

If you're a Windows 11 user, and specifically an owner of a Microsoft Copilot+ PC that has the necessary AI processing power, you can now take advantage of Windows Recall. It works like a memory for your computer, using screenshots to keep track of everything you're doing on Windows, and then letting you search back through it.

The idea is to give you something like your web browsing history, but for the whole computer. If you remember an app, document, web page, or file you need to get to several hours or days later, Windows Recall can help. Thanks to Microsoft's Copilot AI, it can not only grab screenshots, but understand what's in them.

Windows Recall isn't the first tool to do this, but it has been met with a lot of criticism from a lot of users, who would rather their every computing move wasn't being recorded. Security researchers have also shown how it can be easily hacked.

So just how serious are those security and privacy concerns? And if you have Windows Recall on your PC, should you turn it on? Here's what you need to know.

It's fair to say the initial reaction to Windows Recall wasn't hugely positive: The problem with a memory for your PC is that other people might gain access to it, including staff at Microsoft—which potentially means those people are able to see your browsing history, your sensitive documents, your private messages, and potentially anything you looked at on your computer screen. The backlash was so strong that Microsoft pulled Recall for a while.

Now it's back, with changes. First, Recall is going to be off by default. It will not suddenly start tracking you without your knowledge. You need to deliberately turn it on if you want to use it. Second, all of the screenshots and other information Recall captures are stored locally on your PC. Nothing that Windows Recall does is sent to Microsoft's servers or anywhere else on the web. Files are also encrypted, making them much harder for bad actors to access.

Third, Windows Hello authentication is required to get at Windows Recall. If someone gains access to your PC, they can't open Recall without going through a face or fingerprint scan process, or entering your PIN, so it's a level of protection similar to what's on your phone. Fourth, you have the option to not save screenshots when sensitive information (such as passwords or credit card numbers) are on screen. You're also able to delete screenshots at any time.

It's quite a comprehensive package of protections, and Microsoft is hoping that it'll be enough to make you trust Recall and enable it. In return, you get the convenience of being able to retrace your steps at any point, and jump back to previous files or tasks even if you're only able to half remember them. Recall has the potential to be useful, but it's understandable why concerns have been raised about it.

Ultimately, it's a question of how much you trust Microsoft and the security around your PC. Technically, someone at Google could be snooping on your Chrome history and Gmail messages if you sync that information between devices—but Google promises that won't happen, and millions of users accept that promise in return for using all of Google's apps and tools for free. Now there's a similar decision to be made with Windows Recall.

If you want to turn on Recall to be your long-term computer memory assistant—or just for a short-term test—you can find it as one of the apps on your PC. Just search for ""Recall"" using the search box at the top of the Start menu. You'll be taken through the setup process, which includes verifying your user account identity.

While Windows Recall is running, you'll see an icon for it in the notification area on the right-hand side of the taskbar. Click its icon, and you can open the main interface, temporarily pause recording, and choose More Recall settings, which takes you to a list of options for the feature.

There's a lot you can do from this options screen, including disabling Recall. You can set how much storage space the feature is allowed to take up on disk (once you reach that limit, the oldest snapshots will be deleted first), you can delete some or all of the snapshots from the archive, and you can specify particular apps and websites that can't be screenshotted (so you can leave your bank website out of Recall, for instance).

When it comes to the main Recall interface, you'll be shown the most recent snapshot first. It'll probably be something you were just doing on your PC. Use the timeline at the top of the screen to go forwards or backwards in time, and hover over anything in a screenshot to interact with it. Available actions include copying text and images, running web searches, summarizing text, and editing pictures.

The search box up at the top of the Recall interface lets you look for apps, text, images, and more. You could type out a headline from a web page you remember, or type ""notepad"" to see all the times you've opened that app. Click through, and you're able to jump right back to whatever website or file you were looking at. And of course, the longer you use the feature, the more useful this digital memory becomes.

The Flash 22 is possibly the best value daypack on the market, especially now, on sale. This is a very lightweight, minimalist pack, but it's surprisingly comfortable. It'll handle loads up to 15 pounds without straining your shoulders, and the side stash pockets are large enough for a Nalgene bottle or rain jacket. The Flash 22 is made of 70-denier recycled ripstop nylon, which is on the lighter side, but mine has held up well, even on some rough cross country hikes in the North woods.

The ultralight cousin to the Flash 22, the Flash 18 lacks the hip belt, side stash pockets, and floating lid. The result is a stripped-down, bare-bones pack that we like because you can stuff it in your carry-on, and have a nice backpack whenever you need it. Don't load it up with more than 8 pounds of gear, and avoid anything with pointy bits, as there's no padding here, but so long as you recognize its limitations, this is a great little pack.

This no-nonsense day pack is comfortable with loads up to about 10 pounds, and has plenty of pockets for organizing your gear. The ripstop nylon body fabric is DWR coated and the back is better padded and stiffer than the Flash packs above, making it overall bit more substantial. The U-shape access panel is nearly identical to Mystery Ranch's Ripruck series, with two zipper sliders to give you quick access to the main compartment. There's also a zip pocket just under the top to give you a place to stash keys and small items. The side pockets are big enough for a Nalgene bottle and the daisy chains on the bag give you somewhere to clip extra stuff if you need to.

This travel backpack from Six Moon Designs makes it so you no longer have to pick between optimizing for air travel or carrying long distances at your destination. It's the only bag I've used that maximizes your allotted carry-on space while remaining comfortable for a walk across a mid-sized European city or even a day on the trail. The bag's square shape and suitcase handle make it easy to show the flight crew you're compliant, but once you deplane, you have adjustable shoulder straps built by a brand that makes gear for serious backpackers. There's also a padded harness with water bottle holders and a zipper pouches for Clif Bars or a flashlight. —Martin Cizmar

If I were going to live out of a single bag—traveling the world for the rest of my life—this is the bag I would bring. The GR2 is a gear-hauling monster with a ton of built-in organization options. This deal is on the 40L version, which I think is the perfect size for #onebag travel. It still manages to qualify as a carry-on bag for US flights (you may have trouble with that overseas though). The 34L waxed canvas version is also on sale for $340 ($115 off). And yes, it can double as a rucker, though there are better options if that's your main use case. See below.

This deal is only on a couple of colors, and only the X-Pac fabric, but this is the cheapest we've seen the GR1 go for in quite some time. The GoRuck GR1 (7/10, WIRED Review) is the pack that launched the company, and it's still the best and most versatile of the GoRuck lineup. This deal is on the smaller 21L pack, which I think is the perfect size for rucking, everyday carry, and weekend trips. I have lived out of the 21L bag (with a shoulder bag for my camera gear) during a weeklong trip. It was a squeeze, but it worked. The 21L GR1 is deceptively large and always seems to swallow more gear than I think it can.

If rucking is your thing, this is the GoRuck to get. It's very close to the GR1 in size, layout, and fabric options, but the Rucker adds more handles, one on each side. The handles are so that the Rucker can be used as a weight (or kettlebell) in workouts. The interior has a Ruck Plate pocket for holding weight (the 20L version can handle up to 3-pound plates while the 25L can do up to 45-pound plates). The interior pockets are the same as the GR1, but instead of zippers, you get Velcro closures.

Six Moon Design's Lunar Solo (7/10, WIRED Review) is my favorite single-wall ultralight solo tent. It's not without its quirks (read the pitching tips), but if you want something more than a tarp, that still weighs just 26 ounces (740 grams), this one is hard to beat. It's well ventilated for a single-walled tent, with the ability to raise up the front door when weather is nice. I also like that it only needs one trekking pole (or one pole if you don't hike with trekking poles). You'd be hard-pressed to find a tent even half this nice at this price.

I've noticed that, when trying to lighten their load with a smaller, lighter backpack, people then struggle to fit all their gear. The answer for sleeping bags and clothing is this compression stuff sack, which smashes anything soft down to about half the size of the same item in a regular stuff sack. This works well with sleeping bags and clothing, especially puffer jackets, but also fleece and merino wool.

The Flexlite Air camp chair is a great example of the promise of REI brand gear: It offers 90 percent of the designer item, for 70 percent of the price. It's not quite as nice as the Nemo below, but it's still comfortable (it does wobble a little, side to side when you move) and it's nearly half the price.

I rarely bring a chair backpacking, but if I did, the Nemo Moonlite Elite would be in my pack. At 18 ounces, it's one of the lightest chairs around, and it packs down nice and small. It's comfortable and reasonably stable. Nemo also solved the main problem with all pole chairs; The included base pad keeps it from sinking into soft ground.

The Petzl Tikka is the best headlamp you can buy. I've had the same Petzl Tikka for 14 years, and it's still going strong. The Tikka is not the brightest, topping out at 450 lumens, but it's plenty of light to cook by in the backcountry. There are three light modes: bright, brighter, and brightest. There's also a red light mode to retain some of your night vision. The Tikka runs on three AAA batteries (we recommend Panasonic Eneloop rechargeable batteries) and lasts over 5.5 hours.

I have never slept so well camping as I have on this mat. Technically I have the car-friendly model, but in terms of comfort, they're the same. In our guide to car camping pads the Therm-a-rest MondoKing edges out the Megamat for top pick among the monster sleeping pads, but I prefer the Megamat for it's extra warmth (it has an R-value of 8.1 to the MondoKing's R 7.0) and the soft texture of the top. It's comfortable enough to sleep directly on the Megamat.

If you get the Exped Megamat, you'll inflate it without this pump exactly one time. Then you will come back and buy this pump like a sane person. Save yourself even the one time and just get the pump with the pad. You'll never know how much you should thank me, but that's OK. Just carry on and have a good night's sleep.

My favorite stove for actually cooking real food in the backcountry, the Firebox Nano is a titanium (or steel, but I highly recommend titanium) shell that you can fit with an alcohol burner like the Trangia Spirit burner, or an isobutane burner. You can also use wood to cook directly over flames the way your ancestors did, and you should. For backpacking, with its frequent and pesky burn bans, the Firebox Gas Burner with its diffusion plate is hands down the best backcountry cooking system. It won't win you any prizes at the next /r/Ultralight get-together (the Firebox Nano on its own weighs 4.25 ounces for the titanium version), but you could be eating some delicious food in the backcountry.

This is still the best budget rain jacket you can buy. REI's Rainier Jacket is impressively waterproof and reasonably long-lasting for $70. The durable water repellent (DWR) is PFAS-free, but still pretty good. You also get taped seams and an adjustable hood, two nice features you generally don't find in jackets this cheap.

REI's Sahara Shade Hoodie offers UPF 50+ fabric (a polyester and spandex blend) to protect you from that high-altitude sun (or any sun). It's soft and stretchy, so you have a good range of movement, and there are thumbholes in the sleeves to keep them from riding up and exposing your arms. The three-panel hood has a drawstring you can use the cinch it down and keep your neck covered as well. I do prefer merino sun hoodies, but they're double the price, if not more.

Smartwool's 100 percent merino Classic Thermal base layer is a nice, heavy 250-gsm merino, base layer, making it a great base layer for cold weather. It's our top pick heavyweight base layer. It fits looser, making it feel more like a comfortable shirt. The looser fit makes it possible to use this as a second base layer over something like Ibex Woolies when it's extremely cold (this combo is something I wear all the time here in Northern Wisconsin). The bottoms are also on sale (Men's/Women's).

Icebreaker's 200 Oasis base layer is a 200-gsm base layer. This is about what most of us call a mid-weight base layer, making it a good choice for everything from cool weather hiking in the fall or spring, to skiing in the front country. The 100 percent merino fibers here are not quite as soft at the Smartwool above, but they're equally good at regulating body temperature and wicking away moisture. This is also the fastest drying merino top in our base layers guide.

REI's base layers are a solid value. If you want one base layer to do it all and don't want to spend a fortune, these are the base layers to get. You can have a crew top and bottom for less than a single garment of merino or a brand name synthetic. This is the mid-weight version, which is 220 GSM (92 percent recycled polyester, 8 percent spandex). They're comfortable with a tight, but not overly tight, fit that makes them easy to layer over, and there's nice extras like thumb loops on the sleeves.

There are tons of neck gators out there, but this is my favorite (I actually have the slightly longer version, but this is close). Like most things merino it puzzles me how this keeps me warm in the winter, and keeps the sun off my neck in the summer without making me overheat. Somehow it manages this. These make great gifts for your outdoorsy friends too.

These Fjällräven pants are among my favorite hiking pants. The G-1000 fabric is 65 percent recycled polyester and 35 percent organic cotton. They've got pockets everywhere and extras like ventilation zippers, reinforced knees (with openings for pads), and a loop on the leg to hold a axe. Do your pants have a axe loop? Didn't think so. Note that Fjällräven recently changed the fit, so if you're an old school wearer of these, size up.

REI's Magma 15 is one of our top sleeping bags. It's warm (comfort rated to 21 degrees Fahrenheit) with a 15-denier nylon ripstop nylon shell (Bluesign approved, with a non-fluorinated DWR coating to keep moisture at bay). Baffles are variably spaced and not stitched through, which helps the fill stay put and minimizes cold spots. I also really like the Magma hood, which is warm and stays on your head throughout the night. There's a nice interior stash pocket I use to keep my headlamp handy.

Nemo's Forte 20 is a 30-degree (comfort rated) synthetic-fill sleeping bag, making it a good choice for summer. It's our favorite synthetic bag. What I like most about this bag, and nearly all of Nemo's sleeping bags, is the wider cut through the torso area down to the knees. This bag is almost a hybrid of a mummy bag and your father's good old 1970s square sleeping bag. Which is to say, this bag is roomy.

We're still working on a guide to backpacking quilts, but it will probably surprise no one to learn that this is our current pick for best value quilt. Like the Magma 30 sleeping bag, the Magma quilt is not the lightest, nor the warmest, but you get a lot, for not a lot. The 15-denier shell encloses 850-fill-power water-resistant goose down that's comfort-rated down to 30 F. Weighing just 1 lb. 6 oz for a long, the Magma is on the light side for the temp rating. The foot box uses a zipper and drawstring system to be either completely open and flat, or zipped up and cinched down like a sleeping bag on cooler nights.

Our favorite sleeping bag for summer car camping, the Siesta isn't fancy, but hey, it's car camping. If all else fails, there's a car to retreat to. With that in mind, don't spend a fortune on a car camping bag if that's all you need. The Siesta gives you a nice, roomy, rectangular cut, and the 20-degree rating makes it enough for three-season trips. The bonus here is the hood, which you don't often find in this type of bag. If you don't need the hood, REI also has the new Campwell 30 degree bag on sale for $70 ($30 off).

Think of a Rumpl blanket as if your sleeping bag had a baby with the coziest lap blanket that your grandma knitted for you. They're made from DWR-treated ripstop polyester, so they're sturdy, durable, and resist getting soaked or stained. But they're also soft and warm enough to fall asleep under on the couch, and they come in a wide variety of colors and patterns (unfortunately only a couple patterns are on sale right now). —Adrienne So

It's already snowed once where I live. Now's the time to score some new ski gear—jackets, helmets, gloves, and googles are all on sale.

With an 850-fill-power goose down and a recycled ripstop nylon shell, this is one of the warmer jackets in our best puffer jackets guide. I like the zippered chest pocket (there are also two zippered hand pockets, one of which the jacket stuffs into), and at 12.5 ounces this jacket is surprisingly light for how warm it is. The front zip has a wind flap, and there's even a draft collar, something you hardly ever find in a puffer at this price. Even better, you can cinch the hood to keep cold air from blowing in the sides.

Our favorite bargain three-season puffer jacket, the REI 650 down jacket isn't as warm as the Magma above, but it's hard to argue with this price. If you need a cheap, packable jacket for those cold summits or stargazing on chilly nights, this is the jacket to get. The stitched-through baffles mean this one isn't as warm and is more susceptible to wind, but at this price, it's worth buying.

Initially I did not like the idea of a down vest. If it's cold enough to need a down jacket, my arms are probably cold too right? But then I moved somewhere cold (Why? I don't know, but I did) and realized there is an infinite variety of shades when it comes to cold. For some shades of cold, the vest is the right move. Pair it with a good base layer, maybe even a hoodie, and you have something that's warm, but leaves your arms free to swing an ax or whatever you might be doing.

Fjällräven's hybrid fill jacket uses 700-fill-power down for most of the jacket but adds recycled polyester insulation over the shoulders to help resist moisture. That later works quite well when the snow is really coming down. The hood does a good job of keeping you warm while staying out of your way thanks to two drawcord tabs at the front, and an elastic drawcord at the back. It also, as the name suggests, packs down pretty small.

A call to disrupt the People's Republic of China's economic espionage campaign against the United States was sounded in a new report by a Washington, D.C., technology think tank.

“China's campaign of economic espionage against the United States spans cyber intrusions, insider theft, and technology transfer disguised as collaboration,” declared the report written by intelligence analyst and applied historian Darren E. Tromblay and published by the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF).

“Washington must recognize that Beijing is operating an elaborate espionage ecosystem and take strategic measures to disrupt it,” it added.

China's espionage ecosystem is systemic and strategic, it explained. From state intelligence agencies to nominally private firms, Beijing coordinates cyber, human, and corporate channels to steal U.S. industrial and defense technologies.

Chinese companies in the United States act as collection platforms, it continued. Subsidiaries and “consulting” fronts recruit American talent and channel proprietary know-how back to PRC state-owned enterprises.

Despite the breadth and depth of the PRC's economic espionage campaign, it hasn't attracted the urgency of other security concerns, explained Anthony Vinci, an adjunct senior fellow in the national security program of the Center for New American Security, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank focused on U.S. national security and defense policy.

“We have traditionally treated military and political issues as a core national security concern,” he told TechNewsWorld. “We have to start treating economic espionage as one of our core national security concerns. We still don't do that as a nation.”

“Once we do that,” he said. “We need to take a whole-of-government or whole-of-society approach to it, where we're sharing authorities and counterespionage approaches across agencies, similar to how we did it with counterterrorism after 9/11.”

China's approach to espionage is more than spycraft. It's an entire ecosystem. The Chinese system is fundamentally different from other U.S. adversaries in both scale and integration, observed Michael Bell, CEO of Suzu Testing, a provider of AI-powered cybersecurity services, in Las Vegas.

“Russia conducts opportunistic espionage through intelligence services,” he told TechNewsWorld. “China operates a whole-of-society approach where companies, universities, and talent programs function as coordinated collection platforms.”

“Based on the cases we've been seeing and industry analysis, no other nation-state has achieved the level of integration where a student visa, university partnership, and a state-owned enterprise investment can all be vectors for the same operation,” he said.

“I think the Chinese Communist Party runs the most advanced data collection and espionage system on earth,” Vinci added. “Then they're combining that with cyber hacking at a scale that Russia or Iran literally don't have the resources to do.”

One of the most damaging vectors for PRC economic espionage is insider threats, according to the ITIF report. Programs such as Thousand Talents and new “foreign expert” schemes have turned engineers and researchers inside U.S. firms into conduits for trade secrets, it noted.

“Turning an insider provides both the ability to steal concepts, as well as subvert forward progress,” Trey Ford, chief strategy and trust officer at Bugcrowd, a crowdsourced bug bounty platform based in San Francisco, told TechNewsWorld.

April Lenhard, principal product manager for cyber threat intelligence at Qualys, a provider of cloud-based IT, security, and compliance solutions, in Foster City, Calif., explained that insider threats are so damaging because employees already know how to navigate systems that are gated off to outsiders.

“Trusted employees don't just steal files,” she told TechNewsWorld. “They also know to take and use processes, context, and proprietary ‘secret sauce' that costs American companies billions of dollars in R&D, while handing it over to China for free. That innovation can't be recovered once it's gone.”

Insider threats are uniquely damaging because they often bypass many traditional perimeter-focused defenses, added Eran Barak, co-founder and CEO of MIND, a platform focused on data loss prevention and insider risk management, in Seattle.

“Whether intentional or accidental, insiders already have access to sensitive systems and data,” he told TechNewsWorld. “That access, combined with a lack of visibility and control, makes it easier to exfiltrate critical information without triggering alerts.”

“Nation-state actors often exploit this by targeting individuals with privileged access, knowing that human behavior is more difficult to monitor than external network traffic,” he continued. “According to industry research, data sprawl, alert fatigue, and lack of contextual awareness in legacy security systems have made insider threats not only harder to detect, but also more impactful when successful.”

“The reality is, adversaries don't need to break in if they can log in,” he said.

The report also warned that the United States' counterintelligence capacity is eroding. Shifts in FBI and DHS priorities have weakened the government's ability to detect and disrupt Chinese theft, just as Beijing's efforts intensify, it explained.

“While it is the administration's prerogative to assess threats and how best to address them,” the report noted, “counterintelligence, particularly combating economic espionage and trade secret theft, is an essential mission that should be maintained and adequately resourced.”

The shift in government resources should be viewed as an opportunity, Suzu's Bell argued.

“China and Russia already understand that cyber espionage can't be purely government-led,” he explained. “They've built whole-of-society programs leveraging universities, companies, and networks. The U.S. needs to mirror that by deepening partnerships between federal agencies and private sector cybersecurity firms that can serve as force multipliers in the cyber fight.”

“Rather than lamenting FBI and CISA resource shift,” he continued, “we should be building stronger information sharing frameworks, bringing trusted private contractors with appropriate clearances to bridge intel gaps, and recognizing that companies in strategic sectors aren't on their own. They're on the front line, and we need to treat them as partners, not just victims to be protected.”

Chinese espionage is not a series of isolated events or a crime spree, added Qualys's Lenhard, it's an industrial drain. “Chinese espionage is a colossal campaign to accumulate American competitive capability faster than America can defend or replace it,” she said.

“To disrupt China's espionage pipeline, the U.S. has to stop treating technology theft like a compliance issue,” she continued. “Any engineered transfer of strategic technology needs to be handled as a full counterintelligence threat, not a regulatory footnote.”

Ultimately, the PRC-U.S. contest over technology secrets is not trench warfare, but rather a continually evolving fight, the report noted. “PRC objectives will continue to change, as their geopolitical objectives shift, and this will inform its targeting of specific industries, companies and technologies,” it explained.

“Changes in how the countries interact — both in the human and technical spaces — will shape intelligence methodologies and tradecraft,” it added. “The U.S. government's ability to disrupt economic espionage — especially through preemptive, strategic measures — will mitigate risk to industry.”

Auger, a startup building logistics and supply chain software, announced Yuqing Sun as its chief data and AI enablement officer. Sun joins the Bellevue, Wash.-based company from Johnson & Johnson where she has worked for nearly 20 years in a variety of supply chain, analytics and data science roles.

“Yuqing brings the rare combo of deep technical chops, operational scar tissue, and the calm that only comes from having seen every kind of supply-chain fire drill,” said Dave Clark, Auger's founder and CEO and a former Amazon executive.

Clark noted on LinkedIn that while at Johnson & Johnson, Sun worked to modernize “one of the most complex supply chains on the planet through data and AI innovations. She built and scaled more than 30 AI-driven products across optimization, simulation, IoT, machine learning, computer vision — you name it.”

Last month Auger appointed Justine Hastings as chief AI economist. The company, ranked No. 48 on the GeekWire 200 list of top Pacific Northwest startups, raised a $100 million Series A round last December.



— Amy Harris is the new public policy and government relations director for the Washington Technology Industry Association (WTIA).

For the past nine years, Harris has been a principal for Red Strategies, which bills itself as providing “fundraising consulting and event planning for right of center candidates and organizations.” She has also worked as an executive assistant for two members of Congress.

Randa Minkarah, CEO of the WTIA consortium, praised Harris' “deep experience in bipartisan coalition-building, strategic advocacy, and navigating complex political landscapes,” noting the skills will be instrumental in working in Washington state and the nation's capitol.

— Marc Brown, a former corporate vice president at Microsoft who helped lead the acquisition of companies including LinkedIn, GitHub and Minecraft, has joined the board of directors for Syncro, a software platform for IT professionals.

Seattle-based Brown was with Microsoft for more than two decades, managing more than 185 acquisitions and 80 equity investments.

— Pyramid Communications, a longtime Seattle-area public relations firm, named Emily Ryan as its first CEO. Ryan was with Pyramid for nearly 14 years before taking a year-long role as chief communications officer for Our Children's Trust in 2024.  

“During a tumultuous period in the world, Pyramid is doubling down on our commitment to support changemakers leading bold action for a better world,” the company posted on LinkedIn. “Emily's trusted, creative leadership will sustain our team and our clients as we continue to work alongside all of you…”

— Carbon Direct, a carbon management firm based in New York and Seattle, announced two leadership hires as a result of its recent acquisition of climate tech startup Pachama.

What happened to Rad Power Bikes?

That's the question on many minds in Seattle and beyond after the startup revealed Monday it is facing a potential shutdown due to “significant financial challenges.”

Rad started as a scrappy hardware startup and grew into the largest e-bike seller in North America. The company's co-founders won Young Entrepreneur of the Year honors at the GeekWire Awards. Rad raised more than $300 million in 2021 and hit a $1.65 billion valuation — a rare unicorn in Seattle.

But a series of missteps and macroeconomic challenges led to more than seven rounds of layoffs and a remarkable downfall. Rad said it could shut down as soon as January. 

“We are still exploring every viable option to preserve the brand and the community that helped build it,” the company said in a statement to GeekWire.

During a ride along the Burke-Gilman Trail in Seattle this week, we met John Ward, who was cruising on his Rad City electric bike.

“It's a bummer,” Ward said of the hometown company's struggles. “I'm 76 and I don't like climbing up the hills anymore, and I got this Rad bike and I've been very happy.”

Ward, one of nearly 700,000 Rad riders around the globe, is a longtime cyclist who said he uses the e-bike for regular rides with friends and also trips to the swimming pool, the grocery store and the farmers market. He said he's concerned that if the company goes out of business it will be tough to get parts or service.

We spoke with former Rad execs, industry experts, bike shop owners, and hardware startup leaders to understand what went wrong at the company.

Rad's story is a case study in what happens when a breakout hardware brand bets its future on a once-in-a-century pandemic demand spike — and then gets hit with a supply chain storm and the realities of venture-backed consumer hardware.

Right product at the right moment

Rad gave customers “that feeling like they were a kid again,” co-founder Ty Collins told GeekWire this week. 

The company, born from founder Mike Radenbaugh's teenage tinkering, launched a direct-to-consumer model in 2015 with an e-bike at an approachable price.

“They made bicycles accessible to people that may be intimidated going into a bike shop,” said Peter Clancy, business partner at Westside Bicycle in Seattle.

Rad opened up a new “lifestyle” market segment — sub-$2,000 e-bikes for regular people, not hardcore cyclists.

“Rad kind of built the e-bike space,” said Justin Taylor, editor at Electric Bike Report.

Marty Pluth, general manager at Gregg's Cycle, remembers commuting over Seattle's 520 bridge and seeing “a ton of Rad bikes” owned by people in a ski jacket or baggy shorts — a sign the company had unlocked a new kind of customer.

Scrappy and scaling

The company's early team was a ragtag crew doing multiple jobs at once. It was also methodical. “We just really efficiently scaled our spend,” Collins said. 

Rad quickly found product-market fit after an initial crowdfunding campaign. From there, sales kept booming, from Ballard to Berlin. “We'd sell thousands of bikes in seconds,” Collins said. “We literally couldn't keep bikes in stock.”

The company reported $100 million in revenue in 2019 and landed investment from Darrell Cavens and Mark Vadon, former Zulily and Blue Nile execs. Later that year it inked a delivery partnership with Domino's. 

“I see a business with super passionate customers, a cool product, and awesome entrepreneurs,” Vadon told GeekWire that year. “That's what you want to be investing in.”

Pandemic boost

Then the e-bike market exploded as the pandemic hit. People wanted to get outside and have fun. There was also a climate-friendly element. 

Rad cited a 297% increase in demand in May 2020.

COVID brought the classic “is this a blip or a new normal?” dilemma for Rad and many other e-commerce companies experiencing a surge of orders.

“The thought was that this was a catalyst in the electric bike boom,” Collins said.

No matter what, “we had to make sure that we had inventory for it,” Collins said. “If people wanted to buy bikes, we needed bikes.”

Step on the gas

Rad raised more than $300 million from investors in 2021, doubled headcount to more than 600 employees, and bet big on sustained demand.

But like many other businesses during the pandemic, Rad dealt with supply chain delays and disruption. The company went to great lengths to meet demand — in mid-2021, it bought 64 containers and chartered its cargo from Asia into a non-traditional port near Seattle.

Bike companies over-ordered on long lead times assuming COVID demand would keep going, according to Pluth. But he said the surge slowed dramatically by the summer of 2022.

“Prices were driven down, margins were driven down,” Pluth said. “Rad was affected — everybody was.”

As the pandemic demand settled, Rad was saddled with hundreds of millions of dollars of inventory. 

“We just had too much inventory liability that we couldn't be flexible,” said Leah Hunkins, a former supply chain leader at Rad. “It's like walking around with a bowling ball around our ankles and going for a run — you can't move.”

Pluth stressed that selling bikes below cost to clear inventory can be problematic.

“The more you sell, the more money you're losing,” he said. “You're in between this double-whammy of lower demand and a lot of product in stock. The other companies were able to work through that, given they have a lot longer track record and more diversified product. I'm just not sure Rad was able to do that.”

A growth-at-all-costs mindset may have made sense while Rad's bikes were selling faster than they could be built. But it ended up causing problems down the road as the company started missing revenue expectations.

“The only thing we're probably guilty of is being overly optimistic that Rad was on this trajectory of growth that would never stop,” Hunkins said.

Collins, who stepped down in 2021, said the scarcity mindset began to shift once the company started raising outside capital. “When you have more money to spend … it does present a lot more doors that, in theory, could be opened,” he said. “It gives you a lot of keys to a lot of doors.”

He added that the “internal secret sauce” to Rad's success was allowing employees to “take real ownership over the brand and feel like they were really a part of everything.”

New kids on the block

At the same time, Rad faced an influx of strong competitors — Lectric, Velotric and others — plus traditional brands finally moving into e-bikes, all slicing off pieces of the pie.

As more options arrived — from cheap Amazon imports to higher-end brands — Rad was squeezed in the middle: not the cheapest, not the most premium.

“The differentiation of our product got more challenging,” Hunkins said. 

Ward, the rider on the Burke-Gilman, agreed that a saturated market may have created trouble for Rad. During his short stop to talk to GeekWire, cyclists riding e-bikes from Aventon, Lectric, Emotion, Super 73, Gazelle, Urban Arrow and more passed by on a trail that's been dominated by Rad in recent years.

Clancy noted how easy it was for new entrants to appear. “It takes nothing to become a bike brand,” he said. “If you have one decent credit card, you can order a dozen bikes, and off you go.”

Lawsuits, layoffs, recalls

Rad faced other speed bumps including a wrongful death lawsuit, a lawsuit related to property damage, and the recall of nearly 30,000 units due to a safety issue. More recent online posts about Rad highlight customer service issues.

While Rad's direct-to-consumer strategy was an advantage early on (shorter supply chain, bypass bike shops), it carried long-term service obligations. Rad's scale meant tens of thousands of riders looking for service in markets where independent shops had to juggle labor costs, parts sourcing and warranty expectations on bikes they didn't sell.

“It worked in the beginning, until people started having problems with proprietary parts,” said Matt Thomas, owner of The Polka Dot Jersey bike shop in Seattle.

Over time Rad had to stand up its own stores and service network to support hundreds of thousands of bikes in the wild — an expensive, operationally complex layer on top of already thin hardware margins.

Rad shut down its mobile services arm in 2022 and cut 100 jobs. Later that year, Radenbaugh stepped down as CEO. Rad pulled out of Europe starting in 2024 and closed some service shops. 

Meanwhile, the company went through multiple rounds of layoffs under new CEO Phil Molyneux, the former Sony president who departed earlier this year. The company is now led by CEO Kathi Lentzsch, who previously ran Bartell Drugs as CEO before the company sold to Rite-Aid in 2020.

Hard times for hardware

Rad's challenges reflect broader difficulties facing consumer hardware startups in the post-2022 investment climate.

“Hardware success requires patient capital as it will take a long time and money to build an enduring brand,” said Clayton Wood, former CEO of Seattle-based cooking automation startup Picnic. “That capital is very scarce in the last few years.”

Wood noted that pre-2022, venture capital focused on creating unicorns, and hardware companies could raise on high valuations because of high price points and gross profits. “In 2022 the game changed, leaving anyone who raised prior with overvalued companies,” he said. It's easier to pivot in software, he said, but hardware has high production setup and development costs. 

Amish Patel, managing director at Conduit Venture Labs, a hardware-focused startup studio, also pointed out structural challenges. 

Patel said consumer hardware companies with unit-margin-based business models face particular challenges. Hardware brands selling $250+ products rely almost entirely on consumer demand and scale, he said, and when margins tighten — with no software, service, or subscription revenue to offset — the business becomes extremely fragile.

“Add together over-ordering from the boom, inventory risk as demand cooled, high interest and debt servicing costs — and you get classic hardware scaling pain,” Patel said.

Rad's funding rounds may have been seen as a sign of strength. But others see it differently.

“It just seemed weird that a company like that couldn't stand on its own without huge cash influxes,” said David Johnson, owner of Electric & Folding Bikes Northwest. “It just didn't seem sustainable.”

Thomas, the owner at Polka Dot, shared a similar sentiment.

“I don't quite understand why anyone thought during the pandemic that they were going to sustain a 500% increase in business year-over-year for five years,” he said. “I mean, I own a bike shop. I'm not an analyst. But that one didn't seem too hard to figure out.”

GeekWire contacted Vadon and Cavens for comment, but have not heard back. The company's other investors include Fidelity Management & Research Company, Counterpoint Global (Morgan Stanley), Cercano Management, Durable Capital Partners LP, The Rise Fund (TPG's multi-sector global impact investing strategy), and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates.

The future of e-bikes

Rad wasn't the only e-bike maker to struggle. Europe's VanMoof filed for bankruptcy in 2023, while Belgium-based Cowboy and other rivals have struggled to find footing after pandemic-era highs. Some cite tariffs as a headwind.

But bike shop owners say e-bike demand remains strong. “We had three people today come in asking about e-bikes,” said Clancy of Westside Bicycle. 

The U.S. e-bike market is expected to reach $87.1 billion by 2032, up from $54.1 billion in 2025, according to MarketsandMarkets.

Rad says its team is working to “stabilize the business” and explore options for a long-term path forward. The company is still selling bikes and is promoting a Black Friday sale on its site.

“They are a good quality company that makes good bikes,” said Taylor, of Electric Bike Report. “And I do think the industry is better with them here.”

A German court has found that Google has abused its dominant market position in the price comparison sector and ruled that the company must pay a total of €572 million ($665.6 million) in damages to two German price comparison companies, according to a report by Reuters.

Google must pay the price comparison platform Idealo about €465 million (about $540 million) in damages, and €107 million (about $124 million) to Producto, another price comparison tool, the report said.

Idealo had claimed damages of €3.3 billion from Google, arguing that its lawsuit was a direct response to the European Court of Justice's ruling in 2024 that found the search giant was self-preferencing its own shopping comparison service, breaking competition rules, and fined it about $2.7 billion. 

Idealo said on Friday that it intends to continue its case against Google and seek the full damages it had sued for.

“We welcome the court holding Google accountable. But the consequences of self-favoring go far beyond the amount awarded. We will continue to fight – because market abuse must have consequences and must not become a lucrative business model that is worthwhile despite fines and compensation payments,” Idealo's co-founder and CEO Albrecht von Sonntag said in a statement.

Google said it intends to appeal both rulings. “The changes we made in 2017 are working well, with no intervention from the European Commission. The number of price comparison sites in Europe using the remedy Shopping Unit has multiplied from seven then to 1,550 today,” a Google spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

The company added that it offers rival comparison shopping services the same opportunity as Google Shopping to display ads, and said Google Shopping operates as if it were a separate business, participating in auctions the same as everyone else.

The ruling follows close on the heels of an EU investigation into how Google's spam policy affects publishers' search rankings. The company was recently fined €2.95 billion (just under $3.5 billion) by the EU for allegedly breaching EU antitrust rules by favoring its own advertising services. 

Note: This story was updated to add a comment from Google.

Meta is getting ready to launch third-party chat integration on WhatsApp in Europe, the company announced on Friday. The tech giant notes that the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) requires it to give users in Europe the option to chat with people using third-party messaging services that have chosen to make their apps interoperable.

“Following successful small-scale tests over the past months, the option for WhatsApp users to chat with users of messaging apps BirdyChat and Haiket directly via third-party chats will soon be rolling out across Europe,” Meta wrote in a blog post. “This marks a significant milestone in Meta's compliance with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) interoperability requirements.”

Users in Europe who have opted in to the third-party integration will be able to share messages, images, voice messages, videos, and files. The option to create groups with third-party users will launch once Meta's partners are ready to support it, the company says.

Over the coming months, users in the European Region will begin seeing a notification in the “Settings” tab that will explain the process of opting in to connect with people on third-party apps. Third-party integrations will only work on Android and iOS, not on desktops, web, or tablets.

Of course, connecting with people on other messaging apps is optional, and users can turn third-party chats on or off at any time.

Meta says its partnerships with BirdyChat and Haiket are the result of a three-year collaboration with the European messaging services and the European Commission to develop a third-party chat solution that complies with DMA requirements. 

Additionally, the company notes that third-party messaging must use the same level of end-to-end encryption as WhatsApp. Meta also says it has ensured that users will understand the differences between chats on WhatsApp and third-party chats.

Back in September 2024, Meta shared what third-party chats on WhatsApp will look like, noting that users will be able to set up a designated folder for third-party messages or opt for a combined inbox. The company also said at the time that it would notify users each time a new third-party messaging app became available.

Payment technology company Pine Labs, backed by PayPal and Mastercard, won over public investors on Friday, finishing its first day of trading 14% higher even after lowering its valuation for its $440 million IPO. This makes it the second-largest Indian fintech listing this year after online brokerage Groww's nearly $750 million debut earlier this week.

The stock opened at ₹242 and rose as high as ₹284 before settling at ₹252, up from the issue price of ₹221, resulting in a market capitalization of ₹289 billion (approximately $3.3 billion) for the Gurugram-based company. 

It's a step down from Pine Labs' 2022 private valuation of over $5 billion, but still a clear signal that investors are backing India's growing push to take its fintech model global.

Founded in 1998, Pine Labs has been steadily expanding beyond India and now operates in 20 markets, including Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, the UAE, the U.S., and some parts of Africa. What started as a point-of-sale terminal provider has since evolved into a broader payments platform that supports bill payments, account-aggregator transactions, and a range of merchant and acquiring services.

In India, Pine Labs competes with the likes of Razorpay, Paytm, and Walmart-owned PhonePe. The company became profitable in the June quarter, posting a net profit of ₹47.86 million (about $540,000), compared with a loss of ₹278.89 million a year earlier. Revenue from operations rose 17.9% year-over-year to ₹6.16 billion (around $69 million), while its overseas business contributed roughly 15% of total revenue, rising to ₹943.25 million (about $11 million) from ₹795.97 million a year earlier.

“We will never stop being a startup,” said Amrish Rau, CEO of Pine Labs, during its public listing ceremony. “Now that we are a listed company, [that word] will not be heard in our halls.”

Existing investors, including Peak XV Partners, Temasek Holdings, PayPal, and Mastercard, were among those who sold part of their holdings in the public listing.

“Pine Labs never wanted to compete on price,” said Shailendra Singh, managing director at Peak XV Partners. “It always wanted to compete on a superior proposition. And we know this company would keep compounding because there were such strong moats in the business, and it shaped our worldview of how to think about companies and be patient and let ecosystems mature.”

Peak XV Partners, which split from Sequoia Capital in 2023, first invested in Pine Labs in 2009 amid the global financial crisis. The VC firm is also seeing back-to-back partial public exits this week, as Pine Labs is its second portfolio company to list after Groww, which debuted on Indian exchanges with a 12% pop and closed its first trading day 29% above its issue price of ₹100.

Pine Labs' market debut is part of a broader wave, as the public-listing engine in India is revving up. From tech and fintech to e-commerce and manufacturing, more startups are choosing to go public — fueled by strong domestic investor appetite, eased interest-rate conditions, and regulatory nudges to boost listings. Globally, finance has been the top IPO sector this year, with IPOs worth $34.34 billion so far in 2025, more than doubling the $14.05 billion raised over the same period in 2024, according to Dealogic.

With its public debut, Pine Labs plans to keep widening its geographic footprint while deepening its presence in India with new products and services aimed at the country's rapidly expanding, internet-driven consumer base.

“Our core business will keep expanding. Our moats will be strengthened, and margins will grow,” Rau said.

The Pixel 10 Pro Fold won't look very different if you place it next to last year's Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Besides Google's AI chops, there is not much of an overhaul at first glance. However, this is the first foldable to receive an IP68 rating, and that counts for something.

Ever since companies started launching foldables, durability has been the prime concern for users. The longevity of hinges, protection of the inner screen, and resistance of these devices against liquid and sand are always big considerations when buying a foldable as compared to a slab phone.

Google's Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the company's attempt at alleviating those worries. The device closely resembles its predecessor, but there are a few key changes that make the phone sturdier.

First is a new gearless hinge, which adds a bit of resistance to folding and unfolding the phone. Because of the new hinge, there is very little gap when the phone is folded. This ensures that fewer dust particles and other debris can get inside and potentially damage the screen. While I didn't get the phone in any sand, I kept it in my bag and my pocket multiple times to see if lint from either place had any effect. However, the phone continued functioning as usual.

I didn't submerge the phone in water, either. Still, having IP68 protection means that the phone should withstand dust and water better than its predecessor. 

Apart from the sturdiness upgrade, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold gained a new Tensor G5 processor. While it's fine for most day-to-day tasks, as my experience suggests, there is some discussion about how it doesn't perform as well as some other processors in benchmark tests.

Other hardware changes in the 10 Pro Fold involve a bigger battery than last year, which is a welcome change. Plus, the phone has a brighter screen, so it's easier to use outside in the daylight. One notable thing about the display is that the bezel around the screen is much thicker than what I have seen on other recent phones, including both foldables and slab phones.

Since this is a Pixel phone, Google added a number of AI features to the software. These additions include Magic Cue, which surfaces snippets and suggestions based on screenshots and data from apps like Maps, Gmail, Messages, and Keep. You also get call translation, Gemini Live with video view, and a camera coach to guide you to take photos. (These features are already present on the Pixel 10 Pro, and you can read more about how they work here.)

For Pixel phones, the camera has been a central story for years now. The Pixel 10 Fold Pro has camera specs similar to last year's device. This means there is a 48-megapixel main sensor, a 10.8-megapixel telephoto sensor with 5x optical zoom, and a 10.5-megapixel ultrawide sensor. It also has a pair of 10-megapixel sensors as the selfie camera on both the cover display and the inside display.

This setup is not on par with the Pixel 10 Pro's 50-megapixel main sensor and a pair of 48-megapixel sensors for ultrawide and telephoto. Meanwhile, the Pixel Pro 10 also has a 42-megapixel selfie camera.

The photos from the Fold's main camera provide good details, but that is not the case with both the telephoto and ultrawide lenses. In low light, only the main camera holds some water, but the Pixel 10 Pro cameras outshine it. 

One gripe I have with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold camera is that whenever I wanted to take a photo of a small object, like an AirPods case, the camera triggered macro mode, even when it was not super close to the object.

The jury is out on how much AI should be used in photos, but if you are a fan of the Pixel AI Zoom feature, which can let you use 100x zoom, you will be disappointed to know that the feature is missing on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold.

It is hard to expect a phone not to have a name that is a mouthful in this era. However, Google's inclusion of “Pro” in the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is a tad confusing. The company released the Pixel Fold in 2023, and then changed the naming scheme last year. 

Usually, Pro is reserved for the top-tier phone of any lineup. Unless you count the display size and battery size — which result in the form factor — the foldable falls short in the camera, cooling, and charging departments.

The camera is a step down from the Pixel 10 Pro, as we described earlier. Plus, Google only included vapor chamber cooling for its Pro slab phones. And the 25W Qi2 charging is reserved for the Pixel 10 Pro XL. Some of this might be a limitation because of the foldable form. But then, why not drop the Pro name?

Google also needs to encourage developers to adopt third-party apps to fit the foldable experience, besides tweaking its own apps and making the overall multitasking performance less glitchy. It would be good to see Google implement something like Samsung's multi-window feature on Pixel foldables.

Amid manufacturers like Samsung, Oppo, and Honor racing to build thin foldable phones, Google has produced a proudly chunky and hefty foldable. The company has concentrated on making it more sturdy and long-lasting with the new hinge and the IP rating. 

The phone's camera bump is not as massive as some of the Chinese manufacturers have on their devices. That means it holds a bit better when you lay it down on a flat surface. The cameras don't match up to the Pixel 10 Pro line, which is a bummer. But if you are not hung up on camera performance, Pixel Fold cameras are not a bad bet. 

The Pixel 10 Pro sells at a listed price of $1,799 — $200 cheaper than Samsung's Z Fold 7 — but you can get discounts on various sites. If you want a fully baked Google or Pixel experience in a foldable form factor, this device is for you.

TikTok is rolling out a new feature that will allow users to share content from Amazon Music to the social network, the company told TechCrunch exclusively. 

With a new “Share to TikTok” button, Amazon Music users can share songs, albums, playlists, and personal listening highlights from their Insights on Amazon Music directly to TikTok. 

For context, Amazon Music Insights is a new personalized feature that gives listeners a detailed look at their music habits and stats. It includes “Monthly Recaps” that spotlight your top artists, songs, podcasts, and total listening time. Amazon Music users can now share these stats directly to TikTok. 

TikTok already supports “Share to TikTok” features for both Spotify and Apple Music. 

TikTok says the update builds on its current partnership with Amazon Music through its “Add to Music App” feature that allows users to save the songs they discover on TikTok directly to Amazon Music and other leading streaming services. 

Thursday's announcement makes sense for TikTok, an app known for influencing which songs top the charts. By adding Amazon Music to its “Share to TikTok” options, TikTok gains an increased ability to connect users with their favorite songs and artists.

OpenAI on Thursday introduced a group chat feature for ChatGPT. The feature, currently being tested in select regions, including Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan, lets users collaborate directly within the app.

The group chat is available to Free, Plus, and Team users on both mobile and web platforms. OpenAI says the pilot is designed to explore how people use group conversations in ChatGPT.

The announcement comes after earlier reports that OpenAI had been testing a direct-message-style tool. 

The ChatGPT maker describes this pilot as just a “small first step” toward creating a more “shared experience” in the app. Early users will be invited to provide feedback, which the company says will help shape how the feature eventually expands to more regions and offerings.

According to OpenAI, private chats and personal ChatGPT memory stay completely private. Group chats are invitation-only, and members can leave at any time. Most participants can remove others, though the group's creator can only leave voluntarily. For users under 18, content is filtered, with extra safeguards and parental controls in place.

Starting a group chat is easy. Just tap the people icon and add participants, either directly or by sharing a link. Groups can include one to 20 people. If you add someone to an existing chat, a new group is created, leaving the original conversation unchanged. Each group has a short profile, and all chats are organized in a labeled sidebar for easy access.

Group chats work just like regular ChatGPT conversations but with multiple people joining in. GPT‑5.1 Auto handles responses and comes loaded with features such as search, image generation, file uploads, and dictation. In group chats, ChatGPT's usage limits — which restrict how many AI responses users can receive per hour — only count when ChatGPT responds. Messages between human participants don't count toward these limits.

ChatGPT has learned new social skills for group chats, knowing when to jump in and when to stay quiet. You can tag “ChatGPT” to get it to respond. It can also react with emojis and use profile photos to create personalized images for the conversation.

The group chat feature represents the latest step in OpenAI's gradual transformation from a simple AI assistant into something resembling a social platform. In late September, the company launched Sora 2, a stand-alone social media app with a TikTok-style feed for sharing AI-generated videos, complete with algorithmic recommendations based on user activity and location, parental controls, and direct messaging capabilities.

When something has a name for 15 years, it tends to be pretty sticky.“OS/X”, though, that's just someone messed up and jumbled two names together.

During that time I also used Windows and Linux from time to time. Their names didn't change in a way where just calling them that was perceived as incorrect.

It requires macOS 13.0 (High Sierra, 2017) or later, which is several releases after it stopped being called OS X. 10.11 (El Capitan, 2015) was the last OS X.

reply

By contrast, macOS 13 is Ventura, from 2022.(I personally would accept someone referring to High Sierra as “OS X” because it's still version 10 of the Macintosh OS, even if Apple dropped that branding a few years earlier.)

I'm a self hosting GoGogs / Gitea user for almost 10 years, I did follow the Gitea fork. However regarding the Forgejo fork: the main contributors stayed with Gitea. The ideologically forked Forgejo made some license changes and hard fork decisions that increased the maintenance burden even more, resulting in missing upstream features and decreased security. Forgejo is more busy managing ideals, than creating software.

But then a couple of years have passed, and I started to hear about Forgejo more often only very recently, so I was wondering, if maybe the original project actually had some downfall and questionable technical decisions since. I still haven't switched, and was wondering if I should do so. As far, as I've heard it's still basically a matter of running the different docker container with the same volume, and it should work seamlessly. So what's about this ""hard fork"" you are mentioning? Did it actually break compatibility?

OLED panels and high refresh rates tend to drive gaming monitor prices high enough to question your entire hobby. The LG 34GX90SA just hit $679 on Amazon, slashed from its $1,399 list price, and this price makes premium curved ultrawide gaming a lot more accessible.

In one package, you're getting a 34-inch WQHD OLED display featuring a dramatic 800R curve, a 240Hz refresh rate, and 0.03ms response time that gets rid of the motion blur and screen tearing problems affecting normal monitors. This is the lowest price we have tracked for this monitor since it was released so it's been the early Black Friday deal gamers have been waiting for all year.

See at Amazon

That 240Hz refresh rate and the 0.03ms gray-to-gray response time of OLED creates motion clarity that no LCD panel can match, regardless of price. Fast-paced shooters like Valorant or Apex Legends benefit a lot from this speed, and allows you to track enemies through quick movements without ghosting or motion blur which causes you to miss shots.

The response time is basically a measure of how fast individual pixels change colors, and at 0.03ms, this monitor reacts about 100 times faster than typical gaming monitors that hover in the range of 3-5ms. This technical advantage translates into clearer visual information during heated moments of gameplay where split-second decisions make all the difference between winning and losing.

Where the OLED panel technology pays off is in perfect blacks created by turning off individual pixels rather than backlighting that bleeds through, like LCD displays. That equates to a contrast ratio of 1.5 million to 1-the darkest darks and brightest brights can exist on-screen at the same time without washing each other out. Games like Cyberpunk 2077 or horror titles like Resident Evil Village take on incredible depth and atmosphere when the shadows actually look black instead of murky gray. The 1300-nit peak brightness ensures HDR content displays properly with brilliant highlights that pop off the screen while the DisplayHDR True Black 400 certification guarantees consistent HDR performance across different content types.

Color accuracy goes up to 98.5% of the DCI-P3 color space which matters for both gaming and creative work like photo editing or video production. This wide color gamut means you see colors as developers intended them-from the vibrant neon lights of futuristic cityscapes to the subtle earth tones of realistic military shooters. Content creators working on projects bound for film or streaming platforms can trust the colors that show up on this monitor to accurately represent what viewers will see on other DCI-P3 calibrated displays.

The 800R curvature creates an immersive and wraparound effect that extends your peripheral vision and pulls you deeper into game worlds. That 800R measurement means the monitor would form a complete circle with an 800mm radius if you extended the curve all the way around, creating a much more dramatic bend than the gentle 1800R or 1000R curves found on most curved monitors.

Both AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-SYNC compatibility eliminate screen tearing and stuttering by synchronizing your graphics card's frame output with the monitor's refresh rate. This works across the whole 48-240Hz variable refresh rate range, keeping visuals smooth as the frame rate drops to 60fps in demanding scenes or hits 240fps in less intensive moments.

The integrated webOS platform converts this game monitor into a smart display, streaming Netflix, Prime Video, Disney Plus, and more than 300 free LG Channels without the need for a connected PC or streaming device. Cloud gaming services like Nvidia GeForce Now, Amazon Luna, and Blacknut run natively from the monitor's UI, enabling you to game without a dedicated gaming rig by streaming games over your internet connection. USB Type-C connectivity offers 65W power delivery to charge laptops while simultaneously passing video and data over a single cable, which cleans up desk space and streamlines your setup.

For $679, this gets you a monitor that's cheaper than many basic 1440p gaming monitors, but includes OLED quality that usually demands $1,000-plus pricing.

Jack Dorsey made a lot of people unhappy in 2017. His website (then called “Twitter”) had acquired the TikTok precursor known as Vine, but despite all the viral fun, the bird app didn't know what to do with it and decided to shut it down. At the time, Vine was the closest to the kind of micro-entertainment brain candy that ByteDance has since spread to all corners of the globe. People loved it, and they were sad to see it go. But, as it turns out, the Dorsey giveth just as much as he taketh away.

That's only a way of saying that Jack appears to be giving new life to the app whose life he originally cut short. Dorsey's non-profit, “and Other Stuff,” has been working on launching an archive of some 100,000 old Vine videos, TechCrunch reports. The videos will be available in an app, dubbed deVine (get it?), which will be hosted on Nostr, an open-source protocol.

“Nostr — the underlying open source protocol being used by diVine — is empowering developers to create a new generation of apps without the need for VC-backing, toxic business models or huge teams of engineers,” Dorsey shared with TC, in a statement. “The reason I funded the non-profit, and Other Stuff, is to allow creative engineers like Rabble to show what's possible in this new world, by using permissionless protocols which can't be shut down based on the whim of a corporate owner.”

Evan Henshaw-Plath, who is identified as a former Twitter employee (and who goes by the name of “Rabble), is identified as the project leader for diVine. Rabble, who now works with “and Other Stuff,” told TechCrunch that resurrecting the videos was all about doing something fun.

“So basically, I'm like, can we do something that's kind of nostalgic?” Rabble told the outlet. “Can we do something that takes us back, that lets us see those old things, but also lets us see an era of social media where you could either have control of your algorithms, or you could choose who you follow, and it's just your feed, and where you know that it's a real person that recorded the video?”

“I wasn't able to get all of them out, but I was able to get a lot out and basically reconstruct these Vines and these Vine users, and give each person a new user [profile] on this open network,” Rabble said, noting that they had been able to breath new life into “about 150,000 to 200,000 of the videos from about 60,000 of the creators.”

The beta test of the iOS app launched on Thursday and quickly ran out of available slots for new users but you can try it on the web here.

Bitcoin wallet and lending platform Lava has come under scrutiny in the past few weeks due to a lack of clarity around a recent update. According to numerous users of the app, the rug was pulled out from under them in a way, as the update in question completely altered the wallet's trust and security model by switching from a non-custodial setup to a fully trusted and custodial model where Lava has full control over users' digital assets.

According to a report in Blockspace, the controversy started in September when Lava users were shown a screen that indicated an update was necessary to gain access to all of the latest features. Notably, the update screen did not indicate there would be a complete alteration of how custody of user funds was handled behind the scenes in the Lava app. Additionally, there was no way to access loans that had already been taken out via the app without the update.

Eventually, Lava CEO Shehzan Maredia made an X post on some changes that had been made in terms of how the financial app functions behind the scenes. The details of the changes outlined in the post are somewhat murky, but the takeaway for many was that Lava would be moving to a completely custodial model. In response, Foundation Head of Physical Design Owen Kemeys publicly asked on X for more specifics about what exactly had changed and whether those alterations had already been implemented via an update of the app.

The move to a custodial model for Lava would be particularly odd, as Maredia has a long list of posts on X regarding the problems with custodial setups. Additionally, while all this was happening, Lava had also announced a new $200 million fundraising round. Maredia allegedly told Blockspace that a post-mortem regarding this event would be provided on Wednesday, but such an update providing more clarity had not been published as of the time of this writing on Thursday.

Hold on. Lava was founded as DLC based and ""non custodial""; ie local keys (for what that's worth – not 100% accurate whilst lender is also the oracle, but, baby steps).

1. I have an active loan.2. I used to have ""contracts updating, please wait"" type loading screens.3. There…

One of the biggest criticisms of the crypto space, more generally, is the large amount of decentralization theater that takes place. This issue was on full display a few weeks ago when a large amount of crypto infrastructure went down amid an Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage. A large part of the decentralization theater that has occurred in crypto over the years has also been centered around stablecoins, and there is an increasing sense that much of the technology used in crypto is now mainly focused on regulatory arbitrage for centralized entities rather than any sort of cypherpunk philosophy.

In the aforementioned X post by Maredia, the Lava CEO said they are taking a different approach than those who use “trustless theater” in the crypto industry. However, the level of decentralization involved in Lava's app was questioned in the past, as it was originally built on the concept of Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) with Lava itself eventually acting as the relevant oracle. Additionally, the Lava app has also operated on a closed-source basis this whole time, so what exactly has been happening behind the scenes hasn't really been known.

Stablecoins are just traditional fintech that have to use the word ""blockchain"" for regulatory arbitrage purposes. Doesn't really make sense to build on Bitcoin. Solana is so centralized it's basically just traditional fintech. Maybe ""stablechains"" eventually used.

— Kyle Torpey (@kyletorpey) November 13, 2025



Users of closed-source crypto wallets are effectively using a custodial system, as they have no way of knowing whether the developers behind the app have access to users' private keys. Open source software is generally viewed as a requirement for any Bitcoin-related software, as the whole point is to operate as a decentralized financial system without trusted third parties. This is also why the Bitcoin Core node client goes the extra mile with practices such as reproducible builds and forcing users to manually opt in to software updates.

Due to the embrace of crypto by the Trump administration, there could be a continuation of this bifurcation of the space between Bitcoin's focus on decentralization and fintech-esque use cases that heavily involve centralized stablecoins.

Portable Bluetooth speakers solve a common problem: you want quality sound that follows you around without being tied to outlets or bulky equipment. The Anker Soundcore 2 has become one of the most popular portable speakers on Amazon, earning the number one bestseller spot in its category with over 141,000 customer ratings.

Amazon just launched early Black Friday deals exclusively for Prime members, and this speaker has dropped to an all-time low price of $29, down from its regular $44 price tag. This puts a trusted Anker speaker at the same price point as generic no-name alternatives which makes this deal really compelling.

See at Amazon

The Soundcore 2 provides 12 watts of total audio power via dual neodymium drivers-a type of high-performance magnet usually used in much more expensive speaker systems. Neodymium drivers offer stronger magnetic fields in a compact size, enabling these speakers to produce louder, clearer sound without adding bulk or weight to the overall design.

The Bass response often suffers in portable speakers because producing low frequencies requires moving a lot of air, and that usually requires larger drivers and enclosures. Anker tackles this challenge by implementing BassUp technology-a method that uses digital signal processing to analyze and enhance low-end frequencies in real time. Patented Spiral Bass Port works in conjunction with this technology by creating a longer air path within the compact speaker body and allows bass waves to develop more fully before reaching your ears.

This speaker supports wireless stereo pairing, so you can link two Soundcore 2 units together for true left and right channel separation. It really opens up your audio when you can create a proper stereo soundstage with instruments and vocals occupying specific points in space rather than emanating from a single source. Two-speaker pairing is ideal for larger rooms or an outdoor party if you need the extra coverage, and it only takes a few seconds to set up using the Bluetooth connection.

Battery life is not an issue, especially during prolonged stays outdoors, away from power outlets. The 5,200mAh lithium-ion battery will give you up to 24 hours of continuous playback at moderate volume levels; that means you can take this speaker with you on weekend camping trips, day-long beach outings, and multi-day festivals without needing a recharge. Anker built its reputation on power management technology, and this shows in how efficiently this speaker uses its battery capacity.

With an IPX7 waterproof rating, serious protection against water damage far exceeds basic splash resistance. That means it can survive full submersion in up to one meter of water for 30 minutes, so if it accidentally fell in the pool, was caught in a rainstorm, or became splashed by waves while hanging at the beach, there's no need to panic. This also means it handles water vapor and humidity, so it's okay for steamy bathroom showers or foggy outdoor mornings. The device can be rinsed under running water as a way of cleaning off sand, dirt, or spilled drinks, which really comes in handy when trying to take care of the device after some outdoor fun.

The simple control layout puts power, volume, and playback buttons on top of the speaker where you can easily reach them without picking up the device. This straightforward design means anyone can operate the speaker without reading instructions or fumbling with complicated menus. With its cylindrical shape and a rubberized base, it sits stable on most surfaces and fits easily into backpack side pockets, car cup holders, or beach bags. Bluetooth 5 connectivity is present to offer reliable wireless range of up to about 66 feet in open spaces for freedom of movement sans constant audio cutouts.

If you're Prime, make sure you don't miss this.

Nvidia is also investing in similar optical quantum technology.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Quantum computing is still a long way from becoming a mainstream part of society; however, a Chinese firm has developed an all-new optical quantum computing chip that is closing the gap, called the world's first scalable, ""industrial-grade"" quantum chip. The South China Morning Post reports that the chip's developer claims it is ""1,000 times faster"" than Nvidia's GPUs at AI tasks and is already being used in some industries, including aerospace and finance.

The chip in question was built by the Chip Hub for Integrated Photonics Xplore (CHIPX) and is based on a brand-new co-packaging technology for photons and electronics, and it claims to be the first quantum computing platform to be widely deployable. These photonic chips house more than 1,000 optical components on a small 6-inch silicon wafer using a monolithic design, making them incredibly compact compared to traditional quantum computers.

All of these factors have reportedly allowed systems with these quantum chips to be deployed in just two weeks, compared to six months for traditional quantum computers. Its design also allows these chips to work in tandem with each other, just like AI GPUs, with deployments allegedly being ""easily"" scaled up to support 1 million qubits of quantum processing power.

CHIPX's optical quantum chip uses light (or photons) as the information carriers for qubits, rather than matter-based materials. Light has many advantages over raw electricity for computer processing: it takes up no physical space, generates no heat, and travels more efficiently and faster than electricity. Optical computing is attracting more and more scientists and companies as a potential replacement for electrical connections, especially now that power consumption in data centers is sky-high thanks to AI.

However, the current Achilles heel of China's new quantum chip has been the difficulty in producing these chips in large numbers, due to the delicacy of the materials used. The facilities responsible for producing these chips are reportedly producing 12,000 wafers per year, with each wafer yielding ""about"" 350 chips. That's a relatively low production volume compared to typical semiconductor fabs.

There are still many unknowns about this new quantum chip; we don't know which kinks need to be worked out (beyond the production issues) to make these chips truly mainstream. But, regardless, China is intent upon beating Western countries in quantum computing capabilities. If the ""1,000x faster than Nvidia GPUs"" statement is to be believed, it would be a marvelous feat but unsurprising in the world of quantum computers, which, by nature, can solve equations at a rate impossible to comprehend compared to classical computers.

We haven't seen quantum computers this small or as scalable from Western companies, but with companies like Nvidia pouring serious cash into the quantum computing sector, perhaps that will come soon.

Nintendo says it isn't on a mission to break third-party docks.

Nintendo has confirmed to Tom's Hardware that it has no intention of blocking the use of third-party docks with its Nintendo Switch 2 console, after users reported that the latest firmware version for the device rendered certain third-party docking stations inoperative. Numerous user reports have been abundant on the Switch Reddit platform, expressing their anger. Fortunately, vendors have identified a solution to this issue and are now releasing firmware updates for their docks to address it.

The big question many Switch 2 fans are wondering about is whether the issue was deliberate or just an accidental oversight on Nintendo's part. In a statement, a Nintendo representative told Tom's Hardware that ""Nintendo Switch 2 outputs audiovisuals once it detects that it is docked into a Nintendo Switch 2 Dock. Nintendo Switch does the same, outputting audiovisuals once it detects that it is docked into a Nintendo Switch Dock. Nintendo does not have any intention to hinder or invalidate legal third-party dock compatibility.""

Although the Switch 2 appears to use a standard USB-C docking interface, Nintendo is reportedly employing a proprietary handshake protocol. According to our sources, Nintendo may have separated the PID (Product ID) and the VID (Vendor ID), assigning one to charging and USB functionalities, and the other to HDMI output. The hypothesis is that Nintendo retained the existing PID and VID for charging and USB operations, but generated a new PID and VID specifically for HDMI output. That would explain why Switch 2 owners who have upgraded to firmware version 21.0.0 can still charge their devices on third-party docks, but there is no image output on the TV.

It is amusing to note that some user feedback indicates that the official Nintendo dock allegedly stopped working correctly after updating the Switch 2's firmware. However, a restart resolved the issue, though third-party docks did not fare as well.

The market currently offers a wide array of third-party docks and adapters for the Switch 2, supplied by brands such as Next, Antank, Siwiqu, Viture, Jemdo, Jsaux, and Hagibis. However, the firmware has not incapacitated all third-party docks; instead, only specific models have been affected. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that Nintendo did not deliberately disable third-party docks.

We reached out to Next, a manufacturer that produces a bunch of Switch 2 accessories, to inquire whether the issue affects its 4K TV Dock Kit (NX-NS2DK), which is exclusively sold at Best Buy for $59.99. The vendor confirmed that the firmware version 21.0.0 temporarily impacted the compatibility of its dock. However, Next's engineering team has successfully resolved the issue. It plans to deploy a firmware update with detailed instructions to restore the dock's functionality either today or on Saturday.

Most Switch 2 gamers will get by with the included official Nintendo dock. However, some individuals have televisions in multiple rooms and may prefer a dedicated dock for each display. Additionally, there are occasions when you want to share the Switch 2 experience with friends or family members and choose not to transport the dock frequently, seeking a more portable alternative.

Nintendo offers the Switch 2 dock separately for $124.99 on its official website. Although the company has not raised the prices of the Switch 2 due to U.S. tariffs, there has been a price increase concerning accessories and the standard Switch model. The cost of the Switch 2 dock was previously $109.99, then increased to $119.99, and subsequently settled at $124.99. It is considerably more expensive than third-party alternatives. The issue is that Nintendo sells the dock as part of a set that includes an AC adapter, a USB-C charging cable, and an HDMI cable, which naturally increases the overall cost.

If Nintendo were to offer the Switch 2 dock as a standalone product to make the price more attractive, it could persuade owners to prefer official products. Aside from design, the lower prices are what make third-party docks more appealing. If your dock is not functioning correctly, sit tight and wait for your manufacturer to release a firmware update to resolve the issue. Some have already done so.

YMTC plots 2027 production start as Beijing sets its sights on memory sovereignty.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Yangtze Memory Technologies Co. (YMTC), China's top NAND flash manufacturer and one of the most heavily scrutinized names in the chip war, is pushing ahead with plans for a third semiconductor plant in Wuhan. The facility is expected to begin mass production in 2027, in a move that underscores Beijing's intention to double down on domestic memory capacity even as YMTC remains barred from acquiring advanced U.S. chipmaking tools.

The Wuhan expansion marks the company's most ambitious project since being placed on the U.S. Entity List in December 2022, a designation that has crippled access to EUV and advanced DUV lithography, precision etching gear, and key U.S.-origin design IP. Yet, instead of collapsing, YMTC is adapting slowly with the full backing of China's industrial policy apparatus.

YMTC's situation is unlike that of Huawei, which was forced into a radical pivot toward software and cloud services following its sanctions. YMTC, by contrast, continues to manufacture supply-constrained NAND flash chips at scale, albeit at reduced efficiency and with aging process nodes. Its most advanced product, the 232-layer Xtacking 3.0 NAND, was benchmarked in late 2022 as competitive with Micron's and Samsung's offerings. But sustaining that lead has proven impossible without access to ASML's cutting-edge tooling.

Various reports suggest that YMTC's Fab 2 has been operating with domestic workarounds and modified legacy tools, relying in part on procurement from third-party intermediaries to secure essential chemicals and maintenance components. However, these workarounds are slow and painful.

One potential candidate is SMEE's immersion lithography equipment, but this has yet to deliver consistent yields beyond 28nm logic equivalents, far from the sub-20nm half-pitch necessary for leading-edge NAND stacking. Still, YMTC's new fab suggests confidence that by 2027, domestic toolchains will be capable enough to support high-volume NAND production if not at the bleeding edge, then at commercial scale.

 




The report by Nikkei Asia suggests that the timing of this announcement also aligns with China's broader recalibration toward AI infrastructure resilience. With U.S. export restrictions locking out Chinese firms from Nvidia H100 and A100-class GPUs, Beijing has redirected its subsidies and engineering talent toward local accelerator design, sovereign foundation models, and the underlying memory and packaging stacks that make them viable.

In that context, NAND flash is arguably foundational. While DRAM remains the performance bottleneck in AI inference, NAND underpins persistent storage for massive model checkpoints, training data lakes, and parameter weights for retrieval-augmented generation. YMTC's success here is thus critical not because its chips are the fastest, but because they're Chinese.

That imperative is reflected in the composition of China's ""Little Giants"" initiative, which is understood to support key industrial chains and strategic emerging industries such as semiconductors and advanced manufacturing in the upstream value chain. YMTC, though technically a commercial entity under Tsinghua Unigroup, functions effectively as a state-backed lynchpin for this ecosystem.

It's also worth noting that YMTC's return to expansion mirrors Beijing's new appetite for high-risk, high-capex investment in areas where U.S. export controls bite hardest, but enforcement remains inconsistent. In that grey area, YMTC might be betting that Washington's resolve may soften over time, or that domestic tooling will catch up just enough to justify the investment.

From a business standpoint, YMTC's decision to break ground on a third fab lands during one of the tightest NAND cycles in recent memory. According to Phison CEO K.S. Pua, the price of a 1Tb TLC NAND die has more than doubled in the past six months, climbing from $4.80 to $10.70, with virtually all 2026 production capacity already sold out. NAND flash pricing is expected to remain elevated into 2027, as AI datacenter deployments and enterprise SSD demand continue to outpace wafer output across the major suppliers.

Micron, SK Hynix, and Samsung are all riding that upturn, but their responses have been measured. Micron is prioritizing DRAM and HBM3E, while SK Hynix has pivoted to premium AI NAND. Samsung, for its part, is accelerating its transition to eighth-generation 3D V-NAND while absorbing the cost pressures that come with it. What none of them are doing is flooding the market with new capacity. YMTC, by contrast, is hoping to do exactly that, not because it sees an opening to grab global share, but because its political and economic mandate is different.

Beijing's industrial planners are less concerned with global pricing cycles than with insulating domestic AI infrastructure from foreign dependency. If YMTC can bring its third fab online by 2027 — even at 128-layer or similar nodes — it can serve national storage demand across hyperscalers, surveillance systems, and edge compute. That volume won't threaten Samsung's lead, but it could give Chinese cloud providers a secure NAND supply at a time when export controls are steadily tightening and global inventories are already claimed.

There's no denying that YMTC's third fab is a geopolitical play as much as an economic one. On paper, its production timeline puts it three years away from volume output, which is an eternity in semiconductor terms. By 2027, however, the efficacy of U.S. sanctions will hinge on how well Chinese tooling ecosystems mature. YMTC bets that by then, it won't need American equipment, or at least not enough to make the fab infeasible. Whether that turns out to be true is uncertain.

 




For the world's top memory makers, YMTC's continued growth even under U.S. sanctions is more than a marginal concern. With a third fab now in planning and domestic demand accelerating, the company is on track to become the fifth-largest NAND producer globally, and could climb to fourth if its expansion proceeds on schedule. According to Nikkei Asia, industry executives estimate that YMTC could capture 10% or more of global NAND production capacity by as early as next year, potentially overtaking Micron in volume terms.

Even if YMTC remains focused on serving China's domestic market, that shift has global implications. For Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron, it may force a recalibration of pricing strategies and long-term exposure to China, especially as Beijing continues to push for procurement of domestic components.

AI just went from vibe hacking to a nation-state-sponsored cyberattack.

Anthropic, the AI company behind Claude, just published a report detailing how its agentic coding tool was used in a cyberattack that targeted 30 institutions, including tech, finance, and chemical manufacturing companies, plus some government agencies. The company alleges that a Chinese state-sponsored group was behind the campaign, and that it used a jailbroken version of Claude to conduct the sophisticated attack. According to Anthropic, this is the first time an AI-orchestrated cyber attack has been reported.

The company says that although AI with agentic capabilities has increased its usefulness in productivity-related tasks, it has also allowed bad actors to take advantage of AI tools to execute complicated attacks without needing constant human supervision. Although LLMs typically have built-in safeguards to prevent them from being used in criminal acts, the recent event showed that there are ways to circumvent this.

Recent developments in AI technology have enabled the threat actor to use Claude effectively in their intrusions. This includes increased intelligence, which allows the AI to follow multiple, layered instructions and understand the context in which they were to be executed; agency, allowing the tool to make decisions on its own without human input; and access to advanced tools through the Model Context Protocol, letting it use security-related software like password crackers and network scanners.

The attack was allegedly conducted in five phases — in Phase 1, the human operator assigns a target to Claude. In Phase 2, the AI is instructed to conduct its initial reconnaissance, using scan, search, data retrieval, and code analysis tools to deliver an initial analysis and summary of the target to its operator. Phase 3 is a more targeted version of Phase 2, where the AI runs a vulnerability scan based on its findings to determine how it will compromise the target.

This is also where the operator can instruct the AI to begin exploitation by engaging callback services. Again, the human operator reviews the AI's findings and may even give the tool additional directives, either to run the scan again and find more weaknesses in the network or to begin Phases 4 and 5. In the last phases of the attack, the human operator directs the AI tool to obtain credentials and access data. At these stages, both the human and the AI tool can use the exploitation tools to locate and exfiltrate data from the target.

Although the AI still reverts to the human operator in various steps of the network intrusion, it mostly does this to report its findings and for further instructions. Otherwise, it mostly runs independently, around 80% to 90% of the time, allowing the bad actors to run an elaborate operation much quicker and with fewer humans in the loop.

Anthropic says that Claude has built-in safeguards to help prevent this from happening, but the attackers were able to circumvent this. The first thing they did was to convince the LLM that it was working for a cybersecurity company, and that it was being used for penetration testing and red teaming. They also broke down the entire operation into smaller, seemingly innocent tasks. This prevented Claude from seeing the entire context of the operation and the true purpose of its instructions.

While AI has previously been used for “vibe hacking”, this is the first time that it was used in an attack of this magnitude. Advancing AI technology has now allowed smaller teams with fewer resources to conduct complex campaigns such as this, although it must be noted that Anthropic suspects that this was driven by a nation-state sponsor. Thankfully, its team soon discovered what was happening and took steps to document the entire operation. It also banned accounts that were detected to be engaged in illegal activity, as well as notifying both the targets and the authorities of what was happening. Aside from this, the company published its findings (PDF) on the first-reported AI-orchestrated cyber espionage campaign to help the industry detect these and develop countermeasures.

Slowly but surely, AMD is eating Intel's lunch.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AMD increased its share across all markets served by x86 processors at Intel's expense in the third quarter of 2025, according to Mercury Research. Intel is holding strong, and as its latest offerings for client and server systems got significantly more competitive than they were several quarters ago, the pace of AMD's gains has slowed down considerably. However, during the quarter, AMD achieved two important milestones: it now commands shipments of over 25% of all x86 CPUs, and it now ships over 33% (one-third) of desktop x86 CPUs.

Normally, we start our coverage of the x86 market based on data from Mercury Research with client CPUs, but the third quarter was very unusual as unit shipments of x86 CPUs were flat quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), which significantly contradicts the normal seasonal bump when PC makers start to prep for the back-to-school (BTS) season in June – July as well as Christmas season in September.

Indeed, PC and server makers increased their CPU procurements in Q3, but the weakness came almost entirely from Intel, which saw sharp drops in IoT/SoC and entry-level mobile processors as it shifted manufacturing capacity toward server processors, and strong shipments of such parts in Q2. By contrast, AMD's unit shipments were flat to slightly up, so the company gained share sequentially and year-over-year (YoY), hitting two psychologically important milestones.

For the first time in years, AMD's unit share of all x86 client and server CPUs shipped exceeded 25% and now stands at 25.6%, up from 24.2% in the prior quarter and up from 24% in the same quarter a year ago. Intel still commands 74.4%, but it lost some share in certain segments, allowing AMD to hit an important milestone amid a market shrink.

If we add embedded, IoT, and game consoles SoCs to the equation, then AMD's share looks even more impressive: a 30.9% share of all x86-based chips, up from 25% in the third quarter of 2024. While Intel maintains its dominant position with 69.1%, its 5.9% YoY share loss does not look very good. Yet, it should be noted that AMD shipped significantly more game console SoCs in the third quarter this year compared to the third quarter of 2024, which inflated its results a bit.

Strong desktop and mobile CPU lineups as well as Intel struggles with supply of small-core mobile CPUs and prior-generation desktop offerings allowed AMD to slightly outgrow Intel in the third quarter both sequentially and year-over-year, according to data from Mercury Research.

 




AMD's client unit share rose to 25.4%, up 1.5% QoQ and 1.4% YoY, driven mainly by strong desktop momentum. By contrast, Intel's share fell to 74.6%, down 1.5% sequentially and 1.4% compared to the same quarter a year ago, as its entry-level mobile shipments were constrained by reduced small-core CPU supply. Although Intel still dominates in total volume, Q3's numbers reflect the ongoing pressure on its mobile PC shipments and AMD's sustained improvement in desktops.

Both AMD and Intel saw strong sequential unit shipments growth in Q3 2025 on the desktop CPU market, although Q2 -> Q3 market growth in general was lower than normal seasonal rates, according to Mercury Research.

 




AMD grew far faster thanks to the popularity of its Ryzen 9000-series 'Granite Ridge' CPUs in the enthusiast and performance tiers, allowing the company to reach another all-time high: a 33.6% share of the desktop PC market, up from 32.2% in the prior quarter and a gain of 5.2% year-over-year. If we compare AMD's current share to its share in the second quarter of 2024, the gain would be a whopping 10.6%

Intel still held the majority of desktop shipments, but its share fell from 67.8% to 66.4% QoQ, and from 71.7% YoY, reflecting AMD's continued gains in both the mainstream and high-end segments and shortages of Intel's 13th and 14th Core 'Raptor Lake' processors that are still popular three years after their original release in 2022.

On the revenue front, AMD reached another record quarter for desktop CPU revenue, driven by higher shipments and a strong mix of premium SKUs, as the company noted in its conference call a week ago. Intel's revenue position weakened as its unit share declined and AMD absorbed more of the market's high-margin demand. Mercury Research notes that AMD's revenue growth in desktops significantly outpaced its unit growth, which confirms that the red company continued to strengthen its position in the most profitable parts of the desktop market.

AMD lost market share to Intel in the mobile CPU space in Q1 and Q2 2025, but the company outperformed Intel in Q3 2025 on a sequential basis, gaining unit share as Intel struggled with reduced shipments of its entry-level small-core processors.

 




AMD's mobile CPU unit share rose from 20.6% in Q2 to 21.9% in Q3, a sequential gain of 1.4%, while Intel's share fell from 79.4% to 78.1%, down 1.4% QoQ. Intel did manage to grow shipments slightly, but well below normal seasonal levels, allowing AMD to capture market share during the quarter, according to Mercury Research. Nonetheless, AMD lost 0.4% market share year-over-year, whereas Intel gained 0.4%.

On the revenue side, the mix probably favored both companies but helped AMD more. Intel's shortage of low-end CPUs pushed its average selling prices upward, while AMD — which does not have direct rivals for Intel Atom-like SoCs — benefited from increased shipments of mid-range and premium Ryzen mobile processors as Intel faced some shortages on this side of the spectrum as well.

In the server CPU market, Q3 2025 saw relatively flat unit shipments overall, but while AMD managed to edge out another small gain, its gains have been negligible this year. Then again, although the sequential movement was modest, it continued the longer-term trend of AMD steadily expanding its presence in x86 servers.

 




AMD's server unit share increased from 27.3% in Q2 to 27.8% in Q3, while Intel's share slipped 0.5% to 72.2%. Both companies saw YoY shipment growth, but AMD's increase was stronger, helping it push unit share higher compared to the same quarter a year earlier, so overall things look good for AMD.

Most of the real action in Q3 came from product mix rather than volume, according to Mercury. AMD's EPYC 'Turin' ramp accelerated, driving stronger demand for high-core-count EPYC processors, while Intel saw increasing adoption of Xeon 6 'Granite Rapids,' which helped lift its average selling prices despite slightly lower unit volumes.

On the revenue side, AMD hit another all-time high, as the mix shifted heavily toward its latest and more expensive EPYC 9005-series platform. The combination of flat unit shipments and rising prices meant that AMD's server revenue continues to grow significantly faster than its unit share, while Intel's revenue gains were more limited due to modest declines in its overall shipment mix.

In terms of unit share, AMD continued to gain ground in Q3 2025 across nearly all major x86 segments, helped by strong desktop growth driven by the halo effect of range-topping Ryzen 9000-series CPUs and Intel's struggles to ship enough previous-generation desktop CPUs, as well as the relatively low popularity of its latest offerings for desktops. As a result, AMD expanded its presence in client CPUs, reached a new high in desktops, and inched upward in servers, while Intel's share declined modestly as supply constraints and product transitions limited its ability to address all orders. Although Intel still led the market in total shipments, the balance continued shifting gradually toward AMD.

In terms of revenue, AMD delivered even stronger results, setting new highs in both desktop and server segments thanks to rising sales of premium processors and the ramp of its newest platforms. Intel's revenue performance was more mixed: constrained low-end supply pushed its average prices higher, but it ceded more of the high-margin market to AMD, especially in desktops and enterprise servers. Then again, the company announced price hikes of its popular Raptor Lake processors, which will impact its results in Q4.

Annie  Lennon

 November 14, 2025  

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended granting marketing authorization for Teizeild (teplizumab) to delay the onset of stage 3 type 1 diabetes (T1D) in patients aged 8 years and older with stage 2 T1D. 

Teizeild was granted entry into the PRIME medicine scheme in 2019. The EMA launched the scheme to help medicines targeting an unmet medical need reach patients sooner. At present, there are no authorized treatments to delay or cure T1D. 

T1D is a chronic autoimmune condition wherein the immune system destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Patients need daily insulin injections to maintain their glucose levels which, if left uncontrolled, can damage the heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes, and kidneys.

The condition progresses in three stages. The first are presymptomatic. Symptoms appear at stage 3 and include uncontrolled hyperglycemia, polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, fatigue, and weight loss. It is at this point that patients require daily insulin injections to manage their blood glucose levels, something which can be burdensome for patients and especially children and their caregivers. Around 2.2 million people live with T1D in the EU. 

The active substance in Teizeild is teplizumab, a humanized immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that binds to human T lymphocytes. Its mechanism of action remains somewhat unknown, but it may involve partial agonistic signaling and deactivation of pancreatic beta-cell autoreactive T lymphocytes. 

The CHMP's recommendation follows results from a phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of teplizumab involving 76 participants aged 8 years and older with a high risk of developing T1D. Patients were given either teplizumab for 14 days or a placebo and followed for up to 51 months. 

By the end of the study period, 43% of those who received teplizumab and 72% on the placebo received a diagnosis of T1D. The median time to diagnosis for the teplizumab group was 48.4 months, significantly longer than the 24.4 months for those in the placebo group. Annualized rates of diabetes diagnosis were 14.9% per year in the teplizumab group and 35.9% in the placebo group. 

Adverse events were more common in the treatment group than those taking the placebo and included lymphopenia and rash. Other adverse events linked to the drug include leukopenia, neutropenia, and decreased blood bicarbonate, with cytokine release syndrome the most frequent severe adverse reaction. 

Teizeild will be available as a 1 mg/ml concentrate solution for infusion. It should only be given to patients by healthcare professionals who have access to appropriate medical support in order to manage potentially severe adverse reactions.

The pathway for foreign-trained physicians to practice medicine in Brazil requires careful planning and a solid understanding of several mandatory steps. From diploma validation to Portuguese-language certification and visa procedures, the process involves multiple stages.

This guide outlines the essential information needed to convert a foreign medical degree into legal authorization to practice in Brazil, including timelines, costs, documentation requirements, and the main entry points into the Brazilian healthcare job market.(Click here to learn more about the experiences of foreign doctors now practicing in Brazil.)

In Brazil, anyone who earned a medical degree abroad must take the National Exam for the Revalidation of Medical Diplomas Issued by Foreign Higher Education Institutions, known as Revalida. The exam is administered twice a year, and each session includes both a theoretical test and a clinical-skills (practical) assessment. Only after passing both stages may candidates continue with the diploma revalidation process and then apply for registration with the Regional Council of Medicine (Conselho Regional de Medicina, CRM) in the state where they intend to work.

The theoretical exam consists of 100 multiple-choice questions, and candidates have 5 hours to complete it. The test covers clinical reasoning — such as identifying the correct diagnosis and treatment for a case of meningococcal meningitis — as well as knowledge of Brazil's public health system, the Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS).

The clinical-skills exam takes place across 10 stations that simulate real clinical scenarios in the five major areas of medicine: internal medicine, general surgery, gynecology and obstetrics, pediatrics, and family and community medicine. Candidates must perform tasks such as diagnostic assessments, physical examinations, and clinical procedures. Communication with patients and family members is also evaluated.

After registration, exam locations are assigned based on the candidate's preference and availability outlined in the official announcement, typically in major state capitals and in the Federal District (Brasília).

The process also includes a document review, which requires the original diploma issued by the foreign medical school, the revalidated diploma issued by a Brazilian university after passing Revalida, and personal identification documents.

Foreign-trained physicians must also demonstrate proficiency in Portuguese through the Certificate of Proficiency in Portuguese for Foreigners (Celpe-Bras). This is Brazil's official Portuguese-language exam, administered both within the country and at approved testing centers abroad. The test evaluates listening and reading comprehension, written expression, and conversational skills.

Submitting a valid Celpe-Bras certificate is also required for foreign doctors to register with the CRM in the state where they intend to practice. There are two exceptions:

The proficiency level required for medical diploma validation is generally advanced, and the specific threshold is determined by the body responsible for homologation — the Federal Council of Medicine (Conselho Federal de Medicina), Brazil's national medical regulatory authority.

Foreign doctors may obtain authorization for indefinite residence in Brazil, but this does not occur automatically. Eligibility depends on meeting the requirements set by Brazil's Migration Law (Law No. 13,445/2017). In most cases, the process begins with a temporary residence permit, which can later be converted into an authorization for permanent stay.

Applications for residence must be submitted to the Federal Police, the agency responsible for immigration processing. Importantly, this authorization does not automatically extend to the doctor's family members, who must apply separately.

Physicians from Cuba who worked in Brazil under the More Doctors Program may remain in the country for up to 2 years. After that period, Interministerial Ordinance No. 4 of July 26, 2019, issued jointly by the Ministry of Justice and Public Security and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, allows these professionals to apply for indefinite-term residence, provided they meet all established criteria.

To help navigate the diploma validation process, foreign-trained physicians may seek support from universities and specialized centers that offer Revalida preparation courses. These programs help candidates become familiar with exam content and gain a working understanding of Brazil's healthcare system.

One of the most common entry pathways for foreign doctors is the More Doctors Program, managed by the Brazilian federal government. Through this program, foreign-trained physicians can work in underserved or remote areas without completing diploma revalidation for the first 4 years, with the option to extend participation for another 4 years. The program includes a Welcoming and Assessment Module designed to orient doctors to Brazil's public health system. Participants receive a monthly training stipend of R$ 14,058.00 (net R$ 12,500.80), along with housing and meal allowances.

As in many countries, networking is one of the most effective ways to learn about job opportunities. In Brazil, openings for foreign doctors tend to be more frequent in the public sector because private hospitals typically fill positions quickly. Many physicians prefer working in the private system because public hospitals often face resource shortages, challenging working conditions, and lower salaries compared with private-sector positions.

Foreign-trained doctors seeking to join Brazilian medical societies should be aware that membership typically requires:

Requirements vary by organization. Some societies demand a residency specifically in the specialty represented, while others accept broader clinical training. It is therefore important to check each society's criteria individually before applying.

Brazil's public healthcare system, the SUS, is universal. Established under the country's 1988 Federal Constitution, SUS guarantees access to healthcare for all residents, regardless of income or immigration status.

The system is organized into three levels of care, based on complexity:

Foreign-trained physicians working in Brazil — especially those entering through programs serving remote or underserved regions — will interact heavily with the primary-care network, which forms the backbone of SUS.

Every year, 12 million people worldwide suffer a stroke; many die or are permanently impaired. Currently, drugs are administered to dissolve the thrombus that blocks the blood vessel. These drugs spread throughout the entire body, meaning a high dose must be administered to ensure that the necessary amount reaches the thrombus. This can cause serious side effects, such as internal bleeding. Since medicines are often only needed in specific areas of the body, medical research has long been searching for a way to use microrobots to deliver pharmaceuticals to where they need to be: in the case of a stroke, directly to the stroke-related thrombus. Now, a team of researchers at ETH Zurich has made major breakthroughs on several levels. They have published their findings in Science.

The microrobot the researchers use comprises a proprietary spherical capsule made of a soluble gel shell that they can control with magnets and guide through the body to its destination. Iron oxide nanoparticles in the capsule provide the magnetic properties.

""Because the vessels in the human brain are so small, there is a limit to how big the capsule can be. The technical challenge is to ensure that a capsule this small also has sufficient magnetic properties.""

Fabian Landers, Study Lead Author and Postdoctoral Researcher, Multi-Scale Robotics Lab, ETH Zurich

The microrobot also needs a contrast agent to enable doctors to track via X-ray how it is moving through the vessels. The researchers focused on tantalum nanoparticles, which are commonly used in medicine but are more challenging to control due to their greater density and weight. ""Combining magnetic functionality, imaging visibility and precise control in a single microrobot required perfect synergy between materials science and robotics engineering, which has taken us many years to successfully achieve,"" says ETH Professor Bradley Nelson, who has been researching microrobots for decades. Professor Salvador Pané, a chemist at the Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Systems, and his team developed precision iron oxide nanoparticles that enable this delicate balancing act.

The microrobots also contain the active ingredient they need to deliver. The researchers successfully loaded the microrobots with common drugs for a variety of applications – in this case a thrombus-dissolving agent, an antibiotic or tumour medication. These drugs were released by a high-frequency magnetic field that heats the magnetic nanoparticles, dissolving the gel shell and the microrobot.

The researchers used a two-step strategy to bring the microrobot close to its target: first, they injected the microrobot into the blood or cerebrospinal fluid via a catheter. They went on to use an electromagnetic navigation system to guide the magnetic microrobot to the target location. The catheter's design is based on a commercially available model with an internal guidewire connected to a flexible polymer gripper. When pushed beyond the external guide, the polymer gripper opens and releases the microrobot.

To precisely steer the microrobots, the researchers developed a modular electromagnetic navigation system suitable for use in the operating theatre. ""The speed of blood flow in the human arterial system varies a lot depending on location. This makes navigating a microrobot very complex,"" explains Nelson. The researchers combined three different magnetic navigation strategies that allowed them to navigate in all regions of the arteries of the head.

This allows them to roll the capsule along the vessel wall using a rotating magnetic field. The capsule can be guided to its target with enormous precision at a speed of 4 millimetres per second.

In a different model, the capsule is moved using a magnetic field gradient: the magnetic field is stronger in one place than in another. This pulls the microrobot in the vessel towards the stronger field. The capsule can even go against the current – and at a considerable flow velocity of over 20 centimetres per second. ""It's remarkable how much blood flows through our vessels and at such high speed. Our navigation system must be able to withstand all of that,"" says Landers.

When the microrobot reaches a junction in the vessels that would be difficult to manoeuvre through, in-flow navigation comes into play. The magnetic gradient is directed against the wall of the vessel in such a way that the capsule is carried along into the correct vessel.

By integrating these three navigation strategies, the researchers gain effective control over the microrobots across various flow conditions and anatomical scenarios. In more than 95 percent of the cases tested, the capsule successfully delivered the drug to the correct location. ""Magnetic fields and gradients are ideal for minimally invasive procedures because they penetrate deep into the body and – at least at the strengths and frequencies we use – have no detrimental effect on the body,"" explains Nelson.

To test the microrobots and their navigation in a realistic environment, the researchers developed silicone models that accurately replicate the vessels of patients and animals. These vessel models are so realistic that they are now being used in medical training and are being marketed by ETH spin-off Swiss Vascular. ""The models are crucial for us, as we practised extensively to optimise the strategy and its components. You can't do that with animals,"" explains Pané. In the model, the researchers were able to target and dissolve a blood clot.

After numerous successful trials in the model, the team sought to demonstrate what the microrobot could achieve under real clinical conditions. First, they were able to demonstrate in pigs that all three navigation methods work and that the microrobot remains clearly visible throughout the entire procedure. Second, they navigated microrobots through the cerebral fluid of a sheep. Landers is particularly pleased: ""This complex anatomical environment has enormous potential for further therapeutic interventions, which is why we were so excited that the microrobot was able to find its way in this environment too."" 

In addition to treating thrombosis, these new microrobots could also be used for localised infections or tumours. At every stage of development, the research team has remained focused on their goal: to ensure that everything they create is ready for use in operating theatres as soon as possible. The next goal is to begin human clinical trials as quickly as possible. Speaking about what motivates the whole team, Landers says, ""Doctors are already doing an incredible job in hospitals. What drives us is the knowledge that we have a technology that enables us to help patients faster and more effectively and to give them new hope through innovative therapies.""

A recent study conducted at the University of Turku in Finland showed that hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of nausea that occurs during pregnancy, is linked to depression. Women who experienced severe nausea were more likely to have depression both before and after pregnancy and to receive an earlier diagnosis of depression after pregnancy.

Hyperemesis gravidarum is associated with severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy that prevent a person from eating and drinking normally and make everyday life extremely difficult. It occurs in 0.3 to 3.6 percent of all pregnancies and is the most common cause of hospitalisation in the first trimester of pregnancy.

In addition to the physical effects, severe nausea in pregnancy carries a considerable psychosocial burden. However, information on its association with psychiatric illness has been limited so far.

Researchers at the University of Turku conducted a Finnish nationwide register-based study that found an association between severe nausea during pregnancy and depression. This is the first time this association has been identified, and it was also found to be bidirectional, meaning that severe nausea during pregnancy is associated with depression both before and after the pregnancy.

The study analyzed register data from over 437,000 Finnish women from 2004 to 2017. The results show that 8.8 percent of women with severe nausea during pregnancy had depression before pregnancy, compared to 1.0 percent in the control group. This means that these women were more than five times as likely to experience depression before pregnancy. In addition, they were also about 3.5 times more likely to develop new, previously undiagnosed depression after childbirth: 4.9 percent were diagnosed with a new-onset depression after childbirth, compared to 1.0 percent in the control group.

After giving birth, depression was also diagnosed earlier in women who had suffered from severe nausea during pregnancy compared to others. On average, depression was diagnosed 3.3 years after delivery in women with severe nausea during pregnancy, compared with an average of 4.5 years after delivery in their controls.

The study suggests that severe nausea during pregnancy and depression may have shared biological mechanisms. The findings highlight the importance of systematic psychiatric screening during and after pregnancy, and the need for a multidisciplinary approach to care.

Our research shows that severe nausea in pregnancy is not only a physically stressful condition, but also a significant mental health risk factor. The results emphasise the need for improved collaboration between psychiatry, gynaecology, and primary care. Our aim is also to raise awareness and improve access to support for these patients.""

Imagine if every neuroscientist in the world could suddenly speak the same language and share their discoveries instantly. Allen Institute researchers and engineers have now unlocked that potential and the vast discoveries it could lead to through the new Brain Knowledge Platform (BKP). 

This first-of-its-kind database and research tool has just launched with data from over 34 million brain cells. It compiles and standardizes the world's neuroscience data into a common format and language allowing deep, seamless collaboration between international teams all united in the common goal of finding cures for brain disease. 

The Allen Institute partnered with technology leaders like Amazon Web Services, which built the core computing infrastructure powering Brain Knowledge Platform, and Google to develop AI models for neuroscience. That collaboration and innovation have created a powerful tool designed to transform how we discover treatments for diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. 

""This is special because the field has long suffered from fragmentation: different labs working in different species, with different modalities, labeling cell types differently, and with datasets that are difficult to align,"" said Shoaib Mufti, senior director of data and technology at the Allen Institute. 

I am excited about the way the Brain Knowledge Platform will unite massive, multimodal, high-resolution datasets - including single-cell and spatial transcriptomics - all in one open, navigable environment.""

Shoaib Mufti, Senior Director, Data and Technology, Allen Institute 

The work is also supported by the National Institutes of Health's Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies® Initiative, or The BRAIN Initiative®, aimed at accelerating the development of innovative neurotechnologies and revolutionizing our understanding of the human brain 

For decades, brain researchers have faced a major communications challenge: Labs around the world have relied on a variety of methods and technology to study the brain and classify its diverse cell populations. These labs have adopted their own terminology and classification systems for their findings and cell types-a diversity that has meant neuroscience lacks a standardized, comprehensive vocabulary to describe and understand the brain and its incredible complexity. This lack of alignment has slowed the pace of discovery because it's as though research teams are speaking different languages, hindering seamless collaboration 

The Allen Institute is solving this problem by creating a universal translator for brain science. This new platform takes all the different ways scientists describe brain cells and organizes them into one giant, searchable map that everyone can use. 

""The Brain Knowledge Platform is a transformative open resource, giving neuroscience a common language for brain cell types much like the Human Genome Project did for genes,"" said Joseph R. Ecker, Ph.D., a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator from the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. 

Brain Knowledge Platform uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help scientists find patterns and connections they might miss on their own. For example, a scientist studying a brain cell that seems important in Parkinson's disease can search the platform and instantly see how that same cell behaves in healthy brains, in Alzheimer's patients, and in people with other conditions. AI helps them spot similarities and differences that could lead to new treatments. 

The Platform also includes a catalog of genetic tools allowing researchers to immediately begin probing scientific questions that surface. If a researcher finds an interesting brain cell, they can immediately obtain the tools they need to study that cell in their own lab-going from inquiry to action in a single step, with the ultimate goal of discovery. 

What makes Brain Knowledge Platform transformative is how it connects basic brain research to actual medical treatments. The platform includes data from both healthy and diseased brains, so researchers can see what goes wrong in conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. They can identify which brain cells are affected and then test potential treatments on those specific cells. 

The AI assistant accelerates discovery and insights by allowing user to search for molecules and cell features through natural language queries, similar generative AI search, making the massive datasets more accessible and easier to navigate. 

One of the most exciting aspects is how the platform reveals connections between different brain diseases, and how it may speed up collaboration and big scientific discovery. 

""We've created and shared high-quality brain maps since our first mouse brain atlas in 2007,"" says Hongkui Zeng, Ph.D., executive vice president and director of Brain Science at the Allen Institute. ""The Brain Knowledge Platform enhances those maps with the novel understanding of cell types we've been developing with others in the NIH's BRAIN Initiative. Like topography on Google Maps, cell type information adds multiple new layers to our maps, helping scientists design better experiments and glean new insights."" 

The platform eliminates wasted effort by making all research discoverable and connected. Instead of spending months rediscovering what someone else already figured out, researchers can build on existing work and focus on the next breakthrough. This could help scientists understand how the brain works as a complete system and develop much more effective treatments for brain diseases.

Indero is proud to announce the successful completion of an internally funded study that introduces a novel approach to evaluating topical new chemical entities (NCE) in early-phase clinical research. This innovative method leverages quantitative gene expression analysis to assess drug efficacy rapidly and cost effectively.

Dr. Robert Bissonnette, Executive Chairman and Founder of Indero, who initiated and led the study, shared his excitement about the results:

""Our goal was to rethink how to study topical drugs in early phase studies. The results of this study demonstrate that microdosing for only 3 days can provide meaningful efficacy signals. Within just 24 hours, we observed alterations in gene expression after applying a microdose of mid-potency corticosteroid on the skin of patients. By 72 hours, Th2, Th22 and Th17-specific biomarkers were significantly reduced. This outcome is exactly what we hoped for and opens the door to faster, smarter drug development strategies, demonstrating the potential for this method to be used effectively in early phase 1 studies."" The study highlights several advantages of this approach:

Emma Guttman, Professor and Chair of Dermatology at Mount Sinai, who performed gene expression analysis, emphasized its impact:

This strategy represents a paradigm shift in topical drug development. It allows physicians and researchers to accelerate innovation while minimizing patient exposure and resource use. The implications for both industry and patients are tremendous.""

Emma Guttman-Yassky, MD, PhD, Waldman Professor and System Chair, Department of Dermatology and Director, Asness Family Center of Excellence in Eczema and Allergic Conditions, and Director, Laboratory of Inflammatory Skin Diseases, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai

This breakthrough puts Indero ahead in dermatology research, creating a faster, safer, and more affordable way to develop topical treatments.

Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are emerging as a transformative tool in colorectal cancer (CRC) research, offering unparalleled insights into tumor biology, drug resistance, and personalized treatment approaches. These models, created by transplanting fresh human tumor tissue into immunodeficient mice, faithfully replicate the genetic, histological, and molecular features of the original tumors. As such, they serve as invaluable resources in the study of tumor heterogeneity and in the development of precision oncology.

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide and remains a leading cause of cancer mortality. Despite advances in therapeutic strategies, the genetic diversity and adaptive nature of CRC significantly hinder long-term treatment efficacy. Traditional preclinical models, like cell lines, often fail to capture the complexity of human tumors, resulting in limited predictive accuracy for clinical outcomes. In contrast, PDX models preserve the tumor microenvironment (TME), maintain clonal diversity, and reflect the biological and pathological traits of patient tumors. This level of fidelity is critical for drug discovery and biomarker identification, making PDX models essential for translational cancer research.One of the primary applications of PDX models is in drug efficacy testing. By correlating genetic profiles with drug responses, researchers can predict how a patient's cancer might respond to specific treatments. This capability enhances the precision medicine approach, allowing for more personalized and targeted therapies. PDX models also provide insights into drug resistance mechanisms, an area of growing importance as many patients develop resistance to initially effective therapies. Through long-term studies, these models have helped identify molecular pathways that enable cancer cells to evade treatment, guiding the development of next-generation therapies.However, the establishment and maintenance of PDX models present significant challenges. The process is time-consuming and labor-intensive, requiring the selection of high-quality tumor samples, careful engraftment into immunodeficient mice, and meticulous long-term monitoring. Moreover, genetic drift over multiple passages can alter the tumor's original characteristics, posing challenges for longitudinal studies. Despite these limitations, advances in humanized mouse models are helping to overcome these barriers, enhancing the model's relevance for immunotherapy research.The future of CRC research will likely see an increased reliance on PDX models, particularly in co-clinical trials that test potential treatments alongside human patients. By mimicking real-world patient responses, PDX models are driving the development of more effective cancer therapies and helping researchers understand the dynamic nature of tumor evolution. As these models continue to evolve, they hold the promise of transforming how colorectal cancer is understood and treated, offering new hope for improved patient outcomes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New molecular test revolutionizes fungal infection diagnosis","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251114/New-molecular-test-revolutionizes-fungal-infection-diagnosis.aspx","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 18:34:00 GMT","

Certain serious fungal infections occur in regions of the United States with specific environments and are often tied to soil exposure. These infections can affect both healthy and immunocompromised people, but proper diagnosis remains slow, which delays treatment.

The current gold standard for making a diagnosis relies on fungal culturing, which can take weeks, and tests that look for antigens, which lack specificity, or antibodies in the blood, which are often unreliable in early disease. But now researchers from Indiana University Health and the IU School of Medicine have developed a new molecular test capable of detecting three major pathogenic fungi at once - and with a much quicker turnaround than traditional methods.

The work will be presented at the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) 2025 Annual Meeting & Expo, taking place Nov. 11–15 in Boston.

Dr. Kenneth Gavina, Ph.D., is the director of clinical microbiology at Eskanazi Health in Indianapolis. He oversaw the project through the Indiana University School of Medicine. His team sought to identify three fungal infections that affect thousands of people each year, are often mistaken for other respiratory illnesses, and can be life-threatening, particularly in immunocompromised people:

The researchers designed a multiplex real-time PCR test, which means it can detect multiple pathogens simultaneously from the same sample.

Their test targeted three genetic regions that are unique to each fungus: ITS1 for Histoplasma, BAD1 for Blastomyces, and A2/PRA gene for Coccidioides. By detecting the fungi's genetic material directly, the PCR test bypasses the slow culture process that is complicated by the fungi's ability to switch between environmental and human forms.

When they compared their PCR results to standard lab methods, the PCR test identified all tested samples with 100% accuracy. In addition, it was 100% specific, meaning it didn't mistakenly detect other fungi or contaminants.

The workflow also eliminates the need for time-consuming DNA-extraction steps, potentially reducing turnaround time and laboratory risk associated with handling live pathogenic fungi.

 Our assay has the potential to significantly improve turnaround time and diagnostic confidence for infections that have historically been difficult to detect quickly.""

Dr. Kenneth Gavina, Ph.D., director of clinical microbiology, Eskanazi Health, Indianapolis

Importantly, the team's system runs on a platform already used in many clinical laboratories, making it potentially quite accessible.

""While additional clinical validation is under way, this assay shows strong potential to fill a major gap in fungal diagnostics,"" Gavina said. The assay has the ability to detect the three major causes of endemic mycoses in the United States directly from clinical specimens or be used as a form of definitive identification from fungal culture. ""Clinicians currently have no FDA-approved molecular tests for these three pathogens, making rapid, reliable detection a pressing need.""

This work was overseen by Dr. Kenneth Gavina, Ph.D., an assistant professor of clinical pathology and laboratory medicine at IU School of Medicine, and will be presented one of the medical laboratory scientists at IU Health, Kylee Alexander, during a poster session at 9:15 a.m. on Friday, Nov. 14, at the Thomas M. Menino Convention and Exhibition Center in Boston. Alexander's poster number is ID008. Gavina will be available to discuss the work with reporters.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Mental navigation framework helps people change pathological thinking","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251114/Mental-navigation-framework-helps-people-change-pathological-thinking.aspx","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 06:31:00 GMT","

The stereotypical image of psychotherapy shows a patient lying on a couch, exploring their deepest traumas. This leads to awareness of unconscious habits, thoughts, and drives and has long been a cornerstone of psychotherapy. However, the cognitive processes underlying the new awareness that emerges-what's actually happening in the patient's brain on that couch-remain a mystery. 

""Part of the problem with psychotherapy is that we haven't had good insights into the mechanistic problems,"" said Jaan Aru, an associate professor at the University of Tartu, in an interview with the Observer. ""So, it's very hard to design a therapy."" 

In a 2025 paper in Perspectives on Psychological Science, Aru and Nick Kabrel, Aru's graduate student at the University of Zurich, wrote that becoming aware of unrecognized psychological and behavioral challenges is the most crucial mechanism in conversation-based psychotherapy. Furthermore, they argue that becoming aware can be best framed as a process that expands one's cognitive map and changes the way one navigates through the mind. This framework also provides a testable theory about the neural correlates behind successful psychotherapy. 

Kabrel came to this theory through personal experience. He noticed how a therapist's questions could prompt him to search through his memories and beliefs, and the introspection was surprisingly powerful. He wondered what was happening in his brain in those moments and noticed something that sparked his interest. 

""When I search through memory or search in my mind, it always feels as if I am navigating in some kind of environment,"" he said. 

As he looked into this idea of mental navigation, he realized he was not alone. In a 2024 paper, he and Aru showed that patients and therapists used more spatial language-such as ""this is unexplored territory"" or ""I'm going in circles""-during psychotherapy sessions than during everyday conversation. 

In the new paper, Aru and Kabrel proposed a framework based on how individuals construct their internal worlds in the form of cognitive maps: structured representations of phenomena like objects, concepts, people, and memories, and the relationships among them. Research revealing how the brain represents three-dimensional space helped inspire how this navigation may occur in the brain (O'Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971; Hafting, 2005). In the hippocampus, place cells fire when animals are in a specific location, while the entorhinal cortex's grid cells act like a coordinate map. More recent research revealed these cells also encode abstract concepts, such as time, sound, social hierarchies, and word meanings (MacDonald, 2011; Aronov, 2017; Park, 2021; Solomon, 2019; Viganò, 2021). 

""The brain is highly likely to make use of this mapping system in these other domains, too,"" Aru said.

This idea of mental navigation could be a very general framework to understand thinking and abstract cognition.""

Jaan Aru, Associate Professor, University of Tartu

Framing introspection in this way may help people realize that changing the way they navigate through their thoughts could help them out of a pathological way of thinking. 

For example, someone suffering from depression might think they are flawed, and any interaction with someone else that ends negatively will be interpreted as their fault because of these perceived flaws. As they continue to view the world through this same negative lens, this thought pattern gets reinforced. It's analogous to hiking through a forest: The more a path is used, the wider it gets and the more likely it is to be used again. 

But a therapist helping them see a different interpretation-a different navigational route-may allow them to reframe their thoughts and not see everything as their fault. Kabrel recommends a psychotherapist say something like, ""This is the place where we are stuck. We come back here every time, but we need to expand this."" 

Aru thinks this idea is not just for people with mental illness, but for everyone. 

""Often the problem is that people have very narrow maps, very narrow ways of thinking. And it's a very general problem,"" he said. ""Our goal as a society could be to expand the way people actually think."" 

On a smaller scale, the goal of the paper is to encourage psychological scientists and neuroscientists to design experiments to test this new framework and the possible neural correlates involved. In the meantime, Aru knows that some scientists may be doubtful. 

""It's completely understandable if there are scientists who would say, 'Oh, you're stretching it too far. How do you know that it's really related to grid cells?'"" he explained. ""For me, this is the fun thing about science. You can try to make these links, and sometimes these links are actually there. Then suddenly we might be understanding something that we previously didn't, and we might be expanding our own mental maps with that.""

A six-week at-home hypnosis program not only eased hot flashes more than an active placebo but also improved women's daily functioning and sense of control, offering a powerful new option for those who can't or don't want to use hormone therapy.

Study: Self-Administered Hypnosis vs Sham Hypnosis for Hot Flashes. Image credit: fizkes/Shutterstock.com

A recent study published in the open-access journal JAMA Network Open compares self-hypnosis with sham hypnosis in the management of hot flashes in menopause.

Many postmenopausal women report that hot flashes significantly reduce their quality of life. These occurrences consist of a sudden feeling of widespread heat and flushing, often accompanied by sweating, discomfort, thirst, anxiety, and sleep disruption. They affect up to 80% of menopausal women, persisting for up to six or seven years from onset.

Hormone replacement therapy for hot flashes is effective at controlling the symptoms. Still, many women cannot use hormone therapy, including those above the age of 60 years, or with a history of gynecologic cancer (uterus or breast), thromboembolism, or heart disease. Clinical hypnosis is considered safe and effective as a non-hormonal method of managing this symptom, but women find it difficult to access. Its mechanism of action is also unclear.  

The current study aimed to directly compare self-administered hypnosis with sham hypnosis in menopausal women with hot flashes for the benefit of reducing hot flash severity, making allowance for differences in treatment adherence when calculating the effect of treatment.

The study was conducted at two American universities as a single-blind randomized trial. It included 250 postmenopausal women experiencing at least four daily, or 28 weekly, hot flashes. The mean age was 56 years.

About a quarter had a history of breast cancer, thus making them unsuitable for hormonal therapy. Moreover, hot flashes often set in more abruptly in these women due to the sudden onset of menopause with cancer treatment.

The participants were randomized to receive sham hypnosis vs self-administered clinical hypnosis. The frequency and severity of hot flashes were evaluated as their product to obtain a hot flash score.

Hypnosis was induced through a 20-minute daily audio session that suggested various relaxation methods, accompanied by cooling imagery. The sham hypnosis consisted of white noise labeled as “hypnosis” to match expectancy, for the same period. This compensates for placebo effects as well as the mental expectancy induced by the intervention, without actually involving hypnosis.

The women were assessed for hot flashes and perceived benefits at six weeks from baseline, with a follow-up assessment at 12 weeks.

The study showed that hot flash scores fell more significantly with self-administered hypnosis compared to sham hypnosis at six weeks. That is, hot flash scores in the hypnosis group improved by 53% vs 41% in the sham hypnosis group. Thus, the improvement with hypnosis exceeds the 50% threshold required for clinical significance.

Women in the hypnosis group were more likely to report less disruption of daily life from hot flashes after the intervention, with a mean Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS; score range, 0 to 100) score decrease of 49% compared to 37% in the sham group, rather than 49% vs 37% of women reporting improvement.

Over 90% of the women in the hypnosis group reported it to be beneficial vs 64% in the sham hypnosis group, using the Subject Global Impression of Change. 

These findings confirm that compared to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), the only other commonly used behavioral method in the management of hot flashes, clinical hypnosis “continues to consistently demonstrate clinically significant reductions in hot flash symptoms” in contrast to the less concrete findings with CBT.

The white noise used in the sham hypnosis group served as an active control, demonstrating the beneficial effect of the placebo, although it fell below the significance threshold. Intervention adherence significantly influenced treatment benefits, with greater practice associated with greater symptom reductions.

At 12 weeks, reductions in hot flash scores were maintained in both groups, with the hypnosis group continuing to show larger improvements.

The study indicates that hypnosis self-administered via audio files is more effective than sham hypnosis in managing hot flashes, reducing their frequency and severity by more than half. While the difference in symptom trajectory over time did not reach statistical significance at the prespecified threshold, the between-group difference at six weeks was significant.

Further research is required to determine the duration and long-term effects of this treatment on the symptom.

The U.S. men's national team take on Paraguay in the first of two November friendlies as 2026 FIFA World Cup preparation ramps up.

After a positive October camp with results against Ecuador and Australia, manager Mauricio Pochettino is without numerous stars. Players like Christian Pulisic, Malik Tillman, Antonee Robinson, Weston McKennie and Chris Richards were not selected for the two November friendlies. To make matters worse, veteran midfielder Tyler Adams had to pull out with an injury. 

For every player absent, however, there's fringe players looking to further make their cases for a roster spot next year. Particularly in midfield given Pochettino has yet to settle on a favored pivot. And, there's Gio Reyna to consider with him back with the USMNT for the first time since March.

Here's how the USMNT's XI could look like against Paraguay. 

FREE NEWSLETTER. US Newsletter. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC (US Only). dark

GK: Matt Freese—The New York City FC goalkeeper looks set to be the starting goalkeeper for 2026 barring an unforeseen drop in form. 

CB: Miles Robinson—Fresh off eliminating MLS rival Columbus Crew from the playoffs, the FC Cincinnati defender gets the nod.

CB: Mark McKenzie—McKenzie made one substitute appearance back in October, but should start with Chris Richards absent.

CB: Tim Ream—Ream should see the bulk of minutes in the left center back role during this camp. The 38-year-old has been a consistent name in Pochettino XIs. 

RWB: Alex Freeman—The MLS Young Player of the Year has been a standout performer, flying up and down the right flank.

CM: Tanner Tessmann—Pochettino has favored Tessmann in a box-to-box midfield role since taking over. The 24-year-old is in line for another opportunity given Tyler Adams had to withdraw from camp.

CM: Cristian Roldan—Roldan is fully focused on earning a 2026 World Cup roster spot after the Seattle Sounders were eliminated from the MLS Cup playoffs. 

LWB: Max Arfsten—Pochettino took credit earlier in the week for developing Arfsten in the wake of Antonee Robinson's absence. The Columbus Crew product is more effective as a wingback looking to get forward.

RW: Gio Reyna—This is a big camp for Reyna. With Tim Weah and Malik Tillman both absent, the Borussia Mönchengladbach player gets a big opportunity to endear himself to Pochettino.

ST: Folarin Balogun—Balogun recently scored his first career Champions League goal and was one of the best USMNT players last camp.

LW: Diego Luna—Another MLS product, Luna has been a fan-favorite in multiple camps this year. He should see notable playing time against Paraguay and Uruguay on the left.

ARLINGTON, TEXAS - MARCH 24: Christian Pulisic #10, Weston McKennie #8 and Gio Reyna #7 of the United States celebrate after the Concacaf Nations League final match between Mexico and USMNT at AT&amp;T Stadium on March 24, 2024 in Arlington, Texas.

U.S. national team star Christian Pulisic may not be in this November camp as Gio Reyna makes his return to the group, but the AC Milan star certainly has Reyna's back.

Pulisic said Reyna has been treated unfairly and sympathizes with the 23-year-old's battle with injuries over the last four years.

“He's had a really tough time, unfairly in a lot of ways,” Pulisic told CBS Sports Golazo. “I feel for him. It's difficult what we go through. Some of the injuries he's gone through, it's really hard.”

Reyna exploded as one of Europe's biggest teenage talents with Borussia Dortmund and the USMNT in the lead up to the 2022 World Cup, but controversy and injury has dimmed his light since.

Reyna was the middle of a dispute between former U.S. head coach Gregg Berhalter and his parents, Claudio and Danielle Reyna. The Reynas, frustrated by Gio's lack of playing time at the World Cup, revealed to U.S. Soccer a decades-old domestic violence incident involving Berhalter and his wife. The revelation led to an investigation, a public saga, and the breakdown of the relationship between the two families.

There was a time during the 2022 World Cup that Reyna was nearly sent home from camp due to his attitude.

On the field, things haven't been much smoother for Reyna. He has failed to feature more than 610 minutes in a single league season since 2020-21. After falling out of favor in Dortmund, Reyna went on loan to Nottingham Forest where his playing outlook didn't much improve. He was even left off the matchday roster entirely a handful of times.

This summer, Reyna made the move from Dortmund to Borussia Mönchengladbach. He has started just one game, but has appeared in six. He dealt with ramping up his fitness before his debut then was sidelined briefly with a thigh injury.

Pulisic still backs his teammate to show his top quality moving forward.

“When I have him on the field with me on the national team, I feel a lot more relaxed,” Pulisic said. “He's a really, really good player — that's not a crazy take, a lot of people see that. I just tell him to stay patient. He's a guy that's gone through a bit of a tough time, he'll admit that, but that doesn't mean he can't have really good things ahead.”

The November national team camp is the first time Reyna is involved with the national team since the 2024 Copa America, when he was selected by Berhalter.

“I do think it's been unfair, but I think he's going to come around and people are going to see that soon,” Pulisic said.

As for Pulisic, he is missing camp as he just recovered from a hamstring injury suffered on international duty in October. He missed four games for AC Milan and returned off the bench last weekend.

“I just want to make sure I have the time now to fully care for myself, to make sure my hamstring is doing well and allow other guys to take my place,” Pulisic said. “It's just the best decision for everyone right now.”

Pulisic was absent from the USMNT over the summer when he asked head coach Mauricio Pochettino not to be selected for the Gold Cup. He got some time off before returning to Milan for preseason.

The USMNT face Paraguay and Uruguay this window and won't be together again until the March international break.

Herc Gomez and Ale Moreno discuss Tyler Adams being added to a long list of injured players for Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT. (2:46)

Days after halting Lionel Messi and keeping Inter Miami scoreless in a stunning 3-0 victory in the Leagues Cup final in early September, Seattle Sounders midfielder Cristian Roldan received a surprising phone call while on vacation.

""I answered in front of my wife, someone that has encouraged me and has given me a whole lot of confidence,"" Roldan told ESPN. ""I had to get on a flight about five hours later.""

Roldan was returning to the U.S. men's national team for the first time in two years.

Nine months out from the World Cup at the time, he had yet to play for U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino, and it wasn't as if he was an up-and-coming prospect or playing for a major European powerhouse. ""I always had a slight belief that I could make a [national team] return, but the belief was dwindling down, if I'm being honest,"" he said.

Months later -- make that weeks later -- the MLS veteran went from the outside looking in to one of Pochettino's unforeseen favorites in a roster filled with Europe-based stars. After the United States' 2-1 win over Australia last month, in which Roldan provided two assists, Pochettino praised the midfielder as a ""perfect player.""

A member of MLS' Best XI for 2025, Roldan is on the cusp of not only raising his stock even further when the U.S. plays friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay this month but also becoming an irreplaceable figure as he continues to fight for a roster spot in next summer's World Cup.

Doing so would mark an incredible resurgence for a player whose national team chapter seemed to have already closed. It would also be a testament to the perseverance of the 30-year-old, who is still finding ways to evolve.

It's 2015, and Roldan is at his first day of training with Seattle after being selected as the No. 16 pick in the MLS SuperDraft. The budding youngster from the University of Washington is likely still learning the names of his teammates, when suddenly ...

""Ozzie [Alonso] just comes and just tackles the s--- out of Cristian,"" Sounders coach Brian Schmetzer told ESPN.

Alonso, a hard-nosed defensive midfielder who was 10 years older than the rookie on the ground, had read a quote in an article in which Roldan noted that he respected Alonso, but also wanted to one day take his place. The moment might have petrified other youthful signings, but this wasn't the case for the eventual two-time MLS Cup winner.

""He came right back in training and still competed; [he] wasn't in awe,"" Schmetzer said. ""Ozzie sent the message, but Cristian didn't back down.""

Roldan soon became a favorite among his Sounders colleagues. In his early days at Seattle, he would cut his teammates' hair. Easygoing, friendly and able to float between different groups and different personalities with his ability to speak both English and Spanish, he later solidified himself as a likable teammate off the field and in the starting XI.

He received his first call-up to the U.S. men's national team in 2017. Matt Besler, a former USMNT player and five-time MLS All-Star, remembers the young 20-something who was getting his first opportunities at a national team level.

""You could tell right away he was mature for his age. He's a professional. He shows up and trains hard, he pays attention. Smart player, competitor,"" Besler said. ""He was respectful and he was asking the right questions, but he also wasn't afraid to kind of show off his personality.""

Mauricio Pochettino explains why he's decided to recall Gio Reyna into his USMNT squad for the friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay.

Roldan became a familiar face over the next few years, eventually earning a place on the United States' 2022 World Cup squad. Then, in 2023, his dry spell began. After Panama stunned the U.S. in that year's Gold Cup semifinal, in which Roldan's last touch for the U.S. was a missed penalty in the shootout, the Seattle player's lengthy absence from the national team began. By the 2024 Copa America, the U.S. had moved on to a midfield and attack that was composed entirely of players from European clubs.

With Roldan nearing his 30s and plying his trade in the more modest MLS, it seemed like a natural transition away from the national team spotlight. Roldan wasn't the first or last aging player in the domestic league to lose his USMNT relevance. But during that time away, he found a new role at club level that changed his career.

Schmetzer moved the attack-minded winger to a more deep-lying central role last year when injuries plagued his gameday setup. ""It was by necessity,"" he said. ""That's when it blossomed, because it was new and it was different. He was soaking up information.""

At 30 years old, Roldan is now playing the best soccer of his career. He has shined in 2025 in multiple competitions such as the Club World Cup and Leagues Cup, in addition to MLS.

""I made the move to a deep-lying midfielder about a year and a half ago, and it's worked out. The game has slowed down a whole lot for me,"" Roldan said. ""It allows me to use what I'm good at, and that's hunting players down, that's winning second balls, that's being aggressive, communicating, being a leader, using my voice a whole lot more, organizing the group.""

At the Club World Cup, a tournament in which outside expectations for Seattle were low, the Sounders and Roldan were competitive against globally recognized giants such as Paris Saint-Germain and Atlético Madrid.

""The Club World Cup made me believe that I can play at a higher level. It made me believe that there's more that I can give to the sport,"" said Roldan, who scored against Botafogo. ""Even at 30, I can get better and sustain that.""

""If you look at Cristian's individual performances against three of the best teams in the world, he didn't look out of place. He actually looked better than a lot of players,"" Schmetzer said. ""That really helped his confidence, and I think he said it after those games, he said to himself, you know, I can play with these guys. I can actually play with some of the best players in the world.""

Two months later, he was shutting down Messi & Co. in the Leagues Cup final. After the 3-0 thrashing of Inter Miami, and with plenty of momentum behind him in a stellar 2025, the Seattle captain earned his long-awaited return to the USMNT.

When speaking to Roldan about his renaissance that led to his return, there was one word that kept emerging from the player who has now received his third consecutive call-up to the national team: confidence.

""I think that's the way I have handled my call-ups,"" Roldan said. ""Not taking them for granted and going out there and having the most confidence and belief in myself that I was going to make an impact.""

That impact was on full display in the USMNT's latest game. Starting alongside prominent names such as AC Milan's Christian Pulisic and Juventus' Weston McKennie against Australia last month, Roldan was the star of the show thanks to his two assists, as well as two dangerous shots that nearly found the back of the net.

""I think in the past, maybe I lacked that confidence when I was with the national team,"" the Seattle captain said. ""To be myself.""

As a fellow MLS lifer, Besler knows plenty about the importance of having that self-belief within a USMNT structure that houses plenty of star names from abroad. In the 2014 World Cup, Besler started in all four matches for the national team.

""The narrative for a lot of my playing generation was you had to be in Europe in order to get called in. That was sort of the narrative and the stigma, if you weren't playing in Europe, then you weren't good enough to play with the national team,"" said Besler, a Sporting Kansas City legend. ""I think you quickly realize there's a lot of good players, and every league's a little bit different. Some leagues probably are better than others, but at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter. ... Everybody's here for a reason.""

The same could be said of Roldan. Praised by his teammates and Pochettino for the mentality that he brings, the midfielder is a well-liked member of the locker room. As the U.S. continues to build its identity ahead of the World Cup -- ""Culture Eats Strategy for Breakfast,"" Pochettino recently wrote on a whiteboard -- Roldan is a key aspect of that off-the-field culture.

""It's also great to have guys like Cristian here, he's amazing for that type of stuff,"" goalkeeper Matt Freese told media on Monday when discussing the team's identity.

Herculez Gomez backs Mauricio Pochettino's decision to recall Gio Reyna to the USMNT, despite a lack of minutes at club level.

Roldan knows he can be an asset no matter what role he receives. There is no sense of possible jealousy or frustration over playing time with the USMNT. He knows that if he's selected for the World Cup, there are no guarantees with minutes being given. ""Whether I'm playing or not, I want to help the team,"" he said.

As seen last month though, he could still help the team as a member of a starting XI. ""As I've gotten older, and I've been part of many teams that have won championships, I've understood that sometimes your best XI doesn't win you a championship. There are times where the best team will. ... I think coaches understand that piece,"" he said.

""Look, I don't want to be known, especially with the national team, known as just a player that is known for his off-the-field stuff, right? I'm a professional soccer player. I want to be known for winning games, being part of big teams, big moments. I want to be on the field kicking a player.""

Just a few months after that life-changing call, he'll now have another opportunity to do so in November. With just one more international break after that in March before the World Cup, the next two games could cement his roster position if he can provide more of those big moments. And Roldan is well aware of how rapidly fortunes can swing in your favor in those moments.

""Sometimes in soccer, it can change so fast, whether negatively or positively, and this is a moment in time where it has changed drastically in a positive way for me,"" he said. ""I'm riding the wave. I'm enjoying the moment, I'm taking advantage of the moment, and hopefully I can ride this high into the World Cup.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

CHESTER, Pa. — Tim Ream said he hasn't seen anything to suggest tension between Sebastian Berhalter and Gio Reyna in their first U.S. men's national team camp together.

The Reyna family and Berhalter family were close friends until a now-infamous scandal that erupted after the 2022 World Cup.

Reyna's parents, former national team players Claudio and Danielle, attempted to get Berhalter's father Gregg fired as USMNT head coach by revealing sordid details of a decades-old domestic violence incident to U.S. Soccer.

The Reynas' drastic move was in response to Berhalter giving their son little playing time at the World Cup, then unwittingly revealing afterwards that he nearly sent the midfielder home from the tournament after an angry reaction to his reduced role.

Ties between the two families severed in the aftermath of the scandal. After growing up as friends, Berhalter indicated to The Athletic in April that he hadn't spoken to Reyna since the World Cup.

According to Ream, however, the reunion between the Vancouver Whitecaps midfielder and Borussia Mönchengladbach midfielder appears to have been mostly without incident.

""I actually completely forgot about it until like, the third or fourth day [of camp], and I was like, 'Oh, wait a minute,'"" Ream said on Friday.

""It hasn't really been discussed amongst the team. Their relationship looked pretty normal to me and to everybody else. I think what happened happened and we've all kind of moved on from it, and they have as well.""

Ream was also complimentary of the focus he's seen from Reyna, who is with the USMNT for the first time since March and only the second time in the Mauricio Pochettino era.

The veteran defender said the 23-year-old hasn't let his recent struggles for fitness and playing time at the club level affect him in training.

""He's not really let the challenges overseas seep into into camp, which is great to see,"" Ream said.

""I feel like he's more tuned in and more focused on the field than I've seen in the past, which is a great thing. Whether it was injury or other things that were going on, I think his focus is so much greater now.""

The USMNT is set to face Paraguay on Saturday in a friendly at Subaru Park before traveling to Tampa, Fla. to take on Uruguay on Tuesday in its final game of 2025.","{'href': 'https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com', 'title': 'Pro Soccer Wire'}","soccer"

In his 226th appearance for Portugal, Cristiano Ronaldo received his first red card for his country in the shock 2-0 defeat to Ireland. The Real Madrid and Manchester United legend was dismissed for violent conduct after swinging his arm towards Dara O'Shea. Ronaldo was incandescent at the decision as he sarcastically clapped the Dublin crown as he trudged off the pitch.

It was a damaging result for Portugal as they failed to secure qualification for the World Cup but they will realistically achieve that against Armenia on Sunday - Roberto Martinez's men only require a point. But there could be bigger consequences for Ronaldo as he could now miss the opening game, or two, of the World Cup. Red cards carry an automatic one-game ban, so Ronaldo will miss the Armenia clash, but FIFA could increase the suspension to three games. Although it was the 40-year-old's first red card for his country, Ronaldo has been sent off 12 times at club level across his career.
Every red card of Cristiano Ronaldo's career
Ronaldo's first red card of his career arrived on the final day of the 2003/04 season with Manchester United. It was a poignant day in English football as Arsenal completed their ‘Invincible' season but Ronaldo was also dismissed against Aston Villa, receiving a second yellow card for kicking the ball away. As the graphic below illustrates, Ronaldo was sent off four times during his first spell at Old Trafford, including twice against rivals Manchester City.
The legendary attacker is Real Madrid's record goalscorer in history with 451 goals in 438 games, which included six red cards. The most famous of these arrived against Barcelona in the 2017 Spanish Super Cup. After scoring the decisive goal in a 3-1 win for Madrid on 80 minutes, Ronaldo was shown his second yellow card just two minutes later to the delight of the Barca fans. The Portugal captain was dismissed once for Juventus against Valencia and once for Al-Nassr.

Cristiano Ronaldo may be ruled out of Portugal matches at the World Cup after his red card against Ireland in Dublin

That's the lot for this blog. We thank you for reading, and emailing in. I'll be back shortly for tonight's World Cup qualifying action. Get yours puns, and even your keen insight into this beautiful game of ours, ready.

In addition to the massive Haaland-buys-some-burgers story, his teammates said it was a calm half-time team talk from the forward that kept Norway on track against Estonia last night. It was 0-0 at half time, but the hosts went on to win 4-1 with the first goal coming five minutes after the break. This is from Reuters:

Haaland, leading the team in the injured Martin Ødegaard's absence, urged them to stay calm after a goalless first half in Oslo, where the frustrated home crowd booed as the players headed down the tunnel.

Norway hit four goals in 12 minutes as Alexander Sørloth scored twice in quick succession five minutes after play resumed before Haaland added a double of his own. Robi Saarma netted a consolation for Estonia in the 64th minute.

“Erling was just nice and calm, he gave us the confidence that ‘We'll fix this, boys',” Morten Thorsby said. “‘We're going to get that goal. We just have to keep going.' That's the kind of confidence we need in these games,” Thorsby told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.

The defender Torbjørn Heggem said Haaland, who extended his all-time Norway scoring record to 53 goals, also delivered a clear tactical message at the break.

“He said we had to feed him more crosses ... just hit even more into the box. Especially when they are sitting so deep and we have to play a lot around them.” Heggem told NRK. “It worked, you could see that after five minutes.”

News to emerge from Sonia Bompastor's earlier press conference is that Hannah Hampton, the England goalkeeper, will be out of action “for a few weeks” due to a quad muscle injury.

Hampton missed the 6-0 away win against St Pölten in the Champions League on Tuesday having sustained the injury in the 1-1 draw with Arsenal last Saturday.

‘She will be out for a few weeks, so we'll see,” said Bompastor. “If we can see her before the end of the year I'm not sure.”

Peter is referring to this story from last night, which I didn't see earlier:

Captain Erling Haaland helped Norway celebrate their 4-1 victory over Estonia on Thursday by picking up a huge order of dozens of cheeseburgers for the squad, British media reported.

Haaland's composed half-time talk helped spark the win, midfielder Morten Thorsby said, with the team now on the brink of qualifying for the World Cup for the first time since 1998.

The 25-year-old striker, still dressed in Norway gear, was spotted after the game lugging the cheeseburger order back to the squad. “It's a strong performance from the captain!” Norway and Fulham midfielder Sander Berge told TV2. (Reuters)

“A late-night order of 60 or 70 cheeseburgers?!” emails Peter Oh. “I hope that is all that Erling Haaland has in common with Donald Trump.”

Women's Super League fixtures this weekend are as follows:

Saturday
 Manchester City v Manchester United (1.30pm)

Sunday (12pm unless stated)
 Aston Villa v London City Lionesses
 Brighton v Leicester
 Liverpool v Chelsea
 West Ham v Everton
 Tottenham v Arsenal (2.30pm)

“It's really important to have Sam [Kerr] back,” says Sonia Bompastor, the Chelsea Women head coach, of the forward who started a game for the first time in 692 days in the 6-0 Champions League win away against St Pölten on Tuesday. “She started in the Champions League, and scored a couple of goals.

“She brings leadership, also the fact she's a goal scorer, she has a lot of experience, and is always in the right position to score goals.”

Gosh, there an awful lot of cynical football fans out there! Within seconds of the referee brandishing his red card last night, I received a message from a colleague along very similar lines, as to whether Ronaldo will face the full force of the law.

“I am fully aware that Fifa are a wonderful and fair organisation led by a wonderful and peace-loving human being,” emails Espen. “Yet there is this tiny nagging thought in the back of my head saying that I'm not entirely sure they will follow their own rules and ban Ronaldo for two World Cup games. Don't know why but there's just something …”

John Brewin has penned today's Football Daily. You guessed it, it's all about Cristiano Ronaldo and his antics in Dublin last night.

Martin McColgan has emailed to query the following stat posted below:

England have won their last six away matches in all competitions, their best run since between May 1970 and December 1971 (6).

“Only if you don't count losing to Brazil and West Germany at the Mexico World Cup finals in June 1970,” writes Martin.

An interesting shout, I suppose for statistical purposes tournament games are not considered “away” matches.

Here's the view of a friend of mine who was at Fortess Aviva: “Portugal were woeful, sideways passing, no ideas, modern football! The striker who came on for them [Gonçalo Ramos] did more in two minutes than Ronaldo did the whole game. I mean, he doesn't even run any more.”

“I was just finishing an email to you last night about how limited this Irish team right as Troy Parrott scored the first goal,” writes John.

“Even with last nights result, I stand by that comment that they are limited but there are enough decent players to form into a competent team. The big problem is that there is no midfielder who can either dominate a game or who can create chances. That's obviously a problem but there are enough decent centre-backs there to create a good defence and a top-class keeper in Kelleher as well. That should be the basis of a decent team but the big thing this Irish team has is that it has attackers who are capable of scoring goals.

“Along with Parrott last night, Evan Ferguson has scored three goals in four games in qualifying while struggling at club level. It's been unfortunate that Ferguson and Parrott have not been fit at the same times this season as there is a chance of a good partnership there. Adam Idah has his flaws & shortcomings but he has a decent record for Ireland and if a Scottish player had scored 20 goals last season for Celtic, you could be sure he would be starting up front for them.

“Point is that for all of Ireland shortcomings, there is the bones of a decent team there and at international level, if you can get your tactics, organisation and discipline right, you can go a long way. Whether Heimir Hallgrimsson is the man to do that, I don't know, but with last nights result I think he has earned a chance to build on this.”

If you didn't see this goal by Piotr Zielinski for Inter the other week, stop everything and watch this:

What can I say about that? Other than: I hit one very similar at Catford Powerleague in 2012.

Football's global popularity is being placed at risk by skewing the sport's balance towards more matches at international level, Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has warned.

The impact of Uefa's expansion of club competitions was again felt this month, with Arsenal and Crystal Palace's Carabao Cup tie and their league fixtures preceding it having to be rearranged in part due to Palace's participation in the Uefa Conference League.

Leagues are also concerned about the impact of the expanded, summertime Club World Cup on their competitions from an economic and player welfare perspective, particularly amid talk of a further expansion from 32 to 48 teams and playing it every two years instead of every four.

Masters joined other league executives at the two-day World Leagues Association annual meeting in Athens this week, where the threat to domestic leagues from international expansion was one of the major topics discussed.

“(This meeting) is the best attended we've ever had and it's no surprise it comes at a time when the balance between national and international football is under threat from the unprecedented expansion of international competitions,” Masters said.

“We cannot take football's global popularity, its fans and its players for granted by fracturing this balance through an overloaded international calendar. All our members are united in their belief that to restore this balance domestic leagues must be protected.

“Football at all levels, from international competitions to grassroots, needs strong national leagues to provide the foundations. Dialogue with Fifa is now crucial and it is in the best interests of football to involve the leagues in any future decisions about the international calendar.”

European Leagues and the European division of world players' union Fifpro have filed a legal complaint to the European Commission against Fifa over what they see as an abuse of its dominant position under EU competition law.

They argue FIFA is abusing its position as both regulator and competition organiser and in doing so, causing economic and sporting damage to domestic leagues and jeopardising player welfare.

Fifa argues it is within its rights to organise competitions such as the Club World Cup within the parameters of the international calendar.

Fifa also has a Memorandum of Understanding with European Football Clubs - which features 17 current Premier League clubs among its membership - through to 2030 which renews those clubs' commitment to the international calendar. (PA Media)

There is a parallel between Cristiano Ronaldo/Portugal and Jude Bellingham/England. If Ronaldo gets a three-match ban for violent conduct, meaning he was due to miss Portugal's first two group games in North America, surely Roberto Martínez would be sensible to drop him altogether? Judging by his behaviour last night, it is hard to believe he is a positive presence in the changing room.

Thomas Tuchel has already shown he is willing to leave Bellingham out – and while he is a less dominant presence in the England setup than Ronaldo with Portugal, it's also feasible that Tuchel feels he is not a wholly positive figure when it comes to the building an upbeat squad dynamic. You really have to feel for the Adidas marketing people, after all that money they chucked at the current Bellingham campaign.

In other news, someone on telly was just blathering on about how England's back-up options for Harry Kane aren't up to scratch. I don't really buy that. The only reason England beat the Netherlands at the last Euros is that Ollie Watkins came on, a striker who can actually run fast. Kane is obviously in extremely good form but that is under specific circumstances at Bayern and in a certain way of playing. I wouldn't be entirely surprised to see him stinking out another major international tournament come next summer.

Thank you David. Here we are again. I was lucky enough to be doing the clockwatch for Republic of Ireland v Portugal last night, plus the other games. The match in Dublin bore all the hallmarks of a frustrating 0-0, or an agonising 0-1 defeat for the hosts.

But it couldn't have turned out much better, both in terms of result for the Irish, and Cristiano Ronaldo's comically childish yet notably violent red card. I'm doing the clockwatch again for tonight's qualifiers too.

In the meantime send me an email with your thoughts on Republic of Ireland's victory, prospects for their match in Budapest on Sunday, or tonight's games which include Slovakia v Northern Ireland, Luxembourg v Germany and Poland v Netherlands. Oh, and there's always England too. Let's go!

Time to hand the blog over to Luke McLaughlin for the rest of the afternoon. Thanks for reading!

Next up for England is a trip to Albania on Sunday. Some Opta stats here to impress family and friends with:

Albania have lost all seven of their matches against England – all in World Cup qualifiers – conceding at least twice in every defeat and scoring just once, an Altin Rraklli goal in a 3-1 loss in March 2001.

Albania have not conceded a goal in a home qualifier for a major tournament (EURO/World Cup) for eight matches, since a 1-0 defeat to Poland in October 2021. They have faced 70 shots (17 on target) and an xG of 4.61 without conceding in these eight games.

England have won their last six away matches in all competitions, their best run since between May 1970 and December 1971 (6).

England have kept a clean sheet in each of their last nine competitive internationals, facing just nine shots on target in that run – five of which were against Greece in the first of those nine games last November.

England have won their last two away matches 5-0, beating Serbia in September and Latvia in October. They last hit 5+ goals in three away games in a row between May 1937 and May 1938.

Harry Kane has been directly involved in seven goals in three appearances against Albania (5 goals, 2 assists), scoring or assisting on average every 35 minutes.

A quick mention for our cricket coverage with a week to go until day one of the first Ashes Test in Perth.

Back to domestic matters now and an exclusive. The EFL is to oppose radical proposals from League one clubs to introduce a £4.7m salary cap and a luxury tax for clubs that overspend.

Eighteen League One clubs wrote to the EFL chair, Rick Parry, this month advocating a fixed squad salary allowance, which they argue is required to get spending under control in a division where the median loss among 24 clubs last season was £5.2m.

“But what about the assists charts?” I hear you cry. Yes, we have those too. Norway on top again. Slightly surprising that Declan Rice has been England's top provider in the European World Cup qualifiers.

7 Martin Ødegaard (Norway)5 Lovro Majer (Croatia)5 Sorba Thomas (Wales)4 Memphis Depay (Netherlands)4 Mateo Retegui (Italy)﻿4 Declan Rice (England)4 Julian Ryerson (Norway)4 Manor Solomon (Israel)﻿

Erling Haaland is a mile clear in the top scorers in European World Cup qualifying charts. Those 14 goals have helped the ‘cheeseburger chompers' (see 11:22) smash 33 in their seven qualifiers. To be honest, it's pretty impressive that his teammates have combined for all those other 19.

The world of football throws up no shortage of questions. Today, Graham Ruthven endeavors to answer three of them, two of those involving Pep and Messi.

After failing to reach the finals in 2018 and 2022, could we be facing a third World Cup without the presence of Italy? It's possible. With group rivals Norway in such flying form (seven wins out of seven), Italy are now destined for the play-offs. The Azzurri only just scraped past Moldova last night, goals in the 88th minute and injury-time securing an unconvincing 2-0 win against a team that Norway had blasted 11 past, Erling Haaland helping himself to a five-for.

Not surprisingly, the travelling fans weren't happy, voicing their disapproval loudly but Italy boss Gennaro Gattuso wasn't having it. “What I heard today was a disgrace. I can't accept it. There are no easy games. If you're still thinking about the 11-1 Norway did against them here, that's not my problem. I'm very happy, let's move on. You have to stay united, because the team is struggling with difficulties on the pitch - and I don't accept hearing 500 fans protesting.”

Warming to his task, Gattuso also had a go at the qualification system. “In our day, the best runners-up went straight to the World Cup.”

Quiz time! Plenty of football questions in today's test of the grey matter. Quite a tricky one today.

Can France, after West Germany and Brazil, become only the third team to reach three consecutive World Cup finals? Luke Entwistle runs the rule over the 2018 winners after their 4-0 victory over Ukraine last night, a game that was Didier Deschamps' last competitive game on French soil as manager.

Here's Troy Parrott on his double against Portugal which kept the Republic of Ireland's World Cup hopes alive. Those two goals from the AZ Alkmaar striker secured a surprise 2-0 victory which means the Irish can earn a play-off spot if winning away to Hungary on Sunday. Parrott got the nod due to the absence of injured Roma frontman Evan Ferguson.

“It means everything. I felt emotions scoring those goals that I've never felt before. I don't even have the words to describe them. It's really a special feeling. I'm over the moon.

“I know it's a bit of a cliche, but I think Sunday now is probably the biggest game. We gave ourselves a good chance to get into that second spot, so now all the focus is on Sunday.

“I've had a big night. I'm not frustrated with the past. It is still frustrating that I've had to wait a long time for a night like this, but it just goes to show I have a lot of belief in myself. To see it pay off is really special.”

Former England captain Millie Bright has been getting her chat on with Suzanne Wrack. The Chelsea defender talks Barcelona, the benefits of taking a breather and joining a campaign to tackle winter loneliness.

Thanks Alex. Excellent win there for Curaçao. Fun fact: they're 82nd in the Fifa World Rankings, nine spots above Bulgaria. Stoichkov won't be happy.

It's not just European qualifiers going on right now, naturally, results in Concacaf World Cup qualifying today include Guatemala 2-3 Panama, Haiti 1-0 Costa Rica, Nicaragua 2-0 Honduras, Bermuda 0-7 Curaçao and, vitally, Trinidad and Tobago 1-1 Jamaica – a game which pitched Dwight Yorke against Steve McClaren in a managerial showdown. Honours even!

And, on that bombshell, I'll hand you back to David Tindall.

Cristiano Ronaldo's red card and possible suspension from two World Cup games for Portugal (note: I, perhaps cynically, believe this is unlikely) has me thinking about star players suspended for the start of major tournaments.

Wayne Rooney missed England's opening two games of Euro 2012, of course, after being sent off in England's draw with Montenegro. Before that, in Euro 2008, Russia were without a suspended Andrey Arshavin for two group games, before he returned and helped his side to the semi-finals. I'm sure there are simply loads I'm missing …

Unsurprising news: Marc Guéhi has now officially withdrawn from the England squad due to his foot injury. An FA statement has trumpeted: “Crystal Palace's Marc Guéhi has left the England camp and will not travel to Albania for Sunday's 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifier.

“The defender joined up with the Three Lions at Tottenham Hotspur's training ground earlier this week but has returned to his club to continue his rehabilitation.”

Palace go to Wolves next weekend so the club will be hoping to get their captain fit for that.

Thomas Tuchel has given more feedback on his England players after the win against Serbia. The gist: stand down John Cena, because none of them require an attitude adjustment. “I'm very happy with the attitude again of the team,” said Tuchel. “I don't see any change of attitude in training because the game doesn't mean anything, or is a dead-rubber as you call it, or is a friendly.”

England go to Albania in their last qualifier aiming to make it a perfect eight wins from eight. “I'm pretty sure we will be ready and the team will have the right spirit, to do it hopefully again in Albania, with all the respect,” added Tuchel. “It will be not easy and from there we go.”

Scotland visit Greece tomorrow in a vital Group C match – Ewan Murray is in Athens, surrounded by ancient wonders, and he's supplied his preview.

“It appears you can be on the brink of reaching your holy grail without many people paying sufficient attention. Scotland's opportunity for World Cup qualification is their best since 1998, when they last performed on that scene. Theirs is also a scenario that would have been widely welcomed before a ball was kicked. On the basis Denmark will defeat Belarus, Scotland must take at least a point from Saturday's clash in Greece.”

Group G's fixtures tonight are Finland v Malta and the big one: Poland v the Netherlands. The Dutch are three points ahead of Poland with a far better goal difference, so it isn't exactly a top-spot showdown, but nothing is settled yet. Finland could still sneak into second if it all goes wrong for Poland in their last two fixtures.

Group L has Croatia v Faroe Islands (on a three-game qualification win streak!) later today. Plus Gibraltar v Montenegro. Croatia will qualify for the World Cup if they pick up a point.

World Cup qualification action tonight is brought to you by the Groups A, G and L (note: for me, Group L just sounds too far into the alphabet but there we go).

Group A features Slovakia v Northern Ireland and, while the latter are guaranteed a playoff spot after topping their Nations League group, they could do Germany a favour(!) by taking at least a point off Slovakia. Germany face Luxembourg this evening, but the final match is Germany v Slovakia in a likely playoff for top spot. A reminder that Germany lost the first fixture between those two sides, 2-0 in September.

Thanks David – on the subject of England World Cup songs: I'm obviously partial to the epic 90s duo of my youth (World in Motion/Three Lions).

However I also have a guilty soft spot for Ant and Dec's We're on the Ball and I can recite the entire passing sequence – “it's Neville to Campbell, Campbell to Rio, Rio to Scholsey” etc, etc – from start to finish off by heart. Yet I can remember next to nothing of my GCSE French. How useful.

Right, time for me to hand you over to Alex Reid while I head out in the pouring rain for supplies.

Here's Portugal coach Roberto Martinez defending Cristiano Ronaldo for the elbow on the Republic of Ireland's Dara O'Shea that could lead to the skipper missing the first two group games of the 2026 World Cup finals.

FIFA's disciplinary code states violent conduct should lead to a suspension of at least three matches, as should any offence of assault, including “elbowing, punching, kicking, biting, spitting at or hitting an opponent”. Ronaldo will definitely serve a one-match ban for his red card in the 2-0 defeat in Dublin, meaning he misses Portugal's final qualifier against Armenia on Sunday, but then it's in Fifa's hands as to whether that suspension is increased to three games.

Martinez said of Ronaldo: “The red card is just a captain that has never been sent off before in 226 games – I think that just deserves credit – and today, I thought it was a bit harsh because he cares about the team.

“He was 60 minutes or 58 minutes in the box being grabbed, being pulled, being pushed and obviously when he tries to get away from the defender. I think the action looks worse than what it actually is, I don't think it's an elbow, I think it's a full body, but from where the camera is, it looks like an elbow. But we accept it.

“The only thing that leaves a bitter taste in my mouth is at the (pre-match) press conference, (the Ireland) coach (Heimir Hallgrimsson) was talking about the aspect of the referees being influenced, and then a big centre-half falls on the floor so dramatically at the turn of Cristiano's body.”

An e-mail from Kieran McHugh. 

“We all know that the best World Cup song is This Time by the 1982 World Cup squad. Whether it's comb and paper or a kazoo may never be known, but it's a cracking song and the video demonstrates Shilts' lip syncing is up there with Milli Vanilli. However as a resident of Loughton, Essex I have further information that may be of interest. News in fact of a blue plaque in Loughton that celebrates the former home of Ron Greenwood. The house number? 22. Of course!”

A song now to hopefully inspire the Republic of Ireland to World Cup qualification. Remember this? Mick McCarthy on drums after 31 seconds. Produced by U2's Larry Mullen.

Exciting news from Norway where Erling Haaland was seen coming out of a local restaurant with a massive stash of cheeseburgers after scoring a brace in the 4-1 win over Estonia. Experts reckon the celebratory haul was significant, with claims of “60 to 70 cheeseburgers” in some outlets. Haaland, age 25, was still wearing his Norway training gear when emerging from the fast food establishment. More when we have it.

Shall we have some World Cup songs? Let's start with England. This is often forgotten and overshadowed by 1970's ‘Back Home' and 1982's ‘This Time (We'll Get It Right)‘ but I rather like 1998's ‘(How Does It Feel to Be) On Top of the World'. I mean, the Spice Girls are in the video, it was written by Ian McCulloch, Johnny Marr and the fella out of Ocean Colour Scene. Released on Juxtaposition Records. Didn't get to No.1. Good, didn't want it to. Next.

A brief departure from international musings. Then again, not quite as two England starters from last night appear in this list curated by Danel Harris.

England analysis. Five pointers from the Wembley win, courtesy of Jacob Steinberg. Nico O'Reilly and Marcus Rashford both feature.

“The dream scenario is Marcus Rashford becoming England's Son Heung-min. Kane loved dropping off and releasing Son when they were teammates at Tottenham.”

Some Thomas Tuchel quotes from England's 2-0 win. The German was delighted with the impact of his substitutes which included Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden.

“This is not about building a starting XI, it's about building a team. And that means that sometimes, they're all big players in their club, they're all used to play, they're all disappointed. This is normal, but they buy into this idea of building a team and this is what we want, this is what we need, there is no other way around it.”

You want content? How about this for content, then: Luis Rubiales having eggs flung at him during during the presentation of his new book in Madrid. Not only that, the disgraced former Spanish football federation president claimed the flinger was his uncle.

Zapruder footage here. You have to say that the disgraced former Spanish football federation president takes the second egg well. Quite the spin to catch it on his cool jacket, ensuring the egg doesn't strike his cool white t-shirt and cool light blue jeans. Would disgraced presidents from other football federations have shown such mobility in a tight area?

A reminder that Rubiales was convicted of sexual assault for a forced kiss on the player Jenni Hermoso after Spain won the Women's World Cup.

Here's Barney Ronay's take on last night's game at Wembley and the big talking point: England's No 10.

“Tuchel has been very clear. He wants a structure not a group of the coolest guys, a selection by aura. And in many ways it worked here as on 65 minutes, with England already 1-0 up, we finally got it, the shootout of the No 10s. We got energy, mood-shift, a four-man blazing squad entering the field of play: Jude, Phil, Eberechi Eze and, er, Jordan Henderson.”

The World Cup starts in 209 days. It seems quite a while yet but if you're thinking about committing to the 2026 Panini sticker album, it's probably worth putting aside some cash now. With 48 teams involved, this ain't going to be cheap.

I've asked AI to run the numbers. “It will likely cost well over £1,000 to fill the 2026 Panini World Cup sticker album, potentially reaching as high as £1,500, due to the increase in the number of teams and general inflation. While the theoretical minimum cost, assuming no duplicates, is much lower (around £120-£130), the practical cost is much higher because of the high probability of getting duplicate stickers.” Quote this to your football-mad 10-year-old nearer the time.

In related news, I had a rummage the other night and found three spare Robertos from the 1978 World Cup collection. Does anyone know if the Brazilian striker is worth much?

A World Cup qualifying quiz question. In the European section, only one other team apart from England have gone through qualifying with a perfect record so far? Don't look down if you want to try and make a guess.

A clue: they haven't played in the finals since France ‘98.

A second clue: they have a big lad up front.

Yes, the answer is Norway, who have won seven out of seven after beating Estonia 4-1 in Oslo last night. Erling Haaland helped himself to another couple and now has 14 goals in qualifying.

Technically, they haven't yet qualified as Italy, who they play away in the final game, could still join Norway on 21 points. However, check the goal difference: Norway +29, Italy +12. So just a 17-goal swing then.

Not wanting to spoil the party but it's a still a big ask for the Republic of Ireland to qualify for the finals. To secure a play-off spot they need to secure victory over Hungary in Budapest on Sunday. Hungary stayed ahead of the Irish in Group F after Barnabás Varga headed home Dominik Szoboszlai's cross to secure a 1-0 win in Armenia.

The last time Hungary took part in a World Cup play-off they lost 12-1 on aggregate to Yugoslovia in 1997. What?! 12-1!!

Which countries have qualified for the 2026 World Cup and how did they do it? Here's a very handy ‘Explainer' from Andy Martin. Twenty-nine of the 48 places have now been filled but some big names – Cameroon and Nigeria for example – will need to come through a playoff.

That red card for Ronaldo against the Republic of Ireland was his first in 226 appearances for Portugal. And the man himself certainly didn't see it coming having come out with these famous last words before the match. “I really like the fans here. The support they give to their national team is lovely. For me, it's a pleasure to come to play here again. I hope they don't boo too much to me tomorrow. I swear that I'm gonna try to be a good boy.”

There could be some serious ramifications for Ronnie after his flailing arm on Dara O'Shea. The red means he's automatically banned for Portugal's home game against Armenia on Sunday. But if judged as “serious foul play” by Fifa, that suspension would double to two matches and if classed as “violent conduct” the ban would be extend to three.

That, of course, would mean Ronaldo missing one, or even two, of Portugal's opening group games in the 2026 finals. I'm going to make a wild guess here… I don't think that will happen.

Back to England v Serbia and some player ratings. We have a ‘9' and a couple of ‘8s'. Press here to reveal Ed Aarons' scores on the doors from Wembley.

Republic of Ireland 2-0 Portugal. While England winning 2-0 generated nothing much more than a shrug around the football world, another qualifier ending in that same scoreline raised lots of eyebrows. Fantastic stuff from the Irish as two goals from Troy Parrott secured a famous win in Dublin and kept their playoff hopes alive. And just for extra craic for the home fans filing out of the Aviva, Cristiano Ronaldo was sent off! More details here on the best sporting performance from a Parrott since John beat Jimmy White 18-11 in the final of the 1991 world snooker championship.

Good morning! Before the deep dive, let's start with the bread and butter: David Hytner's match report of England 2-0 Serbia.

“Too often, the final pass was missing. But what the manager did get was another win and another clean sheet. Count seven of each from seven qualifiers. The final one is against Albania in Tirana on Sunday. And, also, two lovely goals.”

International breaks seem to go on for ages and we're not even halfway through the latest one. Still, matters are being resolved and the picture of just who will be at next summer's 2026 World Cup finals is becoming clearer.

England had already qualified ahead of last night's 2-0 win over Serbia but that didn't stop the forensic analysis of Thomas Tuchel's latest selection and England's Wembley performance.

We'll bring you all the fallout from last night's game and also a round-up of events elsewhere where it was quite the night for the Republic of Ireland. For Cristiano Ronaldo, not so much.

And beyond World Cup qualifying, there appears to have been a family feud in Spain involving eggs. More on that shortly.

Inter president Beppe Marotta has candidly admitted that while a return for former Manchester United and Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho was ""mentioned,"" as the club searched for a new manager, he would have ultimately ""regretted hiring him."" Marotta praised the ""courageous"" decision to appoint Christian Chivu instead, highlighting the club's commitment to different values and a forward-thinking approach over relying on big-name managers.

Marotta has revealed that Mourinho's name was among those considered for the coaching role before the ""courageous"" decision was made to appoint Chivu. Speaking at the executive master's program in ""Sports Management"" organized by the RCS Academy Business School, Marotta explained why he ultimately favored Chivu, despite Mourinho's illustrious past with the Nerazzurri.

According to Gazzetta.it, Marotta stated: ""I'm surprised people were surprised by Cristian's skill. We chose him because he represents important values; he had the courage to go against the grain, even in the media. Some even mentioned Mourinho, who, with all due respect... If I hadn't had the courage, I would have regretted it.""

Mourinho, who famously led Inter to a historic treble in 2010, was reportedly a name floated by ""some"" stakeholders, indicating a natural inclination among some to revisit a successful past. However, Marotta's comments suggest a deliberate decision to move in a different direction, prioritizing new leadership and values.

Chivu, who took over from Simone Inzaghi, has navigated a challenging start to his tenure at Inter, ultimately guiding the team to the top of Serie A and a perfect record in the Champions League. His initial period included three defeats in Serie A, but the team has since recovered impressively.

Under Chivu, Inter are currently in first place in Serie A alongside Gian Piero Gasperini's Roma, demonstrating a rapid turnaround in league form. In the Champions League, their performance has been particularly strong, boasting four wins out of four matches played and conceding only one goal. This triumphant march in Europe contrasts sharply with the earlier domestic stumbles, showcasing Chivu's ability to adapt and motivate his squad.

Marotta's praise for Chivu's ""skill"" and ""courage"" aligns with the team's visible progress. Chivu has been credited with introducing a ""different football philosophy,"" which Marotta believes aligns with the club's evolving values. This new approach appears to be focused on developing talent and fostering a collective spirit rather than relying solely on individual star power.

Marotta used the platform to discuss the significant changes in modern football, particularly the shift from a ""patronage model"" to one demanding ""sustainability"" and ""financial balance."" He emphasised that the equation ""if I spend, I win"" is no longer valid, citing PSG as an example of a club that has changed its model from ""huge names"" to investing in ""young talent.""

This philosophical shift is directly linked to the decision to back Chivu over a high-profile manager like Mourinho. Marotta highlighted the importance of ""motivation multiplied by competence"" as the new formula for success. His career path, starting as a ""mascot"" for Varese and learning to ""negotiate"" for a tracksuit, underscores his belief in hard work and organic growth, values he sees in Chivu.

Marotta also touched on the increasing complexity of football management, which now involves ""criminal, civil, and sports justice codes,"" and requires ""industrial and financial expertise"" alongside traditional sporting knowledge. He stressed the importance of leadership that is ""courageous, persevering, and must listen,"" attributes he clearly sees in Chivu.

During his address, Marotta shared personal anecdotes from his extensive career in football. He recalled a pivotal moment in 1983 when then-Inter president Pellegrini offered him a junior manager role, an offer he declined. ""If I had accepted, I wouldn't be president today,"" he mused, emphasising the importance of timing and managing career progression calmly.

He also recounted a difficult decision during his time at Sampdoria where he had to fire a ""very dear friend,"" Gianfranco Bellotto, to bring the club back to Serie A. This story illustrates the tough choices leaders often face, prioritising the club's objectives over personal relationships.

Marotta concluded his speech by addressing the contentious issue of San Siro's future. While acknowledging the ""bitterness and nostalgia"" for old romantics, he stressed the necessity of a new, modern stadium for Inter's future. He entered San Siro for the first time in 1966 and described it as a ""vessel of enormous emotions,"" but argued that innovation and modernity are paramount.

""Renovation was unthinkable, and so it ended up being demolished. But it must be done,"" he asserted. Marotta highlighted the need for a stadium that prioritizes ""security, which is lacking; hospitality, so you can be there all day with entertainment of all kinds; and a sense of belonging. Having your own home."" He projected the financial benefits of a new stadium, contrasting Inter's current €80 million (£68m/$88m) per year from matchdays with Real Madrid's goal of exceeding half a billion.

Chivu and Inter will aim to maintain their strong form in both Serie A and the Champions League as the season progresses. The backing from President Marotta provides Chivu with significant confidence as he continues to implement his coaching philosophy.

The club's focus on sustainability and youth development, as articulated by Marotta, will likely influence future transfer strategies and player development pathways. The long-term project under Chivu represents a clear strategic direction for Inter, moving away from relying on established managerial figures towards nurturing new talent and adhering to modern football's financial realities. The new stadium project also remains a critical component of Inter's future growth, promising both financial and cultural benefits.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has issued a stark warning that the global appeal of football is being jeopardised by an increasing imbalance favouring international fixtures.

His comments come amid growing concerns over the impact of expanded international competitions on domestic leagues.

The strain on the domestic calendar was recently highlighted by the rearrangement of Arsenal and Crystal Palace's Carabao Cup tie and preceding league fixtures, partly due to Palace's involvement in the UEFA Conference League.

Further anxieties surround the expanded summertime Club World Cup, with leagues fearing economic and player welfare repercussions, particularly given discussions of increasing its size from 32 to 48 teams and holding it biennially.

Speaking at the World Leagues Association annual meeting in Athens, Masters underscored the urgency of the situation.

He stated: ""(This meeting) is the best attended we've ever had and it's no surprise it comes at a time when the balance between national and international football is under threat from the unprecedented expansion of international competitions.""

Masters continued, stressing the need for caution: ""We cannot take football's global popularity, its fans and its players for granted by fracturing this balance through an overloaded international calendar. All our members are united in their belief that to restore this balance domestic leagues must be protected.""

He added that ""dialogue with FIFA is now crucial and it is in the best interests of football to involve the leagues in any future decisions about the international calendar.""

This sentiment is echoed by European Leagues and FIFPRO, the world players' union, who have lodged a legal complaint with the European Commission against FIFA.

They allege FIFA is abusing its dominant position under EU competition law, acting as both regulator and competition organiser, thereby causing economic and sporting harm to domestic leagues and compromising player welfare.

FIFA, however, maintains it is within its rights to organise competitions like the Club World Cup within the existing international calendar.

The organisation also points to a Memorandum of Understanding with European Football Clubs, which includes 17 Premier League teams, extending to 2030, reaffirming these clubs' commitment to the international schedule.

Dynamic pricing sparks outrage as parking rivals premium event costs across venues

Dubai: World Cup ticket holders should brace for an unexpected expense at next year's tournament: parking. 

Prices on FIFA's official website have soared as high as $175 per car, stunning fans across the United States، a country where driving to major events is the norm and public transit options are limited.

The figures, first reported by The Athletic, have sparked widespread disbelief among American sports fans. The U.S. is one of three World Cup hosts, alongside Canada and Mexico.

According to FIFA's online listings, a general parking pass for the July 14 semifinal in Dallas costs $175, while parking for group-stage matches is priced at $75. Parking at the July 11 quarterfinal in Kansas City will cost $125, and again $75for group-stage fixtures.

The irony is striking: in the first phase of ticket sales, which used flexible, dynamic pricing, group-stage seats started at just $60, meaning fans could end up paying more to park their car than to enter the stadium.

As of this week, only a handful of the tournament's 16 host venues across the US, Canada, and Mexico have released parking passes online. Major host cities, including Mexico City, which will open the tournament, and New York-New Jersey, which will host the final, have not yet made any parking available.

Many US host cities lack the public-transport infrastructure common in Europe and other footballing regions. All 11 American stadiums set to host matches are NFL venues surrounded by vast parking lots, yet during the World Cup, much of that space will fall inside security perimeters or be repurposed for hospitality zones, making parking more scarce and more valuable.

FIFA appears poised to capitalize on that scarcity. Its official parking website, powered by the technology firm JustPark, indicates that paid parking will eventually be sold for most or all tournament venues.

Early pricing suggests a tiered structure: $75 for group-stage and round-of-32 matches, $100–$145 for the knockout rounds, and $175 for semifinals and the third-place game. In Philadelphia, group-stage parking already appears at $115.

The sticker shock comes during record demand for tickets. FIFA received more than 1.5 million ticket applicationswithin 24 hours of launching its presale draw in September.

With 48 teams, 104 matches, and millions of fans expected to travel between cities, transportation was always likely to be one of the tournament's biggest hurdles. Now, with parking prices rivaling premium event experiences, fans are left wondering: At the 2026 World Cup, how expensive will it be just to show up?

Germany can effectively seal its spot at the 2026 World Cup by beating Luxembourg on the road this Friday.

The 2026 World Cup qualification trail is nearing its climax, and Germany has the opportunity to all but guarantee its place at the tournament when it visits Luxembourg on Friday. Die Mannschaft leads Slovakia on goal difference at the top of UEFA Group A and can potentially open up a gap with only a couple of games to play.

The two teams hold identical records of three wins and one defeat thus far in qualifying, with Slovakia having stunned the Germans with a 2-0 win in Bratislava back in September. Julian Nagelsmann's side have recovered to take to the top of the pool, but their future at next year's global tournament isn't quite sealed just yet.

Luxembourg, on the other hand, is already well aware it will not be featuring at the World Cup after failing to pick up a single point in four qualifiers to date. That means the best the Red Lions can do is hope to act as a speed bump this weekend and potentially aid Slovakia's cause in the process.

The Germans have won in each of their last seven encounters with Luxembourg and triumphed 4-0 when these teams faced off in Sinsheim last month. However, it's perhaps a concern for Nagelsmann that his side has looked far less capable on the road, producing just one goal in two away qualifiers thus far.

'If Harry Kane were to get injured this summer, where would that leave us?'

England have been able to start preparing for next summer's World Cup for months, such has been the ease of their qualifying campaign. But the task of picking warm-up games is a tricky one for coach Thomas Tuchel.

Unlike some of the other leading contenders, England have been starved of top-level competition since losing to Spain in the final of Euro 2024. 

Now the Three Lions must plot their two friendly matches in March, plus potential games in North America before their first World Cup game - and there are decisions to be made about who they play.

The highest-ranked team played by Thomas Tuchel's England is Senegal (19th in the world at the time)

England's relegation to League B of the 2024 Uefa Nations League put them at a disadvantage.

While the likes of France, Italy, Belgium and Netherlands were playing against each other in League A, England faced three teams from lower down the world rankings - Greece (ranked 48th in September 2024), Republic of Ireland (62nd) and Finland (64th).

England won five of those six games, with a surprise home loss to Greece the only dropped points. 

Coupled with a World Cup qualifying campaign where England have won every match without conceding a goal, there is a concern they could arrive at next summer's tournament undercooked. 

It is not like the Nations League could be truly used to experiment either, as Lee Carsley took interim charge of that campaign after Gareth Southgate's departure.

England had been planning to play two friendlies in the United States in June this year, but that was scuppered by being drawn into a World Cup group of five teams rather than four.

While England were left with two free dates for friendlies, other confederations were largely busy with their own World Cup qualifiers. 

With Serbia, ranked 36th, the strongest team in England's qualifying group, it means Senegal (19th at the time) are the highest-ranked team the Three Lions have played since Euro 2024. And they lost that game at the City Ground 3-1.

The highest-ranked team England have beaten in that time is Wales (30th) - 3-0 in a friendly in October. 

'Saka cements place alongside Kane as Tuchel's trusted lieutenants'

The great number nine decline - where have England's strikers gone?

Will Ronaldo be banned at World Cup after red card?

England will not confirm their opponents for the March friendlies until after the World Cup draw on 5 December.

Reports suggest fixtures against Uruguay and Japan are pencilled in. But with England set to be in Pot 1 for the draw, and those two countries in Pot 2, there is a chance one of them could be in the same group - which would rule out a friendly.

Preparations are complicated, too, by an early start to next summer's tournament. 

The Premier League ends on 24 May, with the Champions League final on 30 May. 

The earliest England could play their first game is on 13 June, when Group C kicks off. 

That would only leave a small window to fit in the two games Tuchel wants to help the England squad acclimatise to the high temperatures and playing conditions.  

But if England are drawn for a later start - Groups K and L begin on 17 June - there is a little bit more room to play with.

In 2018, England were able to fit in two warm-ups, on 2 and 7 June, before they played their opening Group G game on 18 June.

That season the Champions League final - when Real Madrid beat Liverpool 3-1 in Kyiv, with Jordan Henderson and Trent Alexander-Arnold involved so missing the first friendly - was played earlier on 26 May.

England did not play any warm-up games before the 2022 World Cup, with the October international break scrapped before the November start in Qatar.

England's most recent game against a South American team was in March 2024 - when they lost 1-0 to Brazil at Wembley

Before the Nations League began, England's men's team would regularly arrange matches against countries from around the world. But friendlies are now relatively rare - England have only played 14 since the 2018 World Cup, compared to 37 in the seven years before then.

England's women's team have enjoyed much more freedom. 

Before the 2019 Women's World Cup they were able to play 11 friendlies, including testing fixtures against Sweden, Brazil (twice), the USA and Spain. 

Before the 2023 tournament they played nine matches against opponents of different strengths, plus the Finalissima against Brazil.

They reached the semi-finals in 2019 and the final in 2023.

So should the men's team look to organise games against top countries, or versus nations who play in a similar style to their World Cup opponents? 

Ideally, you would do both. Before the 2018 World Cup, England played the Netherlands and Italy (who had failed to qualify) in March before taking on Nigeria and Costa Rica - as direct preparation for group stage games against Tunisia and Panama.

But England need to weigh up two kinds of preparation, and consider possible knockout opponents too.

They have not faced a South American team since the 1-0 defeat by Brazil in March 2024.

And they have not played a team from Asia (discounting a friendly against Australia in October 2023) or Concacaf since matches against Iran and the USA at the 2022 World Cup.

The draw will be the guide, but Uruguay (ranked 15th) would present the chance to play a team from South America, and be their strongest opponents for two years. Japan, now ranked 19th, are the leading nation in Asia.

However, you cannot help but wonder if England might be missing a true top-level test before the World Cup.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","Miami mayor wants to donate up to $7.5M in city services to 2026 World Cup events","https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article312892116.html","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 16:35:23 GMT","

With just a few weeks to go before he's out of office, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has a big ask of his colleagues on the City Commission: approve up to $7.5 million in city services to support FIFA-sanctioned events when the World Cup games come to town next year.

That's in addition to a $5 million cash contribution that the city previously agreed to pay to FIFA World Cup, according to a July budget memo.

If approved, the city could join Miami-Dade County in donating millions of dollars in government services when the World Cup brings seven soccer matches to Hard Rock Stadium in 2026. The city's proposal to donate services from police, fire-rescue, sanitation and more follows a request from the local World Cup host committee, which is independent of FIFA, according to the legislation.

Suarez, who is sponsoring the proposal, said in a statement to the Miami Herald that next year's events present a “once in a lifetime opportunity.”

While the World Cup games are taking place in Miami Gardens — a separate municipality — Suarez said he's expecting a flurry of related events to happen in the city of Miami. That includes FIFA Fan Festival, taking place in downtown's Bayfront Park, which Suarez said will draw “over 1 million attendees.”

“Miami will receive unprecedented global exposure, and our small businesses, restaurants, and hotels stand to benefit enormously from the influx of tourism and international media attention,” Suarez said.

Asked how the city arrived at the $7.5 million figure, the mayor said it is “based on the public safety, traffic management, sanitation, and logistical support required to safely host an event of that scale.” He did not provide further details on how the number was calculated.

“Beyond FanFest, we anticipate several FIFA sanctioned activations within city limits, all of which will generate significant economic and cultural value,” Suarez said. “Put simply: this investment ensures Miami shows the world who we are, while maximizing the economic return for our residents and businesses.”

The proposed legislation is slated to go before the Miami City Commission for a vote Thursday.

Host committee chair Rodney Barreto has been spearheading the push for government funding for the games at Hard Rock, the Herald previously reported. Neither Barreto nor Alina Hudak, who is president and CEO of the host committee, responded to requests for comment seeking more details on the amount of financial assistance the host committee requested from the city and how it anticipates using city services.

Other board members of the nonprofit host committee include Jorge Mas, the managing owner of Inter Miami and one of the developers behind the under-construction Miami Freedom Park soccer stadium, which is the mayor's marquee project, and billionaire Ken Griffin, an acquaintance of Suarez.

Griffin was on the roster at a major business conference Suarez organized last week. Speaking onstage, Griffin said: “If [Suarez] asks me to jump, the only answer is how high.” FIFA President Gianni Infantino was also a featured speaker at the event.

Like the city, the county is spending millions in tax dollars on next year's World Cup events. Miami-Dade County has agreed to spend up to $46 million in cash subsidies, donated police services and other expenses when the World Cup comes to town next year.

Cristiano Ronaldo received a straight red card during Portugal's World Cup qualifier against the Republic of Ireland - but will he miss the start of the group stage if they qualify for the 2026 World Cup?

Portugal were trailing 2-0 when Ronaldo clashed with Dara O'Shea, hitting his elbow into the defender's back.

Referee Glenn Nyberg spotted the incident and showed Ronaldo a yellow card, but upgraded it to a red after reviewing it.

The incident was Ronaldo's first red card for Portugal in his 226th appearance.

Portugal will be without their captain for Sunday's home match against Armenia, with a win needed to secure their spot at the tournament.

Send us your questions

Ronaldo exchanged words with Republic of Ireland boss Heimir Hallgrimsson and sarcastically applauded the crowd after the red card

Earlier this week, Ronaldo announced next year's World Cup would be his final major tournament, but now he is likely to miss the start of it.

The red card he received automatically carries a one-match suspension, ruling him out of Sunday's crucial qualifier against Armenia.

But violent conduct almost always carries an extended suspension and the extra games would only be served in competitive fixtures. 

If Portugal get the win they need against Armenia to qualify directly, their next competitive match would be their opening group game at the World Cup.

If the unlikely happens and Portugal do drop into the play-offs, the 40-year-old would sit out the semi-final and perhaps the final.

But how many games will Ronaldo get? That is in the hands of Fifa's disciplinary committee.

Technically, Fifa could opt not to extend Ronaldo's ban at all, meaning he would not be at risk of missing the start of the tournament.

However, Fifa disciplinary code states that a red card for ""assault, including elbowing, punching, kicking, biting, spitting or hitting an opponent"" should carry a three-match suspension. That would see Ronaldo miss Portugal's first two World Cup group games or both play-off matches.

But it's not quite as simple as that, as Fifa judges these matters on a case-by-case basis. 

For instance, at the 2023 Women's World Cup, England forward Lauren James was given two matches for stamping on the back of Nigeria's Michelle Alozie.

So, Ronaldo should be banned for three games, but he might only receive a two-match suspension.

There is no confirmed date for the decision, but after previous international windows the Fifa disciplinary committee met at the start of the following month. 

That would mean Ronaldo would learn his fate closer to the World Cup draw on 5 December.

GUATEMALA CITY – The Final Round of the Concacaf Qualifiers to the 2026 FIFA World Cup continued with Panama defeating Guatemala, 3-2, in Group A on Thursday at Estadio El Trébol in Guatemala City, Guatemala.

Cecilio Waterman opened the scoring in the 30' as Panama pulled ahead with a powerful right-footed hit. 

Waterman secured his brace in the 44' to extend the lead for Los Canaleros, finding the back of the net with a finish from the top of the box. 

Arquímides Ordóñez headed a ball from Pedro Altán from close range in the 69' to shorten the deficit for Guatemala.

Rudy Muñoz equalized for Los Chapines in the 69', slotting the ball at the bottom right corner, capitalizing on a through ball from Olger Escobar. 

José Fajardo struck in the 78' with a first-time right-footed finish from the center of the box to restore Panama's lead.

Panama remains in second place in the group with the win, separated from the direct qualification on goal difference. Los Canaleros will host El Salvador on Tuesday. 

Guatemala is eliminated from contention for the 2026 FIFA World Cup with the loss. Los Chapines will host Suriname to conclude its campaign.

The 2026 World Cup playoff draw will take place on Thursday, November 20, at 13:00 CET, and Italy will be in pot one.

Italy will certainly need to go through the World Cup playoff in March next year as only a victory by nine goals against Norway on Sunday would guarantee direct qualification for the tournament.

As reported by Corriere della Sera, 16 teams will participate in the playoff: the 12 runners-up in the European World Cup qualifying groups and the four best group winners of the 2024-25 Nations League, who have not yet earned direct qualification for the World Cup or have not finished as runners-up.

The draw will take place on Thursday, November 20, at 13:00 CET (12:00 GMT).

There will be a one-legged semifinal and a one-legged final. Italy will get their semifinal opponent from pot 4.

The semifinal will be played at the home of the best-placed team in the FIFA ranking, while the final's venue will be decided by a draw.

The top three pots in the draw are determined by the FIFA Ranking, which means Italy are at least guaranteed a spot among the four seeded teams and will play the semifinal at home. The fourth and final pot is formed by the Nations League teams.

Currently, with one game remaining, this is how the four pots look.

Pot 1
Italy (9)
Turkey (26)
Poland (33)
Hungary (37)

Pot 2
Scotland (38)
Czech Republic (44)
Slovakoia (46)
Albania (61)

Pot 3
North Macedonia (65)
Iceland (74)
Bosnia & Herzegovina (75)
Kosovo (84)

Pot 4
Wales
Romania
Sweden
Northern Ireland

Wales can still finish as runners-up in their group, which would push them to Pot 1 and Poland to Pot 4, making them a possible Italy opponent.

If the Azzurri qualify for the Final, they will find an opponent from Pot 2 or 3.




Lorenzo Bettoni is the Editor of Football Italia.

If Wales goes in 2nd that would push n Macedonia to pot 4 since they won their nation league group and would be next then Moldova and San Marino . But we would need Romania and n Ireland to make 2nd place as well .

Even with its current squad, Italy shouldn't be afraid of any of those opponents.

From a certain perspective, those games aren't any different from regular qualification games. Be it in playoffs or not, there are some important games you need to win in order to make it. But if you see those playoffs as “oooh nightmare, bad memories, so much pressure, nooooo”, you'll play with fear, and that will turn against you.

If Italy mess up any of those games, they don't deserve to go to the worldcup, period.

Remember the good old days when you wondered if Italy would win the World Cup now it's will they ever make it to the World Cup

Pot 4 looks, on paper, the have the most difficult teams. Sweden would be very tricky, not least because of what happened two world cups ago – the pressure on Italy will be astronomical whereas Sweden can play with calm.

Bryan Mbeumo cut a heartbroken figure after Cameroon's World Cup hopes collapsed in dramatic fashion, with the Manchester United star storming off alone after a stoppage-time defeat to DR Congo. The Indomitable Lions suffered a crushing 1-0 loss in the CAF play-offs, ending their bid to reach the 2026 tournament and leaving their talisman visibly emotional in the rain.

Cameroon's bid to qualify for the 2026 World Cup ended in brutal fashion as they fell to a late 1-0 defeat against DR Congo in the CAF knockout play-offs. Having finished second in their group behind first-time qualifiers Cape Verde, the Indomitable Lions entered the play-offs as favourites but struggled to create clear chances in a tense, cagey encounter. One minute into second-half stoppage time, Chancel Mbemba headed home from a corner, crushing Cameroon's hopes of reaching the expanded 48-team tournament across North America.

The late goal sparked despair among the Cameroonian players, many of whom fell to the turf in disbelief as DR Congo celebrated wildly. Manchester United winger Mbeumo, who had been one of Cameroon's key performers throughout the campaign, reacted with visible frustration as he walked straight off the field. A video shared on social media showed him leaving alone in the pouring rain, needing to be consoled as he headed toward the tunnel after one of the toughest nights of his international career.

The defeat marked the end of a turbulent qualification journey in which Cameroon won only five matches and struggled for consistency despite the presence of top talents such as Mbeumo, Andre Onana and Carlos Baleba. Their failure to top Group D, as they finished four points behind Cape Verde, forced them into the play-off path, where their hopes evaporated in the most agonising manner imaginable. It leaves a talented squad and manager Marc Brys facing intense scrutiny after missing out on a World Cup for only the fourth time since 1982.

Their elimination carries heavy symbolic weight, given their long-standing history as Africa's most frequent World Cup participants with eight qualifications. The disappointment is amplified by the fact that the 2026 tournament will feature 48 teams and additional African berths, making this one of the most accessible routes to a World Cup in modern history. Yet despite the expanded format, the Indomitable Lions were unable to navigate a qualification campaign that exposed their tactical flaws and organisational instability.

The responsibility for the failure will fall not just on the players but also on the chaotic backdrop surrounding the national team setup. Brys' appointment by the Ministry of Sports against the wishes of federation president Samuel Eto'o created internal tension from the outset, affecting preparation and harmony.

DR Congo's triumph sends them into the final stage of CAF qualifying, where they will face Nigeria in their own bid to secure a place in the 2026 World Cup in North America.

Cameroon must now regroup and confront the structural issues that contributed to their undoing in the qualifiers, starting with the uncertainty surrounding the head coach position. Brys' tenure has been defined by controversy, and his future will likely come under immediate review following the failure to reach the World Cup, as the Indomitable Lions look ahead to the Africa Cup of Nations next month.

For Mbeumo, the focus shifts back to club football with Manchester United, but the emotional toll of missing a World Cup cannot be understated. As one of the squad's leaders, he will be central to Cameroon's rebuilding efforts. He has scored seven goals in 26 international appearances and is widely regarded as Cameroon's attacking talisman, but he now faces the reality of missing out on the sport's biggest stage.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Vinicius Junior has urged Brazil to “switch into World Cup mode,” insisting the Selecao's opportunity has finally arrived under coach Carlo Ancelotti. The Real Madrid star claims the Italian has transformed Brazil's mentality, tactics and daily culture since taking charge by bringing calm, confidence and clarity to a team desperate to end a 24-year World Cup drought.

The bond between Ancelotti and Brazil has grown into one of the defining stories of the national team's new era. When he left Madrid in the summer, a year after delivering another Champions League title, few expected his next job to be with the Selecao. But for one of the most decorated managers in football history, the lure of leading Brazil was irresistible.

After six games - three wins and two draws - under the coach, the national team have qualified for the next World Cup and are aiming to end a long wait for the global crown, and Vinicius has given the clearest endorsement of the Italian.

Speaking to CBF's official media, ahead of Brazil's international friendlies against Senegal and Tunisia, he said they are finally becoming the team they need to be: “With Ancelotti, we're evolving and building a clear playing identity. Finding that balance before the World Cup will be crucial. We all have to get into the World Cup mindset and understand that our opportunity has arrived.”

Vinicius explained the transformation in detail pointing out to the renewed confidence the manager has instilled within the team.

“He's done the same thing everywhere he's gone—instilling confidence and getting the best out of every player in their ideal position. He always says his dream is to make the Brazilian people happy, to bring back the joyful football that defines us, and to win the World Cup.

“He gives us calm and confidence. He reminds us that we already have the passion and intensity to wear this shirt—and that's the hardest part. We just need to win so that his work gets the recognition it deserves.”

Ancelotti's selections have also reflected a shift toward merit rather than reputation. Fitness, form and tactical fit have dictated squad decisions, even if it meant temporarily leaving out heavyweights like Vinicius, Rodrygo or Neymar. At the same time, Ancelotti has expanded the talent pool, integrating emerging names such as Endrick and Vitor Roque while encouraging competition by insisting that “around 70 players” are capable of reaching the World Cup squad.

As Ancelotti builds a disciplined, modern Brazil, one monumental question hangs over the project: Will Neymar be part of that squad?

His return to Santos has been overshadowed by repeated thigh and knee injuries, including a rectus femoris issue, his fourth setback since returning. Though the player insists his omission from recent squads is “technical, not physical,” doubts remain.

Brazil's legendary striker Ronaldo, however, is adamant: “He's a key player. We don't have another Neymar. If he's fit, Brazil will be stronger, simple as that. People don't understand how hard it is to come back. It's a gradual process.”

Neymar continues to play full matches for Santos and has extended his contract until the end of 2025, with an option through the World Cup. Yet Ancelotti's Brazil has learned to function without him.

With Vinicius, Raphinha and Matheus Cunha leading the front line, the Selecao are balanced but sometimes lack moments of magic. Whether Neymar provides them again will decide his World Cup fate. And it will be Ancelotti's biggest selection decision yet.

If Brazil are to challenge for a sixth World Cup, the heart of that push will be the relationship between Vinicius and Ancelotti. Vinicius' evolution under Ancelotti is one of European football's success stories with two Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, Champions League Best Player 2023-24 and a Ballon d'Or favourite.

Ancelotti refined him from a raw winger into one of the world's most decisive attackers, improving his finishing, decision-making and leadership. That dynamic has now transferred seamlessly to Brazil. As the 2026 World Cup approaches, Brazil stand at a crossroads. For 24 years, they have chased a sixth star. Now, under a calm, experienced leader and with a superstar maturing into his prime, belief is returning. ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Former Chelsea star Oscar is reportedly considering retirement after being hospitalised with a heart issue. The 34-year-old is said to have fallen ill during a bicycle test at current side São Paulo and since then, he has been diagnosed with vasovagal syncope, where the blood pressure drops too low, causing people to faint. Now, reports suggest the Brazilian is weighing up whether or not to end his career.

After spending eight years playing in China, Oscar rejoined São Paulo on a deal until 2027 at the end of last year. Following that move, he said: ""I'm happy to be back in Brazil and to be able to play for São Paulo, which is the club where I started out, where I made my base and where I grew up. I thank you for the affection I have received on social media these past few days and I will do my best to achieve great things together.""

Fast forward to the present, and the veteran may have kicked his last ball for the club after this health scare on Tuesday. 

The Brazilian team said on Thursday: ""Midfielder Oscar remains hospitalized at Einstein Hospital Israelita, where he was admitted on Tuesday afternoon after presenting an intercurrence with cardiological changes during exams carried out at SuperCT. An extensive investigation carried out at the hospital confirmed the diagnosis of vasovagal syncope. Oscar remains clinically well and stable, hospitalized in a cardiology unit, and this Friday will undergo an electrophysiological study.""

Following the incident, Oscar - who started his career at São Paulo way back in 2008 - posted in an Instagram story: ""Everything will be alright, God willing."" 

While he is seemingly staying upbeat, Brazilian publication Globo states that Oscar - who moved to Shanghai in 2017 in a £60 million ($79m) move that reportedly pocketed him around £400,000 a week - is mulling over whether or not to retire from football. They add that it may be more likely he hangs up his boots, rather than continuing.

The report states: ""According to a specialist heard by Globo, the problem is not life-threatening and can be solved with medication or simple surgical intervention, where a ganglion is cauterized to avoid getting out of control. Also, according to the expert, Oscar may be able to return to football if everything goes well and he feels comfortable to do so. For now, Oscar still has no discharge forecast. At the age of 34, he evaluates with his family whether he will announce his retirement or continue in football. The biggest tendency is for him to leave professional football.""

According to the NHS, vasovagal syncope is common, can affect anyone, and is often a temporary problem affecting the body's control system (autonomic nervous system). It is a common cause of fainting that occurs due to a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, leading to reduced blood flow to the brain. Certain triggers affect the nerve messages, and as a result of this issue, you can feel weak, sick, sweaty, and light-headed - and that can lead to losing consciousness. If you have this problem, people are encouraged to drink plenty of fluids, not to stand still for long periods, and to avoid overly warm environments. If you get warning symptoms, sufferers should lie down and squeezing firmly on a ball may be helpful. 

Football fans will be eagerly awaiting to hear from Oscar, who played 203 times for Chelsea and scored 38 goals between 2012-17 before joining Shanghai Port, again and whether or not he will continue his playing career. After making more than 500 appearances in club football, playing 48 times for Brazil, and winning trophies in England, China, and his home country, he may decide that for the good of his health, it is time to move on to something different. However, the Brazilian may still have another chapter to write in his footballing journey.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Carlo Ancelotti believes that England will be ""dangerous"" at next year's World Cup, while singing the praises of former charge Jude Bellingham. The Italian got to work with the ex-Borussia Dortmund star for two seasons at Real Madrid and has seen his quality at first hand. Not only did he talk up the 22-year-old's strengths, he also lauded his humanity.

The former Chelsea and AC Milan boss was in charge at Madrid when Bellingham was signed from Dortmund for £88 million ($115m) in 2023, and in their first season together, they won a Champions League and La Liga double. Things didn't work out quite as well last season, however, as bitter rivals Barcelona pipped Los Blancos to the league and Copa del Rey. Following news of Ancelotti's Santiago Bernabeu exit earlier this year, the England international waxed lyrical about the Italian. 

He wrote on Instagram: ""Mister, thank you for everything. It was a pleasure and a great experience to learn from the most successful manager of our club and one of the greatest of all time. What you have taught me about life and football will stick with me always, and I will be forever grateful. Good luck on your next journey, I wish you, your staff, and your family nothing but happiness!""

And earlier this week, Ancelotti was equally as complimentary about the ex-Birmingham City starlet.

The former Everton manager said on the Rest is Football podcast that Bellingham was a top player and even likened him to Brazilian great Kaka. He also dismissed any notion that the attacking midfielder has attitude problems, a topic that has come to the fore after he was not selected for Thomas Tuchel's October England squads. 

Ancelotti said this week, ""I think Jude is a fantastic player. If I have to compare, we were talking about Kaka. He is this kind of player, a really intelligent player, who is physically really strong, fantastic to arrive in the box at the right time. He's doing really well, and maybe he had a problem with his shoulder. He was out for two or three months, now he's back. No question mark. But why do you have to put a question mark on Bellingham?""

He added, ""No, I never had a problem with Jude about his attitude. He is really professional, really serious, works hard in training, like all English players do. And no, no complaints.""

And on Friday, when asked if Bellingham was one of the best midfielders in the world, Ancelotti replied, ""What do you expect me to say? Yes or no? Of course. One of the best. I had a good relationship with him. He helped me to win one Champions League in 2024. So for me, I am a little bit involved in the judgement of Jude Bellingham, but he is a good guy and a great player.""

Following England's 2-0 World Cup qualifying win over Serbia, in a game where Bellingham was a second-half substitute, Ancelotti stated that the Three Lions could go deep at next year's tournament in North America.

""England will be dangerous for sure,” he said. “They have fantastic quality, a fantastic manager. I saw them play last night against Serbia. They are a team with a lot of quality and of course. Maybe they will say they will not compete but I am sure they will compete and try to win the World Cup.""

While Bellingham is back fit and is making an impression at Madrid once more, scoring three goals and adding an assist in 11 games for the Spanish giants, he is being kept out of the England team by Aston Villa star Morgan Rogers. While competition for places will be fierce, Tuchel says Bellingham and Rogers are on good terms.

""It is normal, but he's one of the best mates of Jude, so I don't think he feels that kind of pressure. They compete at the moment for the same position, and they're still friends,"" he said. ""They are very respectful with each other and like each other. Morgan deserved to stay on the pitch because he had three fantastic performances with him and second of all we didn't know what was coming if our plan was right with the high press. It would be unfair for Jude to try to figure everything out because we changed our way of pressing in the last two camps. Declan [Rice], Morgan, and Harry [Kane] did it already in three to four matches together. I figured they could adapt a bit quicker. Once we see the formation, we can give clear instructions to Phil [Foden] and Jude and bring them from the bench.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Carlos Alcaraz enjoyed one of those season-capping, career-defining nights on Thursday at the Nitto ATP Finals. His win over Lorenzo Musetti in Turin secured him ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours for the second time, having also claimed the trophy in 2022.

The achievement comes at the end of a year in which the Spaniard has been a consistent threat on Tour, claiming a Tour-best eight titles, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Consistency has been a focal point of everything he has tried to improve since January.

“We really are having a magnificent season,” said Alcaraz. “Consistency is something that has always been tough for me, and it's something I've worked on as hard as possible. For example, in previous years, consistency in matches or tournaments has always let me down. We've tried to improve, and I think we've done it.

“In every tournament I've either reached the final, won the title or had a good result. So that's what I'll take away from it, that I've improved in terms of consistency and, obviously, compared to the start of the year, which wasn't the best, we managed to turn it around and I'd say that it is, without a doubt, the best season I've had so far, and there are still two tournaments to play.”

Alcaraz's body language after sealing the victory was that of a man who understood what he had just accomplished, but it also reflected the fact that there is no room for extravagant celebrations at a tournament where the margin for error is so small. In fact, Alcaraz himself explained that he was barely able to enjoy the moment with his team before embarking on his recovery routine.

“Obviously, I was with my team in the locker room, with people who are close to me and were able to come here. But I wasn't able to celebrate much because I have a semi-final on Saturday,” said Alcaraz, who topped Jimmy Connors Group with a perfect 3-0 record. “I tried to do everything in my power to try and recover and to be ready for tomorrow so I can practise well and take to the court on Saturday in the best shape possible.”

The context of the clash with Musetti was also out of the ordinary. The crowd were rapturous in their support of the Italian, as one might expect for a home player, but it is an unusual situation for Alcaraz, who enjoys a certain amount of affection wherever he wields his racquet. However, the Spaniard took it all in his stride.

“Ultimately, with players like Lorenzo [Musetti] and Jannik [Sinner] playing in Italy, playing this tournament... of course they will get the support, it's normal,” said Alcaraz. “We tried to stay focused and not let it affect us and to play good tennis. I think I managed to steer clear of all of that and to play at a good level.”



Alcaraz's latest scalp means he has reached 70 wins in a calendar year for the first time, a mark that is only within reach of those who are capable of winning even when they are not at their best. It is a trait that defines the greats of the game.

“Well, most of the time, not winning maybe, but competing, which is I think is the important thing in the end,” said the six-time Grand Slam champion. “Ultimately, win or lose... there are also a lot of factors, but whether or not I'm feeling good, I know I'll be able to compete and give myself the chance to win.

“I think that's what we've really improved. Obviously, we always try to find solutions in matches, but it is true that most of the time I know they will have to play at a great level, even when I'm not feeling good, if they want to beat me.”

Turin now has its Year-End No. 1, it does not yet have a champion, but Alcaraz is in the semi-finals and in the final stretch of his most mature season to date.

Jannik Sinner may not have delivered his sharpest performance on Friday at the Nitto ATP Finals, but the defending champion still produced a straight-sets victory to complete a perfect round-robin in Turin.

The No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings overcame an up-and-down showing to defeat Ben Shelton 6-3, 7-6(3), ending the American's season in the process. Although Sinner struggled to find his rhythm on serve, he absorbed Shelton's spirited challenge — despite the debutant already being eliminated — to preserve his spotless record this week and extend his indoor winning streak to 29 matches.

“When you come here and win all three round-robin matches, you have to play at a very high level, which I've done,” Sinner said. “Serving very well in important moments has brought me to this point. It was a very special day playing in front of the home crowd, and against Ben it's always a tough challenge.

“When he comes up with a huge serve, you cannot do a lot, so you have to accept it. My mental aspect [has been] great until now, so let's see what's coming.”

Sinner had already secured the top spot in the Bjorn Borg Group, and with Carlos Alcaraz advancing, a potential championship-match showdown between the two rivals now looms if both win their respective semi-finals. Sinner will face Alex de Minaur, while Alcaraz — who topped the Jimmy Connors Group — awaits the winner of Friday evening's winner-takes-all clash between Alexander Zverev and Felix Auger-Aliassime.

“I'm very happy for him,” Sinner said of De Minaur, who fell to a crushing three-set defeat to Lorenzo Musetti on Tuesday night. “When you have these kinds of losses, it's tough. So props to him to come back with an incredible performance against Taylor [Fritz]. I have to be very careful, because he doesn't have a lot to lose… I have a lot to lose.”

In their fourth meeting of 2025, Shelton rebounded from a nervous start with a promising second-set surge, powered by his explosive serve. The 23-year-old dropped just two of 18 service points through the first nine games of the set, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

But, after saving a match point on serve at 4-5, Shelton was then overpowered in the tie-break as Sinner seized control with a series of clean approaches to seal his eighth consecutive Lexus ATP Head2Head win against the American (8-1). The 24-year-old Italian, last year's champion in Turin, has now won eight consecutive matches at the season finale without dropping a set.

Carlos Alcaraz accepted his ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF trophy on Friday afternoon at the Nitto ATP Finals.

The Spaniard clinched the honour on Thursday evening when he defeated Lorenzo Musetti to move to 3-0 in round-robin play at the season finale. It is the second time he has achieved the feat (also 2022).

“It is a pleasure for me [being] the No. 1,” Alcaraz said. “Being the No. 1 of the world is something that I'm working really hard for with my team every day. It is a goal. But I think it is a journey that you're not going through alone. It's with your whole team, with your family, with your close people behind you always supporting you in the tough and good moments, which I'm really, really proud about: having such a great team.”

Alcaraz pointed out that when he first earned Year-End No. 1 honours in 2022, he had the same team. They have stuck together and continued to reap the rewards.

“I'm still really proud about the team I have right now,” Alcaraz said. “Some new members in the team that I'm really happy and proud to share this moment with them as well.  For me it's a great achievement. It means the world to me and I'm just really proud and happy.”

ATP Chairman Andrea Gaudenzi and Head of Corporate Brand and Strategic Advisory at PIF Mohamed Alsayyad presented Alcaraz the trophy.

The 22-year-old is chasing his first Nitto ATP Finals title. The Spaniard has booked his semi-final spot and will take on two-time champion Alexander Zverev or Felix Auger-Aliassime on Saturday.

But before returning his focus to the task at hand in Turin, Alcaraz thanked fans around the world.

“I want to continue because the support that I'm receiving everywhere that I'm going, I can't thank enough the people,” Alcaraz said. “We're traveling since the 1st of January until the end of November — new places, new countries, new stages and the people are always the same. The great energy, the great atmosphere, I feel the love everywhere that I'm going. 

“In some tournaments, in some matches without the support of the people it wouldn't be possible to come back, to win, to lift trophies. So I really want to say thank you for all the people who are coming to every tournament, to every match, that are supporting tennis, supporting myself. I'm really grateful for everyone for the energy and the love that I am receiving. This trophy is obviously for them.”

ATP Chairman Andrea Gaudenzi spoke to the media at the Nitto ATP Finals on a wide range of topics.

This Q&A has been excerpted from the press conference, and has been edited for brevity and readability. 

Nitto ATP Finals

Q. This is the fifth year of the Nitto ATP Finals in Turin. What has been your impression of the event so far?
Overall, it's an amazing edition. We started with COVID, which wasn't easy, but every single year the event has improved. Kudos to the FITP, they've done an incredible job. I think we were all a bit anxious post London, because London was a great event. I think we've delivered, and we are above the expectation we had initially.

This one is particularly exciting because we have the No. 1 at stake. It's super exciting to have the best players in the world fighting for the No. 1 at the end of the year. This is probably the best possible outcome. It's great for the fans. 

Q. Will the Nitto ATP Finals stay in Turin until 2030?
There hasn't been a decision yet. We're super happy here. That's obviously a consideration we need to take into account. We've agreed to sit down with the FITP and have a conversation early next year.

Calendar


Q. There's been a lot of debate about the content of the ATP season with the topic now returning to lower-ranked tournaments like the Challengers and ATP 250s. How do you see the future of the ATP 250 series, especially now we've decided to remove the week of Metz and Athens?

Tennis is a very difficult sport to schedule, probably the hardest, for a simple reason: it is direct elimination. 

For example, in a Grand Slam or a 12-day event, a player can play one match, or they can play seven matches over 12 days. Look at golf, for example, the top 60 play the 72 holes over four days. 

You have Carlos and Jannik playing, I would say, around 80 matches within 18, 20 tournaments. The lower-ranked players play a lower number of matches within 30, 35 tournaments. 

In reality, you have four, five calendars within one calendar. Half of the players lose first round, and 75% are done by the second round. For most players, it is a two- or four-day event. For others, it's a longer event. This highlights the complexity of the calendar. 

Obviously, there is a cohort of players saying it is too much. For others, if you remove events, it becomes too few because they need to play. If you lose, you have to go to another tournament and play more matches. That's why we have the different tiers and categories: Grand Slams, Masters, 500s and 250s. 

We try to balance it for all cohorts of players, including challengers, because these events are also very important for the pathway and to build the champions of the future. 

In the last few years, we've had a strategy of reducing the number of 250s. We are down from 38 to, I think it's 29. The target to optimize the calendar for '28, when the new Saudi Masters will come on board, is to continue to reduce the number of 250s. 

250s are very important. Every category is important. But we had too many of them. It was really difficult to schedule within the calendar. 

We have two problems. The year has 52 weeks and we're not going to change that. The other thing is that players need a proper off-season. At the moment the off-season is a bit too short. 

You need to be able to rest, take a holiday, rebuild your body, restart practicing tennis, then you move into the Australian season. 

On top of that we add in the complexity of having seven entities participating in this effort. The four Grand Slams are individual. They have their own dates. Then you have the ITF with the Davis Cup format that has been changing quite a bit in the last few years. You obviously have the ATP and WTA. 

If you think of the overall picture, I have sympathy from a player standpoint. You're dealing with seven entities managing a calendar, seven boards making decisions. So, it's difficult to have a streamlined effort, which is at the core of the OneVision plan, where you try to unify the governance and try to come up with an ideal, or next-best option of an ideal calendar. 

Overall, our strategy has been clear to focus on the premium product, the Masters. The reason for that is simple: we need to provide the best possible experience to the fans. The fans love to watch the best players in the world playing against each other in the best events. The four Grand Slams, the Masters and the Finals are the moments where we get to see this. 

Then you have the 500s and 250s where those who play less matches in the Grand Slam and the Masters need to play to keep their level up and improve. 

It's complicated. I have sympathy. For example, Carlos and Jannik have been reaching the final of every Slam, playing very well at the Masters. For those players at the very top, it's probably very difficult to play a full calendar. 

Another problem we have is that we have an open system where players are independent contractors. We have rules and incentives, we try to influence their behaviour, but ultimately a player chooses where to play. They can prioritize a 250 over a 500, a 500 over a Masters. Players often play in lower categories, and in team events and exhibitions outside of our system. 

It's a complex problem to solve. I don't think there is one solution that fits all. I believe strongly that if everyone was around the same table - Grand Slams, ATP, WTA, ITF - in one room, with one board, one governance, we would do a much better job than we are doing today. 

Q. How would you have felt, if when you were a player, the number of 250s was being reduced, making it harder for you to advance to the 500s or 1000s?
You can't increase the 250s and expand the Masters at the same time.

In my career, I was never one of those guys who went deep into the second week of the Grand Slams and Masters.  

Firstly, I was really frustrated by the fact that, even when I was ranked 50, 55, I could only play the main draw of two Masters, Indian Wells and Miami. You end up being 50 in the world and you couldn't access the premium tier. I thought, why can I play in a Grand Slam main draw and not a Masters main draw? If we have this, we want all the top players playing. 

Hence why I think it's very important to move to a 96 draw. You provide Top 100 players with the possibility of playing main draw in Grand Slams and Masters on at least seven occasions out of nine. The exceptions are Paris, Monte-Carlo, and Saudi will be the same.  

In terms of the 250s, I made a lot of mistakes in my career. I often played 250s on clay in Europe the week before the US Open. They were scheduled there, there were swings almost everywhere, tournaments all over. 

I learned, improved my behaviour, and realised I was responsible for my own calendar. It was as a little bit of self-discipline. I saw other players who played a smart calendar, who weren't really attracted by the opportunity for guarantees. 

I don't think players should schedule with guaranteed money as a priority. Players should be playing for ranking points and titles, especially those in the Top 50, Top 100. 

The number of 250s is not going to be a problem because our plan is to have exclusive, dedicated category weeks. 10 weeks of 250s, eight weeks of 500s, that's 18, then the 10 Masters, that's 28, then the four slams, 32. This is the goal. 

This really serves all the Top 100. If you're at the top, you probably just play Slams and Masters, and a few 500s. If you're lower in ranking, you play more 500s and 250s. If you are lower in ranking, you play 250s and Challengers. It's a pyramid. The lower your ranking, the lower you play. 

If you're high in the rankings, in my opinion, you shouldn't be playing down. If you're Sinner or Alcaraz, you have no need to play the 250s for money, because it doesn't fit within your ranking, and it's not your level. When you're winning Slams and Masters, you should be playing up. 

In Formula 1, for example, a driver is not allowed to race in a lower category. They try to protect their talent. But they have a different system. 

Q. Players continue to complain about the Masters 1000s with the extended number of days. Jack Draper called all the Top 20 players, and I don't think there was a very positive response to these extended events.
On the 12 days' expansion, I haven't really invented anything. Indian Wells and Miami were there for 35 years. I came in, I looked at the numbers, and I could see these tournaments were really outperforming the others.

Why are the Slams so successful? Two reasons: incredible infrastructure, and history, the brand. They have big stadiums, and they technically have three weeks, 15 days of main draw plus quallies. 

As a sport, we are low in media and very heavy on ticketing for many reasons, one being fragmentation. Ticketing revenue is above 50%, 60%. Compared to other sports, media is probably 60%, 70% of their revenue breakdown. 

2025 was year three of the OneVision plan, but in year one of the expanded Masters, you can already see the results. If you look at the top-line revenue, which I cannot disclose, it's going up very high. It's changing a lot. 

Thanks to the profit-sharing formula the players now have, we paid out almost $20 million in 2024, up from $6 million in 2023. That represents 25% on top of prize money, which was also increased. 

This means the total profit of the Masters is close to 110 million, 109 million. The way the profit-sharing formula works – you take the profits, deduct the base prize money, and share the excess. 

Simplified, this is working from a financial standpoint and providing a lot of value to all players, because that money goes to the whole ecosystem, including the players ranked 100, 150. 

I always knew that the 12-day format would probably not be well received by the top players, because they are the ones who need to arrive a few days early. I have a lot of sympathy for the fact that they are the ones who also stay late. They are really the ones affected by the 12 days. All other players, they lose early. Even in the quarterfinals, there's not much of a change. 

I think we need to be a few more years into the plan or we need to shift more compensation to the top players to reward them for the value they're driving. It also becomes a debate around compensation per day. It's simple mathematics. The players probably look and say, I could be making ‘X' in an exhibition for one day. If I go there, I make ‘X' divided by 12 days. That's the issue at the moment. 

Again, I want to be very clear. I don't believe a perfect product exists. All I believe is we've started with an assumption, we need to give it a few years to see if it works, then we can review and decide whether to go backwards or continue. 

We also need to look at all aspects, because the 12-day format was achieved as part of a deal which included tournaments agreeing to open their economics to the players. Just to be clear, for 35 years the players had no access to the economics of the tournaments. They had no clue how much money we were making. 

It's like saying you and I have a 50-50 partnership. You make $100. You ask me how much I make. I tell you, sorry. Now the books are open. Players have full benefit. They are now equity partners. So that was a compromise. 

The other compromise was the aggregation of media. There are a lot of things that we've done that will benefit the entire ecosystem over time. All I'm asking is be a little bit patient because I think it will deliver value. The second ask, try to manage your schedule slightly differently in the other tournaments that you play. 

Yes, we've added in the Masters 1000 category, but if you take away from exhibitions or lower category tournaments that you play, I think you're going to be fine because it is a matter of the balance between the two. 

Q. Do you have an ideal number, in your mind, of weeks you think the off-season should be in tennis?
I don't know if there's an exact number. Some players would say six, some say seven, some say eight. Surely a player needs one or two weeks off, then one or two weeks to start building their body, then they pick up the racquet again. I think it definitely needs to be longer than what it is today.

Then the question is, for who? I played the Davis Cup Final once in my career. That was the only time where I had to wait for that. Otherwise, players like me would be done after Paris. 

Obviously the top eight finish later. Now the Davis Cup format means players who lost in Paris have to wait until after the Finals for that event. 

I love the Davis Cup. I probably had the best matches of my career there. I think it's an incredible asset. We should all come together to try to make it the World Cup for tennis. 

I think the best product is the home and away. The Final I played in Milan is probably the best memory of my career. You go to cities where we don't take tennis with the Tour. I played quarterfinals against the U.S., Agassi-Sampras, in Palermo. Regardless of which players you have, you're going to have a full stadium cheering for your country. That atmosphere for me is the core of our product. 

The problem at the time was playing it every year and on different surfaces. One year we played the Davis Cup against the Czech Republic in Naples. We won. On Tuesday I had to play on hard court in Dubai. It's challenging. 

In the ideal world I think Davis Cup could go home and away over two years. There is no World Cup in sport that happens every year, to my knowledge. I think it would be better for the product and would also release a lot of pressure from the calendar. 

Last but not least, there is the difference between finishing the season in Paris and the Finals. That is where I think the beginning of the season comes into play. I don't know the stat top of mind, but I believe Novak won the Australian Open seven times without playing anything prior to that. Jannik won the Australian Open without playing anything. For those guys, winning at that level, you have the flexibility to do that. You don't have to play week one and two. 

If there is no Masters, that's where you create your own flexibility. If you go too deep and play more matches than others, that's when you have to say, stop. That's why we're going to look at '28 in trying to keep that in mind. 

I do believe players need at least seven weeks off, I would say, in the off-season. 

Governance

Q. What are the latest movements of the top players with the Grand Slams? How does it affect their relationship between the ATP and the wider ecosystem?
I'll go back to One Vision, the plan I laid out in 2020 when I started.

There are obviously flaws in our system because of the legacy of having four independent Slams, the ATP, the WTA, and the ITF. 

The Slams, and I want to make this very clear, are the best tournaments in our sport. They are incredible assets. The Slams are probably the best way to showcase our sport. I thank them immensely for what they have done and what they're doing. As a player, you grow up dreaming of being in a Slam. Probably the main two goals are becoming No. 1 and winning a Slam. 

In the ATP, 50% of the governance is players. Every decision we make, we need the approval of the player board representative that gets elected by the players council, which is 10 players representing the wider group. So, it is a very democratic environment. 

Obviously, you have four independent entities. Maybe that's to a certain extent an advantage because you just do things and you don't have to ask everyone permission. 

On the other hand, if you look from a player perspective, players have no representation. We have a formula which is very transparent to the players. They deliver value, they gain more value. All they're asking for generally is fair representation and fair compensation, whatever that is. Maybe the level is already right, but they just don't know and they don't feel they're heard. I think that's a fair ask. 

That is the goal of OneVision. To get everyone in one room, players, men and women, equally represented, then the Grand Slams, Masters, 500s and 250s. Everybody needs to be at the same table because we are talking to the same people. I've said many times; it's like writing a book and the chapters are written by different writers and sold in different bookstores. It's not optimal.

F1 fitness myths busted with Alex Albon

The Cooldown Room: F2's Luke Browning takes on a charades challenge

Ahead of the final three rounds of the 2025 season, F1.com looks at the permutations for the Drivers' Championship fight between Lando Norris, Oscar Piastri and Max Verstappen.

After retaking the lead of the Drivers' Championship with his commanding victory in Mexico, Lando Norris bolstered his position at the top of the leaderboard thanks to a hugely successful Sao Paulo Grand Prix weekend, in which he triumphed in the Sprint as well as Sunday's race.

Norris' tally now stands at 390, giving him an advantage of 24 points over McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri – who he has also matched in terms of victories in 2025, both having claimed seven Grand Prix wins apiece – while Red Bull's Max Verstappen is 49 points adrift in third.

All three drivers remain mathematically in contention for the crown – but when is the earliest that leader Norris could potentially win a maiden World Championship? We have listed the key numbers and scenarios below…

The maximum points score available across the remaining three race weekends is 83 points, a total that a driver would achieve by taking victory at every Grand Prix as well as the final Sprint of the season in Qatar.

Drivers' standings after Sao Paulo

In a word – no. If Norris were to win the Las Vegas Grand Prix and Piastri did not score, the gap would stand at 49 points, meaning that this would not be enough to give Norris the title (given that 58 points will still be available after Vegas).

With this scenario, the best finish for Verstappen in Vegas would be second place, an outcome that would boost his points to 359 – but this would still leave him seven points behind Piastri.

That would be the Qatar Sprint. If the above situation played out, Norris would need to outscore Piastri by only two points in the 100-kilometre dash to guarantee the title. This would require the Briton to cross the line in at least seventh place.

Even if Verstappen won the Sprint in this scenario, his new points total of 367 points would put him 50 points adrift of Norris.

As such, if Norris failed to finish the final two Grands Prix and Verstappen won both, they would end the season equal on points – but Norris' win tally of eight in comparison to Verstappen's seven would result in the former taking the championship.

If Verstappen were to win in Las Vegas – with Norris second and Piastri not scoring – this would give Norris a 42-point gap over both of his championship rivals.

Even if the British driver then went on to claim victory in the Qatar Sprint with both Piastri and Verstappen failing to score, his subsequent 50-point advantage would not be enough for him to take the Drivers' Championship on the day.

This is because this scenario would put Norris' wins tally at seven, Piastri's at seven and Verstappen's at six, meaning that if Norris did not take any points in the Qatar or Abu Dhabi Grands Prix and either Piastri or Verstappen won those races, whoever was victorious in those final two events would become World Champion.

Additionally, in a scenario where Norris finishes third or lower in Las Vegas, Piastri does not score and Verstappen crosses the line in any position, Norris would still not be able to clinch the title in the Qatar Sprint as the maximum points gap before the Saturday race would be 39 points, which could potentially rise to 47 afterwards if Piastri or Verstappen did not score and Norris won, meaning that the championship fight would roll over to the Qatar Grand Prix, either way.

In short, there is no mathematical way Norris can win the title in Las Vegas. As things stand, the earliest he could wrap it up would be in the Qatar Sprint.

F1 fitness myths busted with Alex Albon

The Cooldown Room: F2's Luke Browning takes on a charades challenge

How the 2025 season in F1 ACADEMY unfolded with just days to go until the season finale in Las Vegas.

The F1 Drivers' Championship isn't the only title still on the line, as the fight to be crowned the 2025 F1 ACADEMY Champion is set to go right down to the wire in a showstopping Las Vegas season finale.

Mercedes' Doriane Pin and Ferrari's Maya Weug are separated by only nine points, leaving the title contenders to face a final race shootout that could go either way.

With just under a week to go, we take a look back at how the fight for the title has unfolded from the season opener in Shanghai to the most recent battles on the streets of Singapore.

After claiming the final win of the 2024 campaign, Weug showed why she was one of the favourites for the new season, claiming pole position, nearly half a second clear of Pin.

Lining up eighth for the reverse grid Race 1, both made gains but only Weug walked away with a podium in P3. Red Bull Racing's Alisha Palmowski would lead home a Campos Racing 1-2 ahead of Chambers after inheriting the lead from fellow rookie Nina Gademan, who retired on the penultimate lap with a technical issue.

Pin was the braver of the duo in Race 2 as an overly cautious approach from Weug on the rolling start backfired. After getting past on the opening lap, the French racer held firm despite a Safety Car restart to leave China with a five-point lead over Weug, with Chambers finishing third on track and in the Drivers' standings.

The standings order reversed in Qualifying around the Jeddah Corniche Circuit, with Chambers taking pole by over two-tenths to Pin and Weug was almost a further three-tenths off in third.

Race 1 saw Ella Lloyd emerged triumphant in a drag race to the line with Weug, who once again came through the pack and overtook Palmowski on the penultimate lap for P2. The Ferrari driver got the better of front-row starter Pin off the line, before going wheel-to-wheel with Chambers. Their back-and-forth battle for the lead ended after Chambers was handed a five-second penalty for forcing Weug off the track.

Despite the Red Bull Ford driver's best efforts to extend the gap out front, she was relegated to third at the chequered flag behind Pin, leaving Weug to claim the win and a seven-point advantage in the standings.

A downpour turned Qualifying into a one-lap sprint from the pit lane and it was Chambers who capitalised, taking pole ahead of teammate Palmowski and Pin – with less than seven-hundredths separating the top four. Stuck in traffic on her only lap, Weug found herself languishing in P10.

Unable to achieve a podium in the previous reverse grid races, Pin made up for it in Race 1. A strong opening lap put her on the rear of polesitter Emma Felbermayr and she eventually got the move done to lead Palmowski and Chambers to the chequered flag, with Weug missing out on a podium in fourth.

Sunday proved to be a washout for F1 ACADEMY as Race 2 was postponed due to inclement weather, leaving Weug clinging on to the top of the standings by a point.

The title fight took a dramatic turn on the series' debut in Canada. A dominant display in Qualifying saw Chambers seal her third consecutive pole ahead of Palmowski and Pin. However, Weug's weekend went on a swift downturn after an electrical issue in practice remained unresolved, leaving the dejected Dutch racer down in P15.

After Qualifying first in Miami, Chambers lined up on pole for the first of three races at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve. But it was Pin with the best seat in the house as she watched Chambers and Palmowski collide on Lap 2, leaving the door open for her to take home the win, whilst rival Weug retired early. Lloyd finished in P2 ahead Gademan, with the Alpine driver elevated to her first podium after Felbermayr was disqualified for being below the minimum weight.

Felbermayr bounced back that afternoon in Race 2, seizing her first victory in an epic last lap three-way fight, overtaking Gademan with a handful of corners to spare. Lloyd gave Rodin Motorsport their first 1-2 finish in F1 ACADEMY in second ahead of Gademan. Pin claimed fourth and Weug was left empty-handed in ninth.

Chambers led from lights-to-flag to take her first win of the year in Race 3, promoting her to become Pin's nearest title rival in second. Pin narrowly avoided damage on the opening lap after driving straight into the path of a spinning Palmowski, following contact between the Red Bull Racing driver and fellow Briton Lloyd, and receiving a knock to her front wing.

Surviving the early drama, Lloyd scored her third consecutive P2 finish ahead of Pin. A third Safety Car appearance to end the weekend denied Weug a chance to climb any higher than P6. This left Pin as the new standings leader by 20 points to Chambers, demoting Weug to third, 37 points adrift.

Knowing she had to be perfect from here on out if she hoped to keep her title hopes alive, Weug's home event heralded a welcome change in her fortunes. A tight battle for pole saw her out-qualify Palmowski by 0.039s, with rivals Chambers and Pin forced to settle for fourth and fifth.

The ‘Orange Army' were already celebrating on Saturday as home hero Gademan delivered an emotional maiden win in Race 1 — having been cleared to race after being declared unfit to drive in Free Practice 2 the previous day.

Williams' Lia Block stood on the podium for the first time in F1 ACADEMY in second, keeping out of the clutches of a charging Weug. A scrappy race for Pin saw her finish behind Lloyd and Chambers in sixth, her lowest result of the season so far.

For Chambers, Race 2 was over before it began as the Red Bull Ford driver was forced to retire on the formation lap due to a technical problem.

Out front, Weug was untouchable, with her 7.3s winning margin the second-largest in the series' history. Palmowski and Pin completed the podium, each being promoted up one place after Lloyd was handed a five-second penalty for a false start.

Pin maintained her 20-point lead heading into the penultimate round, with Weug's silverware-laden weekend allowing her to regain the P2 spot from Chambers.

There was a nervous wait for Weug at the end of Qualifying in Singapore as Pin reached the chequered flag in time for one final lap. But the Mercedes junior's efforts were only good enough for second, leaving her rival to take pole by 0.042s.

Block's long-awaited first win finally arrived, as the American held her nerve from reverse grid pole in Race 1 to become the eighth different winner in 2025. An overtaking masterclass around the Marina Bay Street Circuit saw Weug go from eighth to second ahead of Chambers, whilst Pin struggled to make the same inroads in P5.

However, Pin got the better of Weug off the line in Race 2 and looked to be on course for the win. But with six laps remaining, the threat of rain materialised. Both PREMA Racing and MP Motorsport debated pitting their drivers, but both gambled on staying out on slicks.

Holding track position, Pin controlled the restart but Weug had nothing to lose. Gambling on an audacious move on the final lap, the Ferrari junior wrestled the victory away from her disappointed rival. Lloyd's third-place finish moved her up to third in the standings ahead of Chambers, who pitted from fourth and fell out of the title race in 11th.

Left with a nine-point gap between them and tied on three wins apiece, Pin and Weug will have to put together the drives of their lives if they hope to overcome the other and become the third F1 ACADEMY Champion.

F1 fitness myths busted with Alex Albon

The Cooldown Room: F2's Luke Browning takes on a charades challenge

It's nearly time for Audi to take their bow in F1, as Lawrence Barretto reports from Munich.

We've known Audi were heading for Formula 1 in 2026 for around three years. But it wasn't until Wednesday, when they hosted a dazzling launch event in Munich to unveil the colours and design that will adorn their first F1 car, that it felt like the German manufacturer had really arrived.

Audi have enjoyed immense success across various motorsport categories, from endurance racing and the famous Le Mans 24 Hours to rallying and touring cars.

That success was on show at this event, with the likes of CEO Gernot Dollner, Head of Audi F1 project Mattia Binotto and Team Principal Jonathan Wheatley, plus their drivers Nico Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto and F1 President and CEO Stefano Domenicali arriving in a selection of vintage machinery that has won Audi so much silverware over the years.

""This feels like a very significant moment on our journey,"" says Wheatley when we speak on the red carpet at the event. ""To see all the cars – it's like Audi have opened up the toy box and got all of the cars out here tonight. I had a spin in a Quattro Sport, which is one of my favourite cars, round to the event just now. It all feels real, it feels like it's happening.""

Audi are proud of what they've achieved in motor racing so far. They've dipped their toe in, invested heavily in technology and design and then ultimately won. Taking on the challenge of Formula 1 is the natural next step. And while reaching the top step won't be the work of the moment – they intend to find a way to get there before the end of the decade.

""We have got our plans, we know our competitors are strong, but we are here to try to do well,"" Binotto tells me. ""We are aiming to win a championship by 2030. That's our ambition, our goal, our objective.""

That's five years for Audi to turn a Sauber squad who are fighting in the thick of the midfield and have only previously won one race in their various iterations, but have made progress this year under the leadership of Binotto and Wheatley into an operation that can fight the likes of McLaren, Red Bull, Mercedes and Ferrari for race wins – and the championship.

That target shows that the board understand and respect the challenge F1 presents but also shows Audi's big ambitions, as five years isn't very long in F1.

They are ploughing huge amounts of resource into their power unit base in Neuberg, Germany, where the first Audi power unit is coming to life. They are looking to develop Hinwil, which has been Sauber's home since they entered F1 in 1993 and from next year will be responsible for churning out the first Audi F1 car. And they will ultimately want a return on that investment.

For next year, though, they are being pragmatic. No one knows what the pecking order will look like given the sweeping new rules that will see very different chassis – which will feature active aero – and brand-new power units that put a greater focus on battery power and which will run advanced sustainable fuel.

""[The Audi board have given us a] very realistic set of targets,"" says Wheatley. ""They understand the journey we are on, they have been incredibly understanding of how long that may take, the stages along the way, the fact everything needs to be in place, get bigger then consolidate your position for a while, get bigger again and then consolidate.

""So, our target really is to keep building on this momentum, which we started this year. We need to carry that through – and that will make us championship challengers at the end of the decade.""

With their motorsport heritage taking centre stage to open the event, it was then the turn of the R26 Concept car to break cover, donning the colour scheme that will coat their new F1 machines. The Audi red, black and titanium and straight, clean lines, was very Audi. That they conducted extensive research of how the colours will look on TV during the broadcast shows every detail matters to the German firm.

""It's about releasing something really unique,"" says Wheatley. ""If you look at an F1 car in five years, you'll say that's an Audi, in 10 years' time, you'll say that's an Audi. It's about setting a design ethos that will just carry through.""

Underneath the paintjob, but away from prying eyes (as the livery was unveiled on a concept show car) in Hinwil, the first Audi F1 car is coming together. ""It's looking great as a car,"" says Binotto. ""I am enjoying the new regulations, I'm enjoying the challenge from an engineering point of view.

""The entire team at Hinwil and Neuberg are excited, it'll be very special for us in a few weeks' time when we fire up the car – and then later on we will hit the track very soon. Next year, when we are in Melbourne, it'll be a special moment for all of us. The dream is coming close.""

Binotto has an immense amount of experience in Formula 1, with a large chunk of that centred around the power unit, having headed up that division for a period during his long stint at Ferrari. He of all people knows how big a challenge it is for Audi to not only get a power unit ready in a reasonably short amount of time but to do so having never built a Formula 1 engine that has hit the track.

""The challenge is big,"" he says. ""The power unit is a complex and difficult matter. The development of the power unit takes time, it takes longer than the chassis and aero. The team started years ago to develop the power unit and it's running well on the dyno. But for us it will be a long journey, and there will be much we need to learn, but we are all excited.

""On the dyno, we are running through reliability at the moment, ensuring reliability will be alright for the start of the season. There are some tense moments in Neuberg – but that's the challenge.""

He adds: ""I think the power unit challenge is difficult, but to become World Champion, to become the best car on track, all the challenges are tricky. I don't think you can select one or the other being the most difficult. But for a new manufacturer, certainly it's not easy.""

Exciting times ahead, then, for Audi. The German automotive are taking their entry into F1 very seriously – and they want to beat the very best. Based on their approach so far, they've got off to a strong start.

The Cooldown Room: F2's Luke Browning takes on a charades challenge

All 10 current Formula 1 teams will continue to sponsor a livery and driver in F1 ACADEMY, while Cadillac are set to join the all-female series as a sponsor from 2027.

F1 ACADEMY and Formula 1 have announced that all 10 current F1 teams have reaffirmed their commitment to sponsor a livery and driver in the all-female series as part of a multi-year partnership.

The Cadillac Formula 1 team, who will join F1 in 2026, have also confirmed that they will join the F1 ACADEMY grid as a sponsor from 2027.

This agreement not only reiterates the sport's deep commitment to increasing female participation in motorsport, on and off the track, but also reflects the rapidly expanding and highly competitive pool of drivers competing for a seat in the all-female F4-level series.

In addition, with a focus on deeper talent development, from 2027 drivers who have competed in the two previous seasons may be granted an exemption to race in the series for a third season, in accordance with the updated 2027 regulations.

This new provision reflects a tailored approach to nurturing talent and will be granted exclusively to drivers whose performance indicates strong potential for continued growth throughout a third campaign.

The news comes at a time of continued global growth for F1 ACADEMY. The series' brand platform has grown rapidly in the three seasons since its launch in 2023, with races broadcast in over 170 global territories, the seven-part documentary series on Netflix produced by Reese Witherspoon's production company Hello Sunshine, F1: The Academy, and a cumulative social audience across Instagram, YouTube, X and TikTok of 1.38 million.

Susie Wolff, Managing Director of F1 ACADEMY, said: “The commitment of long-term support from all 10 current Formula 1 teams, and the addition of Cadillac to our grid from 2027, sends a powerful message about the future of F1 ACADEMY.

“We're not just providing a platform for the current generation of female drivers; together, we're building a pathway to support generations of talent to come.

“We continue to be impressed by the depth of female talent coming out of the world of karting and are encouraged by the growth and strength of the emerging talent pool.

“A sharpened focus on individualised talent development, including the opportunity for drivers with high potential to compete in up to three seasons, will give standout drivers the support and platform needed to fully realise their potential, while ensuring that the F1 ACADEMY grid consistently features the very best female talent.”

F1 fitness myths busted with Alex Albon

The Cooldown Room: F2's Luke Browning takes on a charades challenge

With F1 The Movie's soundtrack up for three Grammy Awards, F1 is finding itself in the global spotlight yet again – making waves on screen, on stage, and far beyond the track.

F1 The Movie has been making headlines since its release earlier this summer, but now it's racing into entirely new territory – the Grammys. The film's official soundtrack has picked up not one – but three nominations at the 2026 Grammy Awards, including Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media and two songs for individual consideration.

Featuring a mind-blowing score composed by the legendary Hans Zimmer, and original music from artists such as Ed Sheeran, Doja Cat and Tate McRae, F1 the Album was designed to capture the energy and emotion of Formula 1, from the build-up before lights out, the rhythm of a flawless pit stop, and the release of emotion at the chequered flag in music. It's the first time F1 has featured at the Grammys – a sign of just how far the sport now reaches beyond the circuit on a race weekend.

But this isn't the first time F1 has caught the attention of the awards world. From Emmys and Laureus honours to BAFTA nods and even knighthoods, the sport and its stars have rightly been recognised well beyond the track...

For a sport where finding the right rhythm is everything, tensions build to stratospheric levels, and releases of intense emotion after a race are not uncommon, it's hardly surprising that the sport translates so naturally into music.

F1 The Movie's soundtrack, titled F1 the Album – produced by Apple Studios and Atlantic Records – is the perfect accompaniment to the film featuring Brad Pitt, Javier Bardem, and Kerry Condon. Hans Zimmer's cinematic orchestration blends flawlessly with contemporary artists, so every movie moment has a perfectly matching sound. As The Independent reported, Lewis Hamilton even played a hands-on role in shaping the album's global sound, championing diversity, and helping to select tracks and artists to reflect the sport's worldwide audience.

This resulted in recognition from the members of the Recording Academy, who put forward music from the album in three different categories. Tate McRae's hit Just Keep Watching is up for Best Dance Pop Recording and already has over 400 million streams on Spotify. Chris Stapleton's Bad As I Used To Be is nominated for Best Country Solo Performance, while F1 the Album is put forward for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media.

Back in June, Billboard's Top Movie Songs chart was dominated by the album, with seven of its tracks appearing in the top 10 – a clear sign of how strongly the soundtrack resonated with F1, music, and movie fans. The album's inclusion on the list marks F1's first appearance on a major Grammys shortlist, putting the sport in the same conversation as cultural hits Barbie and Oppenheimer.

Whether or not F1 The Album takes home a trophy, it's already made an impact on the sport – turning the sound of Formula 1 into something fans can blast over race weekends, play on a long drive, or simply to score their everyday lives.

If F1 The Movie took the sport to the big screen, Netflix's Drive to Survive brought it to living rooms all over the world.

Since its debut series in 2019, the Netflix docuseries has undoubtedly transformed F1's audience, pulling in millions of new fans into its captivating world. Its unique behind-the-scenes storytelling highlights, unseen garage moments, and intricate team politics – completely reshaping how viewers can connect with the sport.

The show's critical acclaim from fans has been matched by industry recognition. Since 2021, Drive to Survive has earned Sports Emmy nominations for Outstanding Documentary Series – Serialised every single year since its launch. With wins in 2022 and 2025, the show has certainly made a significant impact in the sports documentary industry.

It's no exaggeration to say the series helped shift the global image of motorsport too – and its countless Emmy wins and nominations simply confirmed what fans already knew: the drama of F1 never stops...

But it's not just Drive to Survive that has been recognised for its enthralling storytelling in the world of F1. Brawn: The Impossible Formula 1 Story on Disney+, another F1 documentary and narrated by Keanu Reeves, captured the imagination of fans and critics alike. Its vibrant retelling of Jenson Button's title winning 2009 season – when Ross Brawn's underdog team shocked the world in a fairytale season – earned an International Emmy for Best Sports Documentary.

Ron Howard's 2013 film Rush, which dramatised James Hunt's epic rivalry with Niki Lauda, was nominated for Best Film (Drama) at the Golden Globes and received BAFTA nods for its editing and sound design. The film, featuring Chris Hemsworth, Daniel Bruhl, and Olivia Wilde, remains one of the most critically acclaimed sports biopics of the modern era – and is still an entertaining watch over a decade later.

And in 2023, Villeneuve Pironi: Racing's Untold Tragedy, a feature documentary exploring the complex friendship turned rivalry between Ferrari drivers Gilles Villeneuve and Didier Pironi, won Best Feature Documentary at the International Motor Film Awards. The film was praised for its sensitivity, historical insight, and cinematic craft, highlighting how the real life drama of F1 can rival anything scripted when it comes to Hollywood thrills.

The 2010 documentary movie Senna which charted the life and career of F1 legend Ayrton Senna, also received plenty of accolades, as it won two BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) awards for Best Documentary and Best Editing.

And the Senna mini-series on Netflix was nominated for the highly prestigious Critics Choice Award in 2025 for the Best Foreign Language Series.

When it comes to sporting prestige, few honours carry the weight of the Laureus World Sports Awards – and F1 has featured prominently amongst its winners.

In 2022, Max Verstappen took home the coveted World Sportsman of the Year award after clinching his first World Championship title. Accepting the award, the now four-time champion said it topped off his whirlwind year.

“A big thank you to everyone voting for me from the Laureus Academy. It's been a very special year – a very hectic year because the pressure was always on. I couldn't do this without the team behind me and the people back at the factory,” he said at the time.

Just two years earlier, Hamilton shared the same title with football icon Lionel Messi – the first time in Laureus history that the award was jointly given.

It was a recognition of not only Hamilton's sixth world title at the time, but also of his influence beyond the track with his tireless work in diversity and environmental advocacy. The Brit also won the Laureus Breakthrough of the Year award in 2008 for his stellar 2007 rookie season where he finished runner-up in the Drivers' Championship.

Daniel Ricciardo followed Hamilton's footsteps, earning the Breakthrough in 2015 after his remarkable debut season with Red Bull. The late Niki Lauda was recognised a year later with the Laureus Lifetime Achievement Award, celebrating a career defined not just by his exceptional three World Championship titles, but by his infamous resilience, leadership, and extraordinary contribution to F1 on and off the track.

Teams have also shared the spotlight, with Mercedes winning Team of the Year in 2018 after a fourth-consecutive Constructors and Drivers' Championship double, while Brawn GP and Button were honoured in 2010 for their unlikely Championship wins.

The star power of Formula 1 has never burned brighter. From the latest Grammys nominations and Emmy wins to numerous red-carpet appearances and chart-topping soundtracks – the sport's reach is undeniably growing.

And as F1 continues to break new ground and extend into new fields and arenas, who knows what could be next. One thing's for sure: whether it's on the podium, a playlist, or the big screen, F1 isn't done collecting trophies just yet...

The Cooldown Room: F2's Luke Browning takes on a charades challenge

Williams boss James Vowles has shared his reaction to the recent news that Franco Colapinto will remain on the grid with Alpine in 2026.

James Vowles was left feeling “really proud” of Franco Colapinto after it was confirmed that the Argentinian will remain on the grid with Alpine into 2026, though the Williams boss added that the young driver needs to “keep earning it year on year”.

Colapinto – who was previously a member of the Williams Driver Academy – made his F1 debut for Williams during the final nine Grands Prix of the 2024 season, having been drafted in to replace Logan Sargeant until Carlos Sainz arrived in 2025.

The 22-year-old went on to join Alpine as a reserve driver, before being promoted to a race seat following the opening six rounds of the 2025 season after the decision was made to swap out Jack Doohan.

While Colapinto faced a difficult start – leading Alpine's Executive Advisor Flavio Briatore to state that he was “not happy” with the level of performance – the Argentinian has been more competitive relative to team mate Pierre Gasly of late.

Asked for his reaction to the news that Colapinto will continue on with Alpine in 2026, Vowles said: “I'm really proud of what he's done – certainly over the last, let's say, seven races. It's a big turnaround for me. He's showing the world the performance I saw when he was with Williams.

“I think he's earned that seat for next year, and I was incredibly proud of him when they announced it.”

Vowles also spoke positively of the large fanbase that Colapinto has, adding: “He's got such a huge following. On the way in here [to the Sao Paulo Grand Prix] – and I'm really not exaggerating – it took half an hour because there's about 50,000 incredibly passionate Argentinians, and that's what I like to see.

“The sport is in a health it's never been in before, and Franco has this huge following. So I think he's done it on performance; he also does it on what the sport's getting out of it as well at the same time. I think he's got a bright future – it's for him to keep earning it year on year.”

Colapinto will again have Gasly as his team mate next season, the Frenchman having signed a contract extension with the Enstone-based squad – who will switch to Mercedes power units in 2026 – that will see him race for them until at least the end of the 2028 campaign.

F1 fitness myths busted with Alex Albon

The Cooldown Room: F2's Luke Browning takes on a charades challenge

F1.com flicks through the archives to relive a selection of special pit lane performances in years gone by.

Max Verstappen added another legendary drive to his CV at last weekend's Sao Paulo Grand Prix when the reigning four-time World Champion rose from the pits to the podium. But who else has impressed with standout pit lane showings over the years? F1.com picks out a few examples…

Early on in what would become a close fight for the 1984 title between McLaren team mates Niki Lauda and Alain Prost, the South African Grand Prix yielded the squad's first 1-2 finish of the season via a significant dose of drama.

After qualifying fifth, Prost's car could not be fired up due to technical trouble and meant he was forced to start from the pits in the spare, which would have gone to Lauda had it not been for a delay brought on by a rival crashing heavily in the warm-up (which allowed mechanics to fix the Austrian's own engine woes).

When the race eventually got under way, Lauda cycled to the front of the pack from P8 on the grid and cruised to victory by more than a minute, but it was pit lane starter Prost who impressively emerged as the runner-up with a tenacious drive.

A few years later, Prost and new McLaren team mate Ayrton Senna had just led the way into the first corner of the French Grand Prix when Leyton House driver Mauricio Gugelmin steamrolled Williams' Thierry Boutsen and Ferrari pair Gerhard Berger and Nigel Mansell.

Mansell took the restart from the pit lane and set about making up lost ground, using Paul Ricard's long straights and mixture of braking zones to pick off plenty of cars, while also benefitting from various retirements – including for
Senna and team mate Berger.

Mansell ultimately took the chequered flag in second position, 44 seconds behind winner Prost, marking a fine way to bounce back after he had been disqualified from the previous race in Canada due to a start procedure breach.

It was a tricky start to the 2003 season-opening Australian Grand Prix for Kimi Raikkonen, who crashed heavily in practice, lost valuable track time as a result, and was subsequently forced to use the spare McLaren car in Qualifying, which he ended back in 15th position.

However, with heavy rain arriving before the race, and the start taking place in mixed conditions, McLaren filled Raikkonen's car with fuel and started him from the pit lane, leading to one of the Finn's finest F1 drives.

Making overtake after overtake, Raikkonen soon found himself leading the race, which he might have converted into the win without a drive-through penalty for speeding in the pit lane by just 1 km/h. In the end, he had to settle for a still very respectable third.

Michael Schumacher sparked controversy at the 2006 Monaco Grand Prix when he came to a halt at the Rascasse corner in the final moments of Qualifying, preventing championship rival Alonso from completing a final effort and overhauling him for pole position.

While Schumacher insisted it was a genuine mistake, many in the paddock questioned the move. When the stewards looked into the matter, the German's lap times were deleted and he was forced to start from the back, which then became the pit lane.

With that drama behind him, Schumacher focused on what would be a challenging recovery drive around Monte Carlo's tight, twisty streets, but the seven-time World Champion this time showed his best side to climb to fifth and salvage a couple of valuable points.

Markus Winkelhock only made one start as an F1 driver, but he still managed to leave his mark on the sport – the German racer brilliantly going from last to first in the opening minutes of a dramatic, rain-hit 2007 European Grand Prix around the Nurburgring.

Given the threat of a downpour, and having qualified almost a second-and-a-half slower than Spyker team mate Adrian Sutil, Winkelhock peeled into the pit lane at the end of the formation lap to bolt on wet tyres, while the rest of the field lined up on the grid.

It proved to be a masterstroke when the rain arrived and sent slick-shod cars sliding off the track, with Winkelhock driving through it all to take the lead before red flags were thrown. While he lost the lead at the restart and later retired due to a hydraulics issue, it was a memorable backmarker display.

All-new regulations led to a pecking order shake-up in 2009, with Brawn GP emerging as the surprise package following Honda's withdrawal from F1 and a host of other teams scrapping to be the ‘best of the rest' behind them.

Toyota were one of those outfits, but Jarno Trulli and team mate Timo Glock suffered an early setback when they were excluded from Qualifying at the Australian Grand Prix opener due to rear wing breaches – turning their P8 and P6 grid slots into pit lane starts.

Both drivers came back fighting on race day, though, overtaking plenty of rivals and benefitting from several incidents – which included a late clash between BMW Sauber's Robert Kubica and Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel – to reach the top-five places.

Trulli, who had crossed the line third, was initially hit with a penalty for passing Lewis Hamilton under a Safety Car, only for that decision to be reversed when it was deemed the McLaren man had misled the stewards post-race.

Hamilton was locked in a fierce title fight with Mercedes team mate Nico Rosberg midway through the 2014 season, and his efforts were dealt a blow when his car caught fire in Qualifying at the Hungaroring before he had a chance to post a lap time.

That meant a pit lane start for the Briton, who then spun into the Turn 2 barriers on the first lap with cold tyres and brakes, damaging his front wing and leaving him with an even bigger damage limitation exercise for the rest of the afternoon.

An incident-filled race flipped the script once more, however, with Rosberg particularly hurt by the timing of an early Safety Car, helping Hamilton (on an alternate strategy) to close in and slot ahead – via some team orders drama and tense wheel-to-wheel moments.

Hungary was the scene of another chaotic race in 2021, starting when Valtteri Bottas triggered a multi-car crash at Turn 1 in wet conditions, along with more wheel-banging further down the order – leaving Race Control with no option but to red flag proceedings.

A bizarre sight followed at the restart when Hamilton was the only driver to line up on the grid on intermediate tyres, while the remaining drivers pitted to fit slicks, among them Alpine's Esteban Ocon, who had started eighth and taken advantage of the first-lap incidents.

Ocon found himself in P1 when Hamilton boxed for slicks, a lead the Frenchman would not relinquish as the race developed – despite sustained pressure from Aston Martin man Vettel (who was later disqualified over a fuel sample breach).

Towards the end of a highly competitive 2012 season, which saw seven different drivers take victory at the first seven rounds, Vettel put himself in control of the championship battle with an imperious run of four successive wins.

However, with just three rounds to go in Abu Dhabi, the German was dramatically excluded from Qualifying when officials were unable to take a fuel sample from his Red Bull post-session, forcing him to start from the pit lane while title rival Fernando Alonso lined up sixth.

The action did not stop on race day, with Vettel picking up front wing damage early on but recovering to pull off a series of overtakes and charge through the field – the last being a bold move on Jenson Button to reach the podium.

Verstappen wowed the rain-soaked crowds at Interlagos in 2024 when he somehow turned 17th on the grid into victory – the Dutchman sailing past his rivals in torrential conditions and finishing almost 20 seconds clear of second place.

Fast forward 12 months and, after a dreadful Qualifying session that saw him drop out in Q1 for the first time since the 2021 season, he was forced into another comeback drive, albeit this time without the ‘help' of any wet weather.

With a new power unit in the back of his Red Bull, which also underwent some set-up changes, Verstappen put on another charge for the ages that turned a pit lane start into a scarcely believable third, even after an early puncture.

The second installment of Victor Kossakovsky's ""empathy trilogy,"" which started with 'Gunda,' premieres at Amsterdam's IDFA. Danny Glover and Maya Rudolph also get thanks in the closing credits.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	A woman walks barefoot over jagged rocks by the sea in a location we can't quite place immediately. Wearing a white dress, her face is hidden beneath the brim of a floppy hat. She walks and walks, sometimes carrying a large jute bag over her shoulder. In his new feature, the black-and-white Trillion, filmmaker Victor Kossakovsky tells a minimalist story, but he is hoping for maximum impact. 


	Described as “a cinematic and wordless interpretation of the Myth of Sisyphus” in collaboration with an artist using the name K49814, Trillion world premieres Sunday in the Envision Competition of this year's International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA). Its executive producers include none other than Joaquin Phoenix, along with Susan Rockefeller, Frank Lehmann, Fridrik Mar and Kaja Bjelke.

	What unfolds in Trillion over 80 wordless minutes feels like a mystery and an experience, enticing viewers to try and piece together what is happening and why, based on visual clues, including the images and the play of light, and audio clues, both natural and atmospheric.




			Related Video		







	Given Kossakovsky's past work, though, you know that he will want to make us aware of something profound and make us think about it. An official description of Trillion confirms as much, noting that the movie is “the second installment of his 'empathy trilogy.'” And it explains the filmmaker's hope for the impact of Trillion this way: “Provoking deeply relevant questions about the meaning and purpose of life in a time when all sentient beings face existential threat.”

	











	Kossakovsky has made a splash with such recent works as Gunda (2020), about a pig and her piglets that was the first film in his “empathy trilogy,” which Phoenix also executive produced. And in Architekton (2024), the director explored creation and destruction. 


	“Trillion is also a call to action: a journey of discovery that prompts reflection on the possibilities of realizing a different future,” the IDFA website says mysteriously. 


	As with Gunda, Phoenix is listed as an executive producer on Trillion. And when the closing credits roll, Danny Glover and Maya Rudolph are among the other big Hollywood names mentioned in a “thank you” section. “They were involved in the production in one way or another,” Kossakovsky tells THR. Anonymous Content is handling North American sales for the film from Anita Rehoff Larsen and Tone Grottjord-Glenne for Sant & Usant, and Joslyn Barnes for Louverture Films.


	So, what exactly is this woman in Trillion doing? And why? That only becomes clear very, very gradually. “Only at the last second, you understand,” says the Russian director. “In the last frame, you know why it's called Trillion and what it is about.” (THR will for now not spoil further details.)


	He feels doc festival IDFA is a great fit for his kind of doc work. “When you go to a fiction festival like Berlin or Venice, you are secondary,” he says. “People waiting on the red carpet for George Clooney.” 


	Kossakovsky says that “every film I make, I'm trying to make differently in form.” But he has earned a reputation for using narrative images more than dialogue. “I'm not using many words in my movies,” he acknowledges. “I'm trying to use cinema language. I'm trying to use pictures. A picture alone talks most of the time. Our eyes are unbelievable computers. We are able to look at someone and read that other person. This is why I don't understand why cinema, specifically documentary cinema, doesn't use this factor.”

	











	He adds: “We understand the world not through voiceovers and talking heads. It's not through words. We understand the world around us through looking.”


	Watching Trillion, audiences will see images and movement, but “in a way, nothing much is happening,”  Kossakovsky offers. “The idea is to watch to the last frame. My duty was [to make sure] that you sit and watch until the end.” And he quips: “That's why I trick people. I use this dramatic music” in parts of the film.


	The director shares that his distinct approach to documentary filmmaking means he also tends to be notably affected by his projects. “Some people make documentaries in order to teach someone something,” Kossakovsky explains. “And that's why they use a voiceover to tell you something. I'm making films in order to become a different person.”


	He means that literally. “I'm doing a film, and after that film, I cannot live in the same way I lived before,” the director shares. 


	Asked about his empathy trilogy, Kossakovsky tells THR: “I decided to to make three films about something we don't pay attention to.” In Gunda, he tackled that in this way: “We don't pay attention to pigs. We just eat them.”


	How did Phoenix get involved in that film? “He watched Gunda, and he immediately called me and said, ‘Finally, someone made a film about pigs, not about us humans,'” Kossakovsky recalls. “He watched it and said, ‘I want to support such movies.'” Now, the actor is back on board for Trillions.


	But the filmmaker is already thinking about the third film in the trilogy. “I cannot say anything about it, because it's  still secret, but I will start soon,” Kossakovsky shares. “And I hope Joaquin Phoenix will be part of it as well.”

	











‘Trillion' world premiere details: Sunday, November 16 at 6:15 pm at Tuschinski 1 in Amsterdam

After more than a decade of working together, Drake has cut ties with Brent Smith at Wasserman Music.


													By
												

	Dave Brooks



Drake quietly parted ways with the booking agent he shared with  longtime rival Kendrick Lamar earlier this year, Billboard has learned, in a move largely kept quiet to avoid media scrutiny.


	One source tells Billboard that Drake and former longtime agent Brent Smith of Wasserman Music have not worked together for most, if not all, of 2025 due in part to the fallout over last year's feud with Lamar and the release of his Billboard Hot 100-topping diss track “Not Like Us.”


	Drake had been repped by Smith for more than a decade; the two began working together at WME and continued their relation after Smith joined Wasserman Music in 2020, where he now serves as executive vice president and managing executive.

	











	Drake will reportedly be repped at CAA by a team led by Daryl Eaton, Billboard has learned. The news was first reported by Hits Daily Double.


	Drake's decision to split with Wasserman comes after Lamar and SZA grossed an impressive $358.6 million gross on their Grand National Tour, making it one of the highest-grossing hip-hop treks of all time, according to Billboard Boxscore, moving 1.76 million tickets. Drake is reportedly planning his own tour for 2026 with Live Nation, where he has long had an exclusive global touring deal.




	The fact that Drake and Lamar shared a booking agent was a topic of intrigue in the music business, especially as the two rappers' feud worsened. At one point, Drake even sued his record label Universal Music Group over the lyrics to “Not Like Us,” which Drake claimed were untrue and defamatory. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit last month, and attorneys for Drake have appealed.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


UPDATED: Donald Trump went after what he called “weak Republicans” for backing an effort to compel the Justice Department to release files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.


	Later, he said that he would be asking Attorney General Pam Bondi “to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him.”


	Trump posted on Truth Social on Friday, “The Democrats are doing everything in their withering power to push the Epstein Hoax again, despite the DOJ releasing 50,000 pages of documents, in order to deflect from all of their bad policies and losses, especially the SHUTDOWN EMBARRASSMENT, where their party is in total disarray, and has no idea what to do. Some Weak Republicans have fallen into their clutches because they are soft and foolish.”

	











	In asking for an investigation of Clinton, Summers and Hoffman, Trump wrote, “This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats. Records show that these men, and many others, spent large portions of their life with Epstein, and on his ‘Island.'”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Earlier this week, backers of the effort to release the files secured the 218 votes needed to force a House vote. The petition has the support of four Republicans and all Democrats, with the House expected to take it up next week. That will put pressure on other House Republicans to vote in favor of the files release, with the expectation that there will be a number of defections.

	











	Trump has labeled the focus on the Epstein files a hoax orchestrated by the Democrats, while the White House has maintained that the president did nothing wrong. But Trump advocated for the release of the files during his presidential campaign last year.


	Earlier this week, Democrats released a series of emails from Epstein's estate that were obtained by the House Oversight Committee. The emails included one that Epstein wrote to Ghislaine Maxwell on April 2, 2011: “I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is trump.. [Victim] spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned.  Police chief. etc.     im 75 % there.”


	In another email, from Jan. 31, 2019, Epstein wrote to journalist Michael Wolff: “[Victim] mara lago. [identifier]. Trump said he asked me to resign, never a member ever. Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.”


	The punctuation appears as it as in the email documents released by the Oversight Committee.


	Republicans on the Oversight Committee responded by releasing 20,000 emails from the Epstein estate. They pointed to the redaction of the victim's name from the April 2, 2011 email. “Why did Democrats cover up the name when the Estate didn't redact it in the redacted documents provided to the committee? It's because this victim, Virginia Giuffre, publicly said that she never witnessed wrongdoing by President Trump.”


	In one of the emails that was released, Epstein wrote in 2015 that Clinton was “never ever” on the island, contradicting one victim's claim.


	Since the email release, Trump has avoided answering reporters' questions about Epstein. In his Truth Social post, Trump tried to shift attention to Democrats who have been associated with Epstein and said he was “not the Republicans' problem!”

He might as well release em even his cult members know what's up at this point.

Naturally being such a big hoax you would do everything in your power to block the release of the Epstein files.

If the Epstein files are released, it may have Trump, but it will also have Clinton and other powerful leaders and personalities from both sides. Clinton was best friends with Epstein.

Nobody is saying “Don't release them! We must protect Bill Clinton!” Nobody. Dems and a handful of Republicans alike want all the files released. Trump's defiance speaks volumes  And NOW he's calling on an investigation into others? Uhh, release the files. Or is that his way of preventing the files' release. Meaning, the DOJ won'tbe able to release them if there are active investigations going on.  

Oh amd Speaker Johnson saying that the Dems refused to vote is absurd. What they refused to vote on was anonymous voting. They want transparency on both the Epstein files release as well as the votes to release them. Why are the Republicans against being transparent?

How many time do we have to tell you we do not give an F. A everyone that was involved with Epstein needs to be investigated, period.

Reverse psychology.

“I'm not guilty, no not at all! Stop looking at Trump, Trump wasn't involved!”

Sure, Don.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


FRIDAY AM: While it may seem too close to call, there's buzz that Lionsgate's Now You See Me: Now You Don't may have the best shot at No. 1 this weekend after collecting $2.1 million in total Thursday previews. At least that was the confidence last night from a handful of sources. Now You See Me 2 did $1.75M previews back in June 2016.


	Paramount's $110M redo of The Running Man grossed $1.9M across 3,000 theaters during Thursday night shows. Both Now You See Me 3 and Running Man are eyeing $20M+. Critics on Rotten Tomatoes have similar opinions for both titles, though Running Man has the edge, 64% to 59%.

	











	The advantage that Now You See Me 3 has is its PG-13 rating compared with Running Man‘s R. Now You See Me 3 is looking to be both a date night movie while also appealing to families. The previous two movies made anywhere from 67% to 80% of their global box office abroad. Note, Lionsgate is one of the sole motion picture studios that licenses out foreign to fund their productions. Now You See Me 3 cost north of net $90M before P&A.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Meanwhile, Running Man‘s previews are in line with that of Neon's The Monkey, which did $1.9M in total previews before a $5.8M Friday and a three-day total of $14M. Running Man‘s previews are well below that of Tron Ares, another 1980s sci-fi series reboot, which saw a $14.4M Friday and a three-day of $33.2M  when it bowed last month.


	The original Running Man, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, opened in this same exact mid-November slot in 1987 with a No. 1 take of $8.1M (unadjusted for inflation). The movie finaled at $38.1M domestic and earned a B+ CinemaScore off a reported $27M production cost. The pic continued to hold No. 1 in its second weekend before ceding to Disney/Touchstone's Three Men and a Baby over the Thanksgiving holiday. Running Man was the 30th highest-grossing movie of 1987 in a year that was led by Beverly Hills Cop ($153.6M), Platoon ($136.7M) and Fatal Attraction ($125.9M). Coming in the wake of summer 1987's Predator, which at that time was Schwarzenegger's highest-grossing movie of his career with $60M domestic, Running Man didn't meet expectations, though its U.S.-Canada take was in line with previous Arnie movies like Commando, Conan the Barbarian and The Terminator. 












	Nonetheless, keep in mind that it's a marathon not a sprint for both movies given that Thanksgiving is in two weeks.


	20th Century Studios' No. 1 pic of the week, Predator: Badlands, did an estimated $1.7M yesterday (off 26% from Wednesday) for a first-week tally of $53.2M. The Elle Fanning movie is expected to be down 60% in its second weekend, par for the genre.

According to Deadline, Predator: Badlands cost $105 million and The Running Man cost $110 million.

Having seen both movies, i find that hard to believe.

Whereas Predator has incredible 3D animations and is full of effects, Running Man has much fewer effects and old school practical fx and explosions.

Predator had an opening weekend of $40 million and is also the better movie.

The Running Man is very forgettable unlike The Long March.

Is Predator Badlands a box office hit or not

					By Mike Fleming Jr 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, Film


EXCLUSIVE: Atlas Entertainment and Ghost Machine have made a deal for a feature film adaptation of Redcoat,  the comic series written by Geoff Johns (Aquaman, The Flash). Redcoat's debut issue in April 2024 was an instant sellout, and the ongoing series has since been a bestseller for Ghost Machine and publishing partner Image Comics.  The film will be scripted by Johns, based on a story by Johns and Hitch.


	Producing are Charles Roven and Alex Gartner for Atlas Entertainment. 


	After a British deserter mistakenly gains immortality during the American Revolution, he is forced to face his cowardly past and fight against a sinister plot to destroy America. Reminiscent of the bombastic historical action in Pirates of the Caribbean and Indiana Jones, Redcoat pulls back the curtain of American History to tell the legend of the unknown hero. The comics are illustrated by Bryan Hitch (The Ultimates), colored by Brad Anderson, and lettered by Rob Leigh.

	“All great franchises are built on great characters and Redcoat's Simon Pure is one of them,” Gartner said. “Funny, charismatic, and lovably roguish, he anchors the IP fantastically.”

	Said Roven: “I have known Geoff Johns for many years and in some cases had a front row seat to his excellent work in the DC world. Johns and Hitch have formed a brilliant collaboration as writer and illustrator of the Redcoat comics, which have become a top-selling fan favorite. Redcoat is innovative comic material and ripe to become a tentpole.”

	











	Founded in October 2023, Ghost Machine is the first-of-its-kind creator-owned and operated media company which generates, adapts, and controls its fully owned universes of original characters and stories. Beyond Johns' Redcoat, his comic work for Ghost Machine includes the post-apocalyptic western Geiger and the sci-fi Rook: Exodus.


	Roven won the Best Picture Oscar for Oppenheimer, and he and Gartner are producing the Amazon MGM Studios films Mercy, starring Chris Pratt, Rebecca Ferguson, Kali Reis and Annabelle Wallis for early 2026, and are in production on the Michael B. Jordan-directed reimagining of The Thomas Crown Affair for 2027 and the sequel to the Road House reboot with Jake Gyllenhaal reprising for an Amazon Prime Video release.

					By Justin Kroll 

Film Editor


EXCLUSIVE: After breathing new life into high-profile IP like the Spider-Man franchise and Dungeons & Dragons, Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley are looking to boldly go where no directors have gone before with a very popular franchise. Sources tell Deadline, the duo are coming on to write, produce and are attached to direct a new original Star Trek film for Paramount. They will produce under their GoldDay banner.


	Plot details are being kept under wraps for now, but sources say Goldstein and Daley's film is a completely new take on the Star Trek universe and not connected to any previous or current television series, movie or prior movie development projects. That pitch falls in line with Skydance founder David Ellison's recent comments on an earnings call where he said the next Star Trek film would not be a sequel in the Chris Pine-led series but something different with new actors. While not confirmed, sources also add it's likely you also also see new characters being featured in this version.

	











	As for Goldstein and Daley, the two have shown a knack for not only delivering scripts with new and fresh takes on existing IP but adding a fun and lightness that differentiated them from other films in the franchise. Films like Spider-Man: Homecoming, which the two wrote, and the recent Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, which they also directed, earned strong marks from fans and critics alike for not only having strong stories but fun, witty humor that consistently is seen in their work and will be fresh for the Star Trek franchise.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Goldstein and Daley also have strong ties to both Paramount and Skydance on recent projects. Dungeons & Dragons was one of Paramounts best scored films from 2023 with a 91% from critics and 92% from audience members. As for Skydance, Goldstein and Daley recently wrote, produced and directed the original Cold War action comedy Mayday starring Ryan Reynolds. Sources say it has tested through the roof in early screenings for Skydance and Apple, with plans to release next year.


	Goldstein and Daley are repped by CAA, Fourth Wall Management and Hansen Jacobson Teller.

Cardi B is now a mom of four!

The “Bodak Yellow” rapper welcomed her first child with boyfriend Stefon Diggs, she announced Thursday via Instagram. 

“My life has always been a combination of different chapters and different seasons,” she wrote alongside a video of herself modeling her post-baby physique in a black miniskirt and coat.

“My last chapter was the beginning of a new season. Starting over is never easy but it's been so worth it! I brought new music and a new album to the world! A new baby into my world, and one more reason to be the best version of me, one more reason to love me more than anything else or anyone else so I can continue giving my babies the love and life they deserve.”

“This next chapter is Me vs. Me! It's me against all odds me against everything meant to get in my way.” 

The rapper added that she's “started prepping” for her upcoming tour. 

“There's nothing thats gonna stop me from giving you guys the performance of a life time!” she continued. “I've learned i've healed, and im loving the woman i've become! Thats what this next era means to me and i'm stepping into it better than.” 

TMZ subsequently confirmed that she gave birth to a son “last week.”

Rumors that the hitmaker, 33, had welcomed her fourth child kicked into overdrive on Thursday after apparent footage emerged of her working out at a gym in New Jersey.

The brief clip obtained by TMZ showed a perfectly coiffed Cardi sitting on a weight bench in black workout gear, rocking earphones and scrolling on her smartphone.

The “WAP” hitmaker confirmed her pregnancy with the NFL star, 31, in September.

“I'm excited, I'm happy, I feel like I'm in a good space,” she told Gayle King during an appearance on “CBS Mornings” at the time. 

“By the way, now that I talk about it, y'all better buy my album so I can buy Pampers and diapers and all that stuff,” she said. “I felt like can I just say it on my own time? I'm not hiding.”

The Grammy winning songstress also divulged the baby was due before her “Little Miss Drama Tour” kicks off in February 2026.

Her newest addition to the family joins Cardi's three children with her estranged husband Offset, 33. 

They co-parent daughter Kulture, 7, son Wave, 3, and daughter Blossom, 1, whom Cardi welcomed following the former couple's 2024 split.

Cardi first sparked dating rumors with the athlete when they were photographed spending time together in February.

By May, they'd publicly confirmed their status as a couple with an appearance at a Knicks game, during which they held hands.

Earlier this month, a paternity test confirmed that Diggs also fathered Instagram model Aileen Lopera's baby, Charliee Harper Diggs-Lopera.

“The paternity has been confirmed. Mr. Diggs is the father of the child,” the influencer's attorney Tamar Arminak told Page Six.

“Now that the child's paternity has been established and Mr. Diggs has acknowledged his daughter, my client hopes they can work toward being great parents to their child.”

Diggs also welcomed daughter Nova — whom he allegedly shares with ex Tyler-Marie — in 2016.

Shakira and her sons made a rare red carpet appearance together on Thursday, attending the “Zootopia 2” premiere in Los Angeles. 

The trio made a colorful statement in coordinated lavender outfits. Milan, 12, and Sasha Piqué Mebarak, 10, twinned in custom purple tuxedos with matching bow ties and bright white sneakers while mom, Shakira, wore a high-neck, long-sleeve dress in the same hue, featuring an asymmetric hemline with a high left leg line that revealed strappy purple satin heels below.

Her long hair was in a high ponytail with two strands framing her face.

Stella McCartney designed all three ensembles.

The singer is finishing up her “Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran” tour, which began last February and ends on Dec. 11.

Shakira doesn't frequent red carpet events, so it's particularly sweet that she not only brought her sons but also coordinated all their high-fashion looks for the family-friendly screening.

Last year, she shared that taking her sons to “Barbie” was a bust, saying that they “absolutely hated” it. 

Hopefully, “Zootopia 2” was more of a hit.

Amy Robach's new engagement ring from fiancé T.J. Holmes is a show-stopper.

The newly engaged couple was snapped walking in New York City on Wednesday, and Robach's massive new hardware was on display. Robach smirked as she wore the ring — which features a very large gold gem — on her left ring finger.

The former “Good Morning America” hosts held hands and bundled up for the cold. Robach wore a long black coat, boots and a heavy pink scarf, while Holmes was more casual in gray sweatpants, a hoodie and a Nike jacket.

It appears the two stepped out to grab a bite to eat, as they were holding paper bags from bakery-restaurant chain Le Pain Quotidien.

Advertisement

The couple announced they were engaged on their “Amy & TJ” podcast in October, a month after he popped the question.

Holmes, 48, shared that Robach, 52, has been publicly wearing her engagement ring in front of crowds of thousands of people in plain sight but nobody had said anything.

Robach added, “I was in three massive football stadiums three weekends in a row, wearing my engagement ring very proudly, very excitedly, and kept waiting for somebody to point it out or ask me, ‘Hey, what's that?' And it never happened.”

But a source told Page Six that Robach's pals weren't fully on board with her wedding plans.

“I don't know many people who like T.J. She still has her besties and anyone who truly cares wants her [to be] happy,” the source said.

Holmes and Robach's engagement came three years after they were fired from “Good Morning America” for having an affair while they were still married to their previous partners.

In a stunning twist, Holmes and Robach's ex-spouses — Marilee Fiebig and Andrew Shue, respectively — are now dating and reportedly moved in together in February.

An insider told Us Weekly in June that Holmes and Robach are planning to invite their ex-spouses to their wedding.

Both Robach and Holmes have been married twice before. Robach was married to Tim McIntosh from 1996-2009, then Shue from 2010-2023. She shares two daughters with McIntosh: Ava, 22, and Annalise, 19.

Holmes' first wife was Amy Ferson, whom he divorced in 2007. He married Fiebig in 2010 before their split in 2022. He and Fiebig share daughter Sabine, 12.

There's a little game you can play with Hideo Kojima's Death Stranding video game series, and all that it requires, in terms of materials, is a handful of basic facts about the franchise, and a normie to relate them to. You win when they call you a liar, and it usually doesn't take that long: After all, we're talking about a post-apocalyptic walking simulator where Norman Reedus plays the world's most badass mailman, hogtying obsessive package thieves and launching himself out of cannons. Where major characters are played by motion-captured copies of Guillermo Del Toro and Nicolas Winding Refn. Where you fend off ghosts by throwing grenades filled with your main character's magical pee, while he carries a canteen that automatically fills itself back up with Monster brand energy drink. Wait, don't go! We haven't even gotten to the part where the Norman Reedus character talks glowingly about how riding a motorcycle is just like watching AMC's Ride With Norman Reedus!

What we're trying to establish here is that these are weird games, and now they're apparently going to be a weird animated TV show, too. This is per THR, which reports that Kojima has apparently signed with Disney to make a Disney+ animated series, Death Stranding Isolations, set in the world of the show, and which we can only assume will also be suitably bonkers. Featuring 2D animation (courtesy of Japanese studio E&H Production), the show will apparently center on a man and a woman going on a journey in the world of Kojima's games, where humanity screwed everything up for itself by reaching out to the realm of death, opening a door that's caused deadly time-accelerating rain called timefall to blanket the earth. and lethal ghosts to prowl the vast stretches of countryside now abandoned by humanity.

Kojima Productions has released two Death Stranding games so far, with the sequel, subtitled On The Beach, arriving earlier this year. In announcing the show, Metal Gear creator Kojima—who's also working on a film adaptation of the series with A24, and has long held ludicrously unsubtle desires to break into his beloved worlds of TV and film—stated that his goal was to bring the story of his games to people who don't play video games.

Jelly Roll is embracing a whole new chapter — and a whole new look — as he continues celebrating his incredible 200-plus–pound weight loss.

According to Jelly Roll's wife, Bunnie Xo, the “Son of a Sinner” artist has not had a clean-shaven face in more than a decade. What better time than now?

“I have been with my husband for going on 10 years now, and I have never seen this man without his facial hair,” Bunnie said in a video shared via Instagram on Thursday, November 13. “You guys know as women we get catfished, because we don't know what the hell's under there.”

Jelly, 40, joked that he might need plastic surgery for the loose skin left behind after losing weight.  

“We know we're gonna have to get some skin cut here, but we're trying to see if a face lift might be in order,” he said, tugging at his neck. 

Bunnie's reaction to her freshly-shaved husband was positive…mostly.

“Oh my god! Baby, it looks really good,” she said as he paused his shave halfway through to show her what he'd look like with a goatee. “Oh my god, the cop ‘stash is fire.”

Shortly after, however, Jelly — real name Jason DeFord — shaved it completely. 

“The total naked face…it's not terrible,” Bunnie said before bursting out laughing.

The country singer has lost more than 200 pounds through his journey, weighing in at under 300 pounds for the first time in his adult life. 

“I got fat, like, really, really young. I was over 300 pounds coming out of middle school. I'm gonna be under 300 pounds for the first time since middle school the night I walk to that ring at SummerSlam,” he told Stephanie McMahon on her “What's Your Story?” podcast earlier this year.

Bunnie wasn't the only one raving about her man's new look as fans took to the comment section to gush over the slimmed-down star. 

“You are THE most supportive woman on the planet. Everyone should take a note from you,” one follower praised the “Dumb Blonde” podcast host.

“Dudeeee he looks amazing, respectfully!!!” a second fan wrote. 

“Handsome no matter what (beautiful couple) but a goatee is a happy middle area,” another shared. 

“Unrecognizable in the best way omg!” a third follower responded. 

“Omg! He's looking so good! I'm so happy for you and him,” yet another reacted.

Simone Biles is speaking out about why she's choosing to share her plastic surgery journey with so much transparency. The seven-time Olympic gold medalist, who made it to the semi-finals and placed fourth with Sasha Farber on season 24 of “Dancing With the Stars,” revealed in a People exclusive published November 13, 2025 that she has “no shame” about her procedures.

Back in October, the superstar gymnast shared a TikTok video where she listed the alterations she's made to her appearance so far: a breast augmentation, a lower blepharoplasty to smooth her under eyes, and an earlobe surgery to fix the damage caused by an earring being “ripped out” in the past.

Now, she's opening up about the importance she places on sharing openly about her journey. Read on for details.

The 28-year-old told People in the new interview, “Social media is not real, so that's why I try to be as transparent as possible. She said her decision was inspired by the tendency to open social media and question how everyone looks so good, and that she places importance on sharing both the good and the bad parts of her cosmetic journey. She revealed getting Botox on her 27th birthday was something she didn't love, saying, “I had a floating eyebrow and everyone was asking what that was.”

Simone also talked about the value she places on being relatable. “Seeing me win medals at the Olympics, that's not relatable. But what is relatable is how we feel about ourselves, what we talk about, what we go through and how we share openly, honestly,” she told the mag, adding its the reason she opted to get so candid in the revealing TikTok post.

She also emphasized that the surgeries weren't a result of disliking the way she looked or felt. “It's just something that I notice obviously a little bit more because I live in this body, I'm just so used to it,” she said.

take your guesses 👀

Following in Simone's footsteps on the dance floor is her Olympic teammate, 24-year-old Jordan Chiles. Chiles was at Simone's side as the team took the silver medal at the Tokyo 2020 games (which were held in the Summer of 2021), and the friends shared the worldwide stage once again at Paris 2024.

While being interviewed after her week 2 jive to the song “Maniac” with her partner Ezra Sosa on One-Hit-Wonders night, Chiles told E! News, “One of my teammates Simone, she texted me and was like, ‘Girl, you killed it.' I was like, ‘Period. Oh, thank you.' I love being able to understand they are supporting me the same way I support them.”

Chiles and Sosa will dance in the semifinals of “Dancing With the Stars” season 34 on Tuesday, November 18 at 8 p.m. E.T. on ABC. The show also airs live on Disney+. 

Competing against Chiles and Sosa in the semifinals will be Alix Earle and Val Chmerkovskiy, Whitney Leavitt and Mark Ballas, Steve Irwin and Witney Carson, Dylan Efron and Daniella Karagach, and Elaine Hendrix and Alan Bersten.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Heather Gay Spent a Staggering Six-Figure Sum on Cosmetic Work — ‘Worth Every Penny'","https://entertainmentnow.com/real-housewives/rhoslc-heather-gay-reveals-cosmetic-costs/","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 16:46:09 GMT","

Heather Gay is pulling back the curtain on every cosmetic procedure, beauty treatment, and glow-up moment she's invested in — and she's not holding anything back. As “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” continues airing season 6, the 51-year-old reality star is opening up about her long journey with injectables, surgery, weight loss medication, and the costs behind her transformation.

In a new article published by Bustle on Wednesday, Nov. 13, Gay shared the full number she estimates she's spent on her appearance: at least $200,000. And as she put it, it was “worth every penny.”

The RHOSLC star told Bustle that investing in her appearance became part of her job once she joined reality TV, and she approached it with full honesty. “As soon as I had the money and the time, I thought: ‘I am going to try to profit from every single thing that's available to me. I can afford it, and it's part of my job now to look good,'” Gay said. “I always said that I'd be so much cuter if I were richer. I'm richer now — and I'm so much cuter because of it.”

Gay, who co-owns Beauty Lab + Laser, shared that she has been getting Botox quarterly since her 30s. She also regularly maintains fillers, facials, and twice-a-year laser hair removal. Her lip filler routine has remained consistent for around seven years, and she has also incorporated Sculptra — a collagen stimulator — into her regimen.

“Another treatment I get is Sculptra, which is a collagen stimulator, with big long needles on your face. It's pretty intense, but it's not an actual filler; it's just a filler stimulant,” Gay told Bustle. “Sculptra is $800 to $1,000 for a vial, and some people get four to six vials. It can cost around $4,000 per treatment.”

Gay also revealed she underwent two nose jobs before joining “The Real Housewives” in 2020, along with a blepharoplasty. “I got both of these surgeries for free, from the same surgeon, but I think the nose job was around $12,000, and a blepharoplasty was $2,500,” she shared.

She added that her then-husband, Frank William “Billy” Gay III, paid for a “mommy makeover” — a tummy tuck and breast augmentation — before their 2014 divorce.

Gay explained that over the past three years she has lost 30 pounds using weight-loss medication and continues to use GLP-1s as needed. She estimates the treatment costs at least $500 a month. To finish her “fourth season glow-up,” the RHOSLC star invested around $30,000 in veneers, explaining that looking “perfect” is seen as part of the job in reality television.

“I think there should be no shame in people wanting to change the way they look, but I also see that the standard of beauty has become more and more artificial for women,” Gay told Bustle. “Being on TV, it's really, really hard to see yourself constantly and to be amongst women who are physically flawless in every way.”

“Everyone has perfect teeth, lashes, and hair,” she said. “It's what I call the required uniform of a Housewife — and as you become more of a Housewife, it becomes more entrenched.”

New episodes of “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” air Tuesday nights on Bravo.

All three episodes of season 1 of “Surviving Mormonism with Heather Gay” are now streaming on Peacock.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Beloved & Influential Country Music Figure Passes Away at 81","https://entertainmentnow.com/country-music/country-music-bill-ivey-passing-tributes/","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 18:18:00 GMT","

Bill Ivey has died. He was 81. His name was not always in the limelight, but he had a tremendous impact on the industry as the director of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum. He held the position for 26 years, from 1971 to 1997. 

His passing has been announced publicly, and tributes have poured in from those who knew and respected him. He will be missed by many. 

Ivey passed away in Nashville on November 7. The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum announced the news on Facebook. The message celebrated Ivey's life and accomplishments. He got his start with the museum when he was initially hired for a library job in 1971. The post claims he “so impressed the board that by the fall of the year he was promoted to director of the CMF.” 

“Ivey set a rigorous standard that ensured the Museum's collections of artifacts, recordings, and library materials documenting country music would be unmatched,” the statement reads. “Twice he presided over building expansions, and through his leadership the Museum was transformed from a modest tourist attraction into the premier center for the preservation and study of country music past and present.”

Later in the statement, the museum claimed that Ivey was a “challenging thinker who helped cement the reputation of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum as a significant and authoritative music history center. His impact on the Museum and the wider arts world is incalculable.” 

The post's comment section has been flooded with reactions from people in the music industry, including journalists and administrators. “He inspired me as an arts administrator and advocate for more than 25 years, particularly through his leadership at the NEA and Curb Center,” a comment reads. “His influence in so many realms of the arts cannot be overstated. Grateful for his good works.”

Another comment reads, “Bill was truly a kind and gentle force of nature. Filled with perspective and knowledge, and always had time to spend with others. He served our industry in so many valuable ways.” 

Other reactions include, “A gentleman and scholar who guided the Hall of Fame to a position of respect and envy among museums throughout the country,” “So many memories working with Bill over 50 years,” and “Bill was a really nice guy. Sorry we've lost him.”

The following article is an excerpt from the latest edition of “In Review by David Ehrlich,” a biweekly newsletter in which our Chief Film Critic and Head Reviews Editor rounds up the site's latest reviews and muses about current events in the movie world. Subscribe here to receive the newsletter in your inbox every other Friday.

Pop quiz, hot shot: What do “Cruel Intentions,” “A Colt Is My Passport,” “Night of the Hunter,” “Possession,” “The Faculty,” and “Vertigo” all have in common? Now that I think of it, at least two different things come to mind. The first is that they all should have spawned gratuitously sleazed out direct-to-video sequels that recast Amy Adams in the lead role and aired on Cinemax every other night for the entirety of my high school years (shout out to Roger Kumble, the James Mangold of Adrian Lynes). The second — and perhaps more broadly relevant — aspect that binds those movies together is that Hollywood is currently in the process of remaking each and every one of them.

Some, like Gareth Evans' “A Colt Is My Passport,” are already in the can. Others, like Robert Downey Jr.'s “Vertigo,” are still in the “ominous threat” stage of development. But regardless as to whether they're right over the horizon or still just percolating in a series of cursed email chains, each of these remakes is misbegotten for the same reason: They're all based on objective masterpieces. “But David,” you might say, “isn't one's response to art an inherently subjective experience?” To which I would simply reply: “You are in no way entitled to your own wrong opinion about a movie where Josh Hartnett, Clea DuVall, and Elijah Wood save their high school from salt-phobic aliens while swagged out in late '90s Tommy Hilfiger.” 

 










So I guess that's three things these films all have in common? Whatever, I'm not here to count — I'm here to lend my support to the ongoing argument that Hollywood needs to flip the script on its approach to remakes. In short: Leave good movies alone and devote the same attention to remaking bad ones instead. 

In slightly less short: Forget the IP that people love with all their might, and focus instead on the IP that people recognize against their will. Forego the classics that audiences feel protective towards, and target the short-fallers that are best remembered for their title. In an age where content is king and studios only exist to create shareholder value for their corporate overlords, executives have become so fixated on brand recognition that Disney would sooner bet $200 million — or more! — on another crack at “Tron” than give someone a fraction of that budget to try their hand at something new. The “Jurassic World” franchise notwithstanding, diminishing returns beget diminishing returns, and there's only so many times you can charge people top dollar for reheated leftovers of their favorite childhood meals before they lose their appetite altogether.

But. But! What if you served those same people fresh and completely reformulated versions of the processed garbage they slopped up as kids (or even as grown adults who'd been conditioned not to expect any better)? What if you took the scraps of processed nostalgia, the kind of food that people fondly recall but would never eat again by choice, and challenged today's most inventive chefs to reimagine them for an audience whose palette has been starved of flavor for so long that they've forgotten the taste of a hot meal? If the faint whiff of a memory is all that's motivating people to pay for these movies (as producers and consumers), wouldn't it be more prudent to improve upon the past rather than risk constantly reinforcing the idea that the present is so much worse? 

 










See: Edgar Wright's “The Running Man,” for example. Really, see it! It's not bad! Nor, um, is it a remake. Let's ignore that for a second. The movie — faithfully adapted from the Stephen King novel of the same name, and sharing almost nothing in common with the rancid Arnold Schwarzenegger version that first immortalized the book on film — is 100 percent a mulligan, in that I find it impossible to believe that Paramount would have spent nine figures on adapting this IP if not for the name recognition seeded by the previous take. It doesn't matter that “The Running Man” 1.0 isn't streaming anywhere, or that its limp TV satire of Reagan-era consumerism feels like ancient history, or even that our last remaining scientists are still trying to figure out how a movie featuring Yaphet Kotto, Jesse “the Body” Ventura, and homicidal ice hockey could still be so bland — the only thing that matters is that “The Running Man” as a three-word phrase has retained some vague and unquantifiable purchase over the last several decades. The casual pop consumer's brain recognizes it as “a real thing” in much the same way as the average executive's brain does, even if only by osmosis; for better or worse, it comes to both of them pre-installed with a credibility that original content has to earn on its own terms.

 










A credibility that endures without being hamstrung by any real association to quality. “The Running Man” faces strong headwinds thanks to mediocre reviews and stiff competition at the box office, but — unlike “The Roses,” “The Hand that Rocks the Cradle,” “Road House,” or any number of the actual remakes that have been foisted upon us in recent months —the film will at least be spared the indignity of being judged against the impossible standards of its predecessor. Even the people who love Schwarzenegger's “The Running Man” don't really like Schwarzenegger's “The Running Man,” which is what gave Wright license to stick closer to the source material while also cheating it forward to be more relevant to the modern world. 

In stark contrast to Hollywood's updated versions of “Robocop,” “Point Break,” and “The Day the Earth Stood Still” (to pick literally the first three movies that jumped to mind, all of them built on the reputations of unassailable classics), it's clear that Wright was committed to preserving the raw edges of his film's story rather than sanding them down, and even the least successful elements of his “Running Man” are strengthened by a sociopolitical anger that's rare to find in modern studio films of its size. Had the previous film made from King's book not been such an ineffective piece of satire, it's possible that a corporation as odious as Paramount Skynet — whose allegiance to The Network grows clearer every day — would never have rubber-stamped such an unambiguous “fuck you” to David Ellison's friends in our government. 

 










Of course, there are only so many bad movies that are ripe to be remade; only so many movies that are famous enough to feel like safe investments, but also flawed enough to guarantee that Hollywood executives will feel like creative geniuses for improving upon them. Hollywood has acted upon very few of them. David Lowery's “Pete's Dragon” is one obvious choice; Steven Soderbergh's “Ocean's Eleven” perhaps a slightly more contentious pick. 

Again, there's a reason why the movie that felt best-suited as a peg for this article isn't actually a remake, although I suppose I could have waited a few weeks for Sony Pictures' new “Anaconda,” which sounds like a perfect test for what I'm talking about despite being framed as more of a meta reboot; no one has any particular attachment to the original (much as I'd argue that no movie where Jon Voight gets swallowed alive by a giant snake could ever be considered truly bad), but its title carries an ineffable weight of some kind, and the comforting familiarity it triggers is deepened by the sense that a new “Anaconda” is more likely to build on our collective memory of the old one than to tarnish it. Typically, however, remakes have only been made as backhanded compliments by directors who've seen room for improvement in their own work: Think Alfred Hitchcock revisiting “The Man Who Knew Too Much,” or Michael Mann evolving “L.A. Takedown” into “Heat,” or Yasujiro Ozu turning “A Story of Floating Weeds” into just “Floating Weeds” (it's cleaner). 

 










More often, successful remakes have been created from beloved source material by people who had no previous relationship to it, but even these are few and far between. “Cape Fear.” “The Thing.” “Dawn of the Dead.” Many interesting attempts (“Nightmare Alley”) and most abominations (Rupert Wainright's “The Fog,” Len Wiseman's “Total Recall”) fall under this category. And then of course — with perhaps the highest hit-rate — there are those instances when people have seen the opportunity to rejigger a foreign-language film for an English-speaking audience (“The Departed,” “Sorcerer,” and Luca Guadagnino's “Suspiria,” which is not bad, as you might have mistakenly been led to believe, but in fact very good). At a time when most young people refuse to watch a video clip of Theo Von's podcast without having subtitles on, however, the transliteration model may not have the same currency that it once did (though widespread exposure to “Save the Green Planet!” is sadly not to blame for the underwhelming box office of “Bugonia”). 

Bad remakes of good movies are constant, bad remakes of bad movies are statistically non-existent, good remakes of good movies are almost impossible, and so — by process of elimination in an industry that only considers making original shit under extreme duress — good remakes of bad movies are Hollywood's greatest fount of untapped potential this side of video game adaptations and seeing what might happen if you gave Ridley Scott a kilo of cocaine. 

 










And the sooner the powers that be make this seachange in their thinking, the better. I mean, we simply cannot afford to do another “Starship Troopers” while millions of people on Twitter are still failing to grasp the point of the original. But a new “Hackers” where Jenna Ortega or whatever leads a team of roller-blading computer nerds who steal billions in ill-gotten crypto from the president's large adult sons? That's a hit. “Conspiracy Theory” for the era of virulent rightwing message boards? You wouldn't even have to recast Mel Gibson. “Romeo Must Die” with Andrew Koji and Junglepussy? I'm just saying things now. “Tango & Cash” but it's the Apple Dance and Tap-to-Pay? Amazing. Everyone knows the future is going to be bad. But given the most plausible options left available to us, perhaps it's possible that bad might be our best hope for something better.

When filmmaker Alex Bush received their acceptance to Ari Aster and Lars Knudsen's Square Peg Social (SPS), something shifted. “Just being accepted felt like a huge weight of confidence,” said Bush, whose short film “Thaw” premiered at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival. “It was really affirming to be spoken to by these people in this way of, ‘Yeah, so you as someone who's going to be doing this and who's already doing this.'” You're already doing this is the shift from feeling adjacent to the industry to being recognized as part of it. That can make SPS sound like ruby slippers — You've always had the power, my dear!  To the naked eye, they did and do; the 35 selected SPS filmmakers are uncommonly accomplished. Eli Raskin produced Doechii's Grammy-winning world tour. Haley Johnson recently produced “Obsession,” the horror pic that premiered at TIFF and was acquired by Focus Features. Sally Oh won a Grammy for her work on Beyoncé's “Black Is King.” Alexandre Singh & Natalie Musteata just won AFI Fest's Grand Jury Prize for “Two People Exchanging Saliva,” a short they're now adapting as their debut feature. Nigerian-American filmmaker Boma Iluma is a director for “The Chi.” Hawaiian filmmaker Oz Go founded Narrative Lost, a nonprofit studio making socially engaged films; his short “Antyesti” made the rounds with SPS mentors as each asked the other, “Have you seen this?!” “Roofman” producer and SPS mentor Alex Orlovsky said the filmmakers' accomplishments were startling. “There's [Jamie Hawkesworth]. He's like, “I made a short film.' Oh, who shot it? ‘Robbie Ryan.' I was like, ‘Oh. How'd you do that?' ‘He liked my book of photography.'” Orlovsky chuckled. “I said, ‘Yes, you must be a good photographer.' And there's [Wesley Wang], who was a senior at Harvard who had made a viral short (“nothing, except everything.”) and then had a script, and he's like, ‘I got to go back to school.' Whoa. That's crazy. But awesome. And I'm super curious to read the guy's script.” (Take a look at the full list of participants below.) However, all of that goes to show at least two things: A significant degree of the event's success stemmed from Lars and Amy Knudsen's calibration of who should attend, as filmmakers and mentors, to ensure it held value for everyone. And, impostor syndrome is as universal to the human experience as oxygen. Recognizing that and learning how to move beyond it is essential because, as Lars noted in his opening remarks, confidence creates momentum. And momentum makes films.

SPS brought 26 writer-directors and 9 producers to Austin in late October for four days with 27 industry mentors. (Mentor list, here.) Co-hosted by Square Peg partner Ari Aster and the Knudsens, the event deliberately avoided conventional outcomes: no pitch meetings, no development sessions, no financing goals. The gathering challenged what Grant Conversano identified as “the Sundance myth of ‘You're going to submit, then you're going to get in, and it's like everything's on wheels after that,'” a mythology that creates “a certain selfishness.”  Instead, SPS emphasized community over competition. It operated on the theory that bringing together excellent mentors and impressive filmmakers to share the unvarnished good and bad of their experiences would produce its own value. The mentors' candor about failures, mistakes, and “very bad experiences” created what participants described as uniquely productive conversations. But what did the filmmakers themselves take away? What was worth the application fee and four days in Austin?

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






The application fee was $150, although some paid less if they applied earlier. For Joshua Locy, whose his first feature “Hunter Gatherer” debuted at SXSW in 2016, the cost felt substantial. “So many of my shorts, all these things, and they're all like fucking 70, 80 bucks,” he said. “I've spent thousands of dollars on submissions with a 10% success rate, something like that.”

 










He nearly didn't apply, but when he saw an extended deadline he thought there was lower interest and he stood a better shot. “I was like, fuck it, I'm going to do it.” (Later, he learned deadline extensions are standard practice.) The application itself asked for passion over polish. “They said, write a cover letter, be passionate. We're not looking for perfection. And I just fucking unloaded. I didn't even reread it. I just sent it. It took five minutes to write the letter.” Nearly 1,800 people applied. Thirty-five were selected.

The advice that landed hardest was often the simplest. “Trust your gut. It's incredible how often that comes up,” Bush said. “That's how a lot of these people who've had lasting careers, it seems, operate.” Bush described watching their own past work validate this principle: “When we look at even the careers we've had so far, that's true. It's that innate feeling when you're working on something you're like, ‘Oh, there it is.' Those are the ones that work out. The ones that you kind of force and maybe don't listen to the gut tension, tend to lead you astray.” Bush also emphasized the importance of ensuring everyone involved is “talking about the same thing” from the beginning, particularly “when you're really getting into the nitty gritty with the more complicated people who are not just in it for the spirit.” Translation: Your financier might love your project. They also might also think it's a completely different movie than the one you're making. Better to find that out early.

For Locy, who has worked in film for 20 years as a commercial production designer, Square Peg Social functioned differently. “For me, it's been like a chiropractic realignment,” he said. “It's just like, ‘Wait, the things you're doing are worthy and they're looking for unique projects.'” After years of pitching on IP-based projects that never happened, hearing Searchlight president Matthew Greenfield discuss how decisions actually get made proved revelatory. “I take a project to a studio or to my manager, whatever, and I hear things like, ‘There's no foreign sales' or ‘There's no value in the actor,' whatever. So then I think my problem is foreign sales.” But Greenfield reframed it entirely: “We think that their brains are operating on spreadsheets, but they're reacting humanly and viscerally to what they're hearing. And maybe at some point that gets trickled down to us as foreign sales but he's saying, ‘No, it's not about that.'” The insight shifted Locy's entire approach. “I don't need to worry about fucking foreign sales. I don't need to worry about algorithms that decide what a value of a project is. I need to worry about my voice and the story I'm trying to tell. That's what's important.” Which is both liberating and terrifying. Because it means the work is actually about the work.

 










Brothers Grant and Adam Conversano arrived feeling the uncertainty many emerging filmmakers share about traditional paths. “I think people are collectively feeling like that old path is disappearing,” Grant said. “And I think what's been great about this weekend is it's presenting a road forward for people in our generation. We're just forging ahead and doing it.”

 










They brought with them advice from filmmaker Ira Sachs, who had seen their short film: “You don't need to get into another lab, you need to find a producer. You get a budget, you get an actor. Do not waste your time for a year applying to applications and waiting around. You need a producer, an actor, and some money. And if it's not a lot of money, do that. But don't sit around waiting.” That urgency — just make the thing! — came with crucial caveats about sustainable budgets. As Grant noted, “The story and the scope of the project has to match the resources. I've worked on features where they may be trying to do too much for too little and just driving people into the ground. And that's not great for anyone. I think that people don't want to do that anymore.” The Conversanos also valued what Adam called “mentorship and face-to-face passing of experience and information that's only possible. Mentorship is just another layer of encouragement and belief that you can do this: ‘I've done this and I'll support you through that.'” Keep Writing (Even When Nothing's Getting Made) Grant Conversano took away the importance of “just keep writing and not get too concerned with when any particular script is getting made. Hearing Ari say ‘I had four or five scripts I've been working on for years before he even got Hereditary made' was big.” He also emphasized starting wherever possible: “If you don't know a lot of people and you feel like the industry's really far away, just start somewhere. I started as an extra, then worked as a PA. You have to be useful to other people for some amount of time and put in the time. We've been working for 10 years, just to be clear.”

Perhaps most telling was Locy's observation about finding common ground across experience levels: “You kind of always have to start over. You always have to reinvent yourself. I made — for the first time in my life, really — a short film last year where I was like, I have to make something. I have to pierce through this diaphragm somehow.” He continued: “I may have more contacts and networks and this or that, but at the end of the day, we're all just trying to make our movie and it's impossible until it's not.” That impossibility fuels what Locy described as essential: “There's a certain mental severity, I guess. This clarity and severity and focus that wanes and waxes as good news, bad news happens, or money is here, money is gone. It is just like life happens that hope and faith that comes and goes.” When asked if he'd ever reached a point where he'd consider giving up on features, Locy was definitive: “I don't know what that means. There's no way I could live my life without the hope of making something.” Locy also described what drove him to make his first film over a decade ago: “‘No one's ever done this movie before. This has never existed before and it's going to exist.' That was enough.” It's still enough.

 










What Square Peg Social offered wasn't formulas or shortcuts, but something more fundamental: confirmation that the struggle is shared, that intuition matters, that starting over is normal, and that the community exists if you can find it.  As Bush put it, the goal was understanding “how development is really working and how relationships are really built that lead to that type of work” and “to feel like we're in this together and we can keep helping each other and really set those relationships.” The $150 bought entry to that conversation.

Comparisons to Abbas Kiarostami and David Lynch set a high bar for filmmaker Alireza Khatami, an Iranian who now lives in Canada, and his masterful “The Things You Kill” at Sundance. This unsettling thriller about impotent (emotionally, literally) university professor Ali (Turkish star Ekin Koç), on the path to vengeance after the suspicious death of his mother, scored strong reviews (including my own) and the World Cinema Directing Award out of the Utah festival. 

It now represents Canada in the 2026 Best International Feature race and is undoubtedly one of the most formally bold works in foreign Oscar contention. What appears on its head as a social-realist drama in the vein of, say, Asghar Farhadi, takes a sharp hairpin turn in the second half, upending its own premise when the professor confronts an enigmatic gardener who may be an extension of himself, and his own worst impulses. Meanwhile, a key cast member is swapped to a destabilizing effect as Ali's world comes crashing down.

Khatami, with his second solo directing effort after collaborating with director Ali Asgari on “Terrestrial Verses” and this year's “Divine Comedy,” has made a film so personal that he's been reluctant to show it to his own family. That the professor is named Ali, and the gardener Reza, tells you right away what you need to know about a movie directed by a man named Alireza in terms of personal intentions.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“One of my sisters went to a festival, without telling me, to watch it, and that was emotional,” Khatami told IndieWire over Zoom. “I begged her not to tell anybody else. If my family sees it, they will recognize everything. Even the names [of Ali's sisters] Nesrin and Meriam … [are the names] of two of my siblings. Anybody who sees this movie who knows me on an intimate level. The core of this movie is 100 percent based on truth.”

In “The Things You Kill,” Ali is constantly being challenged not only by his geriatric wreck of a mother, but also his wife, and his two sisters, crushing further on him the burden of masculinity and father-son expectations inherent to Muslim tradition. But did his father kill Ali's mother?

“There is this dialogue in the film where the wife asks Ali, ‘Did your mom tell you bedside stories?' And he says, ‘She didn't like bedside stories. She liked puzzles.' To me, this movie is about a man's narrative being challenged by several female narratives. His narrative has to adjust, has to break down and be rebuilt, and get some element of the feminine narrative in the process,” Khatami said.

That Ali might be in pursuit of killing his father Hamit (Ercan Kesal), who has a history of domestic violence, scared off the Iranian censorship board. But not Khatami from making the film, hence the shift to production in Turkey.

 










“The government was like, ‘This cannot be made.' Everywhere in the world, old men are in power, so you don't want to symbolically kill them in the movie, so they didn't want the father figure to die in the movie. They were telling me, ‘Send him traveling. He goes on a trip and comes back at the end.' Which I didn't want to do. Also, I didn't want to make a movie that is ‘shot illegally.' I've done that before. I don't want to do it. This is a movie that I wanted to really care about every detail. I didn't want to shoot it under the ground with non-actors. I wanted professional actors, I wanted to have a movie that lasts, not a movie that makes noise. That's why I took it to Turkey,” Khatami said.

His last film, “Terrestrial Verses,” a nine-vignette mosaic about the petty bureaucracies of working-class life in Iran, was shot in secret. “I'm familiar with that kind of filmmaking, but it doesn't excite me. The movie, of course, people go, ‘Oh my god, the movie's shot illegally.' There is no value to that for me,” Khatami said. “Yes, some festivals will love you for doing that, but the movie needs to last. For me, politics is capital P. … Of course, Islamophobia sells very well. If you are subtly Islamophobic, you will be well-received in the Cannes competition.”

 










Khatami believes that Telefilm Canada finally supporting his film as the International Feature Oscar selection is a “huge step forward” for BIPOC filmmakers living in Canada. 

“I lived as a refugee in many places before. This is the first time that I have a country that can select a movie of mine. I appreciate Telefilm finally agreeing to let us compete in that selection process,” he said. “There was a little bit of hesitation at the beginning. We went back and forth a lot about the rules and regulations of the Academy, how we are eligible, and finally, Telefilm agreed, and I got a lot of very emotional calls from non-white filmmakers. Some were in tears, who thought they would never select a movie like this. In a way, we broke a barrier for BIPOC filmmakers [in Canada]. Canada is not only interested in the labor of the immigration community; now it finally has embraced their stories as well.”

Part thriller, part moral parable, and part surreal exercise, that “The Things You Kill” is so consistently unpredictable and surprising in its structure, casting, and themes was by design, a way for Khatami to shake up the sleepiness of a lot of modern cinema.

“A few people were surprised by the formal choices we made,” he said of the film's Sundance premiere. “They didn't expect that. I knew there were certain expectations from an ‘Iranian filmmaker' when you make a film in Turkey, so I started the film as a Trojan horse of an Asghar Farhadi movie. People coming to the film think they know the film. When I pull the rug from beneath them, a lot of people who are truly cinephiles are excited to see a bold formal choice, but some people get pissed. ‘Who the hell is he to do that? These kinds of things are supposed to be Gaspar Noé or David Lynch.' But I'm grateful. A lot of people were quite open to the film, and the more time passed, the better reaction we got.”

 










Khatami modeled “The Things You Kill” after the kinds of movies that excite him, the boundary-pushing of say the aforementioned Lynch and Kiarostami, which are not de rigeuer for many of his fellow Iranian filmmakers. (Jafar Panahi's made-in-secret Palme d'Or winner “It Was Just an Accident,” for example, was shot in secret but is also one of the dissident Iranian director's most straightforward narratives.)

“That excites me, a movie that doesn't die. A movie that, OK, it's not easily digestible, he said. “I'm a cinephile at heart. I want to push this to some territory that we haven't discovered yet. What's the point of me having a couple of flashbacks and say, this guy exists or doesn't exist? That's been done many times, so can we push it? A lot of people make films like the cinema is dead, like there is nothing else between my medium shot, your medium shot. Can we do something that is more exhilarating? Of course, there is risk. But that's what keeps me alive. This movie took eight years for me to make. I don't want to make medium shot to medium shot. I want to make a movie that, 20 years later, I watch it and say, ‘That's still watchable.'”

He said that the concept of the film “started as friendship between these two guys [Ali and Reza] and slowly discovering that he's in negotiation with himself. I started experimenting with my own narrative. I started bringing my sisters into it, my mom into it, my dad into it, building the world around it. But every step of the way, I'm always like a child. I'm like, ‘OK, this is the paved path. But what if I step here? What if I try to go and get lost in this area?' And that's always, both as a writer and as a director, exhilarating, right? A lot of people were saying, ‘This will not work.' People get quite confused. But that was exciting for me. I like dwelling in the confused space.”

 










That said, “I wouldn't call it a confusion, but there is a mystery that life is. The capacity to hold the mystery in your hand and say, ‘OK, I'm going to live with this.' As a filmmaker, I'm not afraid of pushing the audience to almost leave, but I don't want them to leave, so I tone back. I don't make experimental films, but I push them to the edge. Still want to leave? I give them something to sit back [for].”

“The Things You Kill” is now in select theaters from Cineverse.

Costume designer Kate Hawley has worked on enough films with Guillermo Del Toro to know which shade of red is Guillermo's. On “Frankenstein,” Hawley heightens the world of the film with operatically bold colors and shapes, taking cues for silhouettes from the 1850s period setting, but ultimately turning Del Toro's adaptation of the Mary Shelley novel into a dream of that period — or, as is sometimes the case in the film, a nightmare. 

Del Toro famously opens up his daily edit sessions to all, so that everyone working on the film can see where they're going, even while they're in production. Hawley told IndieWire that just looking at the way cinematographer Dan Laustsen and Del Toro were framing their shots was like seeing “everything under a magnificent magnifying glass,” reinforcing the level of detail and intensity she and her team were adding to the fabrics of the characters' clothes.

When a film looks “painterly,” Hawley said, as “Frankenstein” often does, it's because camera, production design, costume, hair and makeup, and effects are in lockstep, building off of each other's work and creating a total image with spellbinder texture and cohesion. “What Guillermo and [production designer Tamara Deverell] are working on affects what I do. Then I reflect that back — the imagery, the construction forms; the circle's a motif that is repeated within the silhouettes of the costumes, the colors that we use,” Hawley said. 

 










The colors are quite particular — especially the red that ties Victor (Oscar Isaacs) and Elizabeth (Mia Goth) together, through his mother Claire (also Mia Goth, don't unpack that). “We had played with brighter reds for the apartment scene, but actually the darker reds that we used on Elizabeth's visceral blood dress… that worked tonally. So then I have to understand what the lighting's doing and what that's going to do for color,” Hawley said.  

Hawley and Del Toro toiled to figure out how the actors would reshape their performances once in costume. It's really the first moment for performers, designers, and director, who have all been in isolation with the script, to begin the collaborative process. 

“We'd have fittings, and Guillermo would be there; [Goth] would just be exploring how she was going to move in this world. Half the time, you've got to let silence happen and let the actor just be with it,” Hawley said. “There's always so much noise, you know? ‘Put this on. Do this.' Actually, we allowed some of those fittings to just be rehearsals in themselves.” 

Hawley recalled one such fitting/rehearsal where Del Toro and Goth teased out Elizabeth's presence in the film's world. “We had a pile of, sort of, beetles [sewn into the fabric of the dress], and Mia was exploring movement; she did this beautiful collapse onto the ground, negotiating all this crinoline — this fucking crinoline — and Guillermo was writing. And suddenly we were in the rehearsal of what they were doing with her character.” 

 










Giving that time and that space for character work, even at more technical steps in the process, is key to the total unity of image in “Frankenstein,” according to Hawley. “One big thing I've really learned is that we can all be looking at the same thing but see something very different. So it's listening to what your director sees in something you're showing and … understanding what they're responding to; that's a big part of it. Then, you're growing the character together, and it's a much more cohesive thing,” Hawley said. 

For his part, Del Toro told IndieWire on the Filmmaker Toolkit Podcast that, although he wrote the part of Elizabeth for Goth, they initially had trouble finding the character. “But she came to one of the dress fittings, and she put on one of the dresses, and she said, ‘I understand Elizabeth now.' She became one with the wardrobe in a very strange way that I haven't seen that many times,” Del Toro said. 

Perhaps part of it may be that Elizabeth is a bit like a changing wardrobe in the eyes of the men around her, taking on the personas that they desire. “She's an extraordinary shapeshifter,” Hawley said of Goth. ”In a way, all those characters became fleeting images of women, you know? Through Victor's eyes, she was the image of Mother and then Madonna and Angel, and through the Creature [Jacob Elordi]'s eyes, she becomes different things. She's always these ever-changing, fleeting images of women, memories of them. I can't speak enough to the wonders of her performance. She captured all of these images.” 

 










Capturing all the images was, in a way, the assignment for every department on “Frankenstein,” including the mighty costume branch with workrooms in Toronto, Glasgow, Poland, Spain, other parts of Europe, and a satellite department in Toronto. All the hero fabrics for the film were loomed specifically for “Frankenstein,” and it took a mix of high-tech planning, old-school craft, and elbow grease to create looks for the main characters, the almost superhero special effects needs of the Creature, and the sheer volume of coats needed for the small army of extras. 

“Everyone I know working in this business works every day and really long hours … but what's lovely about the way you work with Guillermo is he adores everybody within those departments, whether they're construction, scenic art, the costume department. He comes around and looks at the work. He puts it onscreen,” Hawley said. “When I saw the film for the first time, as well as just going, ‘Oh my gosh, this happened,' you see how wonderful what every other department was doing and [are] really able to appreciate that seeing how cohesive it was as a whole. And that's Guillermo.”

“Frankenstein” is now streaming on Netflix.

	There's an old internet adage often incorrectly attributed to Nintendo guru Shigeru Miyamoto that goes, “A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad.” Although it's not a genuine quote, the oft-used meme does mostly align with what fans perceive to be the Mario creator's sensibilities — do it right, even if it takes a while.


	What's funny is that Nintendo isn't really known for substantial delays. Famously, the company's creatives have been blunt when it comes to explaining why beloved series like Star Fox and F-Zero have remained on ice for decades at a time: They just don't know what to do with them. Compared to Rockstar or  Ubisoft — hell, most of the industry — it paints a clear picture that if you've even heard of a Nintendo game's existence, it's probably pretty far along in its development cycle.


	Then came Metroid Prime 4. Initially announced way back in 2017 — the same year that the Nintendo Switch launched — the long-awaited sequel to 2007's trilogy capper made a big splash as one of the then-new console's most anticipated titles. But afterward, there was nothing. Two years later, after the internet worked itself into a tizzy, Nintendo officially confirmed that development on the game wasn't up to their standards.

	











	In a shocking twist, the work was going to be restarted from scratch under the eye of Retro Studios, creators of the first three Prime games who had previously handed over the reins to Bandai Namco. The whole thing felt decidedly un-Nintendo-like.

	











	Now, another six years later, the game is nearing completion and is set to launch on Dec. 4 for both Switch and its successor, Switch 2. But after all this time, could it ever live up to the impossible expectations the prolonged delay set in motion? Rolling Stone recently attended a preview event in New York City to go hands-on with Metroid Prime 4's early areas, and the most realistic answer is “maybe?”


	Based on the roughly one-hour demo, here's what we know.

	First released for the GameCube in 2002, and recently remastered in 2023, Metroid Prime reimagined the previously 2D-designed series (that itself kickstarted a whole subgenre) as a fully 3D first-person shooter with a heavy emphasis on exploration. Metroid Prime 4 is technically the sixth installment of the sub-series, which now has as many entries as the mainline games.


	The Prime series are interquels wedged neatly between the original 1986 NES game and 1991's Metroid II for Game Boy. They follow the legendary bounty hunter Samus Aran (who, honestly, doesn't pick up that many bounties) on her continuous missions to aid the Galactic Federation in their ongoing conflict with the Space Pirates. Prime 4 picks up after the trilogy and its handheld spin-offs Hunters (2006) and Federation Force (2016), with the latter two mostly chalking up to footnotes except for the inclusion of the new game's main antagonist, Sylux.


	The demo starts at the very beginning of the game, and is the same content previously shown at the Switch 2 reveal event and other previews. This section sees Samus arriving at a Galactic Federation station to help combat an invasion of pirates led by Sylux, who is seeking a mysterious relic.


	This introductory portion is entirely on-rails, ushering Samus room to room for small incursions while serving as a basic tutorial for her combat abilities and Morph Ball rolling. In most Metroid games, Samus is a loner; the series itself was inspired by Ridley Scott's Alien (1979), meaning that the bounty hunter generally sees herself stranded on an alien planet to survive. Occasionally, certain games will give her support from NPCs via comms, but rarely is she engaging in squad-based warfare.

	That expectation is immediately upended by Prime 4, which similarly to 2007's Prime 3, throws Samus into action alongside space marines for all-out battle. But being a superpowered Amazonian type, towering over the solders in height and physical prowess, she's seen more as a messianic savior than just another grunt.

	











	After this brief sequence that ends in a relatively easy boss fight, the demo jumps ahead past a bunch of exposition and story set up (all of which are under wraps at Nintendo's request). The bulk of the preview takes place on another planet in a region called Fury Green. This lush jungle environment is pretty different from anything seen in other Metroid games, which may have had biomes with vegetation and foliage, but never to this degree.


	It's here where the first genuine look at Metroid Prime 4's gameplay can be gleaned — and it's very familiar. As is the case with all Metroid titles, Samus loses all her high-end abilities from the opening section somewhere between the start and Fury Green. Left with just a base skillset, players will need to explore the labyrinthine world looking for upgrades and tools to use. In Metroid Prime 4, they're mostly based on new psychic powers.


	Like in Prime games past, the first-person perspective allows players to comb the world using a scanning visor, which highlights pertinent information and clues on where to go next. In Prime 4, this is augmented by a Psychic Visor which, paired with the Psychic Glove, lets Samus see invisible trails and objects and manipulate them with a form of telekinesis.


	It mostly works for puzzles; simple ones include unlocking doors with specific sliding nodes, with more complexity coming later as Samus can guide a Control Beam blast through the air like a remote drone. The preview culminates in a big boss fight wherein Samus must whittle away at the plant-like foe's armor then guide her psychic shots into its weak points.


	It's a cool gimmick but doesn't entirely feel revolutionary. In fact, that's an issue that pervades the entirety of the demo.


	In the years since Metroid Prime 4 was originally announced, a lot has changed in gaming. Not only did the entire life cycle of the Switch (its intended home platform) pass by, but first-person shooters and exploration games have evolved. Open world titles like Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018) and a wave of action-RPGs have broadened the horizons on what exploration looks like in modern gaming. In that regard, Prime 4 feels simplistic — though to be fair, the demo only encompasses an early slice of the whole experience. But even by Metroid standards, the areas in Fury Green are extremely linear.

	











	In the series' best entries, like Super Metroid (1994) and the first Prime, players are dropped into sprawling worlds that are mazelike in their design. Filled with competing routes, dead ends, and challenges to return to later, there's a sense that every step is filled with discovery. You'll need to remember the important details to mentally recall and solve the puzzle of the environments themselves.


	Here, most areas barely have more than two or three doors on the high end, and the path is obvious. Had I not stopped to take notes or comb every room for secrets, the demo would've been quick to breeze through, even without any prior experience playing Metroid.


	It's not a new issue; Metroid Prime 3 heavily dumbed down much of the series' complexity to make the game function on the Wii's motion controller, and even 2D titles like Fusion (2002) and Zero Mission (2004) streamlined the exploration with straightforward guidance to fit their handheld platforms.


	In 2021, Metroid Dread brought the franchise back to 2D on Switch, and it felt like a course correction for how easy the games had become post-Prime 2. While not quite the brain buster the early entries were, Dread leaned into its roots as an explorable puzzle in ways that could leave newer players scratching their heads, and its combat was tough as nails.


	Although the full scope of what Prime 4 has to offer remains unknown, what's shown in the preview feels like Nintendo and Retro Studios are playing it safely with a light take on the series' hallmarks. Its pathways are narrow, funneling players between relatively easy enemy encounters and puzzles with obvious solutions.


	Another reversion that, for now, seems ill-advised is pairing Samus up with other characters. A third of the way through the demo, players meet an NPC named Mackenzie, a Galactic Federation technician. Putting it simply, Mackenzie's a dork; a sheepish science guy whose awe of Samus and bumbling demeanor set the duo up as a typical odd couple.


	The first scene with Mackenzie has Samus rescuing him from a horde of aliens, followed quickly by an escort mission — one of the most agonizing cliches in gaming. Their dialogue (or lack thereof on Samus' part) has funny moments. Nintendo has learned that the bounty hunter's most affecting personality trait is remaining a mute goliath who handles nuisances — from chatty scientists to roaring monsters — with annoyed nonchalance. The recurring joke here is that Mackenzie talks a lot and Samus doesn't.

	











	It's hard to say how much of a presence characters like Mackenzie will have in the larger story, but Nintendo learned firsthand how detrimental poorly written NPCs and forced interactions can be with 2010's abysmal Metroid: Other M. That game, which fans would kill to forget, turned the series into a Ninja Gaiden-like third-person action title, but its worst crimes were in the painful dialogue and dumb-as-rocks story. Samus works best when other people are at a distance, and giving her a sidekick, even temporarily, raises some red flags.


	Visually, the game looks nice — with sprawling vistas in the distance when looking beyond the edge of the cliffs and little particle effects filling the air. There's some great lighting, too, with bloom effects and glints of sunbeams peering through Samus' visor, as well as the return of the occasional reflection of her face in the helmet's glass (a detail that blew fans' collective minds back in 2002).


	But despite the pleasantness, there are still some areas where the graphics are lacking. Waterfalls lack complex physics, mostly appearing as flat sheets with some misting to cover up the seams. There's some solid texture mapping across the ground and objects to give the appearance of depth, but it mostly looks like wallpaper. 


	The game runs very smoothly — even hitting up to 120 frames per second in performance mode — but it doesn't feel like much of a leap forward. It's a game that was clearly designed to run on the now-geriatric Nintendo Switch, which results in a game that aesthetically lags behind its Switch 2-exclusive peers like Donkey Kong Bananza.

	Nitpicking aside, it's a small miracle that Metroid Prime 4 exists at all. Arriving after one of the few instances of publicly known developmental hell for Nintendo, the game could've been cancelled outright. Metroid has never been one of the company's best-sellers; it's an IP that they've invested in to keep their hardcore fans happy in between higher grossing fare. But, after all this effort, here's hoping that the full version of Metroid Prime 4 is worth the wait.


Metroid Prime 4: Beyond launches on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 on Dec. 4.

Donald Trump has long insisted that no one cares about America's veterans more than him. He continued to do so while delivering a Veterans Day address from Arlington National Cemetery on Tuesday, claiming his first administration fired “thousands” of government employees — “sick people” and “thieves” — who didn't take care of veterans, only to see them rehired by Joe Biden.


	“We got rid of them,” the president said of his new administration. Trump also praised Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, the Project 2025 architect who is overseeing the administration's cost-cutting spree. “What a good job he's doing, cutting, cutting, cutting,” Trump said.


	The speech came as the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) was struggling through the longest government shutdown in modern history — during which the Republican Party has wasted no time advancing Project 2025 and stripping veterans of their earned disability payments. Trump's VA is also cutting 30,000 employees — many of them service-disabled veterans — after initially planning to cut 80,000 of the “sick people,” as Trump calls them, who are somehow defrauding the system. The cuts come as the department is already hemorrhaging medical professionals, and as the Trump administration has imposed strict hiring limits that prevent replacing those who leave.

	











	Along with gutting federal agencies like the VA, Project 2025 calls for narrowing the list of medical conditions eligible for disability compensation, automating claims decisions, and tying future payments to “work incentives.” Its authors frame these proposals as modernization, but the effect would be to de-rate veterans — to downgrade or deny legitimate claims under the guise of efficiency. Veterans with pending applications could lose eligibility altogether, while those already receiving compensation could see their ratings reduced by algorithm. 

	











	This is all by design, and Trump and his administration are building a case against our veterans with lies. Fraud within the system is exceedingly rare. According to the VA inspector general, few VA fraud cases involve veterans themselves, and most of those are isolated, small-dollar offenses.

	So, what is this really about? It's simple. It's the same thing the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was about, the same thing Trump's so-called Big Beautiful Bill was about. It's about dismantling the U.S. government and diverting trillions of dollars away from veterans, the poor, the uninsured, and other less fortunate Americans — all to enrich a handful of well-connected, Trump-aligned billionaires.


	One Trump-aligned billionaire is Jeff Bezos, whose Washington Post recently published an investigation attacking veterans' benefits and questioning whether veterans deserve them. The Post treats the rare VA fraud outliers as proof the entire structure needs to be torn down, ignoring that the modern VA disability system has expanded precisely because our understanding of service-related injuries — especially toxic-exposure illnesses and post-traumatic stress — has improved.

	Meanwhile, the Trump administration, particularly VA Secretary Doug Collins, is bashing the Post as “fake news” for not running more flattering coverage of Trump's Veterans Day speech. “No one has done more for our great veterans than President Trump,” added Deputy White House Press Secretary Anna Kelly.


	In reality, the Trump administration, led by the president himself, is using veterans as scapegoats to funnel even more money upwards to billionaires — and, coming soon, trillionaires — who leech off government subsidies while pushing the false narrative that other Americans, including veterans, are fraudulently taking advantage of government programs. They should all be ashamed. History will not forget this betrayal — and neither will the veterans of this nation.

	The man who rushed at and grabbed Ariana Grande during a Wicked: For Good event in Singapore has been charged with being a public nuisance.


	According to The Straits Times (one of Singapore's leading newspapers) Johnson Wen, a 26-year-old Australian, appeared in a district court Friday, Nov. 14, via video. Wen reportedly appeared unrepentant about the incident, but still said that he planned to plead guilty to the charge. His next court date is scheduled for Nov. 17. 


	Wen could face up to three months in jail, a S$2,000 fine (about $1,500 U.S. dollars), or both. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Wen is a self-proclaimed “stage invader” who goes by the handle @Pyjamamann on social media and calls himself “troll most hated” in his bio. He's garnered some infamy for getting past security at live music and sporting events, including concerts by Katy Perry, the Weeknd, and the Chainsmokers. He also stormed the field at the 2023 Women's World Cup Final, while his Instagram includes videos of public disruptions at libraries, food courts, and on public transit. 

	











	At the Nov. 13 Wicked: For Good premiere in Singapore, Wen was captured on video jumping the security barricades while Grande and her costars were walking the carpet. He appeared to aggressively grab Grande and pull her into an embrace. Cynthia Erivo could be seen shoving Wen away from Grande and checking that she wasn't hurt.

	In the video Wen shared of the incident, he wrote, “Dear Ariana Grande Thank You for letting me Jump on the Yellow Carpet with You ❤️.” His bio also includes the short line: “Ariana Grande is the Queen.” 

	











	The incident will likely make security even more of a concern at the last remaining Wicked: For Good events ahead of its Nov. 21 release. Prior to Singapore, Grande told fans she would have to miss the Brazil premiere due to flight delays beyond her control, prompting a wave of over-the-top reactions from some disappointed fans. Grande was forced to respond in a now-expired Instagram Story statement: “Please don't wish danger on us. We did everything we could and I promise you no one is more upset than I am, I promise. No matter how upset or disappointed you are, please please do not wish danger on us or assume that we didn't try.”

	With her nose ring, blue hair streaks, and tattoos that extend from her shoulders to her fingertips, DJ Tori is, in the words of her boss, “every guy's fantasy of what a rock chick would look like.” In that regard, she's the logical personality to crank Pearl Jam, Shinedown, or Stabbing Westward songs during her overnight and weekend shifts at a hard-rock radio station in Hiawatha, Iowa.


	Every so often, Tori will mispronounce the name of the vintage alt-rock band Live — so that it rhymes with “give” — or talk about a pairing of artists and say “feat” instead of “featuring.” But her listeners and her station, KFMW Rock 108, just roll with it, since DJ Tori isn't likely to get fired anytime soon. From her image to her voice, she's an entirely AI creation.


	AI continues to infiltrate the music business: Fake photos of aging rockers in hospitals flood Facebook, artificial bands like Velvet Sundown are streaming on Spotify, and a computer-generated R&B artist, Xania Monet, has a song that's charting. Radio — especially nonsatellite terrestrial stations in whatever city or town you live — is now becoming the next artificial frontier. And depending on whom you ask, AI radio will either ramp up the wattage in a struggling medium or imperil jobs, livelihoods, and the long-standing rapport between listeners and DJs. “The one thing they haven't straightened out is the cadence and how we speak,” says Frankie Ross, a longtime DJ currently at the Wave in Los Angeles. “But AI is learning every day, and once they get that worked out, there will be a lot of people out of work long term. It may come down to all the DJs on the air will be AI jocks.”

	











	DJ Tori, which launched last year, is just one of many examples of the way AI has begun creeping into radio or radio-like sites. On Spotify, DJ X roams your queue and compiles playlists and patter aimed at your listening habits. Last year, Will.i.am launched RAiDiO.FYI, an interactive app with 10 music channels and AI hosts who can “converse” with listeners on a variety of topics. “I don't want to render radio obsolete, because you still need traditional radio,” Will.i.am tells Rolling Stone. “We still need humans telling human stories. We still need improv and human banter on what's happening in a city. But you also need the new. On traditional radio, one person could talk to the host at a time. With our radio, you can have 1,000 conversations at the same time about one segment.”

	Last month, radio industry veterans announced the startup of SonicTrek.ai, where AI versions of genre experts will play and talk about classic rock, country, alternative rock, or current hits, with geographically oriented playlists to boot. Those hosts' voices will also chat about local weather and businesses. “We're not trying to pull the wool over anybody's eyes,” says SonicTrek.ai co-founder Mike Agovino. “We wear AI on the sleeve from the get-go. We will deliver talent and content that can interact with listeners on a one-to-one basis, and do it 24/7, 365 days a year, with unlimited endurance. You could never do that with live air talent. You could never have the audience interacting all day long, talking about artists, eras of music, best albums ever, whatever the topic or format might be. That's an element radio has really lost.”


	In the past few decades, the once-mighty radio world has increasingly had to deal with declining revenue, layoffs (at leading companies like iHeartRadio and Audacy), and the advent of voice tracking, in which DJs in one city pretape segments in another, thus saving the companies dollars. The advent of AI has rattled the radio community even further. In a document shared with Rolling Stone, Audacy — which owns more than 200 stations around the country — asked an undetermined number of on-air employees to sign a contract that would give the company the rights, “in perpetuity,” to create “a computer-generated electronic representation or digital replica that is readily identifiable as the voice or visual likeness of Employee,” among other things. Audacy declined to comment, but according to a source close to the situation, it is “not the company's policy to clone or replicate a talent's voice without their permission, and the company has no plans to do so without their specific permission.” (SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents disc jockeys as well as actors, singers, dancers, and other performing professionals, declined comment on the matter.)

	AI is “gimmicky right now, but it's on its way to becoming a threat,” says one veteran DJ who, like many contacted by Rolling Stone, would only speak anonymously for fear of reprisals. “Until people start legitimately losing jobs, they're just putting it in the background of their minds. But when you focus on it, it's really scary.”


	SEVERAL YEARS AGO, HUDSON HOTT, then a leading DJ at the L.A. rock station Alt 98.7, received an unsolicited letter offering to turn her personality and traits into AI versions. She never followed up, but others saw the potential. The generally acknowledged first AI DJ launched two years ago, when Ashley Elzinga, a jock at a station in Traverse City, Michigan, was approached about replicating her voice with AI for KBFF in Portland, Oregon. After being reassured that the technology wasn't meant to replace her — “it was just meant to enhance what we were doing,” she says — Elzinga signed on.

	











	With the help of RadioGPT from Futuri, a leading AI content company, Elzinga began reading prompts and was asked questions by the company's software. “It was kind of intense,” she says. “It wanted to hear the inflection of my voice and my personality, and it started to generate who I was. From there, it was about fine-tuning each inflection and how I say words. My first reaction was, ‘Why does it sound like that?' And they had to tell me, ‘You have a Michigan accent.' It was a bit of a shock.”


	When AI Ashley debuted in the summer of 2023  — during a midday show, with both the real and AI Elzinga sometimes on the air at the same time — Elzinga says she knew she might get “bloodied up” as the first pioneer, and she wasn't wrong. “You can't replicate the human touch and spontaneity,” says Hott. “When I was doing my show in Los Angeles and we had an earthquake, I was live on the air, and the building was shaking and I'm screaming. For anyone driving in their car, we were all experiencing that together. AI Ashley is going to keep talking.” But when AI Ashley gave away tickets to a Portland concert, those tuning in didn't seem to mind. “They were excited, like they were talking to a radio personality,” says Elzinga. “They were like, ‘I got through and won something.' They thought it was cool.”


	The same company that worked on AI Ashley also reached out to Russ Mottla, program director at Iowa's KFMW Rock 108, who was intrigued and heard a sample of how a female AI jock could sound. “The first attempts were awful,” he says. “She was very robotic.”


	But after some tweaks, DJ Tori — name courtesy of Mottla — improved and premiered last year, spewing factoids about bands and records and spouting saucy banter. “I wasn't delusional about it,” Mottla says. “Is it ready to be prime time? It's not. But it gave us the opportunity to talk about something everybody's talking about — ‘We have an AI DJ too' — and make promos making fun of her. As far as our audience is concerned, we're on a new trend. Some people like it. Some people don't. But we're claiming the position, as they say.” A local gun shop, Midwest Shooting, became an on-air sponsor and even hosted an appearance by DJ Tori in the store — a photo of “her” attached to a mannequin. As Mottla insists, “We're not hiding anything from the audience. We're having fun with it.”


	In their defense, those who've turned to AI or are experimenting with it on radio argue that it's a remedy for companies and stations that use pretaped or syndicated shows during off hours or can't afford overnight DJs. Before DJ Tori took over “her” slot, that time period on Rock 108 featured music and commercials but no DJ. “There are fewer and fewer shifts done live,” says veteran New York-area DJ Dennis Elsas, who hosts shows on SiriusXM and WFUV, a noncommercial public station. “More often than not, the overnight time after midnight is pretaped.”

	











	SonicTrek.ai's Agovino insist his fledgling company's goal, once it gets up and running, isn't to “replace the successful midday jock” but to instead focus on local stations in smaller markets that use satellite feeds or voice tracking to fill up their airtime. “We built this as a strategy for radio stations that have, for whatever their rationale was at the time, drifted away from live and local,” he says. But says another longtime DJ who spoke anonymously in response to SonicTrek's plans, “Smaller cities do use syndicated programs or don't have anyone new to do [shifts], so that's not new. But as the technology improves and as the standards lower over time, we're not far away from something like that being on major stations. It's very upsetting.”


	“They should be freaked out,” Will.i.am says of those in radio who fear the coming of AI. “Because if AI is doing something that a human can do, then why does that have to exist? Only use AI with traditional radio if you cannot execute it with humans.”


	At the same time, others in the industry feel that concerns about the death of the traditional human DJ are premature. “The audience is way more perceptive about subtle changes in personality than you might think,” says talent agent Paul Anderson of Workhouse Media, which represents numerous podcast and radio hosts. “People develop real relationships with their favorite personalities. And when you spend multiple hours a day listening to them while stuck in traffic, you can pick up on all those subtle intonations. If people find out that the storytelling is being done by an AI bot trying to replicate a known personality, the whole thing will fall apart.” Even Mottla, DJ Tori's human boss, acknowledges that: “I can see the guys in the corner offices drooling over this, but people bond with DJs. You can't create that with AI.”

	Some in the radio world took comfort when AI Ashley was yanked from the air earlier this year. According to Dylan Salisbury, the Portland program director overseeing the project at the time, AI Ashley didn't result in “any dramatic lifts or decreases” in ratings. But he felt the time had come to wrap it up after two years. “I think the experiment ran its course,” says Salisbury. “We put it on the air, we were called every name under the sun and stood by what we did, and we got our peers [other stations] to buy into it, at least in some form. I'm glad we tried it. But I don't know if, moving forward, an AI DJ is going to have a place on radio. As a society, we like AI but not when it comes to human connection.”

	











	Then again, no one denies how fast the technology is moving, and how “much more likelife,” in Agovino's words, AI voices now sound. That applies to DJ Tori too. “She sounds so much better now than when she first started,” Mottla says. “If they can make this kind of progress in 24 months, I can't imagine what it's going to be like in another two years.”

VIRAL footage shows a black ring hovering above Disneyland, sparking a range of bizarre theories. 

It has prompted some to claim that aliens know where the so-called Happiest Place on Earth is located.

Footage, seen by the CW affiliate KTLA-TV, shows the ring moving. 

And, Lori Nayahalski, who captured the video, said the black ring wasn't disappearing. 

“Real-life Matrix or just an orchestrated spoof,” she said.

“Even alien knows where the happiest place on earth is,” one chimed.

Disney fans have revealed they've seen the black ring in previous years.

“We were there one year and I thought for sure when I seen it we were under alien invasion attack!!” a Facebook user said. 

Disneyland officials have since confirmed what the black ring was. 

Pyrotechnics were tested before the park opened.


						FOR decades, UFOs and aliens were considered to be make belief things created by people in tinfoil hats but they are now considered a threat to national security.					

Long gone are those who claim conspiracy theories are all false as many are now discussed at the highest levels of government with US officials even admitting their existence.

As more and more credible witnesses continue to come forward to tell their extraordinary stories publicly.

The 2010s saw decades of stigmas around extraterrestrial life start to break down as politicians made UFO sightings a matter of national security.

Across the world, governments have also unveiled some spooky truths with some even showcasing “dead alien corpses” on display for Congress.

Researchers verified the legitimacy of a set of three-fingered mummies as potential evidence of “non-human” life forms.

The Pentagon also released a blockbuster 1,574 pages of real-life X-Files in 2022, related to its secretive UFO programme.

The haul includes reports into research on the biological effects of UFO sightings on humans, sets out categorisations for paranormal experiences, and studies into sci-fi-style tech.

Top UFO chief Sean Kirkpatrick told the world last year that he is set to step down from his job following his stern warning of concerning activity “in our backyard.”

The Pentagon‘s UFO analysis office launched a UFO reporting service to the public after admitting to uncovering “some things” and calling the high number of suspicious activity either a foreign power or aliens.

Navy jet footage has revealed the intriguing images of a government-confirmed UFO baffling the internet.

The United States Government launched the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in 2022 to investigate reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

CHARLESTON, WV (LOOTPRESS) – Halloween may be over, but a spine-tingling spirit lives on in the hills and valleys of West Virginia as the state-wide Paranormal Trail remains open through the end of the year. Brave travelers can continue their daring exploration of 21 haunted sites across the Mountain State while claiming exclusive rewards for their courage.

“Don't let the change of the season keep you inside,” said West Virginia Tourism Secretary Chelsea Ruby. “From guided mystery tours to interactive museums, there are endless West Virginia adventures that can be enjoyed all autumn long. I'm thrilled to welcome visitors from all over the world to experience some of the state's most haunted hidden gems.”

Before extraterrestrial rovers are sent to outer space, they undergo rigorous mechanical and mobility testing to ensure they can handle the new terrain. These tests aim to simulate the sand, rocks and slopes of planets, to ensure the rovers can be remotely controlled successfully. 

The gravitational pull is six times weaker on the moon than on Earth. Engineers have traditionally accounted for this difference in gravity by creating prototypes that are one-sixth the mass of an actual rover.  

Dan Negrut, a professor of mechanical engineering at UW–Madison, and his collaborators have discovered that these past tests have missed one key terrain detail, which impacts a rover's success – the impact of the Earth's gravity on sand.

Their findings, first publicized in July 2025 and published in the Journal of Field Robotics, have drawn national attention in the past few months. News outlets like NBC News and ScienceDaily have praised the team for drawing attention to a long-overlooked issue in rover design and testing.

“In retrospect, the idea is simple: We need to consider not only the gravitational pull on the rover but also the effect of gravity on the sand to get a better picture of how the rover will perform on the moon,” Negrut says. “Our findings underscore the value of using physics-based simulation to analyze rover mobility on granular soil.”

Using computer simulation, Negrut and his team have proven that the Earth's gravity pushes down on the sand beneath a rover much more than previously thought. 

The sand on the Earth's surface is rigid, holding firm underneath the treads of a moving rover. However, on the moon, the weaker gravity leads to a less firm or “squishy” surface of sand, which can cause rovers to lose traction or get stuck. 

The study, titled “A Study Demonstrating That Using Gravitational Offset to Prepare Extraterrestrial Mobility Missions Is Misleading,” confirms that decades of rover testing on Earth may have led to overly optimistic performance predictions.

The team's discovery came from combining two tools. 

Negrut and his team used a simulation of the NASA-funded VIPER Rover and a physics-based engine called ProjectChrono. Chrono, developed at UW-Madison in collaboration with scientists from Italy, helped researchers to model the complex situation of a rover moving on an unstable surface like the terrain of the moon. 

This discovery has implications beyond improving extraterrestrial rovers, said Negrut. 

ProjectChrono, the modeling engine used to simulate the rover on the surface of the moon, has applications in robotics and mechatronic systems, and can even be used to simulate three-dimensional shapes for collision detection. 

More importantly, Chrono is free and available to the public, leading to the possibility of more users putting its simulation abilities to good use.

While no official changes to NASA's rover-testing protocols have been announced, Negrut and his team are committed to improving the software to stay applicable for future challenges.

“It's very unusual in academia to produce a software product at this level,” Negrut says. “There are certain types of applications relevant to NASA and planetary exploration where our simulator can solve problems that no other tool can solve, including simulators from huge tech companies, and that's exciting.”

In the five years since Supernatural went silent after a staggering 15-season run, Jared Padalecki has poured himself into his fair share of other roles. First, it was bringing an iconic ‘90s series back with a twist in The CW's Walker, a job he followed up as an executive producer on a prequel series titled Walker: Independence. After his time as a gritty man of the law was given the axe by the network, the Gilmore Girls alum moved onto a guest spot in CBS' smash hit series, Fire Country, in a role that audiences had hoped would turn into a spin-off of its own. And, although there may not be a Camden Casey-centered offshoot anytime soon, CBS isn't quite done with Padalecki just yet, as a recent report reveals the writers' room has officially opened on a new medical drama that would feature the star in a leading role. 

So far, we know that the series will see Padalecki return to his recent rootin' tootin' Texan roots where he'll play a doctor who doesn't always play by the book. Loved by the community, Padalecki's medical professional runs a mobile clinic to better reach those who have been turned away by regular care providers. Accompanying him on his quest for good health for all is a young doctor who, according to the official logline, is “escaping her past.”

In addition to starring, Padalecki will also serve the untitled project, which was announced as a possibility for the network earlier this year, as an executive producer alongside its writer, Anna Fricke. The title falls under Padalecki's first-look producing deal with the studio, while Fricke holds an overall deal as well. Fricke's Pursued by a Bear banner backs the production, with the company's Laura Terry executive producing and CBS Studios producing. The procedural serves as a reunion between the Supernatural alum and Fricke, as they previously worked alongside one another during Walker's four-season run.

Padalecki seems to be following in the footsteps of his Supernatural co-star, Jensen Ackles, when it comes to the roles he's going after. Ackles, who appeared as the older brother to Padalecki's character in the demon hunting TV show, recently appeared in Prime Video's Countdown, a fast-paced drama overflowing with explosive action. Sadly, the project was canned after just one season, but Ackles has stayed busy working alongside Justin Hartley on the set of the third season of Hartley's CBS series, Tracker. With Padalecki's medical production on the same network, maybe a crossover will be in store for the characters down the line. In the meantime, fans can expect to see the duo reunite with their fellow Supernatural pal, Misha Collins, on the upcoming final season of Prime Video's The Boys.

Stay tuned to Collider for more about Padalecki's newest project.

Two brothers follow their father's footsteps as hunters, fighting evil supernatural beings of many kinds, including monsters, demons, and gods that roam the earth.

This year marks the 20th anniversary of the CW show Supernatural, and the 5th year since the last episode aired. Naturally, Funko is marking the occasion with new Pops. The first one on the list comes from season 14 of the show, when Dean Winchester was taken and possessed as the vessel for the archangel Michael. Lucky fans will get a Chase featuring Dean/Michael in a butcher's apron. The drop also includes Death (complete with Scythe), Bobby Singer, and Crowley on his King of Hell throne. 

Want more like this? Get the latest drops, ratings, reviews, and more with the ComicBook Gear Review newsletter — straight to your inbox.

For longtime fans of the longtime series, these new Funko drops keep the fandom flame burning until the inevitable reunion happens. Pre-orders are now available here at Entertainment Earth but not on Amazon at the time of writing. Keep tabs on this Amazon page just in case they show up. Direct links and a gallery of images can be found below, and look for them to arrive on your doorstep in January 2026. 

If you were hoping for more Supernatural adventures, you're in luck. Just in time for the 20th anniversary, Dynamite Entertainment announced back in July that the adventures of Sam and Dean Winchester  will continue in a new comic book series that launched in October 2025. 

Interestingly enough, the new comic series is supposed to take place between season 1 and season 2 and considering that those Supernatural seasons were bridged by a cliffhanger, and Season 2 Episode 1 picked up directly where the events of the finale left off, it's going to be interesting to see where they fit in a new story. But comic books tend to have different ways of tackling the canon, so all that logic could be thrown right out the window. We'll just have to see what they're cooking up for Dean and Sam.

Andrew Daniels and John Gilpatrick discuss how scientists saw a man move a magnetic field with his mind—then the government classified it.



What if your mind could do more than just think? What if it could manipulate the world around you?



That's the idea behind one of Pop Mech's most compelling recent stories, “The CIA Watched Him Bend Reality With Just His Mind—Then Tried to Turn His Consciousness Into a Weapon.” 

In 1972, an artist named Ingo Swann allegedly altered the magnetic field in a sealed vacuum chamber just by thinking about it. That event led to one of the most surreal programs in U.S. government history: Project Stargate.

Watch Pop Mech's Andrew Daniels and John Gilpatrick unpack the strange origins of Stargate, the Cold War paranoia that fueled it, and the CIA's mission to train “psychic spies” who could see across time and space through a technique called remote viewing. 

Andrew and John break down how the tests were run under ultra-secret conditions, and how the government tried—and maybe succeeded?—at unlocking human consciousness as a tool for intelligence gathering.

An early chunk of Prime 4 gameplay showcases exciting new psychic abilities that feel right at home in Samus's suite of powers.

By 
    Steve Watts
   on November 14, 2025 at 6:33AM PST

It has been 18 long years since the last Metroid Prime. Nintendo has not produced one since Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, so the question lingering over the announcement of Prime 4 has been: Does anyone still know how to make one of these? A lengthy hands-on ahead of its release in December reassured me that Retro Studios has the look and feel of Metroid Prime well in-hand, but more importantly, has its objective marker set on expanding the world with new psychic powers that feel just as natural as Samus's other abilities.

Our first taste of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, playable at the debut event for the Switch 2 itself, was composed of an initial tutorial section--an action spectacle as Samus comes to the aid of Federation forces under assault. That initial mission was meant to be a showpiece for both the game and the new hardware, and I walked away suitably impressed. This second hands-on event took place shortly after that slice of the game, still early enough to walk me through some of the core pillars of Prime 4, but more open-ended and familiar to Metroid fans.

In the midst of Samus lending aid to the Federation, she gets transported to a strange planet, cut off from communications and not entirely sure where she is--and of course, missing some key pieces of her equipment. At that point she discovers a psychic crystal, which fuses itself to her helmet and imbues her with the ability to interface with the planet's technology. The Lamorn, an ancient race native to the planet, believes Samus is their people's Chosen One, as the crystal chose to fuse itself to her. So in a way similar to how Samus has traditionally found Chozo artifacts that augment her suit, now she's finding psychically imbued Lamorn power-ups. It's familiar territory for Metroid Prime.

Samus isn't quite starting from zero this time. With the crystal comes a Psychic Beam, Psychic Hyper Beam, and Morph Ball abilities, but she's lost everything else. Most importantly, she's gained a new Psychic Visor, which pulls double-duty as both the scanning visor from the old Metroid Prime games, as well as the interface for many of her snappy new psychic abilities. This makes sense thematically, as it gives the feeling that you're moving objects with your ""mind""--aka, your line of sight--instead of your arm cannon. You even see her raising her left hand to her temple in a classic Professor X gesture. And this sense of psychic power is accented by the only other speaking character in the demo commenting on how objects seem, from his perspective, to be moving by themselves as you manipulate them through telekinesis. More on him in a bit.

You quickly learn that to get off-planet you need to gather five master teleporter keys, and so the adventure begins in earnest. This is where Prime 4 opens up into more expansive exploration, but I could still feel the presence of training wheels. It's an early part of the game, so this is the first taste of exploration, with some limitations. It was still relatively linear and easy to tell where exactly you had to go, so I didn't feel overwhelmed by the alien landscape. I trust that feeling will fade as more areas open and get more complex, but I couldn't tell from this limited demo if the five sections will have interlocking exploration or if they're more segmented. The first one, at least, was almost entirely standalone, but I did see clues of things to come back to once I received other powers.

This section took place in an overgrown jungle in the shadow of a massive tree that's sacred to the Lamorn. And on a visual level, I had mixed feelings about this area. Nintendo excels at art direction and makes the most of its comparatively low hardware power, especially when it comes to the rubbery, cartoonish styles of Mario and his pals. When it comes to a more realistic style with lots of organic elements, the Switch 2 limitations, or perhaps Nintendo and Retro's inexperience with realism, are more apparent. The jungle looked merely fine, with overgrown brush mostly along the edges of flat dirt paths. There are moments that it looks surprisingly great, though, like when you navigate through vines as a morph ball and get to see the organic elements in a tightly controlled space, or viewing the sheen of calcified resin that blocks certain doors. It's not a bad-looking game by any means, but attempting a realistic art style for a familiar biome like ""jungle"" invites unflattering comparisons to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S games.

In this initial section, enemies were mostly minor nuisances and the emphasis was on exploring, learning about your powers, and acquiring a few new ones. Finding a missile power-up lets you crack through the resin. But you also get psychic twists on both new and old powers. You can grasp a psychic mote of light with your mind and then toss it into a receptacle to power up a door, or move elements with your mind to activate them, for example. That element adds a twist to your usual suite of powers, and gives you that much more reason to flip into your visor mode and see what you can interact with. One power, the Control Beam, lets you steer a projectile in slow-mo to aim it towards control switches or enemies.

As you explore, you run into Myles MacKenzie, a Federation engineer who has been marooned on this planet with you. Samus Aran is a bona fide legend, so Myles is obviously impressed, giving the relationship echoes of classic Halo games when ordinary people would come face-to-face with Master Chief. Myles is obviously in way over his head on a hostile planet where everything is trying to kill him, but he knows his way around machinery, so he's an asset. Your mileage may vary, but I found his hapless dorky chatterbox persona endearing, especially contrasted against Samus's quiet stoicism. Myles even comments on it at one point, which makes me think the relationship is intended to be comedic. After briefly escorting Myles to safety--and thankfully, without feeling like he was a burden--he mostly stuck to a control room and I was back to exploring the alien planet on my own.

The demo culminated in a boss battle against Carvex, an aggressive, sentient plant. The fight started by using your weapon to cut through weak points in the vines, but as more appeared, you had to use the Control Beam to cut through several sections of its vines near-simultaneously, which couldn't be done through normal fire, all while dodging its swinging and swaying tendrils. It was an exciting combat puzzle in the way the Prime games have excelled. And I was pleased to see that scanning it treated me to a little bit of extra story context, informing me that it had been rendered unable to communicate by fusing with a Metroid.

The prize for defeating Carvex was another new power, the Psychic Bomb, which ordinarily operates like a standard Metroid Prime bomb but can be charged to create a floating version that can be grabbed with your mind-powers just like the psychic motes. That lets you activate switches remotely, which then allowed me to open a transport pod.

What lies beyond that point is a mystery, and will be until the game releases on December 4. What I've seen so far, though, feels promising enough to fuel my anticipation. Nintendo and Retro Studios appear to understand the fundamental core of what makes a Metroid Prime game, with satisfying exploration, tense combat puzzles, and meaningful new abilities that change how you look at the world. The long wait is finally almost over, and Nintendo and Retro have shown themselves up to the task of matching a classic Metroid Prime--the final game, in its entirety, will let us know if the decades have helped Beyond exceed them.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","Four Simple Questions for Marjorie Taylor Greene","https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2025/11/marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-reputation/684923/","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

A few recent breaks with her party do not negate a lifetime of conspiracies.

Marjorie Taylor Greene's critics are starting to think they got her all wrong. “You are a very different person than I thought you were,” The View's Sunny Hostin marveled last week, when the Georgia representative joined the show for a largely genial discussion. Recently, Greene has criticized the GOP's shutdown strategy, lack of a plan to address health-care costs, and refusal to release the Jeffrey Epstein files. This turnabout has excited some liberals and media outlets, sometimes to the point of credulity.

Greene sits on the potent House Oversight and Homeland Security Committees. She has openly entertained runs for higher office, including for governor and Senate, and was recently reported to be pursuing the presidency. (She denied it.) Yet watching the softball sit-downs with her on TV, one gets the sense that Greene is being treated as a curiosity rather than as one of the most powerful people in the country, seeking even more influence.

Read: Marjorie Taylor Greene knows exactly what she's doing

On the few occasions when she has been confronted with her past positions and incendiary assertions, Greene has deflected or pleaded ignorance. On The View, she disavowed the QAnon conspiracy theory, saying—as she has before—that she was misled by “media lies and stuff you read on social media.” On Real Time With Bill Maher, Greene noted that she never said that any wildfires were caused by a “Jewish” space laser, as some outlets reported. She merely tied such fire-starting technology to the Rothschild banking dynasty, a Jewish family that has been subject to countless anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. “I didn't even know the Rothschilds were Jewish,” Greene explained with an aw-shucks shrug. “Before politics, I didn't know much of any of this stuff.”

Fair enough. Greene was but a tender 44 years old when she invoked the Rothschilds—the same age she was when she liked a social-media comment saying that “a bullet to the head would be quicker” for getting rid of then–House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She was practically a child—43—when she mused about executing Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama. But youthful ignorance doesn't explain every conspiracy theory that Greene has advanced, and every bigot she has embraced, since she entered politics. Because some interlocutors appear to find interrogating her challenging, I thought I'd suggest some lines of inquiry for Greene's next media appearance. You might say I'm just asking questions.

Did Donald Trump win the 2020 election? This week, the president pardoned a group of Republican activists who had acted as fraudulent electors in an attempt to overturn his 2020 loss. Greene not only applauded this decision—she called for more. This stance is nothing new. For years, Greene has denied the 2020 election results and spread false claims about the contest and its aftermath. “Today I'll be objecting to a stolen election,” she declared on January 6, 2021, shortly before rioters stormed the Capitol and attempted to steal the election for Trump. In 2022, Greene insisted that “antifa,” not Trump supporters, was behind that abortive insurrection. In 2023, when House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries observed that Joe Biden had won the 2020 presidential election, Greene yelled back, “No, he didn't.” In 2024, she spread a baseless rumor that Georgia voting machines were surreptitiously altering early votes. She has not disavowed any of these assertions.

Does Greene have any ideological differences with American white nationalists? Last month, Tucker Carlson, one of the most influential voices on the American right, hosted Nick Fuentes, one of the country's most notorious white nationalists, on his podcast. Their conversation kicked off an intra-conservative controversy over the place of anti-Semitism and Nazi apologism in the MAGA movement. But long before Fuentes joined Carlson, Greene joined Fuentes. In February 2022, she spoke at the America First Political Action Conference, an event organized by Fuentes, where she grinningly shook hands with him onstage. Later, Greene claimed to be unaware of his views and said that she was “not aligned with anything that may be controversial,” without explaining how she, a professional politician, had come to give an address at a racist-run gathering without knowing what she was walking into. Eight months later, under media pressure, Greene declared on social media, “Of course I denounce Nick Fuentes and his racists [sic] anti-semitic ideology” (she went on to blame the media for being “obsessed” with him).

More recent events suggest that Greene's disavowal might not have been entirely genuine. “I was a friend of hers, and she spoke at my conference, and then the day after, she pretended like she didn't know me,” Fuentes told Carlson. “She knew exactly what it was.” Days after Carlson hosted Fuentes for that amiable exchange, in which the far-right influencer also praised Joseph Stalin and railed against “organized Jewry,” Greene slammed not Fuentes, but those criticizing “my good friend Tucker Carlson.” Given that Greene had been Carlson's guest the week before Fuentes, this defense is not surprising. But it poses a question: Does Greene agree with either Fuentes or Carlson about Hitler, Black people, women, and the rest? Undoubtedly, she believes in the two men's right to free speech, but will she ever use hers to criticize their specific ideas? Someone should ask.

Yair Rosenberg: The MAGA influencers rehabilitating Hitler

Did the COVID vaccine kill “extremely high amounts” of people? In a November 2021 social-media thread, Greene approvingly cited Louis Farrakhan, the reactionary Black hate preacher known for his homophobic rhetoric and anti-Semitic rants about the “synagogue of Satan.” The reason? Farrakhan and his Nation of Islam organization are avowedly anti-vaccine—Farrakhan once claimed that the H1N1 flu vaccine was developed to kill people—and accordingly opposed the COVID-19 vaccines. “Extremely high amounts of deaths are reported on VAERS,” the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, “but there are no investigations into those deaths,” Greene claimed in that series of posts, misrepresenting the meaning of the VAERS system's data. The merits of vaccine mandates are a matter of opinion. Whether large numbers of people were murdered by the COVID vaccine, only for their deaths to be covered up, is a question of fact—one Greene ought to be able to answer with proof, especially given her position on the House Oversight Committee.

Did Israel let the October 7, 2023, attacks happen? Many people in Congress and beyond have criticized Israel's conduct in Gaza, myself included. But Greene has gone much further. When the conflict began, she initially sided with Israel and attempted to exploit the Hamas assault to censure the Muslim representative Rashida Tlaib for “antisemitic activity” and “sympathizing with terrorist organizations.” But since then, Greene has not only reversed course but begun insinuating something far worse than anything Tlaib ever articulated: that Israel knew about the October 7 plot in advance, yet did nothing to stop the attack.

In September, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed that Israeli intelligence had hijacked phones in Gaza to stream his address to the United Nations. At the time, journalists on the ground reported that they found no evidence that this had actually occurred. Nonetheless, the commentator Glenn Greenwald asked: “Israel has such complete surveillance and control of Gaza's communications networks that it can commandeer them to force their phones to broadcast Netanyahu's speech, but Israel had no clue that Hamas was planning an operation as large as Oct 7 and it then took hours to respond?” There are very straightforward, nonconspiratorial reasons Israel failed to repel the 2023 Hamas attack, but this did not stop Greene from reposting Greenwald's claim with an eyeballs emoji. (Greene has also repeatedly implied that Israel had a hand in assassinating President John F. Kennedy.)

A handful of recent apostasies from her party does not negate Greene's lifetime of conspiracies. Taken together, the above positions do not suggest a stable person of sound judgment. Rather, they paint a picture of someone consistently unable to distinguish partisan fantasy from reality, who ping-pongs from conspiratorial extreme to conspiratorial extreme. “Everybody's like, ‘Marjorie Taylor Greene has changed,'” she said of herself on The View. “Oh no, nothing has changed about me.”

People—even politicians—should be allowed to grow and not be forever reduced to the worst version of themselves. But there is a difference between an honest evolution, which entails accountability, and shallow opportunism, which offers none. Which category does Greene fall into? Given her significant following and stated political ambitions, it's in everyone's best interest to find out. But for that to happen, her interlocutors will have to start asking her the hard questions she's thus far avoided.

Prosecutors in Thuringia said police searched three properties but that the unnamed politician's arrest was not being sought. Meanwhile, the governing coalition has agreed to a new military service policy.

Public prosecutors in the eastern state of Thuringia said police searched the property of an unnamed AfD politician, who is suspected of supporting a far-right group that plotted the kidnapping of Germany's health minister and other crimes. 

The alleged ringleaders of the plot were jailed after a lengthy trial earlier this year.

Meanwhile, US-based NGO Freedom House says internet freedom is declining in Germany and around the world, according to their annual report.

And Germany's ruling parties have agreed on a path forward for military service for 18-year-olds as the Bundeswehr suffers from low recruitment.

It was the roundup of the latest developments in Germany on Thursday, November 13. This blog is now closed.

The German government is planning to introduce a state-subsidized industrial electricity price, Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Thursday evening.

Merz described the plans as important building blocks of his government's energy policy.

The new, subsidized electricity price of €0.05 ($0.058) per kilowatt-hour will be introduced from 2026 to 2028. 

Merz also said a strategy would be developed for the construction of new gas power plants, which should be operational by 2031. 

The coalition is also planning to reduce the ticket tax in air travel from July next year, Merz said.

The air travel tax was significantly raised in May 2024, which potentially makes passenger flights from German airports more expensive.

Reversing the hike was part of the coalition agreement between Merz's conservative CDU/CSU alliance and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD).

The US State Department said on Thursday that it was moving to designate four self-styled ""antifa"" (anti-fascist) groups as terrorist organizations, citing Germany-based Antifa Ost by name. 

It also said it was pursuing ""three other violent antifa groups in Italy and Greece."" 

The State Department intended to designate all four groups as Foreign Terrorist Organizations as of November 20, it said. 

""The designation of Antifa Ost and other violent Antifa groups supports President Trump's National Security Presidential Memorandum-7, an initiative to disrupt self-described 'anti-fascism' networks, entities, and organizations that use political violence and terroristic acts to undermine democratic institutions, constitutional rights, and fundamental liberties,"" the State Department wrote. 

""Groups affiliated with this movement ascribe to revolutionary anarchist or Marxist ideologies, including anti-Americanism, 'anti-capitalism,' and anti-Christianity, using these to incite and justify violent assaults domestically and overseas,"" it said.

Among other things, the designation makes it illegal for US citizens to seek membership or to support the groups, for instance by donating funds.

Trump has been vocal in his criticism of ""antifa"" organizations in the US and beyond in recent years.

The US government didn't mention specific incidents or reasons for the designation. 

One high-profile court case involving Antifa Ost in Germany in recent years was the 2023 prison sentence for Dresden student Lina E., deemed the ringleader of a group of people who would seek out and retaliate against groups they deemed to be far-right extremists.

Another suspected member, Johann G., believed to be the leader of a group within Antifa Ost that calls itself the ""Hammer Gang"" (Hammerbande), was arrested late last year. Prosecutors are seeking to try him and several other suspects on charges including attempted murder.

Police searched the properties of an AfD politician in Ilmenau in the eastern state of Thuringia as part of an investigation into an alleged far-right terrorist plot, state prosecutors said on Thursday. 

A spokesperson for Thuringia public prosecutors in Jena said that the man's apartment and two other properties were searched for evidence. The spokesperson said an arrest was not currently planned or sought and did not identify the politician. 

The searches are connected to investigations into an alleged, foiled plot to kidnap former Health Minister Karl Lauterbach.

Lauterbach is a Social Democrat and a physician who became a prominent and in some circles controversial figure during the coronavirus pandemic as a leading voice advocating vaccinations and shutdowns. 

The AfD politician under investigation is suspected of having supported an organization calling itself the ""Kaiserreichgruppe"" (roughly, ""German Empire Group"") that's one of the fringe ""Reichsbürger"" groups that claim not to recognize the fall of the German Empire after World War I or the validity of the modern German state. 

Four leading members of this group were sentenced to lenghty jail terms by a court in Koblenz earlier this year.

Thuringia is an eastern state and a stronghold of the AfD; the leader of the party's state chapter, Björn Höcke, is among the AfD's most controversial members. He has been convicted twice of knowingly quoting banned Nazi slogans in his political speeches.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to ensure  fewer young Ukrainian men seek to emigrate to Germany, saying they should instead ""serve their country."" 

Merz told a crowd at a business event in Germany on Thursday that he had told Zelenskyy the young men were ""needed"" at home.

Recent changes to wartime emergency laws prohibiting Ukrainian men aged 18-22 from leaving the country led to an uptick in young men looking to move to Germany.

The chancellor also voiced support for his government's plans to remove the automatic eligibility for social benefits that had been granted to Ukrainian refugees in the aftermath of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. 

Going forward, they would be entitled to the same system of state support afforded to typical asylum-seekers rather than that of German residents.

Merz also said there would be ""concrete changes"" going forward designed to push for Ukrainians in Germany to seek work rather than to receive state support.

According to recent German media reports citing government sources, Labor Minister Bärbel Bas (a Social Democrat) and Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt (a member of the conservative Bavarian CSU) recently agreed on plans to change Ukrainian's entitlement to German benefits, although the details have not yet been formally presented.

Merz has been trying to strike a tougher tone on migration and asylum amid the challenge from the populist right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD), the leader of the opposition in parliament and the second-largest party in the country since federal elections earlier this year.

Another suspect has been arrested by German police in connection with the alleged procurement of weapons for the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Germany's Federal Public Prosecutor's Office said on Thursday that the case of the man, who was arrested on a train traveling from Denmark to Germany, was linked to several other arrests in recent weeks.

Authorities said Thursday's suspect was believed to have transported weapons from one suspected Hamas member in the central German state of Hesse to another in Berlin.

""The weapons were to be used by Hamas for assassinations targeting Israeli or Jewish institutions in Germany,"" prosecutors said. However, there was no apparent concrete plan for an attack.

On Tuesday, a suspected Hamas member was arrested as he entered Germany from the Czech Republic.

Three more suspects were detained in Berlin last month, and last week another man was arrested in London on suspicion of transporting weapons to Austria, where a cache was uncovered in November. The British citizen is awaiting extradition to Germany.

Germany classifies Hamas as a terrorist organization. 

Protesters unfurled a banner reading ""Never again genocide — freedom for Palestine"" from Berlin's famous Brandenburg Gate on Thursday.

Three activists climbed onto the 20-meter-high monument with the help of a lifting platform. They set off red smoke flares around the quadriga — the sculpture of four horses and a chariot that tops the gate.

They also displayed a Palestinian flag.

German police sent 75 officers, including climbing specialists from a technical unit, to apprehend the protesters.

The officers, with support from the fire brigade, brought down the three protesters — two women and one man — before taking them into custody. 

Three others who had operated the lifting platform were also arrested.

Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, has launched a new sticker campaign to promote the use of cash payments in shops, alongside paying by card.

Freely available stickers can be put up by shopowners on their doors next to stickers showing that they accept card payments. The stickers are available in different formats, including with slogans ""Klar, auch bar!"" (Of course, also in cash!) and ""Einfach. Bargeld."" (Simple. Cash.)

""The cash payment stickers signal to customers that cash is welcome,"" member of the Bundesbank executive board Burkhard Balz said.

Cash remains a popular payment method in Germany but has declined in recent years, falling to 51% in 2023, based on Bundesbank data.

""Cash can be used independent of technology, electricity and internet,"" Balz said.

The two co-leaders of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party have sought to give a show of unity in a joint letter following an apparent split over views regarding Russia.

""We will continue to work together on policies for Germany and its citizens,"" Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla wrote. ""To this end, we maintain good relations with our European and international partners.""

The anti-immigrant party has come under fire for its connections to Russia, with Weidel attempting to distance herself from some of the controversy.

She criticized several AfD lawmakers who were planning to travel to a conference in Moscow, saying she did not ""understand what
they're supposed to be doing there.""

At the same time, Chrupalla appears to have gone in the other direction, saying in a talk show earlier in the week that he saw no specific danger posed to Germany by Russia, arguing that any country could threaten Germany. 

He went on to say that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""hasn't done anything to me.""

Chrupalla's remarks drew criticism from the AfD's own defense spokesperson in the Bundestag — Rüdiger Lucassen, a former officer in the German armed forces.

German authorities announced on Thursday that wild type 1 poliovirus had been detected in wastewater in the German city of Hamburg.

Although the risk to the public is considered very low due to high vaccination rates and only low levels of virus detected, the discovery rang alarm bells, as it was the first time the deadly disease had been found in sewage in Germany in several decades.

Poliomyelitis, commonly known as polio, can lead to permanent paralysis and death, according to the German Federal Institute for Public Health (BIÖG). Symptoms can also include nausea, fever, sore throat, abdominal pain, muscle pain, headaches and meningitis.

Germany last confirmed a case of polio caused by the wild type of the virus in 1990. The last imported case was recorded in 1992, according to BIÖG.

The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) and the German Environment Agency regularly test wastewater samples in Germany for traces of the poliovirus.

The German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) has given the green light for testing an autonomous shuttle in the northern city of Hamburg.

Holon, the company behind the fully electric, driverless vehicle, welcomed the approval, calling it a ""milestone.""

The ""Holon urban"" operates at what is known as level 4 autonomy. This means it does not require a driver and can stop independently in the case of an emergency.

During the testing phase, a safety supervisor will travel in the vehicle to monitor the autonomous driving.

The vehicle can transport 15 passengers, including nine seats and six standing places. It can reach a maximum speed of 60 kph (just under 40 mph).

With KBA approval and €26 million ($30 million) in federal funding, the pilot project can run until October 2026, with the option to extend it. It aims to supplement public transport and reduce private vehicles on the road.

German car manufacturing giant Volkswagen is also testing its self-driving VW ID.Buzz AD ride pooling vehicles through its subsidiary MOIA.

Some 2,523 organs have been transplanted so far in Germany this year, up from 2,391 in 2024. However, the German Organ Transplantation Foundation (DSO) called on more people to draw up wills to make their intentions clear and for family members to give consent, two factors that can greatly slow down the process.

Axel Rahmel, medical director of the DSO, said that while he welcomed the uptick, ""this should not obscure the fact that this does not represent a fundamental change in organ donation.”

Only about 25% of families give consent for their loved ones organs being donated to those in need, and only 15% die with some sort of document declaring their intention to donate. 

Despite a lack of evidence, rumors persist that doctors are less likely to resusciate someone that is marked as an organ donor via a card that some Germans carry in their wallets. Other stigmas persist too. Some 2,127 donations from January to October 2025 had to be nixed due to lack of consent from families.

Germany has recently made it easier for living donors to provide kidneys to those in need, which doctors hope will also increase donation numbers. According to research firm Statista, the vast majority of people waiting on an organ donation in Germany in 2024 were waiting for kidneys.

The amount of people willing to donate varied widely by region, the DSO reported. In the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, many more organs were donated that in the previous year at over 500. However, in central Hesse and in the northeast, the numbers fell.

According to the DSO, about 10,000 people in Germany are currently waiting on organ donations.

Google recently announced it would invest €5.5 billion ($6.37 billion) in Germany over the next four years, including the construction of a new data center in Dietzenbach, and expansions at existing sites in Munich, Frankfurt and Berlin.

But not everyone is celebrating the move.

An agreement between Germany's coalition parties seen by DW shows that the they have charted a path forward after a contentious debate over the future of the armed forces, the Bundeswehr. 

Chancellor Merz's center-right bloc (CDUand CSU) and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) have been discussing how to resolve the long-standing issue of flagging recruitment after conscription ended in 2011.

The paper opens by acknowledging that ""the security threat situation has worsened significantly in recent years as a result of Russia's war of aggression.""

""It is crucial that our armed forces meet the NATO capability targets that have been agreed upon in terms of structure, equipment, and, above all, personnel,"" it adds.

Currently the Bundeswehr has about 182,000 active duty troops. The goal is to increase that to 260,000 in order to meet ""capabilities promised to NATO.""

Beginning next year, at the age of 18 men will be called upon to fill out a questionnaire about their readiness to join the military —  ""so that, in the event of defense, the Bundeswehr knows who it can call on if universal conscription is reinstated.""

Salaries will also be increased for new recruits. There will also be perks, such as subsidized driving school — famously expensive in Germany.

Crucially, the statement says, there will be ""no automatic mechanism for activating compulsory military service."" This has been the most hotly debated measure, with critics saying the questionnaire will not be enough to gain the necessary troop numbers.

Germany has witnessed a decline in internet freedom, an annual study by Freedom House said on Thursday.

The Washington-based democracy promotion group surveyed freedom on the internet in 72 nations for 2025, in a global landscape marred by persistent authoritarian repression and backsliding in western democracies when it comes to imposing growing curbs online. 

Freedom House said that Germany fell by three points in the internet freedom score to a total of 74. 

The study said that authorities in Germany sought legal action against people who pilloried politicians.

The report made a mention of criminal prosecutions in Germany over memes about politicians, seemingly pointing to the case of an editor of a publication affiliated to the far-right AfD. 

Deutschland-Kurier editor-in-chief David Bendels had received a suspended jail sentence and was fined for a social media post that included a manipulated image to criticize former Interior Minister Nancy Faeser. In the image, she was holding a sign that said ""I hate freedom of speech."" The image was shared widely.

Freedom House also listed out factors like an increased self-censorship due in part to threats from far-right actors, and attacks by hackers with ties to the Russian state as contributors to Germany's internet freedom decline.

On Wednesday morning, hours before the House voted to reopen the federal government after the longest shutdown in US history, senior White House officials and members of Donald Trump's cabinet filtered into the Situation Room.

The secure, wood panelled room on the West Wing's ground floor is usually reserved for top secret meetings about military operations and national security issues, but that morning there was another burning issue on the agenda: Jeffrey Epstein.

The extraordinary summit gathered top officials including Kash Patel, the FBI director, and Pam Bondi, the attorney general, to meet with Colorado Representative Lauren Boebert in an effort to convince her to remove her signature from a petition to force a vote on releasing the Epstein files.

Ms Boebert, 38, was one of four Republicans to sign the petition, which would finally secure the required 218th signature later that day when Democrat Adelita Grijalva was sworn in.

The top level meeting came hours after the Democrats released three of Epstein's email exchanges which raised questions over how much Mr Trump knew about his former friend's conduct.

On Tuesday, Mr Trump himself had reportedly called Ms Boebert as part of an intense pressure campaign to push her to tow the party line. He had also tried to call Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican who also signed the petition.

The calls and meeting are understood to have come after a months-long effort to urge Ms Boebert to reverse course.

White House officials had asked Ms Boebert what it would take for her to remove her signature and issued vague threats about how breaking with Mr Trump could impact her popularity, according to the New York Times.

The campaign failed and reportedly only strengthened Ms Boebert's conviction.

But the remarkable intervention from Mr Trump and his top team reveals the lengths the Republican leader is willing to go to try and kill the Epstein issue which has plagued his second term.

“It's somewhat astonishing to have the White House and even the president try to pressure members of Congress and put the full force of the presidency behind this only to fail,” said Matthew Barlett, a Republican strategist and former Trump appointee to the State Department in the first administration.

“It just exposes a true weakness, possibly a lack of full understanding that the White House has around the Epstein matters, that their own efforts or denials are damaging to only themselves right now.”

“The White House's frantic scramble to peel Representatives Boebert and Mace off the Epstein discharge petition exposed the fragility of Trump's grip on his own flank,” Rina Shah, the Republican strategist, told The Telegraph.

“It was less so a masterstroke of party discipline than it was an actual firewall against bipartisan sunlight that could scorch reputations across the aisle. This desperate move from the White House is a reminder that, in Washington, transparency is the one weapon both sides fear most.”

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, heralded the meeting as an example of “transparency” and of how administration officials “are willing to sit down with members of Congress and address their concerns”.

The discharge petition now has enough signatures to force a vote on the House floor, which House Speaker Mike Johnson has suggested could be held next week.

It is expected to pass with support from dozens and possibly 100 Republicans, sources told Politico. There are still significant, and somewhat insurmountable, hurdles to jump through before the files are released: it must pass through the Senate and would require Mr Trump to sign it off himself.

But if swathes of Republicans vote for transparency it will symbolise the strength of feeling for these files to be released, flames Mr Trump fanned himself before he became president.

Following the top level meeting Ms Boebert thanked White House officials on social media for the meeting, writing: “Together, we remain committed to ensuring transparency for the American people.”

But her refusal to bow to pressure from Mr Trump shows how split the US president is from some of his core supporters on this issue.

Ms Boebert is a political firebrand who was previously called a “Maga warrior” and has always been fiercely loyal to the Republican president. With her perfectly styled dark hair and penchant for cowboy boots bearing the stars and stripes, the mother-of-four epitomised the Maga movement.

She came under fire this Halloween after she dressed up as a Mexican woman and her boyfriend Kyle Perry wore an ICE agent costume.

Ms Boebert, who wore a sombrero, reportedly held a sign which said “Mexican Word of the Day: Juicy. Tell me if juicy ICE coming”, which appeared to mock the pronunciation of “you see”.

Ms Mace, another Maga loyalist, put out a statement explaining her own experience of sexual abuse and rape and how the Epstein petition “is deeply personal” but doubled down on her loyalty to Mr Trump saying she will “defend every last attack” on Mr Trump “to the death”.

Signing the petition is somewhat of a risky move for Ms Mace, who is running to become South Carolina governor next year.

Mr Trump has been plagued by the Epstein issue ever since his administration reversed course and said it would not release the documents the government holds on its investigation into the paedophile.

On social media Mr Trump has branded the Epstein issue a “hoax” and blamed the Democrats and has called his own supporters “stupid” for refusing to move on from it.

He even sent Todd Blanche, his deputy attorney general, to interview convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell about Epstein in an effort to exonerate himself.

“For Trump, this Epstein petition fiasco is a self-inflicted tripwire: his frantic Situation Room summons and phone-tag diplomacy with Boebert and Mace spotlight old associations and they erode the ironclad loyalty he's known to demand,” Ms Shah said.

“Ultimately, it's Trump himself who is fully responsible for turning a bipartisan transparency push into a loyalty litmus test that risks alienating the very hardliners who could define his post-presidency influence.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Chatham House hosts notorious Ukrainian neo-Nazi mob leader","https://www.rt.com/news/627809-chatham-house-ukrainian-nazi/","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 19:08:00 GMT","

London-based think tank Chatham House has hosted notorious Ukrainian neo-Nazi Yevhen Karas as a speaker at an event called ‘War in Ukraine: The battleground for the future of Europe'.

The think tank presented Karas as the commander of the 413th Separate Battalion of Unmanned Systems ‘Raid' of Ukraine's armed forces, failing to mention his colorful neo-Nazi background.

Karas is known as the founder of the notorious S14 far-right paramilitary group, created in 2010 as a youth offshoot of the far-right Svoboda party. The name of the group is a stylized form of the Ukrainian word ‘Sich', referring to an administrative and military center for Cossack proto-states, and contains the number ‘14', widely used by assorted white supremacist and neo-Nazi organizations worldwide.  

The number refers to a 14-word phrase by American white supremacist David Lane: “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.” The S14 itself, however, has insisted its name refers to the date it was created and denies being a neo-Nazi organization, but merely a “Ukrainian nationalist” group.

A post shared by Карась Євген (@karas.yevgen)

The group rose to prominence amid the 2014 Maidan turmoil, acting as a neo-Nazi mob in attacks on pro-government activists. After former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich was toppled and the conflict in then Ukrainian Donbass broke out, S14 militants were repeatedly involved in attacks on entities and individuals deemed to be ‘pro-Russian' and ‘separatist'.  

S14 developed ties with the post-Maidan Ukrainian authorities and the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) in particular, with the agency using the neo-Nazi mob to attack those it could not legally prosecute. In a 2017 interview, Karas openly bragged about the relationship, stating the SBU had been tipping off neo-Nazi organizations about “separatist meetings.” 

“They inform not only us, but also Azov, Right Sector, and so on,” he said.

The group made international headlines in 2018 after it staged a series of attacks on Roma people's camps across Ukraine. The publicity turned out to be so bad for S14 that even Kiev's Western backers condemned the group. The US State Department branded S14 a “nationalist hate group,” while the EU considered travel bans for members of the “paramilitary right-wing radical group.” 

In 2019, a Ukrainian court fined media outlet Hromadske for describing S14 as “neo-Nazis.” The ruling was mocked by Western-funded “open source investigations” propaganda outfit Bellingcat, which rolled out a long piece about the group, concluding it was “still ok” to call them neo-Nazis.  

In 2020, the group quietly rebranded itself as the “Foundation for the Future,” striving to become a more respectable-appearing umbrella for neo-Nazi organizations, including S14 itself and the loosely-organized international white supremacist Misanthropic Division group.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:tass.com","Press review: Ukraine scandal fuels political tension as Russia warns of Lebanon war risks","https://tass.com/pressreview/2043631","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 10:06:05 GMT","

MOSCOW, November 14. /TASS/. A corruption scandal in Ukraine may spiral into a political crisis as US bombers with nuclear missiles are seen performing flights near the Russian border. Meanwhile, Russia warns risks of another war in Lebanon. These stories topped Friday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

The G7 has actually supported a probe by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office into the inner circle of Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky as a major corruption scandal coincided with problems facing the EU in providing more funding to Kiev.

""We made it clear to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrey Sibiga that Ukraine must take decisive action against corruption in order to maintain strong Western support,"" Germany's top diplomat Johann Wadephul told reporters, commenting on the results of the G7 Foreign Ministers' meeting with Sibiga in Canada on Wednesday.

The corruption scandal, among other things, was discussed in a phone conversation between German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Zelensky on November 13. Germany will support the initiative to expose the misuse of funds by the Ukrainian leadership as Berlin is Ukraine's second-largest sponsor after Washington, concurs Artyom Sokolov, a senior researcher at the European Studies Institute of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. Besides, the expert continues, the European community has grown weary of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, especially in light of the Ukrainian retreat on the front lines, thus, Germany may take a more meticulous attitude to Kiev. However, it is too early to talk about any termination of European funding for Ukraine, the political analyst noted.

European countries are unlikely to stop financing Ukraine, as the Ukrainian army relies heavily on this aid for its combat capabilities, Alexander Kamkin, associate professor at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, told Vedomosti. However, the expert argued, the corruption scandal may prompt the EU to monitor financial aid flows more closely. And military assistance to Kiev is not going anywhere, as Germany plans to spend $3 billion for this purpose next year, the expert said.

Now, Ukrainian politicians are under pressure from anti-corruption agencies, but the West has so far refrained from attacking Zelensky personally, head of the Ukraine division at the Institute of CIS Countries Ivan Skorikov told Vedomosti. ""In theory, Zelensky may turn on his associates under pressure, like he did to businessman Igor Kolomoisky. As the stakes get higher, it could be useful for him to get done with his inner circle,"" the expert concluded.

 

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has reaffirmed Washington's readiness to start testing nuclear weapons and their carriers. The United States' top diplomat explained this was needed ""to make sure these things work, and they are safe."" And such tests seem to have already started.

Images of a B-52H Stratofortress bomber equipped with a prototype of the latest American cruise missile AGM-181A Long-Range Standoff (LRSO), performing flights on November 4 and 8, have leaked to the media. The photos were taken near a US air base in California. Experts say the images of missiles may indicate a start to testing nuclear weapon carriers in the United States. Earlier, President Donald Trump announced plans to resume testing of US nuclear capabilities, even as no official statements have been made yet.

Reports that three B-52H Stratofortress strategic bombers, according to data from NATO, recently arrived in Europe for Bomber Task Force Europe 26-1 and patrolled the airspace over Estonia, the Baltic Sea and Finland on November 12 look very alarming against this backdrop. While it is unclear if they carry the newest LRSO missiles, the very flight close to Russia's border itself represents a potential threat.

""Maneuvers currently taking place in Europe, involving Bomber Task Force Europe 26-1, can be viewed as a follow-up to the US nuclear exercise Global Thunder. For all B-52H Stratofortress bombers are considered nuclear weapon carriers,"" military expert and retired Lieutenant General Yury Netkachev said in an interview with Nezavisimaya Gazeta.

Netkachev noted that simultaneously with NATO's Bomber Task Force Europe 26-1 Finland is hosting a ground exercise with more than 15,000 troops taking part. British and Swedish militaries, too, are participating in the maneuvers. The goals include solving tasks on the ground and practicing cooperation and methods of air defense warfare with allies, Western media reported.

 

An explosive situation has been reported in southern Lebanon, Russian Ambassador to Beirut Alexander Rudakov told Izvestia, and Russia sees the likelihood of large-scale battles erupting there anew. Despite the ceasefire, Israel has been violating Lebanon's airspace almost every day, delivering strikes inside Lebanese territory, the diplomat noted. Hezbollah is ready to surrender weapons to the state, but not under fire, Rudakov said.

Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told Izvestia that the Shiite movement has been rebuilding its military infrastructure as it smuggles weapons and builds production facilities to manufacture weapons in Lebanon.

In the past few weeks, the IDF has broadened the scope of strikes, including operations in southern Lebanon and the Beqaa Valley. Lebanon has estimated that 309 people were killed, and 598 others sustained injuries in attacks in less than a year, with more than 5,000 ceasefire violations registered.

According to Jamal Wakim, a professor at the Lebanese University, Israel has been stepping up pressure on Lebanon in order to force it into direct talks with the Jewish state, a goal being pursued by Washington.

While Hezbollah retains a substantial deterrence potential, the likelihood of a major war remains, the expert told Izvestia.

 

Around 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion barrels of oil is currently concentrated in oil tankers in the oceans, with many of those standing still and not going to any ports of destination. And a large portion of oil barrels accumulated in these tankers belongs to economies sanctioned by the United States, namely Russia, Iran and Venezuela, Bloomberg reported, citing data from Vortexa, Kpler and OilX.

This amount of oil has accumulated in global seas and oceans since late August. Naturally, this concentration is primarily associated with the latest US sanctions on Russian oil majors and tougher restrictions against Iran and Venezuela.

According to Maxim Malkov, head of Oil and Gas Services at Kept, the situation is quite extraordinary and things looked the same in 2020 amid the pandemic when global oil demand declined heavily. If the data from Bloomberg is correct, an additional supply overhang is being formed on the market that can put pressure on prices. However, if the amount is not precise or exaggerated, this looks like an attempt at informational intervention to manipulate market expectations.

If the data is correct indeed, Daniil Tyun, who heads the department of client services at AMCH, argues, sanctions and excessive supply are to blame here: many ports and companies refuse to take Russian and Iranian oil as they fear to breach the restrictions. And the loss of major buyers would force Russian exporters to sell their crude to smaller traders or the ""shadow fleet"" or even keep oil at sea while waiting for buyers.

The situation is unlikely to persist for long, as alternative supply routes to bypass sanctions will likely be established, along with new supply and settlement chains. The downside for Russia is that no rise in oil prices appears imminent. Oleg Abelev, Head of the Analytical Department at Rikom-Trust, told Rossiyskaya Gazeta that oil benchmarks will be under pressure in the coming months.

 

Since the start of this year, the market share of Russian wines has increased from 58% to 63%, while wine imports have declined by one-third, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Patrushev revealed. The assortment of wines, too, has expanded, and in 2025, the vineyard area exceeded 110,000 hectares, a 14% increase from 2020. ""This is one of the highest growth rates globally,"" Patrushev said. And one-third of Russian vineyards are quite young, meaning the growth potential is significant.

The government views enotourism as a growth driver. The State Duma has already adopted a first reading of a bill allowing businessmen to build wine tourism facilities on lands that are suitable for cultivating vineyards. And the minimal vineyard area for such projects will be 5 hectares, Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee for Economic Policy Sergey Altukhov noted.

In parallel to this, the international agenda is unfolding. The initiatives include holding a BRICS wine summit and establishing a wine export center that will enable Russian winemakers to take part in international fairs collectively. ""Our common ambitious goal is to make Russian wine, like Italian, French or Spanish wines, not only a beverage but a true point of national pride and a strong international brand,"" Rosselkhozbank Board Chairman Boris Listov believes.

The perception of Russian wine has already strengthened. Alexander Oslon, President of the Public Opinion Foundation, cited a recent survey showing that 70% of Russians believe domestic wines can compete with imported brands. ""So far, wine has been the most dynamic segment of the alcohol market, and the culture of wine consumption continues to improve,"" he said.

MOSCOW, November 14. /TASS/. The Federal Security Service (FSB) has thwarted a terrorist attack against a top Russian official – an explosion that was to be carried out at the grave of his loved ones in a Moscow cemetery using a video camera hidden inside a vase of flowers, the agency said.

Three accomplices in the plot – two Russian spouses and a migrant from a Central Asian country – have been arrested, the FSB told TASS.

""The Federal Security Service has prevented a terrorist act planned by the special services of Ukraine against one of the highest officials of the Russian state when he visited the burial place of close relatives at the Troyekurovskye Cemetery,"" the FSB said, without identifying the official.

According to the agency, Ukrainian security services recruited an illegal migrant from Central Asia, two previously convicted drug-addicted Russian citizens detained in Moscow, and Shamso Jaloliddin Kurbanovich, born in 1979 and residing in Kiev, who is wanted in Russia for murder and illegal arms trafficking.

The FSB said communication devices seized from the suspects contained correspondence with a Ukrainian special services officer via WhatsApp and Signal, confirming preparations for the assassination attempt. The agency also reported the discovery of a video surveillance camera disguised as a vase of flowers, equipped with remote control, which was to be used in the attack.

""According to FSB data, the Ukrainian regime, acting under the guidance of Western special services, is preparing similar crimes in other Russian regions,"" the agency noted.

The FSB again warned that Ukrainian special services continue to actively search for potential perpetrators of terrorist attacks and acts of sabotage online - including on social networks and messaging platforms such as Telegram and WhatsApp - and stressed that confidential cooperation with foreign states or organizations is unacceptable. ""Persons who commit such crimes face criminal liability under Russian law, including life imprisonment,"" the agency said.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Pete Skandalakis appointed himself to take over 2020 election interference case from district attorney Fani Willis

US politics live – latest updates

The only remaining criminal case against Donald Trump has been revived after the head of Georgia's prosecutor's council appointed himself to replace Fani Willis, the Fulton county district attorney, who was removed from the election interference case in September.

Pete Skandalakis, a Republican and the executive director of the prosecuting attorneys' council of Georgia, the state body that provides legal training and is often charged to mitigate prosecutorial conflicts, wrote in a statement on Friday that he would be taking over for Willis.

A grand jury in Atlanta indicted Trump and 18 others in August 2023, using the state's anti-racketeering law to accuse them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn Trump's narrow 2020 loss to Joe Biden in Georgia. The alleged scheme included Trump's call to the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, urging him to find enough votes to beat Biden.

The case remains the only criminal prosecution of Trump remaining, but it has been on life support after Willis was disqualified by the Georgia supreme court, which ruled that her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, revealed in dramatic court filings in January 2024, created an impermissible appearance of a conflict of interest.

Four people have pleaded guilty. Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty. While president, Trump is protected from state-level prosecutions, but the other 14 remaining defendants are still subject to prosecution.

“The filing of this appointment reflects my inability to secure another conflict prosecutor to assume responsibility for this case,” Skandalakis said. “Several prosecutors were contacted and, while all were respectful and professional, each declined the appointment.”

Fulton county's courts have called on Skandalakis to resolve a conflict before in this case, after Scott McAfee, Fulton county's superior court judge, found that Willis's office had a conflict of interest with Burt Jones, who served as one of 16 “alternate” GOP electors in Georgia to cast a vote for Trump during the 2020 legal conflict over election results. Skandalakis ultimately declined to press charges in the case against Jones, who is now Georgia's lieutenant governor and a candidate for governor in 2026.

McAfee set a 14 November deadline for Skandalakis to find a new prosecutor on the Trump racketeering indictment to avoid dismissing the case entirely.

“While it would have been simple to allow Judge McAfee's deadline to lapse or to inform the court that no conflict prosecutor could be secured – thereby allowing the case to be dismissed for want of prosecution – I did not believe that to be the right course of action,” Skandalakis said. “The public has a legitimate interest in the outcome of this case. Accordingly, it is important that someone make an informed and transparent determination about how best to proceed.”

Skandalakis noted that he did not receive the complete investigative file from Fulton county prosecutors until last week. He appointed himself as prosecutor to “complete a comprehensive review and make an informed decision regarding how best to proceed”.

In addition to Trump, Mark Meadows, the president's former chief of staff, and former New York mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani remain defendants in the case. Trump pardoned Meadows and Giuliani of any federal crime related to the 2020 election, a largely symbolic gesture.

Upon receipt of Skandalakis's letter naming himself as prosecutor, McAfee immediately scheduled a pretrial status conference for 1 December, asking prosecutors to tell him whether they intend to seek a superseding indictment to continue the case.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The child sex offender and the former US treasury secretary shared personal views about politics and relationships

US politics live – latest updates

A series of exchanges between child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Larry Summers, the former US treasury secretary, showing a relationship as confidants emerged among the emails released by Republican legislators this week in the continuing political turmoil over Epstein's connections to Donald Trump.

The exchanges, from 2013 to early 2019, showed the two men sharing personal – and sometimes unseemly – views about politics and relationships.

“I'm trying to figure why [the] American elite think if u murder your baby by beating and abandonment it must be irrelevant to your admission to Harvard,” Summers wrote to Epstein in a 2017 email. “But hit on a few women 10 years ago and can't work at a network or think tank. DO NOT REPEAT THIS INSIGHT.”

At the time, Harvard University was wrestling with an admissions debate after a formerly incarcerated woman's admission to a PhD program. Summers, a former president of the university who lost his position in a scandal after making sexist comments about female academics, went on to say in the email to Epstein: “I observed that half of the IQ In [the] world was possessed by women without mentioning they are more than 51 percent of population.”

Summers was once a leading light in Democratic circles – a former treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, one of the primary engineers of Barack Obama's response to the financial crisis and a stalwart in the liberal commentariat. But questions have lingered about his association with Epstein, a longtime associate of Trump. Epstein was accused of running a wide-ranging child sex trafficking operation before his death in jail in 2019 in New York City.

After the Wall Street Journal revealed a previous tranche of emails between Epstein and Summers in a 2023 piece, a spokesperson for Summers told the paper that he “deeply regrets being in contact with Epstein after his conviction”.

Summers's spokesperson has not yet responded to a request for comment from the Guardian.

Democratic lawmakers released emails from the Epstein estate this week that suggest Epstein believed Trump was aware of conduct by the now-convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. In response, Republican lawmakers released a much bigger tranche of 20,000 emails from the Epstein estate.

The documents show that Summers maintained congenial contact with the convicted child sex trafficker well into 2019, with the last email exchange occurring only months before Epstein's arrest.

Trump wrote on Truth Social on Friday that he would be asking the Department of Justice and the FBI to investigate Epstein's “involvement and relationship” with Summers, among other prominent Democrats and business leaders.

In the emails, Summers and Epstein discuss politics – particularly Summers's contempt for Trump – as well as the details of philanthropic social networking – and women. Summers, 70, confided in Epstein in a 2019 exchange about his romantic gestures toward an unnamed woman, and being rebuffed.

“shes smart. making you pay for past errors,” Epstein wrote in an exchange on 16 March. “ignore the daddy im going to go out with the motorcycle guy, you reacted well.. annoyed shows caring., no whining showed strentgh.”

Summers reiterated his regret to the Harvard Crimson on Wednesday. “I have great regrets in my life,” he wrote. “As I have said before, my association with Jeffrey Epstein was a major error of judgement.”

Summers was president of Harvard University from 2001 to 2006. Epstein donated more than $9m to Harvard and its affiliated programs between 1998 and 2008, and was appointed a visiting fellow to conduct research. The university later concluded Epstein “lacked the academic qualifications visiting fellows typically possess and his application proposed a course of study Epstein was unqualified to pursue”.

Harvard only stopped accepting Epstein's donations after he pleaded guilty to child sex offenses in 2008.

By then Obama's star was rising. Summers would eventually win appointment as director of the White House national economic council (NEC) from January 2009 until November 2010.

After Summers left the White House, he began asking Epstein for philanthropic advice for his wife, Elisa New, a Harvard professor pursuing a poetry project, according to reporting by the Wall Street Journal. Epstein and his foundations made philanthropic donations to projects connected to Summers's wife, and the two men met a dozen times between 2013 and 2016, often for dinner.

After reporting about Epstein's donations emerged, New's charity made a donation “in excess” of that received to anti-sex-trafficking organizations, a spokesperson told journalists in 2023.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

A delegation of more than 100 representatives of Taiwanese companies visited Poland with the aim of seeking business opportunities in the reconstruction of war-torn Ukraine. 

The delegation, led by Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs Cynthia Kiang (江文若), attended the “Rebuild Ukraine Exhibition” in Warsaw on Thursday and yesterday.

Kiang said the delegation was sent to Warsaw by the Ministry of Economic Affairs with the main goal of exploring opportunities to participate in the rebuilding of Ukraine, which shares a border with Poland.

Taiwan would take advantage of Poland's geographic proximity to Ukraine, Kiang told the Central News Agency, adding that Warsaw is a gateway to the Ukrainian and EU markets.

Many of the delegation's more than 100 representatives from Taiwanese companies are very interested in participating in reconstruction work in Ukraine, while others are seeking business opportunities elsewhere in Europe, she said.

To that end, Taiwan set up a pavilion at the Rebuild Ukraine Exhibition this year for the first time since the trade fair was launched five years ago, according to the ministry.

The Taiwan Pavilion, the only Asian one at the exhibition, highlights Taiwan's strengths in areas such as machinery and machine tool manufacturing, and its advancements in the fields of energy storage, smart manufacturing and smart city development, the ministry said.

Taiwan's participation in the exhibition is one of the best ways to show the country's commitment to participating in Ukraine's reconstruction, in addition to displaying its technologies and products on the world stage, Kiang said.

Speaking at the opening of the Taiwan Pavilion, Kiang said Taiwan has built a comprehensive information and communications technology (ICT) cluster and supply chain.

Taiwan's flexibility and ability to tailor its products to the needs of customers are recognized in the global market, which proves its capabilities to provide reliable and timely assistance to Ukraine in the fields of technology and equipment, she said. 

On Wednesday, the ministry hosted a “Taiwan Night” event at the exhibition, with government officials, lawmakers, and about 200 representatives from enterprises in Taiwan, Poland and Ukraine discussing business opportunities.

In addition to attending the exhibition, the Taiwanese delegation also visited Poland's three primary hubs for its ICT sector — Lodz, Katowice and Wroclaw, together known as the Poland ICT triangle — to gain insights into the country's latest industrial developments and potential.

Kiang said the presence of her delegation, the largest Taiwanese business group ever sent to Poland, was an indication of Taiwan's interest in cooperation with the European country, which would hopefully lead to a reciprocal and virtuous cycle for the two economies.

Taiwan has set its sights on working closely with like-minded democratic countries to build a non-China supply chain and become a trusted partner, she said.

Taiwanese renewable energy companies are hoping to forge close cooperation with their Polish counterparts, while Taiwan's machinery industry, which has adopted artificial intelligence technologies, is interested in participating in Poland's smart manufacturing development, Kiang said.

The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC) adopted a declaration at its annual summit in Brussels last week, reaffirming that maintaining the “status quo” in the Taiwan Strait is vital to preserving peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.

During the summit, IPAC members also said that actions perceived as undermining the cross-strait “status quo” are not limited to military aggression.

The members agreed on three other scenarios that would be deemed violations of the “status quo” — obstructing Taiwan's self-governance or its ability to secure its borders, economy and society; preventing Taiwan or other states from engaging in substantive international relations; and imposing a political settlement not agreed to by Taiwan's citizens or elected representatives.

“Activity from Beijing contravening these principles should be seen as a violation of the Status Quo, and trigger a proportionate international response,” the declaration said.

Democracies should urgently agree on a common strategy to recognize, clarify and defend the “status quo,” deterring escalation in the Taiwan Strait, while signaling to Beijing that any escalation would carry significant political and economic costs, IPAC said in the declaration, which also called for unhindered maritime traffic through the Taiwan Strait.

The respective governments in IPAC member states should “continue to resist Beijing's distortion of international law regarding Taiwan, especially UN General Assembly Resolution 2758, and clarify that the prohibition of the use of force as set out in the UN Charter applies to Taiwan,” the declaration said.

The declaration was adopted at the fifth annual IPAC summit, which was held on Friday and Saturday last week at the European Parliament in Brussels and attended by cross-party lawmakers from 28 countries.

Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim (蕭美琴) also attended the summit and delivered an address, marking the first time that a sitting Taiwanese vice president had visited a non-allied country and spoken in the European Parliament.

IPAC is a global alliance of lawmakers from various countries and political parties, seeking to reform their governments' policies on China.

The first thing that hits you at the World Cheese Awards is the smell.

As the 37th edition – part competition, part a celebration of cheese – kicked off in Switzerland on Thursday, some visitors might wish the offerings had more holes. With descriptions of odours including “stinky socks” and “sick dog,” it's clearly a festival – and a challenge – for the nose as much as mouths, fingers and eyes.

Welcome to sensory overload.

Connoisseurs, culinary experts and curious consumers flocked to the three-day event in a country where cheese is both food and folklore. The first day got going with the competition, which featured over 5,200 cheeses, nearly one-fifth from Switzerland. Some 46 countries took part, a record count of competitors from Australia to Austria, Bulgaria to Brazil.

All those offerings in the same Bern exhibition hall made for an original mélange of odours. But once past that medley of smells, the sights, flavours and individual scents of the cheeses were tantalizing.

 

The Associated Press

John Farrand, managing director of the Guild of Fine Food in Britain, the event organizer, says some people who tell him they “don't like cheese, it's that awful smelly thing” just need to take time and consider the myriad choices.

“I would grab them and sit down with them and take them on that journey through cheese,” he said. “I get so many people say to me just impulsively ‘I don't like blue cheese' and that's impossible really. There's so much of a range of blue cheese from over here to over here,” – Farrand gesticulated around the hall – “there's always a blue cheese for somebody.”

He rhapsodized about a 120-kg wheel of cheese that teams rolled in and “broke” – or cut open – unleashing a powerful cloud of odour.

“The aroma of this Emmentaler just hit me,” Farrand said. “That's the first time that that cheese has released its greatness and the aroma ... just makes you hungry.”

Some may turn up their noses at bacteria-blued “bleu” cheeses or reject the strong odours of varieties like Limberger, Taleggio, “Stinking Bishop” and Époisses de Bourgogne – a Burgundy specialty reputed to be Napoleon's favourite, and one so stinky that urban legend claims it's banned from public transport in France.

Others might not get over the hump of hesitation to taste a camel (or buffalo or donkey) cheese, or cringe at unpasteurized or squishy cheeses. More adventurous tasters will try the most gooey or mouldy cheeses, looking for the most rich, creamy or meaty varieties on hand.

For the judges, no such compunction: It's more about scrutiny, savouring, criticism and curiosity.

Scores of judges in yellow aprons circled the rows of long, numbered rectangular tables before digging in. They sliced wedges out of hard cheeses and pressed them to their noses, or used spreaders to scoop up soft cheeses, inspecting the consistency and licking or dribbling them onto their tongues.

The judging zone was set off by a waist-high fence and ropes, and security guards kept watch. Journalists were allowed into the area only under escort, and were only allowed to view and smell the cheeses – not taste or even touch them.

It was a blind taste test for the 265-odd judges on hand: All identifying packaging or marking was removed from the cheeses. Their job was to poke, peruse, sniff, touch and taste the offerings – a tall order with so many to choose from – before making their selections for gold, silver and bronze awards based on attributes like aroma, body, texture, flavour and “mouthfeel.”

Only those honoured as “Super Gold” made the cut for the glitzy “Super Jury” selection of 14 finalist cheeses. The judges – and the public – only found out where the cheeses were from after the voting on each was completed.

Paul Thomas, a cheesemaker from Urstrom Kaese, south of Berlin, sliced into a blue cheese covered with cherries and billed as having hints of a Manhattan cocktail. After tasting it, he said he was “pleasantly surprised throughout most of that flavour journey.”

“But right at the end it leaves me with something just ... it's a slightly off flavour toward the back of the tongue,” he added.

Experts admit that choosing a winner is tricky. While the final products from the “caseiculture” – the curdling, coagulating, cheddaring and other processes involved in making cheeses – can be judged on aspects like craftsmanship and quality, taste is an individual thing.

This year's winner was Swiss: A “spezial” Gruyere from the Vorderfultigen Mountain Dairy about 20 kilometres south of Bern, which scored 85 points from the jury. The raw cow's milk cheese was drained overnight and dry salted before being matured for more than 18 months.

A creamy, flower-sprinkled “Crémeux des Aldudes aux fleurs” from the village of Etxaldia in French Basque country was runner-up, trailed by a 9-month-aged Swiss Appenzeller Edel-Würzig. Other finalists were from Britain, Japan, the Netherlands, Slovakia and the United States.

Many cheeses come away with other accolades: More than 20 were selected as national or regional “bests” – such as best American, Basque-country, Japanese or Ukrainian cheese. Other trophies were given out by category such as the best cheddar, raw-milk, goat or ewe, or smoked cheeses.

While the U.S. state of Wisconsin hosts the World Championship Cheese Contest and a competition in France selects the world's best cheesemonger, organizers of the World Cheese Awards say it's the largest cheese-only event anywhere. The competition started in Britain, but Italy, Spain and Norway have also hosted.

Charlie Turnbull, director of the Academy of Cheese, poked his nose toward a round, soft brownish-orange cheese with a pungent smell caused by the Brevibacterium linens – “a close relative to the kind of bacteria you get in boys' trainers when they're about 15 years old.”

“It's challenging,” Turnbull said with a slight wince. But he added that once one got past the smell, the cheese tasted wonderful, noting “hints of fruit, lots of meaty notes, some ham stock.”

“At the end of the day, taste trumps everything,” he said.

The move prioritizes “political theater over responsible governance,” a group of Democrats said in a statement.

President Donald Trump's order to rebrand the Department of Defense (DOD) as the “Department of War” this past summer will cost billions of dollars, a new report suggests.

In September, Trump issued an executive order seeking to change the department's name. Only a bill passed by Congress and signed into law by the president can make the change official, but the order requires all government agencies within the executive branch to refer to the DOD as the Department of War. 

“This name sharpens the Department's focus on our own national interest and our adversaries' focus on our willingness and availability to wage war to secure what is ours,” Trump's order states.

But the change — which has no impact on the mission, makeup, or strategies of the DOD — comes with financial consequences. 

According to six sources speaking to NBC News — including two senior Republican congressional staffers, two senior Democratic congressional staffers, and two other individuals briefed on the price tag — the name change could cost as much as $2 billion. This includes administrative costs like changing signage (both within the U.S. and around the world), letterheads, employee badges, vast amounts of rewriting coding on websites and internal software, and other items.

Officials at the DOD tried to justify the costs by parroting the language of Trump's executive order.

“The Department of War is aggressively implementing the name change directed by President Trump, and is making the name permanent,” chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said, adding that a “final cost estimate has not been determined at this time” and that the name change “is essential because it reflects the Department's core mission: winning wars.”

The U.S. has conducted hundreds of military operations over the past 100 years, including lengthy invasions and occupations in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan, as well as its current, and likely illegal, attacks on boats in the Caribbean and Pacific. But the last time the government formally declared war was during WWII — meaning that, definitionally speaking, the idea of changing the DOD's name to reflect a mission of “winning wars” is flawed. 

Several signs have already been changed, including one outside the Pentagon that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth installed himself as part of a photo op this week. But other signs have yet to be removed and replaced, NBC News reported.

Republican members of Congress have submitted legislation to make the name change official, but the administration has not formally pushed for lawmakers to prioritize it.

Democrats have decried the DOD's informal change to the Department of War as being “both wasteful and hypocritical.”

The move “appears to prioritize political theater over responsible governance, while diverting resources from core national security functions,” a group of Democratic lawmakers wrote in a letter to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in September, requesting information on cost estimates.

The name change signals that the president and his department heads are willing to spend money on pet projects while making cuts elsewhere, ostensibly justifying doing so as a means of reducing federal spending.

But those cuts have come with huge consequences, including detrimental effects on military veterans. Among the plethora of cuts that occurred under the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” earlier this year, reductions in spending within the Department of Veterans Affairs led to “severe and immediate impacts,” including the cancellation of “life-saving cancer trials,” doctors within the department said in a message to the administration at the time. 

The cuts also meant veterans would “lose access to therapies” and other important treatment options, those doctors added.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Exclusive: Department of Energy officials to meet with White House to tamp down Trump's idea of explosive nuclear testing","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/14/politics/nnsa-nuclear-testing-white-house-meeting-exclusive","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 17:06:15 GMT","


            Top energy and nuclear officials in the Trump administration are planning to meet with the White House and National Security Council in the coming days to dissuade President Donald Trump from resuming testing of the nation's nuclear weapons, sources told CNN.
    


            Energy Secretary Chris Wright, National Nuclear Security Administration leader Brandon M. Williams and officials from the US National Laboratories are planning to inform the White House that they do not think blowing up weapons for nuclear warhead testing, as Trump suggested last month, is tenable, two sources familiar with the matter said. They asked not to be named to discuss a sensitive matter.
    


            It's the latest sign of fallout from Trump's October social media post instructing the Department of Defense to start testing nuclear weapons “because of other countries testing programs.”
    


            But NNSA, which falls under the Department of Energy, is the federal agency responsible for building and testing bombs and maintaining the nuclear stockpile, not the Defense Department.
    


            A White House official reiterated on Thursday that “because of other countries' testing programs, President Trump has instructed the Department of War and Department of Energy to test our nuclear weapons on an equal basis.”
    


            “Nothing has been eliminated from consideration as all decision-making authority lies with the President,” the White House official added.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Department of Energy.
    


            Today, the US tests every part of its nuclear weapons systems except for the explosive nuclear material in warheads. The last full-scale nuclear weapons test was done in the US in 1992, and the practice was banned by former President Bill Clinton in 1996.
    


            Trump's recent suggestion the US could resume nuclear testing comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin boasted in October that Moscow had successfully tested a Poseidon nuclear-powered torpedo.
    


            “The reason I'm saying — testing is because Russia announced that they were gonna be doing a test,” Trump told “60 Minutes” recently. “If you notice, North Korea's testing constantly. Other countries are testing,” he said, adding: “I don't wanna be the only country that doesn't test.”
    


            At the upcoming White House meeting, NNSA and DOE officials will be prepared to tell the administration that “there's not going to be any testing” involving exploding nuclear materials and will seek to steer the White House into a workable plan that doesn't involve blowing anything up, one source said.
    


            The source said officials hoped it would give the president the opportunity to align himself with NNSA's approach.
    


            However, Trump has the authority to order the tests anyway if he doesn't agree with the nuclear experts.
    


            An NNSA spokesperson declined to comment. “NNSA does not comment on ongoing or potential private meetings with the White House, especially regarding matters of nuclear security,” NNSA spokesperson Mariza Smajlaj told CNN in a statement.
    


            Mere minutes before he was due to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in Korea last month, Trump took to Truth Social to say that he had directed the “Department of War” to “start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.”
    


            Inside the NNSA, Trump's initial October suggestion was met with confusion, the sources said.
    


            “Nobody saw this coming,” one of them said.
    


            Wright, Trump's energy secretary, told Fox News earlier this month that US nuclear tests are “system tests” and “not nuclear explosions.”
    


            A senior White House official, when pressed this week on what exactly the president meant by his initial comments, told CNN that Trump was being “purposefully vague” in his calls to resume nuclear testing.
    


            The official argued the president became fixated on the idea while on his trip to Asia, telling CNN that some foreign leaders brought the issue up to Trump directly while he was abroad. 



            Another administration official argued that they viewed the president's comments as wanting to do more testing on nuclear-capable missiles, rather than detonating nuclear bombs.
    


            So far, Trump's comments haven't changed agency policy: No plans are underway for exploding nuclear weapons for testing purposes. One source told CNN that no one in the administration has explained to those in the agency what exactly Trump meant by his comments.
    


            NNSA officials recently prepared a memo for Wright and Williams outlining all the things the agency does to make sure its weapons are up to speed, including supercomputer bomb simulations and test flights of non-explosive warheads, the sources told CNN.
    


            That memo also lays out what the timeline would be if the administration directed NNSA to go back to nuclear testing like Trump had suggested. One source said it would take 36 months of underground testing at a minimum to obtain scientifically useful data, but that timeline could get much longer if the federal government were sued by environmental or other groups to delay or stop the testing.
    


            “If they wanted to just make the ground shake, you could probably do that sooner, but there wouldn't be a purpose to the test beyond political signaling,” the source said.
    


            If the US returned to nuclear testing, it would be done in Nevada – at the only underground site designed to explode nuclear weapons. That space sits on federal land in a vast desert, but the state government would also need to sign off on the testing – another thorny issue.
    


            “There's a big resistance from states about dealing with nuclear materials like we used to,” the source said.
    


            There is also the matter of legacy cleanup of nuclear waste due to decades of nuclear testing in Nevada. Testing has had devastating health impacts on nearby downwind communities, from radiation exposure to illnesses like cancer.
    


            There is no need for weapons testing, as the US still has a lot of “really good data” from Cold War-era nuclear testing, one of the sources said.
    


            There are concerns that if the US resumed testing, China could also use it as an excuse to perform nuclear tests — something it says it is not currently doing — raising the geopolitical temperature across the globe.
    


            Neither Beijing nor Moscow have tested a nuclear warhead in many decades, according to experts.
    


            In response to questions about whether the Trump administration has more intelligence on Russia and China's nuclear activities than what is publicly known, a person who worked in the West Wing during Trump's first term, including on national security issues, told CNN: “It would be hard for either country to blow up nuclear warheads underground and keep that quiet. That's not happening.”

President Donald Trump said Friday he will ask Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's ties to many other high-profile figures, in an extraordinary step that comes just days after Democrats released emails from the late Epstein that mention him.
    


            Trump announced the directive in a Truth Social post that accused Democrats of trying to revive attention to his past ties with Epstein, contending they are “using the Epstein Hoax, involving Democrats, not Republicans, to try and deflect from their disastrous SHUTDOWN, and all of their other failures.”
    


            “I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,” Trump wrote.
    


            The move represents the president's most significant effort yet to discredit the push by Democrats and some Republicans to release all of the Epstein case files. And it serves as the latest example of Trump's belief that he can defuse the issue through sheer force of will, despite deepening fears among allies that his actions are only further amplifying it while damaging his own credibility.
    


            “Why doesn't he just release these? Just release them!” conservative podcast host Megyn Kelly said of the Epstein files during her show on Wednesday. “Now he's in a position of being, like, singled out as the only one, allegedly, as opposed to one of a slew of names.”
    


            Trump earlier this week tried and failed to convince Republicans to block a discharge petition in the US House forcing a vote on the release of the Justice Department's Epstein files, with the White House even holding a Situation Room meeting with one key GOP lawmaker who had signed on ahead of it receiving its decisive 218th signature.
    


            Officials during that meeting argued that the administration was not hiding anything, according to a senior White House official, including showing GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert unreleased documents obtained by the House Oversight Committee but they could not change her mind.
    


            The White House's approach to the Epstein case and its subsequent fallout has perplexed even some administration officials and Trump allies, some of whom have been telling him and his advisers to change strategy for months.
    


            In recent days, at least one ally on Capitol Hill directly told Trump that he was getting bad advice on his approach to the Epstein case by continuing to delay and downplay it, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            “These people have no idea what advice the president is getting,” another senior White House official said.
    


            The first senior White House official pushed back on the idea that the White House had been caught flat footed, noting that the administration, while aware of the emails, intentionally did not want to insert Epstein back into the news cycle. Asked about the message to the president from that congressional ally, a White House spokesperson reiterated that the emails released earlier this week “prove literally nothing” and pivoted to attacking Democrats for trying to use the Epstein “hoax” to distract from the shutdown.
    


            Multiple other sources told CNN that Trump himself has dictated the administration's response to Epstein-related developments, specifically opposing any actions that risk pushing the storyline forward.
    


            “Trump doesn't want his people to get ahead of it. Everybody has been instructed to wait until information comes out and then respond that it is a hoax or doesn't prove anything,” one of the sources said.
    


            In the House, Speaker Mike Johnson now plans to schedule a vote on releasing the Epstein files next week, in a strategic shift spurred by the realization that it could not be stopped. The vote is expected to attract significant support from rank-and-file GOP lawmakers.
    


            The president has declined to take questions from the press since the House Oversight Committee's release on Wednesday of emails Epstein wrote that mentioned Trump by name. Trump did not receive or send any of the messages, which largely predate his time as president, and he has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.
    


            But on Friday, Trump again vented his frustration over the state of affairs in a series of Truth Social posts, blasting Republicans backing the Epstein files release as “soft and foolish” and repeatedly branding the issue a “Hoax.”
    


            “This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats,” Trump wrote in one post.
    


            He announced his demand for a Justice Department investigation into “many other people and institutions” in a subsequent Truth Social post.
    


            In thousands of emails reviewed by CNN, Epstein corresponded with a wide group of powerful and influential people, including prominent Democrats.
    


            Among his most frequent communications were with former Obama White House chief counsel Kathryn Ruemmler, who represented Epstein as his attorney, and Summers, the former Clinton Treasury secretary and Obama National Economic Council director. (Corresponding with Epstein would not be a crime, and there's no evidence in the emails that any of them participated in Epstein's wrongdoing.)
    


            The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CNN has reached out to Clinton, Summers and Hoffman.
    


            In a statement, JPMorgan Chase spokesperson Patricia Wexler said the bank “ended our relationship with him years before his arrest on sex trafficking charges.”
    


            JPMorgan paid $290 million in 2023 to settle a class action lawsuit filed by Epstein's survivors that alleged it turned a blind eye to unusual cash transactions that they claimed enabled Epstein's sex trafficking. JPMorgan also paid $75 million to settle with the US Virgin Islands. The bank did not admit or deny any wrongdoing in either settlement.
    


            “The government had damning information about his crimes and failed to share it with us or other banks,” Wexler said. “We regret any association we had with the man, but did not help him commit his heinous acts.”

            As sports gambling accusations spread through Major League Baseball, the NBA and college basketball, the NCAA has one week to decide whether to adopt a proposed rule change that would allow college athletes and staff to bet on professional sports.
    


            The presumption from many in college athletics can be best summed up by one coach, who asked not to be named – “There's no way that happens, right?”
    


            And yet, to rescind the proposal that would OK betting on professional sports, two-thirds of the Division I member schools must submit paperwork by 5 p.m. ET on Friday, November 21.
    


            A source tells CNN that “as of right now, we are not meeting that threshold.''
    


             If the needed 241 (out of 361) D1 schools do not respond, the change will go into effect on November 22.
    


            For years, college athletes, coaches and staff members were prohibited from betting on any sport in which the NCAA crowns a champion. Horse racing, for example, was OK; baseball, football, basketball and hockey were not.
    


            But as sports betting becomes legal in more and more states and readily available to regular college students, the NCAA argued, that although it was not encouraging athletes to bet, prohibiting them from gambling on pro sports no longer made sense.
    


            Betting on college sports will remain a no-no.
    


            “This change recognizes the realities of today's sports environment without compromising our commitment to protecting the integrity of college competition or the well-being of student-athletes,'' Roberta Page, director of athletics at Slippery Rock and chair of the Division II Management Council, said in an NCAA statement.
    


            The change was initially meant to go into effect on November 1.
    


            A week earlier, the feds unsealed an indictment alleging two separate sports gambling schemes - one involving rigged poker games, the other point shaving - that included members of three New York crime families, two NBA players and an NBA head coach.
    


            The timing created immediate blowback at the NCAA's proposal.

            Southeastern Conference commissioner Greg Sankey wrote to NCAA president Charlie Baker, urging him to reconsider.
    


            “On behalf of our universities, I write to urge action by the NCAA Division I Board of Directors to rescind this change and reaffirm the Association's commitment to maintaining strong standards that keep college participants separated from sports wagering at every level,'' Sankey wrote in a letter obtained by ESPN.
    


            Three days later, the NCAA announced it was delaying its decision, but not because of public outrage. It was because less than 75 percent of the cabinet member votes were in favor of the change, prompting an automatic 30-day rescission process.
    


            It is worth noting that, of the 20 cabinet members who voted, and despite their commissioner's protests, the two representing the SEC - Jeremiah Donati, the athletic director at South Carolina, and Matt Boyer, the SEC's assistant commissioner for compliance - both voted in favor of the proposal per the NCAA committee's report.
    


            Of the eight people representing the four power conferences (each of whose votes is weighted: 2.75 versus 1), both ACC representatives voted against the initial proposal, the Big Ten and SEC voted in favor, and the Big 12 split its vote.
    


            In the three weeks since the NCAA implemented its rescission period, two MLB pitchers have been indicted for rigging games and six college basketball players from three separate schools have been permanently banned from NCAA competition for game fixing.
    


            On Thursday, the New Jersey Attorney General's office announced 14 people, including student athletes, were charged for running an illegal online sports betting scheme in conjunction with members of the Lucchese crime family.

Thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee offer a new glimpse into what Jeffery Epstein's relationships with business executives, reporters, academics and political players looked like over a decade.

They start with messages he sent and received around the time he finished serving his Florida sentence in 2009 and continue until the months before his arrest on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019.

During that time, Epstein's network was eclectic, spanning the globe and political affiliations: from the liberal academic Noam Chomsky to Steve Bannon, the longtime ally of President Donald Trump.

The emails don't implicate his contacts in those alleged crimes. They instead paint a picture of Epstein's influence and connections over the years he was a registered sex offender.

Here's the latest:

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said air traffic controllers received 70% of their back pay Friday for working during the shutdown.

A number of controllers called out of work during the shutdown as they dealt with the financial pressure from going without pay for so long.

Some controllers even got side jobs to help make ends meet. That led to delays and other flight disruptions when the Federal Aviation Administration ran short of controllers at airport towers and other radar facilities.

Controller staffing improved significantly earlier this week as the shutdown drew to a close. Duffy said earlier this week that controllers would receive the rest of their back pay in the next few paychecks.

Duffy and President Donald Trump have also proposed that controllers who didn't miss a shift during the shutdown should receive $10,000 bonuses. But the details of exactly who might get those checks haven't been released.

Democratic members of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure asked federal officials for an explanation of the decision to cut up to 10% of flights at 40 major airports during the shutdown, along with details on staffing levels and how airports were chosen.

“It appears that the administration made this decision without adequate coordination with key aviation stakeholders,” said Friday's letter to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford, .

The group requested a briefing and written response by Nov. 20.

The FAA on Wednesday froze reductions at 6%, shortly before a deal was reached to end the shutdown. Requests for comment were sent to the department and FAA.

The president is planning to attend the World Economic Forum's meeting in Switzerland in January, according to a senior White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity to share plans that were not yet publicly announced.

The annual meeting in the Swiss Alps draws world leaders, business executives, celebrities and, sometimes, U.S. presidents. Trump attended in his first term in 2018 and 2020.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement is working with state and local law enforcement agencies to carry out welfare checks on roughly 450,000 migrant children.

They said the program kicked off Nov. 10 in Florida.

The administration launched a similar effort earlier  this year, but this one includes state and local law enforcement agencies authorized to work with ICE.

Migrant children traveling alone initially stay in government shelters before being released to sponsors.

Under the Biden administration, officials tried to release children to eligible sponsors within 30 days, reuniting many families quickly.

But there were problems, including some children released to adults who forced them to work illegally.

Migrant advocates are suspicious that the Trump administration's efforts could end up being a way to deport sponsors or children.

The effects of the rush to redraw U.S. political maps ahead of next year's midterm elections can be seen in the contrasts between two very different places now in the same Missouri congressional district.

The 18th and Vine area in Kansas City is predominately Black, once known for jazz joints and the meeting that created professional baseball's National Negro League when the established major leagues barred Black players. Boonville is a small, mostly white town set in an area teeming with cattle and row crops.

People in both areas worry about being ignored in the new district.

The incumbent is Democrat Emanuel Cleaver, who preached about racial justice as a Methodist minister and has worked for decades for federally funded projects in 18th and Vine. Boonville's decades-long project is a trail favored by cycling enthusiasts.

But their differences are deeper and extend to issues such as health care, education and gun rights.

A union representing federal prison workers is suing the Bureau of Prisons after the agency said it was canceling its collective bargaining agreement.

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in Connecticut federal court, seeks an injunction to block what the Council of Prison Locals union called an “arbitrary and capricious” move that has jeopardized the livelihoods of the agency's nearly 35,000 employees.

Bureau of Prisons Director William K. Marshall III announced the termination for the collective bargaining agreement Sept. 25, citing President Trump's executive order in March that exempts certain federal agencies from collective bargaining or recognizing employee labor unions.

Marshall said the union had become “an obstacle to progress instead of a partner in it.”

The union, in its lawsuit, contends the Bureau of Prisons failed to provide “any reasoned explanation” for its decision, as required under federal law.

The Swiss government says it's reached a deal with the United States to reduce U.S. tariffs on the rich Alpine country to 15% from 39%, which had been the steepest Trump administration tariff level faced by a developed Western country.

The Swiss Federal Council, the country's seven-member executive branch, said “Thank you President Trump for the constructive engagement” in a post on its X account.

Steve Sadow said he's confident that “fair and impartial review” will lead to a dismissal of the case against Trump.

“This politically charged prosecution has to come to an end,” he said in an email.

The president kicked off his Friday with posts on social media complaining about Democratic lawmakers focusing on thousands of documents from Epstein's estate released this week by the House Oversight Committee.

Trump called it a “hoax” and a distraction from Democrats' policies and the “EMBARASSMENT” of the government shutdown and decried “Weak Republicans” who “have fallen into their clutches because they are soft and foolish.” Trump seemed to be referring to the House Republican who are joining Democrats in a push to release files related to the sex trafficking investigation into Epstein.

Trump said Epstein is “not the Republican's problem” and “don't waste your time with Trump. I have a Country to run!”

“While it would have been simple to allow Judge McAfee's deadline to lapse or to inform the Court that no conflict prosecutor could be secured — thereby allowing the case to be dismissed for want of prosecution — I did not believe that to be the right course of action,” Pete Skandalakis wrote in a statement. “The public has a legitimate interest in the outcome of this case. Accordingly, it is important that someone make an informed and transparent determination about how best to proceed.”

That included those charged in Georgia. But that doesn't affect state charges.

The leader of a nonpartisan organization announced he will take over the Georgia election interference case against President Trump and others after Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis was removed from the case.

The Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia was tasked with finding someone to lead the case after Willis was disqualified over an “appearance of impropriety” created by a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she'd chosen to lead it. The organization's executive director, Pete Skandalakis, said Friday that he would take the case on himself.

While it's unlikely that any action against Trump could proceed while he's the sitting president, there are 14 other people still facing charges in the case, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former New York mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani.

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on CNBC on Friday that the White House plans to post details of the deal online Friday.

Greer said the agreement will see Switzerland move manufacturing of some pharmaceuticals, gold smelting and railway equipment to the United States.

Antifa-Ost — a German network suspected in attacks on people it perceived as fascists — was among four European left-wing groups designated as terrorist organizations by the Trump administration Thursday.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Josef Hinterseher said at a regular news conference in Berlin that his ministry has “taken note” of the designation. Asked whether the German government was contacted beforehand, he replied that “the U.S. decided independently on this.”

Interior Ministry spokesperson Sarah Frühauf said “we don't evaluate the decisions and assessments of other states, so I also have no assessment of whether we consider this proportionate or disproportionate.”

Trump does not have any pubic events on his schedule for today, but this evening he will travel to Mar-a-Lago.

Trump's administration on Thursday designated four European left-wing groups as terrorist organizations, following through on his vow to crack down on leftists after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

The networks targeted by Trump's administration all appear to be based in Europe, with no operations in the U.S. They are an Italian anarchist front that sent explosive packages to the then-president of the European Commission in 2003, two Greek networks believed to have planted bombs outside riot police and labor department buildings in Athens, and an anti-fascist group whose members were prosecuted by German authorities for a hammer attack against neo-Nazis in Dresden.

Europe has a long history of left-wing political violence, while in the United States political violence has been more likely to come from the right in recent decades, according to multiple studies, including by the Justice Department. However, there's been an uptick in American political attacks across ideologies in recent years, culminating in the September fatal shooting of Kirk by a gunman who prosecutors contend was driven by hostility toward Kirk's stance against transgenderism and other positions.

The frameworks are about increasing the ability of U.S. firms to sell industrial and agricultural products in these countries, according to a senior administration official who insisted on anonymity as a condition for briefing reporters on a call about the agreements.

The White House also released statements on the frameworks, which have yet to be finalized and are expected to be signed within roughly two weeks. It's all part of a broader effort by President Donald Trump to rewrite the rules of global commerce through the use of broad tariffs.

President Javier Milei of Argentina hailed his country's first bilateral trade framework with the U.S. in nearly a decade as “tremendous news.”

“As you can see, we are strongly committed to making Argentina great again,” he said.

Epstein emailed current and former political figures on all sides, sending news clips and discussing strategy or gossip often in short, choppy emails laden with spelling and grammatical errors.

In several emails in 2018, Epstein advised Bannon on his political tour of Europe that year after Bannon forwarded Epstein a news clip that the German media underestimated Bannon and that he was “As Dangerous as Ever.”

“luv it,” Epstein responded.

Epstein wrote that he'd just spoken to “one of the country leaders that we discussed” and that “we should lay out a strategy plan. . how much fun.”

Just a few months earlier, Epstein was insulting Trump — whose movement Bannon was a representative of — in emails to Kathryn Ruemmler, the former White House counsel under President Barack Obama.

Ruemmler sent a message to Epstein calling Trump “so gross.” A portion of that message was redacted, but Epstein replied, “worse in real life and upclose.”

Trump and Epstein were friends for years but at some point had a falling out, even before underage girls started to come forward to accuse Epstein of sexual abuse.

Journalists sometimes reached out to Epstein, perhaps hoping he might have dirt to spill on Trump. One of those writers was Michael Wolff, who has written extensively about Trump. In a 2019 email to Wolff, Epstein mentioned that one of his best-known accusers, Virginia Giuffre, had worked at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.

“She was the one who accused Prince Andrew,” Epstein wrote.

Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year, had said that Epstein's longtime companion Ghislaine Maxwell recruited her from Mar-a-Lago to give sexualized massages to Epstein. And Trump had long claimed that he banned Epstein from coming to Mar-a-Lago.

Epstein said in an email to Wolff that Trump hadn't asked him to resign from the club, because he hadn't been a member.

“Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,” Epstein added.

By the time Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, he had established an enormous network of wealthy and influential friends. Emails made public this week show the crime did little to diminish the desire of that network to stay connected to the billionaire financier.

Thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday offer a new glimpse into what Epstein's relationships with business executives, reporters, academics and political players looked like over a decade.

During that time, Epstein's network was eclectic, spanning the globe and political affiliations: from the liberal academic Noam Chomsky to Steve Bannon, the longtime ally of President Donald Trump.

Some reached out to support Epstein amid lawsuits and prosecutions, others sought introductions or advice on everything from dating to oil prices. One consulted him on how to respond to accusations of sexual harassment.

Epstein was charged with sex trafficking in 2019, and killed himself in jail a month later. Epstein's crimes, high-profile connections and jailhouse suicide have made the case a magnet for conspiracy theorists and online sleuths seeking proof of a cover-up.

As AI data centers use more electricity, the solar industry is ramping up to provide more power.

Texas startup Janta Power has secured $5.5 million in seed funding to expand its next-generation solar power towers, a vertical alternative to flat solar farms. The funding round was led by MaC Venture Capital with support from Collab Capital. The investment shows strong confidence in 3D solar systems that can reshape renewable energy worldwide.

Traditional solar panels cover large flat areas on rooftops or open fields. This approach uses a lot of land and misses much of the day's available sunlight. The sun moves across the sky, but flat panels capture energy best only when it is directly overhead.

Janta Power takes a different approach. The company's pivoting solar towers stack panels vertically to create a compact three-dimensional structure that captures more sunlight throughout the day. Think of it as the solar version of a skyscraper: more power from less ground space.

NEVER NEED AN EV CHARGING STATION AGAIN WITH THESE ROOFTOP SOLAR POWER PANELS

Each tower uses smart tracking software that follows the sun's path from sunrise to sunset. By adjusting its position throughout the day, the system collects more sunlight than traditional fixed panels. This design allows the towers to produce about 50% more energy while using only one-third of the land required by flat-panel systems.

Because of their vertical orientation, the towers can capture sunlight during early morning and late afternoon when flat arrays are least efficient. The result is a steadier flow of electricity across the entire day, reducing stress on power grids and lowering the need for short-term backup plants.

Janta's towers are also built for strength. Each structure can withstand winds up to 170 miles per hour. The towers feature durable steel frames and modular foundations that simplify installation in a wide range of environments.

Pilot programs are already operating at Munich International Airport, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and facilities managed by Aena, which oversees more than 70 airports worldwide. 

The company's 3D geometry gives each site a capacity factor of around 32%, compared to roughly 22% for flat panels. This greater efficiency lowers the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) to about $0.05 per kilowatt-hour, well below the global average of $0.15.

That advantage can make renewable power more accessible for industries such as data centers, universities and telecom operations that need reliable and consistent energy.

For businesses and communities, Janta Power's technology could mean smaller solar installations that deliver more energy for less money. Because the towers need less land, they can fit into urban areas, airports or industrial zones that could not host traditional solar farms.

For everyday consumers, these innovations can bring cleaner, more stable and more affordable power to local grids while supporting a greener energy future.

The longest government shutdown in history is over, but appropriators still have a long way to go to get nine of the 12 necessary funding bills over the finish line by Jan. 31, 2026.

The government reopened after 43 days, following the House's passage, mostly along party lines, with six Democrats voting in favor and two Republicans voting against, of a legislative package that extended funding until the end of January and included three appropriations bills.

However, with the new January deadline, appropriators are up against the clock, as both chambers must now agree on the nine remaining bills so they can be sent to President Donald Trump's desk before funding runs out once again.

Beginning Thursday, there are 57 weekdays until Jan. 31, but the House is only set to be in session for another 17 days, with the Senate in session for 20 days for the remainder of 2025. The House, in particular, is backlogged after being out of session for 54 days, already eyeing a stock trading bill and legislation to release the Jeffrey Epstein files.

As of now, the House has passed all 12 appropriations bills out of committee and passed the defense and energy bills on the floor, with defense gaining bipartisan support. The Senate, meanwhile, has passed eight of the 12 bills out of committee, but only the three in the minibus have made it to the floor.

House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole (R-OK) said the three-bill minibus and the January funding patch would “buy us time” to see how much “damage was done” during the shutdown.

“There's a lot of bipartisan things in them, but we need to sit down and go forward with the others,” Cole told reporters outside the Rules Committee hearing room on Tuesday night. “I still think that the biggest problem here all along has been Democratic leadership's decision to link this to Medicaid, which there's no way the Republicans are going to undo what they did in the big, beautiful bill.”

He had remained bullish that the appropriations process could move fast once the government reopened, telling the Washington Examiner last month he thought the remaining nine bills could be wrapped up by the end of December.

“Our numbers are a lot closer together than most people seem to realize,” Cole said Tuesday. “We know that those numbers, when we put them there, we're going to have to bargain up, because the Senate is going to spend more.”

Rep. Mike Simpson (R-ID), chairman of the interior subcommittee, told the Washington Examiner that he remains “optimistic” the appropriators can get back on track now that the government has reopened.

“I'm confident that under Speaker Johnson alongside House Leadership, and Chairman Cole, we will continue to restore regular order and pass the remaining appropriations bills,” Simpson said in a statement.

However, having a December CR was unlikely to garner any support from fiscal hawks such as those in the Freedom Caucus, whose considerable numbers could easily sink any bill, thanks to Speaker Mike Johnson's (R-LA) razor-thin majority. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins (R-ME) also would not hear of a December CR, instead favoring something that went into the new year.

Disagreements among the “four corners,” or the appropriations chairmen and ranking members in the House and Senate, that popped up during the shutdown fight signal more choppy waters ahead.

Only three of the four corners approved the minibus, after Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, refused to sign off on it.

“It is unfortunate Senate Republicans prematurely released partial text of the minibus without getting agreement from all corners,” DeLauro said. “While the military construction bill is better than the full-year CR, those programs were funded under for 2025. It is important to place it in the context of the entire legislative package that will be considered.”

DeLauro pointed to getting the rug pulled out from under her to reporters on Wednesday. She also claimed that the 54 days during which the House was out on recess could have been used for appropriators to work on bills.

“So my concern is that we're going to be here in the same situation on Jan. 30,” the ranking member said. “Because we've come to that, there really is a lack of trust. How do you believe people?”

The minibus only accounted for about 10% of the roughly $1.8 trillion it takes for Congress to fund various federal agencies. Under the Jan. 31 CR, all programs except those for veterans, food aid, farmer assistance, and legislative branch operations will remain funded at the Biden-era spending levels set by Congress in March 2024.

The remaining nine bills are expected to be even more complicated to pass, including the labor and health and human services appropriations bill, which is one of the most contentious and expensive.

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) acknowledged that there were more choppy waters ahead earlier this month after Trump signed the deal to end the shutdown.

“We've got to just find a resolution to get the lights back on,” Scalise said. “But the real negotiation is going to be: Can we get an agreement on how to properly fund the government with individual appropriations bills, packages of appropriations bills?”

The Senate is already eyeing a loophole to try to tie funding for the Pentagon and other agencies to House legislation sanctioning the International Criminal Court, as previously reported by the Washington Examiner.

By doing this, leadership could overcome a Senate rule that lets any one senator object to bundling two or more spending bills into a package known as a minibus. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) plans to put the Pentagon bill, as well as three other bills funding the departments of Labor, Transportation, Justice, and Health and Human Services, as soon as next Tuesday.

The strategy signals some lawmakers see the writing on the wall: that their troubles are far from over.

“We'll move as fast as we can so we're not waiting until the Jan. 30 deadline,” Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK), an adviser to Thune, told reporters Monday evening. “But you guys have been here long enough — we'll probably be having this conversation Jan. 28.”

Others are bullish that if they can move on to another minibus, they can avoid another shutdown come winter.

“If we do that, we'll have 87% of the government funded … so you really take away the risk of the shutdown, because you've got the work done,” Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND) said.

Other hiccups, such as the Trump administration's recessions requests and a last-minute Senate FBI provision tucked into the spending deal, are a cause for concern for Democratic appropriators that they will not be able to achieve a bipartisan negotiation.

“President Trump and Russ Vought's illegal stealing of funds from American communities has made it difficult to reach any appropriations agreement,” DeLauro said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “Those challenges are compounded by Senate Republicans' decision to secretly insert language into the Legislative Branch bill that would aid January 6th insurrectionists.”

“Democrats are ready to negotiate spending bills on a bipartisan basis that lower costs for families and protect Congress's constitutional power of the purse,” she added.

Johnson said he was “proud” of Congress being able to pass three appropriations bills through the minibus, but he was “really sad that it took us so long to get here.”

TRUMP RAGES AT DEMOCRATS AND THE FILIBUSTER IN SIGNING BILL TO END GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

“There was so much pain that had to be endured to get to this point,” Johnson told reporters during a victory lap after the House passed the spending deal to end the shutdown.

“So now that we've got the lights back on, we've got the government reopened … the Republicans will get right back to work that we promised the American people that we would do.”

Thus far, the justices have signaled they may not let him — yet.

About a month ago, Trump v. Illinois looked like it was going to be one of the most consequential Supreme Court decisions of the entire Trump era. The case concerns President Donald Trump's attempt to deploy National Guard troops to an immigration facility in Broadview, Illinois, in order to suppress a small protest that has ranged in size from a few dozen people to about 200.

After two lower courts ruled that Trump's use of the National Guard in this way is illegal, Trump asked the Supreme Court — which has a Republican majority that frequently rules in his favor — to greenlight his use of troops in mid-October.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

Yet, in a break from their ordinary practice, the Court signaled in an October 29 order that they are skeptical of many of Trump's legal arguments. And they asked for additional briefing on a question that neither party raised to the justices. The first round of those new briefs were filed on November 10, and the Court is likely to rule on the case after briefing completes on Monday, November 17.

The upshot is that Trump's attempt to send troops to Broadview remains blocked by the lower court orders, at least for now. The Court's October 29 order, moreover, suggests that the justices may look to delay a showdown on whether and when Trump can use the military against Americans on US soil until a future case.

For now, in other words, the stakes of the Illinois case may be somewhat diminished. But, even if the Court does rule against Trump, that will likely only punt the question of when Trump is allowed to deploy troops against Americans until a future date.

Beginning in September, a small group of people have protested the Trump administration's immigration policies outside of a detention facility in Broadview. According to Judge April Perry, a federal district judge who ruled against Trump's use of troops, “the typical number of protestors is fewer than fifty,” and “the crowd has never exceeded 200.”

Some members of this small group of protesters have also been charged with crimes. Some allegedly vandalized federal law enforcement vehicles, and others have been arrested for more serious crimes such as aggravated battery.

When Illinois first reached the Supreme Court, the case seemed to turn on whether federal law permits using National Guard members against such a minor protest. Ordinarily, the National Guard is under the command and control of state governments. But Trump relied on a federal law that permits the president to take command of the Guard if there is “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States” or if “the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

In their initial brief to the justices, Trump's lawyers made some very aggressive arguments. Among other things, they claimed that the decision to take control of National Guard members “is committed exclusively to the president” and cannot be reviewed by federal courts. They also claimed that the small group of protesters constitutes a “rebellion” that justifies military force.

But, in their October 29 order, the justices dodged these questions and instead asked for briefing on an unrelated question: “Whether the term ‘regular forces' refers to the regular forces of the United States military, and, if so, how that interpretation affects the operation of” the relevant federal statute.

The fact that the Court did not immediately rule for Trump on his more aggressive arguments suggests that a majority of the justices are skeptical of them. There would be no need, for example, to parse the meaning of the words “regular forces” if Trump's decision to deploy troops against protesters cannot be reviewed by the courts.

It is likely, moreover, that the justices are sympathetic to a reading of these two words that would require them to rule against Trump in the Illinois case. But a ruling against him on these narrow grounds would merely delay the question of whether and when Trump can use the military against Americans on US soil.

Recall that federal law permits the president to use the National Guard to quell domestic unrest if “the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.” Prior to the Supreme Court's October 29 order, both the Trump administration and the lower courts read the phrase “regular forces” to refer to civilian law enforcement officials. Thus, as Trump's lawyers presented the case to the justices, Illinois turned on whether Trump was unable to enforce US law in Broadview without relying on the military at all.

But an amicus brief filed by Georgetown law professor Marty Lederman argues that the words “regular forces” refers, not to civilian law enforcement, but to “the standing military forces of the Armed Services, within the Department of Defense.” Thus, under Lederman's reading, Trump may only deploy the National Guard to enforce domestic law if he has first demonstrated that he is unable to enforce the law using the actual Army or Marines.

And it appears that Lederman's argument is sufficiently persuasive that it convinced a majority of the justices to seek additional briefing from Trump and from the Illinois plaintiffs on whether Lederman is correct.

To understand Lederman's argument, it's helpful to understand some of the history of the National Guard. Many of the United States's founders feared a permanent, national, standing army; as the Supreme Court summarized this fear in a 1990 opinion, “there was a widespread fear that a national standing Army posed an intolerable threat to individual liberty and to the sovereignty of the separate States.”

Instead, the framers imagined that states would maintain a militia that would generally operate under the state's control. But the Constitution also permitted Congress to call this militia into federal service “to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions.”

The framers' original vision of a nation with no permanent federal army obviously no longer describes America's relationship with the military. The United States has the most powerful standing military forces in the world. By the dawn of the 20th century, the state militias had, in the Supreme Court's words, “proved to be a decidedly unreliable fighting force.” President Theodore Roosevelt warned that the laws governing these militias were “obsolete and worthless.”

In 1901, Roosevelt asked Congress to enact new legislation that would replace the atrophied militias with what became the modern-day National Guard. Notably, Roosevelt's message to Congress proposed that the armaments and other resources provided to this new militia should “be made identical with those provided for the regular forces.”

Congress responded with the regrettably named Dick Act of 1903 (the law is named after Rep. Charles Dick, who chaired an important congressional committee), which established “the organized militia, to be known as the National Guard of the State, Territory, or District of Columbia.”

As originally enacted, the Dick Act permitted the president to use the National Guard when he is “unable, with the other forces at his command, to execute the laws of the Union in any part thereof.” But Congress amended the law in 1908 to something more similar to the modern version. The 1908 version provided that the president may use the National Guard when he “is unable with the regular forces at his command to execute the laws of the Union in any part thereof.”

According to the Senate Committee on Military Affairs, this change was made to ensure that the National Guard would be the “second line of defense” after the use of other military forces. (Congress removed the words “at his command” in 1956 because it deemed them to be “surplusage.”)

In any event, much of Lederman's brief is a long list of historical examples showing that Congress used the words “regular forces” to distinguish a standing federal military from state militias. An 1806 law, for example, provides that militiamen are subject to the same rules of military justice as federal troops when “acting in conjunction with the regular forces of the United States.” A broader 1814 law concerned court martials of militiamen serving under the United States “whether acting in conjunction with the regular forces or otherwise.”

The Supreme Court also used the term “regular forces” in this way around the time that the Dick Act was enacted and first amended. In McClaughry v. Deming (1902), for example, the Court referred to the “substantial difference between the regular forces and the militia.”

There's more. But suffice to say, a majority of the justices appear to have found his evidence persuasive enough to set aside the Trump administration's arguments and instead demand additional briefing on the meaning of the term “regular forces.”

Unless you are a fan of military forces in US streets, the implications of Lederman's argument may seem alarming. If Trump isn't allowed to use the National Guard without first attempting to use the regular Army or the Marines, then he is likely to deploy the regular Army or the Marines against Americans protesting his policies.

But there are other laws that govern the use of regular military forces within the United States. One is the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the use of those forces “to execute the laws” except “under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.” Another law, commonly known as the Insurrection Act, permits the president to use the military to “suppress, in a State, any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy” — but only in limited circumstances laid out in that statute.

The Justice Department has long interpreted these circumstances very narrowly. In a 1964 memorandum signed by then-Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach, for example, the DOJ concluded that the Insurrection Act may only be used if “state authorities are either directly involved, by acting or failing to act, in denials of federal rights of a dimension requiring federal military action, or are so helpless in the face of private violence that the private activity has taken on the character of state action.”

Barring a court order permitting the use of troops, moreover, Katzenbach concluded that military force is only allowed under the Insurrection Act when “those engaging in violence are either acting with the approval of state authorities or have, like the Klan in the 1870s, taken over effective control of the area involved.”

Needless to say, the small group of protesters in Broadview hasn't come close to seizing control of that region in the same way that the Ku Klux Klan dominated many parts of the South in the post-Civil War era.

Still, the fact that the Justice Department has long interpreted the Insurrection Act narrowly does not mean that either the Trump administration or this Supreme Court — which is ordinarily so sycophantic toward Trump that it literally held that he is allowed to use the powers of the presidency to commit crimes — will read the same law as narrowly.

But a legal showdown over the meaning of the Insurrection Act is not currently before the Court.

JPMorgan Chase has secured deals ensuring it will get paid by the fintech firms responsible for nearly all the data requests made by third-party apps connected to customer bank accounts, CNBC has learned.

The bank has signed updated contracts with the fintech middlemen that make up more than 95% of the data pulls on its systems, including Plaid, Yodlee, Morningstar and Akoya, according to JPMorgan spokesman Drew Pusateri.

""We've come to agreements that will make the open banking ecosystem safer and more sustainable and allow customers to continue reliably and securely accessing their favorite financial products,"" Pusateri said in a statement. ""The free market worked.""

The milestone is the latest twist in a long-running dispute between traditional banks and the fintech industry over access to customer accounts. For years, middlemen like Plaid paid nothing to tap bank systems when a customer wanted to use a fintech app like Robinhood to draw funds or check balances.

That dynamic appeared to be enshrined in law in late 2024, when the Biden-era Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized what is known as the ""open-banking rule"" requiring banks to share customer data with other financial firms at no cost.

But banks sued to prevent the CFPB rule from taking hold and seemed to gain the upper hand in May after the Trump administration asked a federal court to vacate the rule.

Soon after, JPMorgan — the largest U.S. bank by assets, deposits and branches — reportedly told the middlemen that it would start charging what amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars for access to its customer data.

In response, fintech, crypto and venture capital executives argued that the bank was engaging in ""anti-competitive, rent-seeking behavior"" that would hurt innovation and consumers' ability to use popular apps.

After weeks of negotiations between JPMorgan and the middlemen, the bank agreed to lower pricing than it originally proposed, and the fintech middlemen won concessions regarding the servicing of data requests, according to people with knowledge of the talks.

Fintech firms preferred the certainty of locking in data-sharing rates because it is unclear whether the current CFPB, which is in the process of revising the open-banking rule, will favor banks or fintech companies, according to a venture capital investor who asked for anonymity to discuss his portfolio companies.

The bank and the fintech firms declined to disclose details about their contracts, including how much the middlemen agreed to pay and how long the deals are in force.

The deals mark a shift in the power dynamic between banks, middlemen and the fintech apps that are increasingly threatening incumbents. More banks are likely to begin charging fintech firms for access to their systems, according to industry observers.  

""JPMorgan tends to be a trendsetter. They're sort of the leader of the pack, so it's fair to expect that the rest of the major banks will follow,"" said Brian Shearer, director of competition and regulatory policy at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator.

Shearer, who worked at the CFPB under former director Rohit Chopra, said he's worried that the development would create a barrier of entry to nascent startups and ultimately result in higher costs for consumers.

Proponents of the 2024 CFPB rule said it gave consumers control over their financial data and encouraged competition and innovation. Banks including JPMorgan said it exposed them to fraud and unfairly saddled them with the rising costs of maintaining systems increasingly tapped by the middlemen and their clients.  

When Plaid's deal with JPMorgan was announced in September, the companies issued a dual press release emphasizing the continuity it provided for customers.

But the industry group that Plaid is a part of has harshly criticized the development, signaling that while JPMorgan has won a decisive battle, the ongoing skirmish may yet play out in courts and in the public.

""Introducing prohibitive tolls is anti-competitive, anti-innovation, and flies in the face of the plain reading of the law,"" Penny Lee, CEO of the Financial Technology Association, told CNBC in response to the JPMorgan milestone.

""These agreements are not the free market at work, but rather big banks using their market position to capitalize on regulatory uncertainty,"" Lee said. ""We urge the Trump Administration to uphold the law by maintaining the existing prohibition on data access fees.""

When Bitcoin dipped under $100,000 early last week, some in the crypto world thought it couldn't get any worse. It did. As of Friday mid-day, Bitcoin was trading at below $97,000 for the first time since May and is down about 22% since its all-time high of about $126,000 just last month. 

Ethereum and Solana, two other major cryptocurrencies known as altcoins, have also sputtered. The former is down about 3% in the last week to about $3,236, and the latter is down about 12% to just under $142 during that time. 





The crypto market's dip comes amid sentiment that a December rate cut from the Federal Reserve is growing less likely. Lower interest rates are typically a spur for crypto speculation.





The crypto sector has experienced a rough first half of November, continuing the downward trend which started during the flash crash of October 10. 





“This is clearly triggered by macro risk adjusting on the back of a more hawkish Fed stance and a vacuum in macro data of inflation and jobs,” said Jasper De Maere, desk strategist at Wintermute. “[The] probability of 25 basis points rate cuts in December dropped from 70% only three days ago to around 50% today, leading to a rebalancing of risk.” 




Bitcoin has been especially volatile in the last six weeks. The beginning of ‘Uptober' was true to its moniker, as Bitcoin crossed the $125,000 threshold for the first time in its history. Its downward spiral began on October 10, the day where traders saw $19 billion in their positions evaporate. That only worsened when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expressed doubt about another rate cut at the end of the year. That doubt has only magnified since, as this week Fed policymakers have echoed Powell's caution. 





The recent crypto boom has been spurred in large part by the favorable regulatory policies from President Donald Trump's administration. But the last month has erased much of those winnings for the sector, and the darkness might linger, according to some analysts. 





“The crypto market has set lower local lows, confirming the downward trend,” said Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro. “The bearish signal – the death cross – is already looming over the first cryptocurrency.”

Oops, something went wrong

BitMine Immersion Technologies, the leading Ethereum treasury company with more than $11 billion worth of the cryptocurrency, announced Friday that it has appointed Chi Tsang as CEO and board member.

Tsang, who succeeds previous CEO Jonathan Bates, was recently the founder and Managing Partner of venture fund m1720, and had previously spent a decade at HSBC, where he finished in 2022 as Head of Asia and TMT Global Banking.

""The transformation and innovation now facing Wall Street through blockchain and Ethereum mirror the explosion of opportunity that mobile phones and the internet unleashed on telecoms and technology in the 1990s,"" said Tsang, in a statement. ""With its substantial Ethereum holdings and credibility with both Wall Street and the Ethereum ecosystem, BitMine is positioned to become a leading financial institution.""

The firm also appointed a trio of new board members in Robert Sechan, Olivia Howe, and Jason Edgeworth.

BitMine Chairman Tom Lee, who has been the face of BitMine since its Ethereum pivot earlier this year, said in a statement that the new appointments ""bring a unique blend of experience, insight, and leadership across technology, DeFi, and financial services, enabling BitMine to further position itself as the bridge between traditional capital markets and the supercycle Ethereum ecosystem.""

Shares of BMNR are down about 4% on the day, recently changing hands just over $35. The firm's stock has fallen nearly 34% over the last month as crypto prices fall, diminishing the value of the company's ETH stash.

BitMine Stock Rises After Tom Lee's Firm Buys the Dip, Adding $389 Million in Ethereum

As of Monday, the company holds over 3.5 million ETH, currently valued around $11.2 billion, making it the largest corporate holder of Ethereum by far—significantly outpacing runner-up SharpLink Gaming, with about $2.75 billion worth.

Ethereum is down 5.5% over the last day to a recent price of $3,200, pushing its 30-day plunge to more than 20%. The price of ETH has fallen by 35% since the asset hit a new all-time high price just shy of $5,000 in August.

Users on Myriad—a prediction market platform operated by Decrypt's parent company, Dastan—remain slightly optimistic about Ethereum's next move, giving a nearly 53% chance that ETH is more likely to rise to $4,000 next rather than fall to $2,500.

Earlier this week, Myriad users penciled in a 77% chance of a rise to $4,000.

Oops, something went wrong

While Bitcoin has painted a bearish picture this past week following its 8% decline and slip below $100,000, it seems like most altcoins will rely on external developments. This could prove to be both beneficial and detrimental to the tokens.

BeInCrypto has analysed three such altcoins to watch this weekend that could witness a surge or a fall.

ARB trades at $0.241 after a 21% drop in the past 24 hours, reflecting mounting pressure ahead of this weekend's token unlock. Market sentiment remains fragile as uncertainty builds, raising concerns that additional supply could amplify volatility and limit any near-term recovery for the altcoin.

The scheduled release of 92.65 million ARB, worth more than $22.35 million, may add downward pressure in an already unstable market. If selling accelerates, ARB could slip toward the $0.200 psychological support level, creating conditions for deeper losses if sentiment weakens further.

If ARB stabilizes at $0.242 and avoids a sharp decline, the altcoin could stage a recovery toward $0.295. A successful move above this level would signal renewed buyer confidence and fully invalidate the bearish outlook, offering a potential reversal for short-term traders.

UDS remains one of the few tokens still trading close to its all-time high, showing resilience despite broader market weakness. The altcoin sits only 23% below its peak of $2.90, signaling stronger demand and tighter supply conditions compared with many assets experiencing deeper corrections.

The tightening of the Bollinger Bands suggests UDS is preparing for a sharp volatility spike. Weekends often amplify market swings, and a bullish move could push the token above $2.59. Sustained momentum may allow UDS to retest the $2.90 all-time high and attract increased trader interest.

If bearish momentum takes hold, UDS may fall below the $2.29 and $2.14 support levels. A breakdown would invalidate the bullish setup and expose the token to steeper losses. This scenario highlights how quickly sentiment can shift when volatility compresses before major price moves.

Another one of the altcoins to watch this weekend is BERA, which trades at $1.42 after a 15.6% weekly drop, reflecting mounting uncertainty in the market. The Ichimoku Cloud signals bullish momentum, yet its position above the candlesticks contradicts the trend.

Berchain's launch of the claims page could help stabilize BERA's price. The tool allows users affected by the Balancer v2 and BEX exploit to recover lost deposits, potentially supporting sentiment. This development may keep BERA above $1.41 or spark a rebound toward $1.57 if demand strengthens.

If bullish momentum weakens and the claims page fails to lift confidence, BERA could break below $1.41. A drop through this support may push the altcoin toward $1.31. This would invalidate the bullish thesis and signal deeper downside risk amid ongoing market volatility.

The crypto market is going through one of its strangest weeks. Altcoin ETFs are breaking trading records, but altcoin prices are still falling. Bitcoin has dropped below $98,000, marking its worst November in years, and altcoins are sliding even harder.

Altcoins Fall Even As New ETFs Surpass Records

The big shock is that this crash is happening while new altcoin ETFs are performing better than anyone expected. The Canary XRP ETF, named XRPC, launched on Nasdaq and recorded $58.5 million in first day volume. This beat the previous altcoin ETF record held by Bitwise Solana at $57 million. More than 2.26 million shares were traded, and XRP price failed to hit the $3 mark.

Why ETFs Did Not Trigger A Rally

Investors expected a strong rally after these ETF launches. Instead, the market dipped. According to Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg, ETF growth will be strong for a while because crypto is a new asset class, but only top coins will benefit long term. He compared crypto ETFs to commodity ETFs where gold dominates, silver follows, and smaller metals barely attract attention. Crypto may follow the same pattern with only a few strong winners and many weak performers.

Altcoin Crash Has A Bigger Cause

The drop is not only happening to XRP or SOL. The broader crypto market is falling with Bitcoin weakness pulling everything down. Rising dominance, macro pressure and profit taking have all added to the sell off. Even strong ETF launches are not enough to fight the wider negative trend.

When Will Altcoins Finally Pump

Analysts are watching Bitcoin dominance closely. It was rejected again at the 50 week EMA, the same pattern seen before the 2021 altcoin season. A sharp fall in dominance usually signals that altcoins are preparing for a big run. 

In September 2023, I said there would be a mini Altcoin Season, and no one believed me.

Now I'm saying the major #AltcoinSeason will come in Q1 2026, and most likely, no one will believe me again. pic.twitter.com/vf6cXbTqNr

One analyst who predicted a mini altcoin season in 2023 now believes the major altcoin season will arrive in the first quarter of 2026. If that plays out, coins like XRP, HBAR, SOL and ETH may see their strongest rallies after Bitcoin completes its next cycle move.

Conclusion

ETF launches are proving that institutional interest is rising fast. Money is flowing in, but price action is still lagging behind. Once market sentiment shifts and Bitcoin dominance breaks down, the altcoin rally investors are waiting for may finally begin.

FAQs

Altcoins are falling because Bitcoin weakness, macro pressure, and profit-taking outweigh gains from strong ETF launches.

ETF demand is rising, but broader market sentiment is negative, limiting price impact and keeping altcoins under selling pressure.

High Bitcoin dominance drains liquidity from altcoins; a sharp drop often signals the start of an altcoin-led market rally.

They show strong institutional interest, but prices may lag until sentiment improves and Bitcoin's influence weakens.

Produced by








The CoinShares Altcoins ETF (DIME) has attracted $3.08 million in flows since its October launch, offering investors a regulated pathway to access alternative cryptocurrencies that now represent more than 40% of the digital asset market.

According to the fund's prospectus, DIME provides equal-weighted exposure to 10 Layer 1 blockchain protocols. These include Solana, Avalanche, and Cardano through investments in exchange-traded products. The fund's management fee of 0.95% is currently being waived for assets up to $1 billion through September 2026.

DIME has gained 5.5% over the past week, according to ETF Database data.

The fund invests in exchange-traded products that hold altcoins rather than directly purchasing the underlying digital assets, according to the prospectus. This structure allows the fund to offer diversified exposure while maintaining regulatory compliance.

Recent research from CoinShares emphasized that altcoins resemble early-stage technology start-ups more than traditional currencies. Most projects launch through initial offerings that raise funding similar to venture capital rounds.

The fund tracks the CoinShares-Compass Crypto Altcoin Index. This index which rebalances quarterly and selects constituents based on liquidity, trading history, and custodial support, according to the prospectus. Current holdings include Polkadot, Near Protocol, Cosmos, Aptos, SUI, Toncoin, and SEI.

The research noted that altcoins appeal to investors seeking diversification beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. This opens opportunities in decentralized finance, gaming, and cross-chain infrastructure that Bitcoin does not directly address.

Total value locked — the amount of capital users commit to a project — along with active wallet growth and developer activity serve as key evaluation metrics for altcoin projects, according to the research. These indicators help reveal whether a project is building real utility or is driven primarily by speculation.

The research noted that altcoins function more like venture investments. They carry high risk but offering potential for outsized returns compared to Bitcoin.

The website Blockspot.io lists more than 17,000 dead coins — failed cryptocurrency projects that lost value or were abandoned — as of September 2025, according to the CoinShares research. Altcoins included in investment products such as ETFs undergo regulatory review, which the research said can help investors avoid these failures and hedge against scams.

Despite the risks, the altcoin ecosystem now rivals Bitcoin in size. Thousands of projects compete across decentralized finance, gaming platforms, and infrastructure networks, with their combined market capitalization representing more than 40% of the total digital asset market as of September 2025, according to the research.

Online magazine about cryptocurrencies, NFTs, DeFi, GameFi and other blockchain technologies

November 14, 2025 By Crypto Reporter PR 

Bitcoin breaking under 98000 reminded the market how quickly confidence can disappear. Periods of aggressive volatility push investors to rethink exposure and search for alternatives that offer real development and transparency. 



This market environment puts a spotlight on the best crypto presale category, where teams are building technology rather than depending on hype alone.

Nexchain captured attention not through price speculation, but through early execution of its Testnet 2.0 and AI driven infrastructure. The combination of raised capital, live milestones, and an active ecosystem has positioned it among top crypto presale discussions and many crypto presale projects competing for visibility.

Bitcoin dropped below $97000 in the last 12 hours, hitting its lowest point since early May. This decline was unexpected because broader macro signals had turned positive. The United States government officially reopened and financial support measures resurfaced, yet selling pressure accelerated.

Just days ago Bitcoin traded above 107000 after President Donald Trump confirmed tariff checks of at least 2000 for eligible Americans. The announcement sparked a wave of optimism and confidence across digital markets.

The reversal shows that price levels can break without warning, even during strong macro recovery news. Many traders shifted focus toward the best crypto presale opportunities as volatility intensified.

The movement continues to draw attention to emerging presale crypto projects that aim to offer real utility.

Nexchain is building a fully AI powered blockchain ecosystem created to deliver real transaction intelligence and advanced security across web3. The presale crypto event is live and the price increases with every stage. Many viewers consider it one of the best crypto presales because it offers innovations that operate in live environments rather than untested theory.

Testnet 2.0 goes live on November 17, earlier than scheduled. This date also marks the final day of the 100 percent purchase bonus using the code TESTNET2.0. The launch introduces the AI Risk Scoring module which analyzes smart contract activity.

It evaluates transaction type, value, associated tags, and sender reputation to identify security risk in real time.

Participants can join the ongoing 5 million NEX Airdrop until November 23 and earn rewards through weekly quests and competitions. The token price is currently 0.116, with a listing price set at 0.3 which reflects a 259 percent return at launch. Nexchain is now in Stage 29 of its crypto presale and has raised 11.72 million.

Many followers rank it among the top crypto presale options and watch it on the crypto presale list of leading cryptocurrency presales for 2025. It continues gaining visibility among long-term potential crypto supporters exploring where to buy presale crypto.

The Nexchain AI framework introduces an advanced speed infrastructure designed for decentralized blockchains. It merges Proof of Stake with the proprietary NEX AI layer to form a Hybrid Consensus mechanism capable of maximizing network responsiveness.

This design enables seamless deployment of next generation smart contracts and interoperability across multiple blockchain ecosystems.

The model includes daily rewards that distribute ten percent of all network gas fees back to NEX holders. Users only need to store tokens in a non custodial wallet to receive their proportional daily share automatically.

This approach commits to transparent value distribution without forcing complex staking requirements. It strengthens interest among best presale crypto followers who seek functional designs inside real blockchain project environments.

Altcoins fell sharply during the broader sell off. AAVE, ENA, RENDER, SUI, PEPE, and LINK each dropped more than 12 percent. Ethereum slid below 3200 after an 11 percent correction. Despite political stability returning in the United States, market sentiment remains strongly risk off.

Many traders exited short term volatility and moved toward presale crypto options with early access structures. Increased attention shifted to Nexchain as investors look beyond unstable markets for new crypto presale opportunities from high utility blockchain projects. Cryptocurrency presales with active development now appear more attractive than speculative momentum assets.

As uncertainty continues, more traders review new crypto presale openings and evaluate long term potential crypto assets with measurable progress. Those watching cryptocurrency presales and seeking balanced risk strategies continue to monitor how strong fundamentals influence future adoption.

Canary Capital will likely hit pause on new crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings for the remainder of the year, with CEO Steve McClurg saying the firm has already submitted applications for every token currently eligible under existing regulatory guidelines.



Speaking in an interview with CoinDesk, McClurg said the XRP ETF launched this week and a pending Solana SOL$142.57 product round out the company's current slate.



 “After that, we will have filed everything that falls under the generic listing standards,” McClurg said, referring to the SEC's framework that allows certain crypto-backed exchange-traded funds to move forward without lengthy review processes.



Under these standards, a crypto asset must meet criteria like having a futures market that has traded for more than six months. That bar leaves only a short list of assets Canary believes can currently qualify.



McClurg noted that the firm will now shift its focus toward managing existing products and awaiting changes in how the Securities and Exchange Commission treats crypto ETFs. For any new launches, “we're just waiting for them to qualify, either under generics or via a 19b-4 approval,” he said, referencing a separate, more involved process for ETF authorization.



On Thursday, Canary brought the first spot XRP ETF to the market, which debuted with $58 million in trading volume, making it one of the most successful ETF launches this year, according to Bloomberg's ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.



McClurg believes the XRP fund could outperform its Solana counterparts, which launched earlier this month, as the XRP network is more familiar to traditional finance players than Solana, which is more embedded in the crypto-native ecosystem, he said.

The U.S. Department of Justice rounded up several convictions in its pursuit of domestic helpers in schemes by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to pocket large amounts of cryptocurrency, and it also seized assets from cyber heists targeting crypto platforms, the department said in a Friday statement.



The five guilty pleas announced by the DOJ were connected to individuals that aided North Korea in getting U.S. jobs for fraudulent information-technology workers, obtaining stolen U.S. identities for the workers and helping mask their geographic origin as the IT employees pulled down paychecks from dozens of U.S. businesses. Probes conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ""continue to expose the North Korean government's relentless campaign to evade U.S. sanctions and generate millions of dollars to fund its authoritarian regime and weapons programs,” said Assistant Director Roman Rozhavsky of the FBI's counterintelligence division, in a statement. He urged companies to improve their vetting of remote workers to counter this trend.



The authorities have also been steadily seizing crypto assets from bad actors around the world, marking another $15 million in Tether's USDT from North Korean sources on Friday. The assets are associated with cyber heists tied to the group known as Advanced Persistent Threat 38, which is allegedly connected to the North Korean military.Read More: North Korean Hackers Were Behind Crypto's Largest 'Theft of All Time'



Earlier this week, the DOJ and other federal agencies also announced a Scam Center Strike Force to target the centers of so-called pig-butchering scams, typically clustered in Southeast Asia and run by Chinese criminal organizations. The authorities said they'd seized another $80 million in stolen funds in that pursuit. Victims will be compensated from seized money, according to the DOJ.



What's not yet clear is how much of these seized crypto funds will end up in the reserves President Donald Trump has sought to establish as a long-term investment for the U.S. government. His administration has been working to stand up a so-called bitcoin strategic reserve to hold all BTC taken in during criminal and civil forfeitures, and Trump also directed the creation of a separate reserve to hold all other digital assets. However, officials working on those reserves have suggested congressional action may be required to formally institute the plan.

Some patients say this condition induces feelings of pure bliss, making them feel as one with the universe. 

For more than 40 years, Margot has suffered from epileptic seizures, which she describes as “unforgettable.” Ever since she was a child, these seizures have made her feel like she has a “special link” with God—“as if I was chosen,” says Margot, who chose to use a pseudonym for privacy. 

And she isn't alone. A small percentage of people with epilepsy experience a state of “oneness” with the world just before their seizures. The rare condition is called ecstatic epilepsy, and the altered state of consciousness patients experience just before a seizure can be life changing; according to some researchers, it could even explain profound religious experiences. 

Scientists don't yet understand where ecstatic seizures come from, but they do have some knowledge of epilepsy in general, which is a condition that causes an electrical storm in the brain. Occasionally, patients' neurons will rapidly misfire, which overwhelms the brain and causes seizures. One of many types of the disorder, ecstatic epilepsy is characterized by a warning sign called an epileptic aura, followed by a focal seizure that affects a localized area in the brain.

Not to be confused with the spiritual term for energy, epileptic auras are brief sensory experiences—such as visual hallucinations or feelings of déjà vu—that occur moments before a seizure. Ecstatic auras in particular are moments of pure ecstasy; patients experience brief, yet overwhelming feelings of heightened self-awareness and positivity. Margot notes that, while she has a few epileptic episodes a year, seizures that provoke this altered state of consciousness are infrequent and she's only experienced them a handful of times. 

Experts are getting closer to understanding where exactly these ecstatic experiences originate from. Researchers studying epilepsy generally point to a dysfunctional temporal lobe, the region of your brain responsible for functions like memory formation and sensory processing, as the culprit for ecstatic epilepsy. More recent studies suspect the anterior insula—a small, poorly understood region of the brain related to emotional processing—may be involved. 

For example, a 2021 study published in the journal Annals of Neurology showed that electrically stimulating the anterior insula can trigger an ecstatic aura, though the procedure is invasive and typically used to identify the origin of a patient's epilepsy before surgery. However, the authors note that not everyone reaches an ecstatic experience through stimulating the region. Meanwhile, another 2021 paper published in the journal Epilepsy & Behavior Reports proposes the hypothalamus—which is located near the pituitary gland and responsible for maintaining things like internal temperature and blood sugar—could be related to ecstatic epilepsy. 

The condition's origins may be a mystery, but the feelings it can create are palpable. Some patients report that their ecstatic auras feel “mystical” and have had a transformative effect on their lives, according to Fabienne Picard, MD, a French-Swiss neurologist who studies the rare form of epilepsy. For example, one patient says she no longer fears death because of the ecstatic states, Picard explains on the podcast Where the Wild Thoughts Are: Conversations in Science and Beyond. Another patient told Picard that her ecstatic auras made her more confident because she understood that “there is something greater than us.” 

Margot explains that her ecstatic auras transcend bodily experience. She emphasizes that she has no religious beliefs in her day-to-day life, yet before her seizures, there is a strange feeling of growth—like something is changing inside her. She feels like she is floating in the air and becomes flooded with an overwhelming sense of power, a greater understanding of the universe.

Some researchers believe that epileptic experiences like Margot's could even explain some mystical accounts from historical and religious figures like Joan of Arc, Saint Paul, and Saint Teresa of Ávila. Picard explains in an email that these “awakening experience[s]” could be due to a momentary slip of the brain's filter. She says humans have become increasingly good at predicting our environments, but ecstatic auras may interrupt that process, stripping away our preconceived notions and revealing a “direct perception” of the world. 

For some patients, the feelings they experience are so profound that they're hesitant to receive treatment to stop the seizures. “Most of them [would] not want to take medication” if they experienced only the ecstatic auras, Picard writes. However, these brief moments of serenity are often followed by a loss of consciousness or a convulsive seizure, which can be distressing and force patients to seek intervention. In other words, the short-lived bliss doesn't outweigh the eventual toll on the body and mind. 

Ecstatic epilepsy is a unique medical condition that requires more research to be fully understood—but it could eventually illuminate our knowledge of higher consciousness as a whole. In fact, those who don't suffer from ecstatic epilepsy might be able to achieve similar “mystical experiences,” Picard explains on the podcast. Possible methods include meditation and psychedelics, two practices commonly associated with higher consciousness. Regardless of how they're induced, Picard says these experiences are a core “aspect of human function,” and help explain our relationship with each other.   

“Behind everything, there is a fundamental interconnectedness,” Picard says on the podcast.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Climate Change Could Heat the Earth Right Into a New Ice Age","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a69366193/warming-planet-deep-freeze/","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

The planet's long-standing natural “thermostat” is being outpaced by an feedback loop process involving algae, phosphorus, and oxygen that's supercharged by anthropogenic climate change.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Like all of us, the Earth goes through phases. Over the course of its existence, the planet's climactic processes have relied on certain mechanisms to regulate its temperature—mechanisms that can have profound impacts on the surface of the planet and, in turn, the life that inhabits that surface. During the Jurassic period, for example, the Earth was so warm that Antarctica was home to temperate rainforests. Rewind the evolutionary clock a couple hundred million years to the Cryogenian (720 to 635 million years ago), and Earth was essentially a giant snowball—an example of when Earth's natural regulatory systems went a bit haywire. 

Today, the Earth is experiencing a warming period unlike any other. The Jurassic, which was warm due to high levels of atmospheric carbon, reached its sweltering temperatures gradually, whereas anthropogenic climate change has caused much more rapid shifts—so rapid, in fact, that certain climactic changes have been discernible even within the average human lifespan. 

Typically, one way the Earth regulates its temperature is through the slow weathering of silicate rocks—a process sometimes referred to as Earth's “natural thermostat.” But a new study, led by scientists at the University of Bremen in German and the University of California (UC) Riverside, shows that a combination of biological and oceanic feedback loops (particularly those involving algae, phosphorus, and oxygen) could outpace this long-standing moderation strategy. This would paradoxically lead Earth to a premature deep freeze hundreds of thousands of years in the future. The results of the study were published in the journal Science.

“When the planet warms, rocks weather faster and absorb more CO2, allowing the Earth to cool down again,” Dominik Hülse, a co-author of the study from UC Riverside, said in a press statement. And that would be great—if it were the only process contributing significantly to our cooling. But it isn't. When Hülse and co-author Andy Ridgwell considered altered processes in the ocean, they realized the potentially dramatic impacts of algal blooms and their collective ability to sequester carbon in marine sediments. The duo discovered that a runaway effect could cause an overcompensation of sorts, leading to a cooling effect that would drop global temperatures far below pre-industrial levels. “In the computer model of the study this can trigger an ice age. With the silicate weathering alone, we were unable to simulate such extreme values.”

Typically, algal blooms don't outpace silicate weathering in terms of cooling. But the more temperate waters and excess nutrients (like phosphorus) made available in a warming world can supercharge algal blooms, causing more and more to occur. When algae die, they take any carbon that they've trapped within themselves to the bottom of the ocean, where it remains locked out of the atmosphere and causes the Earth to cool off. And with more algal blooms occurring, more and more carbon gets trapped, theoretically causing the Earth's temperature to drop more and more. 

The one piece of good news, the authors report, is that compared to other intense cooling periods—such as the Cryogenian period—the atmosphere contains more oxygen, which will likely prevent the planet from becoming a giant snowball in the future.

But, hold on—we're in the middle of a concerning period of global warming. Isn't a carbon-sequestering cooling force a good thing? Well, the big problem is that humans are already experiencing the devastating effects of a warming climate, and these planetary regulating processes can play out over tens, if not hundreds of thousands of years. 

“At the end of the day, does it really matter much if the start of the next ice age is 50, 100, or 200 thousand years into the future?” Ridgwell said in a press statement. “We need to focus now on limiting ongoing warming. That the Earth will naturally cool back down is not going to happen fast enough to help us out.”

Tensor processing is a cornerstone of many modern technological advancements, powering critical applications in data analytics and artificial intelligence. While optical computing offers exceptional advantages in bandwidth, parallelism and energy efficiency, existing methods optimized for scalar operations struggle to efficiently handle tensor-based tasks, limiting their applicability in complex applications, such as neural networks. Here we report parallel optical matrix–matrix multiplication (POMMM), which enables fully parallel tensor processing through a single coherent light propagation. This approach addresses key limitations of current optical methods, scaling the performance with data dimension, while improving theoretical computational power and efficiency. We demonstrate its high consistency with GPU-based matrix–matrix multiplication across both real-valued and complex-valued domains. Moreover, we showcase its adaptability, scalability and versatility in tensor processing applications such as convolutional and vision transformer neural networks. Furthermore, we analyse the theoretical compatibility and efficiency of POMMM in relation to existing optical computing paradigms, highlighting its potential to outperform current state-of-the-art methods. By enabling a variety of computational tasks and supporting multi-wavelength and large-scale expansion, POMMM provides a scalable, high-efficiency foundation for advancing next-generation optical computing.

Artificial intelligence technology, driven by neural networks, is rapidly reshaping various aspects of modern life. However, the training and inference processes of these networks impose enormous computational demands on digital processors. A key operation in these computations is tensor processing, typically implemented through matrix–matrix multiplication (MMM) on graphics processing unit (GPU) tensor cores1,2,3,4. This approach, however, poses many challenges, including large memory bandwidth demands, substantial power consumption and inefficient use of tensor core resources. By contrast, optical computing, with its inherent characteristics of large bandwidth, high parallelism and low energy consumption, has emerged as a promising platform to compute and accelerate neural networks5,6. State-of-the-art optical computing paradigms enable parallel dot product7,8, vector–matrix multiplication9,10,11,12,13,14, diffraction computing15,16 and Fourier transform17,18,19,20 by modulating the amplitude, phase and wavelength of light during a single propagation through planar waveguides or free space, laying the basis for various optical neural network (ONN) implementations21,22,23,24,25,26.

While optical vector–matrix multiplication-driven ONNs are capable of executing tensor processing, they typically require multiple light propagations for each MMM operation, which limits their parallelism and overall efficiency. Some approaches have attempted to improve parallelism by leveraging space multiplexing27,28, wavelength–time multiplexing29,30, wavelength–space multiplexing31,32,33,34 or precomputed inverse operations21,35. However, these methods are constrained by device28,36 and system design29,37 and, in some cases, even contradict the fundamental principle of optical parallel acceleration at the computational logic level38,39. By contrast, while diffraction-based computing offers high parallelism, it relies on diffraction principles to construct the computing architecture40,41,42, making it unsuitable for general-purpose computation. As a result, existing optical computing paradigms struggle to balance both high parallelism and generality. They are often tailored to specific types of neural network computations or individual processing steps, rather than providing a universal acceleration framework for various complex neural network steps within a single system. This limitation also hinders the seamless deployment of advanced network models developed for GPUs onto optical computing platforms in the future.

Here, we report a direct parallel optical MMM (POMMM) paradigm for tensor processing that operates through a single coherent light propagation. This approach leverages the bosonic properties of light43 and exploits the duality between the spatial position, phase gradients and spatial frequency distribution to enhance optical computing capabilities, adding an extra computational order without relying on additional time, space, wavelength multiplexing or preprocessing. We validate this paradigm through theoretical simulations and the construction of a physical optical prototype, demonstrating its strong consistency with standard GPU-based MMM over various input matrix scales. Building upon the POMMM simulation and prototype as fundamental computational units, we develop a GPU-compatible ONN framework and demonstrate the direct optical deployment of different GPU-based neural network architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs)44 and vision transformer (ViT) networks45,46, incorporating various tensor operations such as multi-channel convolution, multi-head self-attention and multi-sample fully connected layers47. We explored the scalability of POMMM, including its data type, large-scale computing ability for complex neural networks and tasks, and multi-wavelength multiplexing for high-order tensor processing. Finally, through a comprehensive comparison with existing optical computing paradigms, we highlight the superior performance of the POMMM paradigm as a transformative approach alongside the ONN framework it enables, offering theoretically improved efficiency and versatility in tensor processing. Our results demonstrate that POMMM has the potential to achieve more complex and higher-order general parallel optical computing, enabling future computing demands.

Conventionally, MMM between matrix A and matrix B is executed in two sequential steps. First, the Hadamard product (element-wise multiplication) is performed between each row of matrix A and each column of matrix B. Subsequently, the results of these Hadamard products are summed and assigned to their corresponding elements in the output matrix. Typically, the optical Hadamard product can be implemented by modulating the amplitude of spatial light, while the optical Fourier transform, which enables approximate summation or integration, can be achieved through quadratic phase modulation (for example, passing through a lens)48. However, a key challenge remains: how to compute the dot products (sum after Hadamard product) of all rows of matrix A with all columns of matrix B (or all rows of matrix BT, transpose of matrix B) in parallel and map them to their corresponding positions without mutual interference.

Fortunately, the Fourier transform exhibits two well-known properties: the time-shifting property and the frequency-shifting property. The former states that shifting a signal in the time (space) domain does not alter the amplitude distribution of its time (space) spectrum, while the latter indicates that applying a linear phase modulation in the time (space) domain results in a corresponding frequency shift in the time (space) spectrum. Leveraging these two properties, we construct the core concept of POMMM (Fig. 1a). First, the elements of matrix A are encoded onto the amplitude and position of a spatial optical field, with each row encoded by a linear phase with special gradient. Then, a column-wise Fourier transform is applied to the optical field carrying the complex amplitude signal, which can be implemented by imaging along the row direction and focusing along the column direction. At this stage, due to the time-shifting property, each row of the optical field represents the superposition of all rows of matrix A. Subsequently, amplitude modulation is applied to perform the Hadamard product between this ‘hybrid matrix' and the matrix BT, effectively enabling the parallel computation of all row-column Hadamard products. Finally, a row-wise Fourier transform is performed to complete the summation. Due to the frequency-shifting property and the presence of different linear phase modulations in the row dimension, the contributions from different rows of matrix A naturally separate into distinct spatial frequency positions in the final computational result (see details in Supplementary Note 1).

To experimentally validate POMMM using conventional optical components and demonstrate its functionality and compatibility, we design an optical proof-of-concept prototype (Fig. 1b). We first encode matrix A onto a collimated beam using an amplitude spatial light modulator (ASLM), ASLM1. This encoded beam is then imaged onto a phase spatial light modulator (PSLM) through a 4f optical system, where distinct linear phase modulations are applied to each row (these two steps can also be realized by a complex amplitude modulator). Subsequently, the beam passes through a cylindrical lens (CL) assembly (1, 2 and 3): two CLs (1 and 3) acting along the row direction and one CL (2) along the column direction. This set-up enables row-wise imaging and column-wise Fourier transform at the surface of the second ASLM (ASLM2), effectively superimposing the ‘fan-out' results from each row of matrix A in space. ASLM2 then encodes matrix BT onto this combined field via amplitude modulation. Finally, the beam then passes through another CL assembly (4, 5 and 6) performing the inverse functionality, achieving row-wise Fourier transform and column-wise imaging, and the output matrix (AB)T is captured by a qCMOS camera (see details in Methods and Supplementary Note 2). Importantly, this entire tensor operation is fully parallel, with single-shot generating all values simultaneously.

To validate the reliability of the POMMM paradigm, we compared its experimental results with those obtained from GPU-based MMM across various scenarios. These included non-negative matrices of different sizes, such as symmetric (Fig. 2a,b) and upper-triangular matrices (Supplementary Fig. 5), as well as real-valued matrices including conjugate matrix pairs (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 6). All comparisons demonstrated strong consistency with the GPU results. Furthermore, we conducted a large-sample quantitative analysis across multiple matrix sizes ([10, 10], [20, 20], [30, 30], [40, 40], [50, 50], with 50 random matrix pairs for each size) and evaluated the computational errors between POMMM and GPU-based MMM (Fig. 2c). The results showed that both the mean absolute error (less than 0.15) and the normalized root-mean-square error (less than 0.1) remained low, confirming the accuracy and reliability of the POMMM framework. In addition, we performed a detailed analysis of the theoretical sources of error in POMMM (Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8), along with the experimental prototype's imperfections (Supplementary Fig. 4). Based on this, we proposed and verified effective error-suppression strategies through theoretical simulations (see details in Supplementary Note 3).

Each bar shows the mean MAE or RMSE over 50 random samples of the corresponding size (black numbers denote the mean values; grey numbers are baselines), and the error bars represent ±1 standard deviation.

Due to the high consistency between POMMM and GPU tensor core-based MMM, POMMM theoretically enables the direct deployment of standard GPU-based neural network architectures. This eliminates the need to design custom network architectures tailored to the unique optical propagation constraints of conventional ONN approaches. To further validate this capability, we conducted direct inference experiments using both CNN and ViT networks on our POMMM simulation and prototype, utilizing MNIST47,49 and Fashion-MNIST50 (FMNIST) datasets (Fig. 3a). These architectures include three representative tensor processing steps common in modern neural networks: multi-channel convolution, multi-head self-attention and multi-sample fully connected layers (see details in Methods). We first used four different models (CNN-MNIST, ViT-MNIST, CNN-FMNIST and ViT-FMNIST) trained on GPUs with non-negative weights and tested inference across GPU, simulated POMMM and POMMM prototype (see details in Supplementary Note 4 and experimental results in Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11). Inference outputs were highly consistent across all platforms, demonstrating that POMMM supports a wide range of tensor processing operations and enables the direct deployment of GPU-trained weights (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, we used two successive simulated POMMM units to directly execute all linear operations with unconstrained GPU-trained weights (Supplementary Figs. 13 and 14), achieving inference accuracy highly consistent with GPU results (Fig. 3c). In addition, we explored the scalability of POMMM by performing an image style transfer task51 based on a U-Net model52, where the largest MMM reached a scale of [256, 9,216] × [9,216, 256] (Supplementary Fig. 16). These findings highlight the versatility and scalability of the POMMM framework, confirming its potential to theoretically support all linear tensor computations in diverse neural networks.

Moreover, in scenarios where the error between POMMM and GPU-based MMM is non-negligible (for example, spectral leakage due to low repetitions; Supplementary Fig. 7), POMMM can still be used by model training. We evaluated inference performance across 80 different error levels for each network architecture and task, where models trained directly using the POMMM kernel achieved inference accuracy comparable to the GPU reference (Fig. 3d). This indicates that strict consistency between POMMM and GPU-based MMM is not always necessary. With appropriate training, high-quality inference remains achievable, and recent advances in onsite training for ONNs support the practical realization of such approaches53,54, thereby reducing future engineering requirements for POMMM deployment. Interestingly, when nonlinear activation functions are disabled (for example, ReLU: \(f\left(x\right)=\max \left(0,x\right)\) is inactive due to non-negative constraints, leading CNNs to degenerate into linear classifiers), models trained with POMMM under certain error levels outperformed their GPU-based counterparts (Fig. 3d, coloured curve). This suggests that, under linear constraints, POMMM may enhance model expressiveness after training compared with standard linear classifiers. In conclusion, through both theoretical simulations and experimental validation, we have demonstrated that POMMM can directly deploy GPU-trained neural network models. We have also explored its potential for deep, large-scale and nonlinear extensions, revealing the promising applicability of POMMM in future tensor processing tasks.

As the POMMM paradigm relies solely on the amplitude and phase modulation of coherent light, it can, in principle, support wavelength multiplexing, thereby enabling tensor–matrix operations through a single propagation process. This allows parallel optical processing of a [L, N, M] tensor with an [M, N] matrix (four-order parallelism). Because the spatial frequency distribution of the optical field depends on the wavelength, different wavelength components subjected to the same linear phase modulation will be mapped to different positions in the spatial frequency domain. Consequently, when an optical field containing L wavelengths undergoes N distinct linear phase modulations, its Fourier transform is distributed over L × N spatial positions (Fig. 4a), analogous to a spectrometer equipped with gratings of different densities simultaneously. Leveraging this, we encoded the real and imaginary parts of a complex-valued matrix (with patterns ‘S' and ‘J') onto two distinct wavelengths and performed two rounds of two-wavelength POMMM with another complex matrix (patterns ‘T' and ‘U') to realize full complex MMM. The results show a high degree of consistency with those computed by GPU (Fig. 4b), and this process can be equivalent to the real-valued multiplication between a [2, 5, 5] tensor and two [5, 5] matrices. In summary, our single- and two-wavelength experiments validate that POMMM can robustly execute MMM across diverse scales and data types through single-shot optical propagation. Furthermore, its intrinsic compatibility with multi-wavelength extensions highlights its strong potential for scaling towards parallel tensor–matrix multiplication.

The vertical axis denotes the energy efficiency, and the horizontal axis represents different device platforms. Each curve corresponds to a computational paradigm with a specific level of theoretical computing power. The data point on the far left indicates the actual performance of our prototype (in Supplementary Table 2), while all other values are estimated under ideal conditions (that is, full device utilization, in Supplementary Table 3).

Compared with existing general-purpose optical computing paradigms, POMMM demonstrates a substantial theoretical computational advantage under both single-wavelength and multi-wavelength extensions (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, the experimentally demonstrated computing scale confirms the practical scalability of POMMM for real-world applications (Supplementary Fig. 18). In our experiments, the prototype was constructed entirely from off-the-shelf, non-specialized components, resulting in a practical energy efficiency of only 2.62 GOP J−1. However, because POMMM requires only passive phase modulation (excluding data input and output), it is, in principle, compatible with a wide range of free-space optical computing devices8. Its extremely high theoretical computing parallelism enables a dramatic increase in effective performance when integrated with high-speed, large-scale and dedicated photonic hardware (Fig. 4d), making POMMM an ideal computational paradigm for next-generation optical computing platforms. Nevertheless, compared with dedicated paradigms such as diffractive and scattering-based computing that leverage complex-valued operations, POMMM introduces additional phase modulation to enable real-valued operations. This may increase deployment and cascading complexity in practice, potentially limiting its convenience and performance in vision-related tasks (see details in Supplementary Note 5).

The theoretical simulations and experimental demonstrations of POMMM are conducted following the workflow outlined in Fig. 1b. The simulation framework incorporates three distinct propagation models (fast Fourier transform, Huygens–Fresnel theory and Rayleigh–Sommerfeld theory) and accounts for critical system factors including device parameters, aperture effects, discrete periodicity and diffraction limitations. Extensive simulations under the paraxial approximation demonstrate high consistency among these models (Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). Unless otherwise specified, all simulated optical field distributions presented in this work are based on the Rayleigh–Sommerfeld theory, whereas the ONN training and inference simulations use the fast Fourier transform method.

For the POMMM experimental demonstrations, a 532-nm solid-state continuous-wave laser is used as the light source for single-wavelength tests, while a broadband pulsed laser (400–2,200 nm) in conjunction with a multi-wavelength tunable filter (430–1,450 nm) is used for multi-wavelength tests. All laser beams are collimated and expanded, and then polarized using a linear polarizer (Thorlabs, LPVISE100-A) to obtain p-polarized light. The beam subsequently passes through a PBS (Thorlabs, PBS251) and is directed onto the surface of ASLM1 (Upolabs, HDSLM80R-A, 8 μm pixel pitch, 1,200 × 1,920 resolution, 8-bit depth, 60 Hz frame rate, 95% zero-order diffraction efficiency). ASLM1 encodes matrix A via amplitude modulation while converting the p-polarization to s-polarization, which is reflected by PBS. The resulting optical field is relayed to the surface of a PSLM (Upolabs, HDSLM80R-P Pro, identical pixel pitch and resolution, 10-bit depth) using a 4f imaging system composed of two achromatic lenses (Thorlabs, ACT508-200-A, f = 200 mm). The beam also passes through a half-wave plate (Lbtek, MAHWP20-VIS) and a 50:50 NBS (Thorlabs, BS013), converting s-polarization back to p-polarization (in Fig. 1b, for the sake of a clearer and more aesthetically balanced schematic, the PSLM is depicted on the reflective side of the NBS; in the actual experiment, however, the PSLM was positioned on the transmission side). The PSLM imposes phase modulation on the beam, which is then reshaped by a CL assembly. This system includes two CLs (Thorlabs, LJ1567L-1-A, f = 100 mm) for the row dimension and one CL (Thorlabs, LJ1653L2-A, f = 200 mm) for the column dimension. The modulated beam is then incident on ASLM2 (identical to ASLM1), which encodes matrix BT in amplitude and converts p-polarization to s-polarization, reflected by PBS2 (Thorlabs, PBS251). Finally, the beam passes through a second CL group (two CLs (Thorlabs, LJ1567L-1-A, f = 100 mm) for the column dimension and one CL (Thorlabs, LJ1653L1-A, f = 200 mm) for the row dimension) before being captured by a high-resolution qCMOS camera (Hamamatsu, ORCA-Quest C15550-20UP, 16-bit depth). Detailed descriptions of the experimental procedures for the POMMM demonstration are provided in Supplementary Note 2.

The CNN framework consists of a multi-channel convolutional layer with 50 channels, followed by a ReLU activation function and a standard fully connected layer. The input images from the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets are initially sized at [28, 28]. After applying padding of [1, 2, 1, 2], the image dimensions become [31, 31]. With a convolution kernel size of [6, 6] and a stride of 5, the convolution operation requires 6 × 6 = 36 dot products between a [6, 6] matrix slice of the input and the [6, 6] kernel to cover the entire [31, 31] matrix. This results in a convolution output of size [6, 6]. For multi-channel convolution, this process transforms a [6, 6, 36] tensor into a [6, 6, 50] tensor. The 36 dot products between 36 [6, 6] matrix slices and a [6, 6] kernels can be interpreted as a vector–matrix multiplication between a [36, 36] matrix and a [36, 1] vector. Thus, tensor processing in the 50-channel convolution can be abstracted as an MMM between a [36, 36] matrix and a [36, 50] matrix (Supplementary Fig. 9a). The result is then flattened into a [1, 1,800] vector and passed through a fully connected layer, producing a [1, 10] vector. This operation can be abstracted as a vector–matrix multiplication between a [1, 1,800] vector and a [1,800, 10] matrix. The resulting [1, 10] vector represents the ten-class classification output, which is processed using a Softmax function. The loss is computed using the cross-entropy loss function with the image label vector. Backward propagation is then applied to update the gradients and complete the training.

The ViT network consists of an embedding layer, an encoder and a classifier. In the embedding layer, patch embeddings are generated using a 50-channel convolution, like the multi-channel convolution in the CNN. The difference lies in the convolution kernel size, which is [4, 4], and the stride, which is 4. This results in 7 × 7 = 49 dot products between the [4, 4] kernel and the [28, 28] input matrix to cover the image. This tensor processing can also be abstracted as an MMM between a [49, 16] matrix and a [16, 50] matrix, producing a [49, 50] matrix. A [1, 50] class token is then appended to the patch embeddings, resulting in a [50, 50] matrix. In the encoder layer, multi-head self-attention is applied, where a query (Q) is mapped to a set of key (K)-value (V) pairs: attention = QKTV. Q, K and V are obtained by performing MMM with the input matrix of size [50, 50] and the weight matrices of WQ, WK and WV, each of size [50, 50]. The input to the encoder layer is added to the output of the self-attention and passed through two multi-sample fully connected layers to produce a [50, 50] matrix as the encoder's output. The tensor processing in the multi-sample fully connected layer can be abstracted as an MMM between a [50, 50] matrix and a [50, 50] matrix (Supplementary Fig. 9b). The classifier layer extracts the [1, 50] class token from the normalized output of the encoder layer. This class token is then passed through two simple fully connected layers, resulting in a [1, 10] vector representing the classification output.

Joe Kiniry, a security expert specializing in elections, was attending an annual conference on voting technology in Washington, DC, when a woman approached him with an unusual offer. She said she represented a wealthy client interested in funding voting systems that would encourage bigger turnouts. Did he have any ideas? “I told her you should stay away from internet voting, because it's really, really hard,” he says.

Later he learned who had sent her. It was Bradley Tusk, a New York City political consultant and fixer for companies like Uber fending off regulation. He'd made a fortune doing that (early Uber stock helped a lot), and he was eager to spend a good chunk of it pursuing online voting technology. Tusk convinced Kiniry to work with him. At the very least, Kiniry thought, it would be a valuable research project.

Today Tusk is showing off the fruits of that collaboration. His Mobile Voting Foundation is releasing VoteSecure, a cryptography-based protocol that seeks to help people securely cast their votes on iPhones and Androids. The protocol is open source and available on GitHub for anyone to test, improve upon, and build out. Two election technology vendors have already committed to using it—perhaps as early as 2026. Tusk claims that mobile voting will save our democracy. But getting it accepted by legislators and the public will be the really, really hard part.

Tusk has been obsessed with mobile voting for a while. Around 2017, he began taking serious action, funding small elections that used existing technology to allow deployed military or disabled people to vote. He estimates he's dropped $20 million so far and plans to keep shoveling cash into the effort. When I ask why, he explains that working with the government has given him a panoramic view of its failures. Tusk believes there is a single pressure point that could fix a number of mismatches between what the public deserves and what they get: more people using the ballot box. “We get lousy, or corrupt, government because so few people vote, especially in off-year elections and primaries, where the turnout is dismal,” he says. “If primary turnout is 37 percent instead of 9 percent, the underlying political incentives for an elected official to change—it pushes them to the middle, and they're not rewarded for screaming and pointing fingers.”

To Tusk, mobile voting is a no-brainer: We already do banking, commerce, and private messages on our phones, so why not cast a ballot? “If I don't do it, who is going to do it?” he asks. Furthermore, he says, “if it doesn't happen, I don't think we're one country in 20 years, because if you are unable to solve any single problem that matters to people, eventually they decide not to keep going.”

Tusk had Kiniry evaluate existing online voting platforms—including some that Tusk himself had paid for. “Joe is considered the absolute expert on electronic voting,” says Tusk. So when Kiniry deemed those systems insufficient, Tusk decided that the best way forward was to start from scratch. He hired Kiniry's company, Free & Fair, to develop VoteSecure. It's not a turnkey solution but a backend part of a system that will require a user interface and other pieces to be operable. The protocol includes a means for voters to check the accuracy of their ballots and verify that their vote has been received by the election board and transferred to a paper ballot.

Tusk says his next step is to “run legislation” in a few cities to allow mobile voting. “Start small—city council, school board, maybe mayor,” he says. “Prove the thesis. The odds of Vladimir Putin hacking the Queensborough election seems pretty remote to me.” (Next spring some local election elections in Alaska will offer the option of mobile-phone voting with software developed by Tusk's foundation.) Kiniry agrees it's way too soon to use mobile voting in national elections, but Tusk is betting that eventually the systems become familiar, to the point where people trust them much more than traditional paper ballots. “Once the genie's out of the bottle, they can't put it back, right?” he says. “That's been true for every tech I've worked on.” But first the genie has to get out of the bottle. That's no cinch.

The loudest objections against mobile or internet voting come from cryptographers and security experts, who believe that the safety risks are insurmountable. Take two people who were at the 2017 conference with Kiniry. Ron Rivest is the legendary “R” in the RSA protocol that protects the internet, a winner of the coveted Turing Award, and a former professor at MIT. His view: Mobile voting is far from ready for prime time. “What you can do with mobile phones is interesting, but we're not there yet, and I haven't seen anything to make me think otherwise,” he says, “Tusk is driven by trying to make this stuff happen in the real world, which is not the right way to do it. They need to go through the process of writing a peer-reviewed paper. Putting up code doesn't cut it.”

Computer scientist and voting expert David Jefferson is also unimpressed. Though he acknowledges that Kiniry is one of the country's top voting system experts, he sees Tusk's effort as doomed. “I'm willing to concede rock-solid cryptography, but it does not weaken the argument about how insecure online voting systems are in general. Open source and perfect cryptography do not address the most serious vulnerabilities.”

Kiniry, of course, disagrees. “We'll get to that,” he says of a peer-reviewed paper. “But in releasing the first version of it, we have provided the community with something like the equivalent of half a dozen papers for review.” Tusk is even more dismissive. “They've never seen what we've built,” he says of his critics. He contends that their “zero-tolerance approach” ignores the fact that the current systems aren't perfect.

All these arguments about the safety and verifiability of mobile voting may be irrelevant. In the not-too-distant past, when Tusk first became consumed with the concept, conversations about election safety were conducted under the guise of science, math, and persnickety accounting. People generally trusted their voting systems, and had reason to—numerous studies have shown that election fraud is involved in only a minuscule fraction of votes cast. That trust no longer exists: In 2025, thanks to one sore loser, the entire issue is fraught with doubt and loathing. Inviting an unfamiliar alternative would be like introducing cordite into the process. Even if a mobile system was verified as 100 percent secure, all it would take to cast suspicion on an election would be a single ill-intended charge that some outside force had hacked the system. Does anyone remember the bogus charges against Dominion Voting Systems? Despite vindication, the company was left so tarnished that it now has different ownership and a different name. Yes, internet voting is really, really hard—but solvable. Less solvable is an electorate that won't accept a vote count it doesn't like.

OpenAI says ChatGPT will now ditch the em dashes if you tell it to. The telltale sign that supposedly signals text written by AI has popped up everywhere in recent months, including in school papers, emails, comments, customer service chats, LinkedIn posts, online forums, ad copy, and more. The inclusion of the em dash has led people to criticize those writers for being lazy and turning to an AI chatbot to do their work.

Of course, many have also argued for the em dash, saying it's been a part of their writing well before LLMs adopted the punctuation. However, the fact that chatbots couldn't seem to avoid its use made the so-called “ChatGPT hyphen” a newly objectionable addition to any text, even if they weren't a reliable signal of content created by generative AI.

The problem had stumped OpenAI for some time, as ChatGPT users were unable to get the chatbot to stop using the symbol, even when they specifically asked it not to.

Now, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says the company has fixed the problem. In a post on X, Altman writes, “If you tell ChatGPT not to use em-dashes in your custom instructions, it finally does what it's supposed to do,” calling the update a “small-but-happy win.”

Small-but-happy win:If you tell ChatGPT not to use em-dashes in your custom instructions, it finally does what it's supposed to do!

The company explains in a post on Threads (where it forced ChatGPT to apologize for “ruining the em dash”) that ChatGPT will be better at not using the em dash if you instruct it not to via the custom instructions in your personalization settings. That means it won't necessarily eliminate the em dash from its output by default, but you will at least have more control over the frequency of its appearance.

Type-checking keybindings is cute, but you're going to discover that the keybinding doesn't work when you go to use it, so how much time are you really saving? That's not helped by the fact that many WMs/compositors have validators for their configs, so you're getting much of the same benefit with much less trouble.For reference, Niri's config is very approachable: https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/blob/main/resources/default-c...

So if your side screen has say documentation open, and you switch on your main screen from terminal to editor, only the main screen changes. The side screen stays untouched. Some people prefer it, some hate it. But it's good that xmonad offers it. It also has hot reloading of the config, which is also nice.Sure, Niri's config is approachable, but is it hackable? It only offers what Niri offers, right? You can't extend its functionality by config alone.That is where XMonad and others shine. Sure, they might not be for the ""I don't wanna spend time configuring my WM to death"" crowd (and I mean absolutely no derision in that. We all have different rabbit holes we want to customize to oblivion), but Xmonad or Stumpwm etc allow for those shenanigans, and I myself am very very happy to have those.Long story short, it's not all 100% about the type safety, it's also a lot about the extensibility of it.Niri is nice, not mocking it. But infinite scrolling is not everyone's jam. Some others might even question the choice of KDL instead of JSON without any clear benifit.Whatever you prefer and if it works for you, great. That's why we have choices ^^

It's not about discovering it doesn't work so much as discovering the specific reason it doesn't work.

reply

Not for me.  I don't know Haskell, and I had to cargo-cult forms to do what I want (which bothers me, as someone towards the end of the developer spectrum that likes to understand well how systems work).But XMonad with a few cargo-culted tweaks works noticeably better for me than I've been able to configure i3wm.  I forced myself to use i3wm at one company, for two years, rather than bring over my Xmonad config, and every evening it was a relief to be back using Xmonad on my personal laptop.

My absolute favorite feature (i'm sure this is present elsewhere too) is the idea that I have my stuff laid out on virtual screens and I can just assign a virtual screen to a physical screen super trivially without ever moving my hands off the keyboard. It's such a wonderful workflow.Tiling WMs are one of those power user things where once you get used to it the other way just seem so obviously bad. VIM and Blender are similar, unfamiliar annoying interface if you're used to the normie way of doing things, but once you understand the patterns and the way you can compose them it becomes so much more expressive.

Conceptually, it's like an infinite 2D canvas windows, divided into strips (strip is a workspace), and you then scroll through an infinite ribbon of windows in each strip.Seems interesting, but also slower and less flexible than traditional tiling WMs (least of all because of the slow scrolling animations, but also because it seems to prefer scrolling instead of jumping-towards).Like most of the 'tiling with gaps' patches I see, these feel like trying to look fancy without necessarily delivering big value. I'd be interested to hear why people want a scrolling WM. Is it merely more visually pleasing?

reply

This is opposed to a traditional tiling WM where you'd either need to open the app in another workspace, use some stacking feature or worst of all shove the new window into the current view by resizing some other window(s) which is often not ideal.

reply

I never want to / have to wonder where any particular window is. Every app will always open on the same workspace, in the same position that I define + a scratchpad workspace for random one-offs that I keep floating. I'm only ever 1 key press away from exactly what I want. I know that ctrl+b gets me my browser, ctrl+t gets me to my terminal(s), etc. I don't even think about the workspace numbers or layout beyond initial configuration. Zero animations, instant switching.In your example, if I'm on one workspace working and I need to open Gimp, I press my keybind for Gimp and it opens on the scratchpad and switches to it immediately.It takes a lot of initial config and tweaking as you go along but once settled it's the most efficient way I've found to manage windows, in that, the windows manage themselves i no longer have to think about them at all.

I'm often working on 3+ codebases or projects at the same time, each project has a browser window with associated tabs, an instance of an editor, several terminals. So they get a workspace. ""Switch to browser workspace"" makes no sense if there are 3 instances of the browser open, especially when I want the browser next to my editor for live reload/API docs.

reply

I use Awesome Window Manager and one feature I like about it is this:Say I've got my terminal in workspace 1, Firefox in workspace 2, and Emacs in workspace 3. There are often times I need to use either the terminal or Emacs (or both) while viewing a website. So with a keystroke, I can tell it to combine any two or three workspaces and all the windows are shown tiled together. In a sense, it creates a new temporary workspace with all 3 windows. As soon as I leave this workspace, it restores it to the original configuration. No need to move windows from one workspace to another and remember to move them back.This is the one feature that I'm really missing from Mac OS.

You can get similar functionality with tabbed windows, but I'm still trying to decide which workflow I prefer; scrolling feels a bit more ""organic"", while tabs are superior for density.

It's the lua scripting that really pushes it to the next level for me. I think I fell in love when I set up randomized times wallpaper rotations, and then realized that I could also create multiple profiles/sets of wallpapers as well, and the only limit was my own ability to add it.

In the old 4:3 days I used ratpoison for a while, but after months I went back to fvwm.  On 4:3 it seemed to work great, but I tend to think on these 16:9/16:10 monitors it could be a PITA.  I believe I would need to move my head to the right a lot.  On 4:3 no such issue.FWIW, via fvwm I force all my main applications to place themselves on the left 2/3 portion of the monitor.  The right 2/3 are for things like xmag, clocks, monitors and FvwmButtons/FvwmIconMan.

Any interventions would have to be targeted directly at the B. burgdorferi to disrupt their internal regulation of manganese. It's a long shot used to make this research discovery sound more impressive, not an actual cure.Your own body uses manganese for critical processes like your metabolism, critical brain functionality, and generating important antioxidants in your mitochondria (MnSOD, the same one mentioned inside of Lyme in the article).Your body also regulates manganese absorption and excretion. Manganese deficiency is extremely rare outside of genetic conditions or other medical problems which interfere with this regulation. You can't really starve yourself of manganese by adjusting your diet or even by periods of fasting.So if you're reading this and thinking you could defeat Lyme by starving yourself of manganese or overdosing on manganese, don't.

The idea would be to look at all of the components that regulate manganese in B. burgdorferi and then look for drugs that might disrupt how they operate.Any solution would act indirectly by disrupting manganese balance in a targeted manner directed at B. burgdorferi, not by flooding the whole body with manganese. The cells regulate their internal manganese anyway, so supplementing manganese wouldn't force it to go into those cells anyway.This is a PR release for some research that tries to stretch it into a promising treatment, but it's really more of an interesting discovery than a path to a new treatment.

You cannot achieve what the paper is discussing through diet or supplements.The paper is hypothesizing that if a drug could target the components of B. burgdorferi that regulate manganese then that would kill it.You cannot deprive the cells of manganese or overwhelm them through supplementation or restrictive diet. You would damage your own body long before reaching levels that killed the Lyme infection.I really hope the alternative medicine people don't start abusing this headline to push diets and supplements.

Deliberately inducing manganese deficiency (which I doubt you could pull off while still eating food) isn't ""self care"". It's a misunderstanding of what this article is saying.Your body needs manganese and MnSOD (one of the target enzymes mentioned in the article) just as much as Lyme disease does.You could theoretically kill the Lyme by killing the host body, like that classic XKCD about destroying anything in a petri dish if you don't care about collateral damage. The key to making a successful treatment is finding a way to kill the infection without killing the host.Calling anything you're suggesting ""self care"" is dangerous and wrong.

Your guess would be wrong. Your body needs manganese for similar reasons that Lyme disease needs it. You also produce MnSOD.If you starved your body of manganese sufficiently (which I doubt you could do without eating a completely synthetic diet for months) then you'd be killing yourself in parallel with the Lyme disease.

Despite their differences, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease share several risk factors and mechanisms of neuronal damage. Both also feature a phase that precedes the appearance of symptoms — a possible therapeutic window during which interventions could reduce the risk for neurodegeneration or slow its course.

At the 55th Congress of the Italian Society of Neurology in Padua, Italy, specialists discussed recent advances in identifying this preclinical phase and strategies for managing it.

“In an updated version of the diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease, the International Working Group (IWG) has clearly defined the characteristics of the stage preceding the clinical onset of neurodegeneration and outlined the possible trajectories of patients who show no cognitive deficits but test positive for amyloid plaques and tau protein accumulations,” explained Giovanni Frisoni, director of the Memory Clinic at Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland.

“The IWG describes a continuum that includes a presymptomatic risk phase, a prodromal phase, and a stage marked by mild, moderate, or severe dementia,” Frisoni said. “Once dementia is established, intervention can only affect the rate of progression. Monoclonal antibodies targeting amyloid plaques can slow degeneration but not stop it. In the presymptomatic phase, however, we can still ask whether a patient will develop cognitive impairment. We therefore need clear criteria to estimate an individual's risk and to guide preventive strategies.”

A recent study involving adults aged 65-77 years who underwent PET imaging to detect amyloid plaques and tau deposits found that those without cognitive impairment but positive for both biomarkers had a 60% likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease symptoms within 6 years.

“During evaluation, beyond amyloid and tau findings and patients' subjective perception of cognitive changes, we must also consider numerous other risk factors,” Frisoni noted. “The degree of risk should then be communicated appropriately to the patient, followed by a preventive strategy to mitigate it.”

According to the 2020 report by The Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care, approximately 45% of dementia cases are linked to modifiable risk factors such as lifestyle, physical activity, diet, alcohol use, environmental pollution, stress, and head trauma.

“These are the levers we can act on preventively,” Frisoni said. “Of course, the ability to modify them varies — not everyone can relocate to a less polluted area or meaningfully reduce daily stress.”

He added that research is now underway to assess the potential benefits of monoclonal antibody therapy in the presymptomatic phase, where intervention might prove most effective.

“Unlike Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's affects multiple organs and body systems, producing symptoms such as tremors, loss of smell, muscle stiffness, slowed movement, and urinary urgency,” said Angelo Antonini, MD, PhD, professor of neurology at the University of Padua, Padua, Italy.

According to a hypothesis proposed by Danish neurologist Per Borghammer, Parkinson's disease may originate differently depending on the individual. In some patients, the disorder begins with alpha-synuclein aggregates forming in the central nervous system — a mechanism referred to as brain-first. In others, it starts in the peripheral nervous system, particularly in the enteric (gut) nervous system, before spreading to the brain — a pattern known as body-first.

In the brain-first form, early symptoms are motor related, such as tremor and bradykinesia (slowness of movement). In the body-first form, gastrointestinal disturbances and REM sleep behavior disorders often appear years before motor symptoms develop.

“A recent Italian study confirmed this diversity in early manifestations among 400 patients — some experienced REM sleep disturbances, constipation, and loss of smell before any motor symptoms emerged,” Antonini said. “For certain individuals, these three signs indicate an increased risk of Parkinson's and may appear years, or even a decade, before tremor begins. Another key factor to consider is family history, which carries more weight in Parkinson's than in Alzheimer's disease.”

At present, alpha-synuclein deposits cannot be detected with PET imaging, Antonini noted. However, EEG can identify compensatory brain reorganization processes that occur in early degeneration, while functional MRI can help assess cognitive decline.

“Once these early warning signs are recognized, what can we do?” Antonini asked. “Several compounds are currently under development for use in the early stages of Parkinson's. Drugs already effective in other neurodegenerative diseases — such as monoclonal antibodies targeting amyloid plaques — may also have potential, since amyloid pathology can be present in some Parkinson's cases as well.”

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hi, everyone. Dr Chandrasekaran here. Today we're going to talk about severe community-acquired pneumonia. 

As we know, community-acquired pneumonia can come in many flavors or symptoms based off how the patient is feeling, whether it's mild, moderate, or severe, and can be scored on CURB-65 or the pneumonia severity index. 

When it comes down to it, it depends mainly on the patient's symptoms. However, we also use imaging guidance, such as chest x-rays and CT scan, to further classify. Sputum cultures are also very important, along with, these days, the viral panel to see if it's some type of virus. 

We usually treat, if it's bacterial, based off their sensitivities and cultures from the sputum culture. However, we start off with a beta-lactam and a macrolide. These usually treat most common community-acquired pathogens. 

If they are progressing to a moderate-to-severe form of pneumonia requiring some type of noninvasive mechanical ventilation or even invasive mechanical ventilation, we can upgrade the IV antibiotics to treat Pseudomonas or MRSA, especially if they have comorbid conditions such as COPD or any underlying interstitial lung disease, that we know of, or malignancies as well.

Other treatments can include steroids. As we now know from the CAPE COD trial, one of the most recent trials to come out about pneumonia, hydrocortisone can be used as treatment within the community for mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia.

Researchers at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center have developed a way to diagnose Lyme disease earlier and more accurately than traditional testing methods.

Over the past 30 years, Lyme disease has been on the rise in the United States, particularly in the Northeast region, where ticks carrying the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi are active from late spring through early fall. If left untreated, Lyme disease can cause joint, heart and nervous system complications.

While the characteristic bull's eye-like rash is an early sign of the disease, it occurs in only about 25% of patients. Many patients develop skin lesions mimicking other illnesses, complicating the clinical diagnosis. Further complicating diagnosis, antibody tests often show false negatives during the first few weeks of infection.

To address these diagnostic complications, researchers at New Hampshire's Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center have developed a new way to detect Borrelia burgdorferi, allowing for faster and more accurate diagnosis. Guohong (Grace) Huang, Ph.D., led the project and will present the work at the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) 2025 Annual Meeting & Expo, taking place Nov. 11–15 in Boston.

The project started with a case involving a 73-year-old woman who experienced progressively worsening skin hardening and inflammation as well as joint immobility over a four-year period. Doctors initially believed the patient had morphea, a condition that causes hard, thickened patches of skin. However, immunosuppressant medication used to treat morphea did not improve the patient's symptoms.

In this patient's case, antibody testing only showed evidence of prior Lyme infection, but she responded positively to the antibiotic doxycycline, a medication commonly used to treat Lyme disease.

Shaofeng Yan, M.D., Ph.D., a member of the patient's care team, requested that Huang's department develop a new molecular test to confirm the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi, leading to the larger study presented in Huang's abstract. 

The team, including Joel A. Lefferts, Ph.D., created three droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) tests-which are used to gather precise, highly sensitive measurements-to identify different types of Borrelia bacteria: one that detects all Borrelia species, one that targets those responsible for Lyme disease and one specific to Borrelia burgdorferi, the main cause of Lyme disease in the U.S. When tested on limited number of skin samples from patients with confirmed or suspected Lyme disease, the new assays showed excellent accuracy and could detect as few as five to ten bacterial cells.

Ultimately, the test for Borrelia burgdorferi developed by her team had an estimated sensitivity of 90.9% in formalin fixed, paraffin embedded samples, making it a potential new avenue for testing Lyme disease. Sensitivity is expected to increase when using fresh or frozen tissues, which typically yield DNA with higher quantity and quality.

Using the ddPCR assay, we successfully detected B. burgdorferi DNA in this patient's skin biopsy. This finding was further confirmed by DNA sequencing, supporting the diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease.""

Guohong (Grace) Huang, Ph.D.

Huang noted that traditional serological tests cannot distinguish between active infection and past exposure.

""Antibody levels may remain elevated even after successful treatment. This is another clinical scenario where the ddPCR assay offers a clear advantage by detecting active bacterial presence rather than relying on indirect immune markers,"" Huang said.

 Although it took the patient more than four years to get a final diagnosis, the test developed by Huang and her team could save future patients from such extended waits. Early diagnosis is crucial in reducing the risk of long-term complications. With further development of the team's test, prompt treatment will be possible for more patients.

""To advance this work, the next step is to expand testing to a large number of cases and explore strategies to further enhance the assay sensitivity,"" Huang said.

This work was led by Guohong (Grace) Huang, Ph.D., in the Laboratory for Clinical Genomics and Advanced Technology (CGAT), Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, and will be presented during a poster session at 9:15am Eastern time on Nov. 14, at the Thomas M. Menino Convention and Exhibition Center in Boston. Huang's poster number is TT088. She will be available to discuss the work with reporters.

Women's World Cup champions and Olympic gold medalists Tobin Heath and Heather O'Reilly were elected to the U.S. National Soccer Hall of Fame on Thursday, along with men's players Tony Sanneh and Chris Wondolowski.

Referee Kari Seitz was also chosen along with Kevin Crow, best known for his time in indoor football.

They will be inducted on May 1 at the hall in Frisco, Texas.

O'Reilly, 40, was a forward and winger who scored 47 goals in 231 international appearances, helping the US win the 2015 World Cup and Olympic gold medals in 2004, 2008 and 2012. 

She won league titles with Sky Blue in 2009 in Women's Professional Soccer and with Kansas City in 2015 and North Carolina in 2019 in the National Women's Soccer League.

Heath, 37, was a midfielder and striker who scored 36 goals in 181 appearances, won World Cup titles with the USA in 2015 and 2019 and Olympic gold medals in 2008 and 2012.

Wondolowski, 42, leads Major League Soccer with 171 goals in the regular season and two in the playoffs. He plays for San Jose (2005, 2009-21) and Houston (2006-09). He scored 11 goals in 35 international appearances and played in two matches at the 2014 World Cup.

Sanneh, 54, was a defender who scored three goals in 43 international appearances, starting all five matches for the US at the 2002 World Cup as the Americans reached the quarter-finals in their biggest progress since 1930. 

O'Reilly, Heath and Wondolowski were chosen from the player vote, while Sanneh and Crow were chosen from the veteran vote.

Seitz, 55, refereed nine games at the Women's World Cup in 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2011 and six at the Olympics in 2004, 2008 and 2012. In 2024, she became vice president of refereeing for the U.S. Soccer Federation.

CHESTER, Penn.  – It's been almost seven months since Gio Reyna was last with the U.S. men's national team. What are the attacking midfielder's teammates saying about how he has looked? 

""I feel like he's more in-tune and more focused on the field than I've seen in the past, which is a great thing,"" defender Tim Ream told the throng of reporters at the USMNT's training session on a brisk fall Friday outside of Philadelphia.

It's fútbol weather in the Philly area ahead of the USMNT's game on Saturday (Getty Images) 

Reyna has spent much of the past two European seasons either injured or on the bench. It's now two years removed from his standout performance in the 2024 Concacaf Nations League final, when his second-half goal sealed the Americans' third consecutive title in that event. 

The 22-year-old one-time prodigy is now working his way into the fold to be considered for manager Mauricio Pochettino's roster for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Reyna will get a chance to prove that in Saturday's friendly against Paraguay, followed by Tuesday's match against Uruguay in what should be a balmier setting in Tampa. 

""I'm looking forward to playing with Gio,"" U.S. striker Folarin Balogun said, who scored his first international goal on an assist by Reyna in the 2023 Nations League final win over Canada.

""I think me and him have a great connection, and he's a sort of player as a striker, you want someone like him providing creativity behind you. … As he has shown in training already, [Reyna can] make a good impact and help us in both games.""

Reyna's inclusion on Pochettino's November roster last week raised eyebrows, given that the silky attacking midfielder has yet to start a game for Borussia Mönchengladbach since signing with the German Bundesliga club in August. 

All of Reyna's 142 minutes played have come in a series of short appearances as a substitute. Still, Ream has noticed a difference in Reyna this week.

""Whether it was injury or other things that were going on, I think his focus is so much greater now,"" Ream noted.  

Ream didn't elaborate on the ""other things"" he was alluding to. But it hasn't gone unnoticed that Pochettino named both Reyna and Sebastian Berhalter, son of former USMNT coach Gregg Berhalter, to this current squad. The elder Berhalter and Reyna's parents, former U.S. national teamers Claudio and Danielle, were embroiled in a well-documented public spat following the 2022 World Cup. 

Not surprisingly, Ream was asked if the presence of both players had been an ""issue"" behind the scenes. 

""I actually completely forgot about it until like, the third or fourth day of camp,"" Ream said. ""And I was like, oh, wait a minute. But no, it's not really been discussed amongst the team. Their relationship has looked pretty normal to me and to everybody else. 

""What happened, happened,"" Ream added. ""We've all kind of moved on from it, and they have as well. And I think that's a good thing. Everyone's trying to make this team. Everybody's trying to be a part of a home World Cup … it's good to see that their focus is here and now. And hopefully both of those guys can impress over the next couple months.""

Right-back Sergiño Dest said Reyna has looked sharp on the practice fields through the first four sessions this week. 

""I'm happy that he's back,"" Dest said. ""I feel like I always had a great chemistry with him, and he's doing well. So I hope he stays that way, stays physically healthy. … I hope he stays with the team.""

CHESTER, Pa. — Auston Trusty's first experiences with Mark McKenzie and Brenden Aaronson were as teens in a cramped youth soccer dressing room. Now 27, the defender is together with his long-time friends on the U.S. national team, all trying to earn spots on next year's World Cup roster.

“When we think about it, we kind of laugh and say, like, that's crazy,” Trusty related ahead of Saturday's friendly against Paraguay. “It's pretty cool to know that we've all kind of been in the same journey together.”

Trusty has moved from Philadelphia and Colorado in MLS to Arsenal, Birmingham, Sheffield United and now Glasgow Celtic.

“To think back when we were in Wayne, Pennsylvania, in a small locker room, 70 of us squeezing in there and showering,” McKenzie said. “We've come a long way.”

Trusty and McKenzie were a center back pairing for the Philadelphia Union's Bethlehem Steel farm team, in the third tier in 2016 and the second the following year, when Aaronson and current No. 1 American goalkeeper Matt Freese joined them.

All four are products of the Union's youth academy, which this summer moved into the lavish WSFS Bank Sportsplex, a $100 million, 170,000-square-foot complex along the Delaware River and adjacent to the senior team's Subaru Park.

Trusty's interest in soccer was sparked by watching his older sister Onnie, a defender who earned a letter for Florida State in 2006.

While Aaronson and McKenzie debuted for the U.S. against Costa Rica in 2020, and Trusty played his first international in the CONCACAF Nations League at Grenada on March 24, 2023, Freese debuted against Turkey this past June and supplanted Matt Turner as the starter.

Since Trusty's debut, his three national team appearances were all as a substitute, against Canada in June 2023, Mexico in October 2024 and Jamaica during coach Mauricio Pochettino's first camp last November.

With Chris Richards and injured Celtic teammate Cameron Carter-Vickers absent, Trusty is one of only three central defenders in camp, joined by McKenzie and Tim Ream. Pochettino has been experimenting this fall with a three center-back formation, increasing the chance Trusty will see significant minutes during the games against No. 39 Paraguay and 15th-ranked Uruguay on Tuesday in Tampa, Florida.

“He was always confident, but I think he's more confident,” said Ream, captain of the No. 16 U.S. team. “He has a better — much better — kind of understanding of the different kind of positions, the different tactical shapes and, really, he's just gained a lot more experience and as a center back that's the biggest thing.”

During his year away from the national team, Trusty had been watching its games online despite the late-night and early morning starts. He's in Britain for his fourth club season.

“It's dark and raining every day everywhere, so you kind of just get used to it,” he said.

He was a second-half substitute in Celtic's first three games, then felt pain in his right foot during a Champions League qualifier against Kazakhstan's Kairat Almaty on Aug. 20. Trusty was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis and didn't play again until Oct. 29.

“Just bad timing, really,” he said. “It's a tricky injury. It just has to heal. So at the bottom of your foot it doesn't have that much circulation and blood flow.""

Trusty returned six days after Carter-Vickers injured an Achilles against Sturm Graz in the Europa League and two days after Martin O'Neill replaced Brendan Rodgers as manager. Trusty has started Celtic's last four matches.

“I know they're watching every single game,” he said of the Pochettino's staff.

Trusty assisted on Callum McGregor's go-ahead goal in extra time of a Scottish League Cup semifinal against Rangers and was selected man of the match in a Scottish Premier League game against Kilmarnock on Sunday.

“He started to play and he played really well,” Pochettino said. “We are a little bit short in that area.”

Trusty is left-footed and was paired with the right-footed Carter-Vickers at Celtic.

“Luckily for the team I can play on right side comfortably,” Trusty said. “It's not too often a lot of left footers, especially left center backs, can play on the right side comfortably. So, yeah, I've been able to step in and get some positive results.”

Trusty has a chance to play in his hometown for the first time since leaving the Union ahead of the 2020 season. The U.S. is training at the facility of the YSC Academy, the Union's education partner — Trusty has become a director. He's gotten 40 tickets for the game for family and friends.

He hopes this becomes a step to being in the U.S. squad next summer for a World Cup the Americans will co-host.

“Everything I do, everything I put myself into, it's all very, very calculated to put myself in the best chances for the national team — the national team and playing in the World Cup,” he said. “It truly is everything to me.”

Thomas Tuchel said he would expect players not selected in his England starting lineup to be angry but stressed the importance of contributions from the bench at next summer's the World Cup.

Tuchel explained before Thursday's qualifying win over Serbia that he would not play squad members out of position for the sake of getting all of his strongest players onto the pitch at once.

Competition for places is particularly high among the forwards in the England squad, with Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden named as substitutes at Wembley, and with Cole Palmer and Anthony Gordon missing through injury.

“You can be angry at the coach, you can be angry at the situation, but if you see the nations that win, see the clubs that win the Champions League, then the bench is on their feet,” Tuchel told a press conference. “For the last eight-ten minutes there is no one sat there thinking, ‘I should be on the field, I should be on the field, why am I not there?' They are just there.

“I experienced this once in the amazing run with Chelsea and it was non-stop, everyone was pushing and fighting from the bench even if they were not picked and they were ready. I strongly, strongly believe we should arrive with a team like that. Even if they are disappointed, which is absolutely normal.”

Tuchel added the role of substitutes would be particularly important given next summer's World Cup takes place in the United States, Mexico and Canada, with extreme conditions expected.

The England head coach said players' roles in the squad would be made clear before the tournament.

“They will never be happy, they don't have to be happy, no one is used to sitting on the bench, this is the nature of a strong national team,” he added.

“You see already I normally pick only 21 of 23 (players in a squad) because I just hate this talk I had to give yesterday to Alex Scott, the message, ‘you are not in the squad'. I don't like it, I have stomach pain and even to see players on the bench, they will never like it but I strongly believe they will accept it.

“We need to have the roles clear. Once we go to a tournament — what is your role? I think in a ten day camp it is easy. Sometimes you are picked, sometimes you are not picked or you are the competition for someone. But once we go to a tournament, I think clarity in the role is very important.”

England return to action against Albania on Sunday.

Ronaldo awaits the red card VAR review against Republic of Ireland Tim Clayton/Getty Images

The Athletic FC ⚽ is The Athletic's daily football (or soccer, if you prefer) newsletter. Sign up to receive it directly to your inbox.

Hello! Today we have a big change coming to Major League Soccer and an international break has finally dished up some drama.

On the way:

MLS owners have voted on a massive shake-up when it comes to the league's fixture schedule – and the majority of people are happy about it. But as we all know, you can't please everyone all the time. From what I can see, this looks like it will benefit MLS globally and means, personally, I will probably watch a lot more of its games.

So what has happened?

Well, in 2027, the league will begin in July and end with a big finale in May 2028. This brings MLS — a league which for the past three decades has started early in a calendar year and ended late — into a new era.

Teams will soon be playing in the same months as Europe's best leagues, which also means they will be preparing their deal sheets at the same time. Commissioner Don Garber (above) called it “one of the most important decisions in our league's history,” and there are some key reasons why the vote went in favour of the change:

One aspect of the switch that has proved frustrating for some fans has been what this means for the weather at matches. Some will be scorching hot, others will be freezing cold. Talking about the weather is a British pastime, so if you are looking for company or solace, TAFC is here for you. It means that in cities such as Toronto, New York and Chicago, when games are played outdoors in winter, snow will potentially be a factor, and could limit ticket sales and outdoor training sessions.

On the flip side, there will be a winter break from December through to February, and there is also talk of front-loading or back-loading games in the colder and hotter climates. But as David Rodriguez's ‘icicle kick' showed us on Monday, as he helped deliver as Atletico Ottawa's first Canadian Premier League championship, it's certainly a spectacle!

So, what do we think overall? We asked our mate Felipe Cardenas what he makes of the plans:

“Garber touted the decision to shift to a Fall-Spring calendar as ‘a historic step' for the league. I don't disagree but it has taken MLS nearly 30 years to do something that is an obvious game-changer for America's top flight.

“The league's sporting directors and coaches will celebrate the decision because it allows MLS teams to maximize the global transfer windows.

Teams will no longer be gutted and forced to play their reserves during FIFA's international breaks. Still, there are potential drawbacks, namely the harsh winter weather in northern markets. Time will tell whether that is a small price to pay for a common-sense decision.”

Just when you were counting down the days for the international break to be over, Cristiano Ronaldo decides to lash out at an Irishman.

Portugal's captain was sent off for the first time in 226 games for his country. There were tears too, of the pretend sort (above).

It came after the Portugal captain threw an elbow in the direction of Ireland defender Dara O'Shea. If you've never been to Dublin, then trust me, it's a city where a 40-year-old man should know better than to start swinging elbows. And so it proved; after initially being shown a yellow card, the red was produced following a VAR review.

Ronaldo will now miss Portugal's game against Armenia this weekend, in which they could qualify automatically for the World Cup. Should his red card ban be more than one game (they can be up to three), Portugal could also be without him for their opening match of the World Cup, given bans carry over to non-friendly games.

As for Ireland, the two goals scored by AZ's Troy Parrott mean they have a lifeline. They are now one point off Hungary in second-place in Group F. Guess what? The two sides go head-to-head in Budapest on Sunday to battle it out for a play-off place.

“On a night heavy with history and significance, rich with sub-plots and featuring any number of players who could have ended up writing their name in the headlines, when the dust settled and the smoke cleared, it ended up being all about the man who it is always all about.”

Why would I write an introduction to this segment about Kylian Mbappe when Tom Williams already served up some sweet poetry. It was a stirring night in Paris as France qualified for the World Cup with a 4-0 win against Ukraine. Mbappe scored twice. His first was a Panenka penalty, dinked to perfection.

Bayern Munich's Michael Olise got in on the action before Mbappe wrestled back the spotlight. When I say wrestled, let's face it, the light never really leaves. And with that second goal, France's third of the match, it was a moment of history. Mbappe, at the age of 26, scored his 400th goal. It's scary how good he is.

In other qualifying news…

Order these teams by the number of games they have won at the men's World Cup (first to last): Spain, England, Uruguay, Argentina, France and Italy. The answer will be here later today and in Monday's TAFC.

(Selected games, times ET/UK)

Saturday: UEFA World Cup qualifiers  — Georgia v Spain, 12pm/5pm — Fubo, ViX/Amazon Prime; Liechtenstein vs Wales, 12pm/5pm — Vix, Fubo/BBC; Greece v Scotland, 2.45pm/7.45pm — FS2, Fubo/BBC.

Sunday: UEFA World Cup qualifiers  —  Hungary vs Ireland, 9am/2pm — FS1, Fubo/Amaxon Prime; Portugal vs Armenia, 9am/2pm — FS2, Fubo/Amazon Prime; Albania vs England, 12pm/5pm — Fubo, ViX/ITV; Azerbaijan vs France, 12pm/5pm — FS2, Fubo/Amazon Prime; Italy vs Norway, 2.45pm/7.45pm — FS1, Fubo/Amazon Prime.

Yes, I'm a millennial, but does anyone remember the “What are those?” trend from about 10 years ago?

Basically, you would wear a questionable pair of shoes and your mate would heckle you with a “What are those?”

Well, I'm that mate now for Nike after it spent the past decade working on these neuroscience shoes, which look like the wearer has stepped in a bunch of gobstoppers — 22 with each foot to be precise.

Why? Apparently, they help you stay grounded. Yes, gravity does that too but Nike says these shoes help — they ‘activate key sensory areas of the brain via underfoot stimulation,' you see — and England's men's team are all over it.

Poland must topple the Netherlands at home on Friday to stand any shot of tying down an automatic qualifying spot ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

The gloves are off in Warsaw on Friday as Poland fight for their World Cup future at home to the Netherlands, with the leading pair in UEFA qualifying Group G set to square off. The Eagles currently trail the Dutch by three points in second place and need a home win this weekend to stand a realistic shot of securing first place and automatic qualification for the tournament.

De Oranje, on the other hand, know that even a draw would be enough to effectively guarantee them top spot, with the gulf in goal difference currently looking too vast for Poland to overcome in the next two games. However, Poland is also fighting for a spot in the play-offs, with third-place Finland breathing down its neck and just three points behind.

Netherlands boss Ronald Koeman has almost a fully fit squad at his disposal aside from the absence of Liverpool right-back Jeremie Frimpong. Poland, meanwhile, is missing a few potential starters in Jan Bednarek, Krzysztof Piatek, and Lukasz Skorupski.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","'Let's try the unreal'","https://www.goal.com/en-gb/lists/try-unreal-kylian-mbappe-aims-cristiano-ronaldo-target-400th-career-goal-france-win/bltbcef7032c4d736c6","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 09:44:55 GMT","

After registering the 400th goal of his remarkable career, Kylian Mbappe is ready to aim for ""the unreal"". The Real Madrid superstar is among those watching on from afar as Portuguese GOAT Cristiano Ronaldo closes in on 1,000 career goals. That milestone feels a long way off for Mbappe, but the France international is prepared to set the most ambitious of targets.

World Cup winner Mbappe reached a quadruple century on the goal front when netting for his country in a 4-0 victory over Ukraine. He bagged a brace in that contest - with his first coming from the penalty spot - and has ensured that Les Bleus will be taking in another shot at global glory next summer.

Mbappe has hit 400 goals through just 537 appearances. He is Paris Saint-Germain's all-time leading scorer - having found the target on 235 occasions for the Ligue 1 heavyweights - and sits only two efforts adrift of France's record marksman Olivier Giroud.

It is only a matter of time before he passes Giroud, with a bar of individual brilliance there set to be raised considerably higher. Mbappe also continues to star at club level, with 18 goals being recorded for Real this season through 16 appearances.

Mbappe is only 26 years of age, so has many seasons with club and country ahead of him. With that in mind, he sees no reason why he should not be looking to emulate the achievements of five-time Ballon d'Or winner CR7.

He said: ""400 doesn't impress people, if you want to be in that circle that shocks people, you have to score another 400. Cristiano Ronaldo's 1,000 goals? That's unreal. But let's try the unreal, we have to try, we only have one career.""

Mbappe is arguably at his peak right now, with it on him to ensure that those standards are maintained when chasing down more major honours with Real and France. He added on silencing any doubters in his homeland: ""I had to be the best version of myself so we could go to the World Cup. Last year was difficult for me with the national team, this season I had to show that the national team is important to me.

""On a mission? Everyone knows and can talk about football, but playing in a World Cup… only those who have played in it know that it's special, it's a privilege to represent your country in the eyes of the world.""

Mbappe captured the most prestigious of trophies with France back in 2018, before suffering final heartache against Lionel Messi and Argentina at Qatar 2022 - as he bagged a hat-trick before seeing Les Bleus lose on penalties.

He went on to say of heading back to FIFA's flagship event, with Ukraine being swept aside with the minimum of fuss: ""Pride. You should never take it for granted; today it's becoming normal, but it wasn't always the case in the history of the French national team. We had to be as sensible as possible and keep in mind that the most important thing was the win. On the pitch, we tried to do the job. We picked up the pace in the second half. After that, we played our game, we created chances, and I think people had a good evening.""

Mbappe added on his bid to become a two-time World Cup winner - an achievement that would see him join an exclusive club: ""Of course we're going there to win, like all 48 other teams. It's a dream to be able to put the third star on the French national team jersey. We need to use this 2022 World Cup final to go to the World Cup with confidence. We'll wait for the draw and focus on the first group matches.""

France will be among the favourites to go all the way when the World Cup heads to the United States, Canada and Mexico. They will discover their early opponents at that tournament when the group stage draw takes place on December 5.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Salisbury/Skupski mark their intent with group sweep at Nitto ATP Finals","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/salisbury-skupski-harrison-king-nitto-atp-finals-2025-friday","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 18:24:51 GMT","

Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski offered another compelling reminder of why they believe they are the team to beat at the 2025 Nitto ATP Finals on Friday evening in Turin.

The fifth seeds completed a flawless 3-0 sweep of the John McEnroe Group with a 7-5, 6-3 victory over already-eliminated Americans Christian Harrison and Evan King. Making their team debut at the prestigious season finale, Salisbury and Skupski remain the only unbeaten pair in the field entering semi-final Saturday.

Their 72-minute win also extended Salisbury's personal streak at the Nitto ATP Finals to 13 matches, following back-to-back titles with Rajeev Ram in 2022-23. The Britons are now level with Harrison and King at 2-2 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

“Joe seems to never lose in a group-stage match,” Salisbury said with a smile. “It's going really well, we're happy to get three wins. We've been through some difficult times this week, but we've managed to keep going.”

Although Salisbury and Skupski have yet to lift a trophy this season, they have reached five finals — including at Roland Garros and the US Open — and will take plenty of confidence into Saturday's all-British semi-final against top seeds Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool. They have surrendered just one set on their way to the last four.

“I think we just give it our all in every match,” Salisbury added. “We know it's going to be tough with all the best teams here, but there's something about this place that I feel good here and enjoy playing on this court.”







Harrison and King were hoping to become the first all-American duo to earn a win at this event since Mike Bryan and Jack Sock captured the title in 2018. But they were outmatched by Salisbury and Skupski, whose sharp volleying and dominant serving prevented them from facing a single break point, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Shelton: 'I'm not the player I want to be yet... Not close'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/shelton-nitto-atp-finals-2025-friday-reaction","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 16:25:10 GMT","

Ben Shelton bowed out of the Nitto ATP Finals on Friday without a win, but hardly empty-handed.

 

Even at 0-3 in his Turin debut, the 23-year-old leaves the year-end event with a sharper understanding of the gap he is trying to bridge. He now turns his attention to building the next layer of his game.

 

“Certainly eye-opening being able to play against some of the best players in the world, [realising] the things that I need to do better,” Shelton said in his post-match press conference Friday. “I'm not the player that I want to be yet. Not close. There's so many things that I need to work on.”

 

Shelton finishes the season with a 40-24 record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. There were highlights along the way, such as winning his biggest career title at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Canada, his third tour-level trophy. Shelton also reached his second major semi-final at the Australian Open, made a career-best fourth-round run at Roland Garros, and began this week at a career-high No. 5.

 

The lefty retired from the US Open third round with a shoulder injury and upon returning to competition in October, Shelton posted a 3-6 record the rest of the season. His week in Turin offered a reminder that progress is not always visible in the moment.

 

“I think tennis is a sport where you don't get instant gratification,” Shelton said. “I could be working on things now this week or have worked on things for the past three months, past two months, past month when I've been trying to come back. I may not see it on the court yet. But maybe in Australia, Paris, at some point next year I start to see those things come along.

 

“It's always been like that in my career. I set a goal, start working on it every day. It doesn't come to me right away. It's frustrating. Sure enough, down the line, as long as I continue to put consistent work in every single day, which has never really been a problem for me, I see those things start to work and start to come alive in my matches.”

 

After falling to defending champion Jannik Sinner 6-3, 7-6(3) on Friday, Shelton slipped to 1-8 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with the Italian. The American's lone win came in their first meeting in 2023 (Shanghai). Since then, Sinner has not loosened his grip, sweeping all 19 sets they have played.

 

“Here, indoor courts, he's hitting the lines a lot on the serve. Pinpoint accuracy,” Shelton said of Sinner. “I think his serve makes him really, really difficult here. Obviously the ability to take time away and hit winners from different places, from the baseline, wherever on the court, is a big advantage.” 

Shelton did not shy away from honestly assessing his usually lethal serve at the season finale. 

“I just honestly got out-served. That was kind of the theme of all three matches I played here, the guys served better than me,” Shelton said. “That's not the biggest concern. I know I have a great serve. Got to give a lot of credit at the end of the year, the way that guys — in-form players played. Me, coming back from being out for a while, it takes me a little bit to find my rhythm. Trying to do that at the end of the year when guys are in really good form is difficult.” 

Having started the year at World No. 21, Shelton is set to finish the season at No. 9. Had Shelton won one match in Turin, he would have finished the season in the Top 5 and as the No. 1 ranked American. The former University of Florida standout, who won the 2022 NCAA singles title, is intent on turning this week's frustration into fuel and channeling it straight into his preparation for next season. 

“It stings, for sure,” he said of his winless Turin record. “Tough to finish out the season like this, 0-3 at the Finals. Tennis is full of highs and lows. This will just make me work harder in the offseason, makes me even more excited for the 2026 season.”

“Here, indoor courts, he's hitting the lines a lot on the serve. Pinpoint accuracy,” Shelton said of Sinner. “I think his serve makes him really, really difficult here. Obviously the ability to take time away and hit winners from different places, from the baseline, wherever on the court, is a big advantage.”

F1 fitness myths busted with Alex Albon

The Cooldown Room: F2's Luke Browning takes on a charades challenge

Sergio Perez has got his first taste of Formula 1 machinery in just under a year after beginning a two-day test in a 2023-spec Ferrari at Imola as part of his preparations to return to the grid with Cadillac next year, F1.com understands. 

Sergio Perez has got his first taste of Formula 1 machinery in just under a year after beginning a two-day test in a 2023-spec Ferrari at Imola as part of his preparations to return to the grid with Cadillac next year, F1.com understands.

The Mexican endured a difficult end to a four-year stint with Red Bull which resulted in Perez ultimately reaching an agreement with the team to part ways at the end of 2024, despite having two years left on his contract. 

The 35-year-old used his first significant break from motor racing for almost two decades to spend time with family and evaluate his life goals before deciding to sign up to drive for Cadillac in the American squad's debut F1 campaign.

As a new team, Cadillac don't have a Testing of Previous Cars (TPC) programme and thus they have come to an arrangement with engine supplier Ferrari to use one of their two-year old cars to aid Perez in getting back up to speed.

The test is also giving Cadillac a chance to build on their work in the simulator and running virtual race weekends by having some members of the race team on-site working with the Ferrari crew who run the Scuderia's TPC programme.

Perez completed his seat fit at Maranello last week ahead of this week's test, which runs on Thursday and Friday, at Imola.

The car is running with an all-black livery, with Perez donning black overalls and a black helmet.

The test is designed to give the former Sauber, McLaren and Force India racer a refresher of F1 machinery and help him get used to protocols and procedures again while also assessing his fitness before he gets behind the wheel of the first-ever Cadillac F1 car in pre-season next January. 

""I think it's great to get the running and also the timing works perfectly because it's just before the January test,"" Perez, who is back to racing weight and fitness, told F1.com before getting back in the car. 

""On these two days, on the physical side, I want to see how much I've lost, where I need to work on. It will give me a very good guide for the winter, to be able to focus on that stuff.”

He added: “It is also a chance to start working together with the team, with the engineers, with the mechanics and start to speak the same language. It's definitely a great time for us.”

Since signing his deal with Cadillac in the summer break, Perez has been immersing himself in the team through regular visits to the team's UK and American bases, plus several sessions in the simulator. 

He was at the Silverstone factory on Monday for more meetings with the team plus a seat fit in their inaugural Formula 1 monocoque, which has been built to sweeping new regulations for 2026.

Following this week's test at Imola, Perez will carry out more simulator sessions, ramp up his meetings with the team and focus on a winter training block so he's ready to hit the ground running in January. 

Next year the Mexican will team up with Valtteri Bottas, who has also had a year on the sidelines as a reserve for Mercedes, with the duo oozing experience through their combined 527 Grands Prix. 

Bottas will have to wait for his first chance to work with Cadillac on-track as he is currently contracted to Mercedes until the end of the season.

Film Editor


EXCLUSIVE: After breathing new life into high-profile IP like the Spider-Man franchise and Dungeons & Dragons, Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley are looking to boldly go where no directors have gone before with a popular franchise. Sources tell Deadline that the duo are coming on to write, produce and are attached to direct a new original Star Trek film for Paramount. They will produce under their GoldDay banner.


	Plot details are being kept under wraps for now, but sources say Goldstein and Daley's film is a completely new take on the Star Trek universe and not connected to any previous or current television series, movie or prior movie development projects. That pitch falls in line with Skydance founder David Ellison's recent comments on an earnings call where he said the next Star Trek film would not be a sequel in the Chris Pine-led series but something different with new actors.

	











	While not confirmed, sources also add it's likely that new characters will be featured in this version.




			Watch on Deadline		







	As for Goldstein and Daley, the two have shown a knack for delivering scripts with new and fresh takes on existing IP while also adding a fun and lightness that differentiated them from other films in the franchise. Films like Spider-Man: Homecoming, which the two wrote, and the recent Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, which they also directed, earned strong marks from fans and critics for strong stories and fun, witty humor.


	Goldstein and Daley also have strong ties to both Paramount and Skydance on recent projects. Dungeons & Dragons was one of Paramount's best scored films from 2023 with a 91% from critics and 92% from audience members. As for Skydance, the pair recently wrote, produced and directed the original Cold War action comedy Mayday starring Ryan Reynolds. Sources say it tested through the roof in early screenings for Skydance and Apple, with plans to release it next year.

	











	Goldstein and Daley are repped by CAA, Fourth Wall Management and Hansen Jacobson Teller.

Great get for Paramount, and great get for Star Trek. If the movie's bad, something will have gone terribly wrong here.

Good luck. Original story, original characters, no existing fanbase? That's a tall order but it's better than yet another remake of Kirk and Spock. They're tired, let them rest!

Didn't they already do ‘light and goofy' with that first Abrams reboot?

All ahead at Full impulse! I hope this is a real attempt along with the GoldDay team understanding what Trek is and appreciation for what Trek means. Good Luck!

Now, these guys? These are guys that I trust to make Star Trek!

Michael Duarte, who is known to his followers as ‘FoodWithBearHands,' tragically passed away, and his wife, Jessica, has now broken her silence. 

The news was initially announced on a GoFundMe created after Duarte's passing.

“It is with a heavy heart that we share the sad news that Michael Duarte passed away in a horrible incident on Saturday, November 8th during his travel in Texas. Michael's death occurred just 3 short days after he and his wife celebrated their 9 year wedding anniversary,” the page said.

Jessica posted a long message on her husband's social media page, paying tribute to the food influencer, while also sharing a photo of their family, as the two share a 6-year-old daughter named Oakley.

“l've struggled with what to do since his passing so I'm doing what feels right and that's sharing his stories. Whether they be about his content or Mike as my husband, daddy and friend to all,” she wrote. “I feel so touched and proud to know so many people that he has inspired over his time here on earth. I plan to keep his legacy going not only for him but his family.He gave everyone every bit of him so it's my turn to give it back. I'm not quite sure what that looks like yet but hopefully he will lead me on that path.

“Thank you to everyone who has reached out. The outpouring love has really given me strength. I can feel him moving mountains❤️ a big thank you to my tribe & Mike's BBQ community for making me feel like I have an army behind me. I'm still struggling with the fact that he is no longer with us but l'm starting to see his purpose was SO much bigger. I'm starting to see God work in mysterious ways that l've never experienced before and hoping that will bring our family some peace,” she continued. “We are working on arrangements for service and will provide more details when we have them.

“As for the media coverage surrounding his death, the false narratives are disheartening and disrespectful to the legacy of a wonderful man. This is an active investigation and I ask that all media and the public refrain from sharing unverified information,” she concluded. “Mike, I'm proud to be your wife and I will carry that title with honor for the rest of my life. See you on the other side, Daddy ❤️.”

Under the post shared by Jessica, many people left sweet comments, showing their support. 

“Love this! Great wifey to a great man ❤️,” o️ne person wrote.

“Powerful words ❤️,” another person commented. 

“Thinking of you all ❤️ beautifully said,” someone else said.

How do you best tell a tragic story that everyone already seems to know? For “Murdaugh: Death in the Family” star and executive producer Jason Clarke, you have a little fun with it. Well, with an asterisk. 

“I'll give it to you straight up: it's enjoyable being a narcissist,” Clarke said during a recent chat with IndieWire as part of our Pass the Remote panel series, presented in partnership with Disney, to celebrate the art and craft of TV. “It's enjoyable being a good ol' boy, you know what I mean? It's good to be the king! There's that whole side of it. Narcissism? I looked and thought about that a lot. A lack of empathy as well, ultimately. Which is where he truly ends up, with a lack of empathy. The man stands by his decision, I guess, in still not coming clean.”

In the miniseries, Clarke stars as convicted murderer Alex Murdaugh (complete with Southern accent and rusty red hair), infamous for killing his wife Maggie (Patricia Arquette) and son Paul (Johnny Berchtold) in 2021 following years of interfamily drama, trauma, and oops, yes, other mysterious deaths. For Clarke, tapping into Alex's most basic (and base) desires was key to unlocking his character.

 










During the panel, hosted by IndieWire's own Editor in Chief & Senior Vice President Dana Harris-Bridson, some of the limited series' cast and crew joined Pass the Remote to talk about their meticulously researched show and what they hope viewers get out of it. Clarke was joined by co-creator and executive producer Erin Lee Carr; co-creator, showrunner, and executive producer Michael D. Fuller; hair department head Katie Ballard; casting director John Papsidera; and makeup department head Addison Foreman.

And while Clarke was joking a bit about enjoying the process, Clarke clearly relished tapping into whatever it is that makes Alex tick and applying it to his performance. He also credited Ballard and Foreman for assisting that transformation, not just through their own craft work, but by similarly diving head-long into a journey through “absurdity and vulgarity.” And Will Ferrell outtakes?

“There's the mechanical way of going through that and processing it, and then there's the subconscious way of just doing it,” Clarke said. “I'll say, with Addison and Katie, we used to listen to what you could term narcissistic music and dance. … You have to stay happy! It's not easy being a full-time narcissist, it's a full-time job. Katie and Addison, who were in my space so much and were probably two of the only people I let into my space to see my absurdity and my vulgarity at times and my bad temper. … We'd do a lot of things, watch Will Ferrell to laugh, to get into, ‘fuckin' the plums, just drippin' down my chin!' You have to have the big thing, to go out and just think, ‘Fuck it! I'm just concerned about me!'”

“Murdaugh: Death in the Family” is now streaming on Hulu, with new episodes rolling out through Wednesday, November 19, when the series finale will start streaming.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has made the shocking revelation that rogue government elements have been hiding the truth about contact with aliens for decades — even keeping U.S. presidents in the dark about the threat.

The nation's top diplomat, 54, reveals the mind-blowing cover-up in a new documentary, The Age of Disclosure, that will stream on Prime Video beginning Nov. 21.

“We've had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities — and it's not ours,” Rubio says.

At one point in the film, he reveals that even the White House has been kept uninformed for decades about secret government projects to reverse-engineer UFOs!

“This was pretty shocking to hear someone of Rubio's level making that allegation,” Dan Farah, The Age of Disclosure's producer and director, said on Real Time with Bill Mahr.

“For someone of Rubio's level to make that accusation in public with such certainty says a lot about what's been kept secret for decades from everyone — and, apparently, even the president,” says Dr. Bill Birnes, the New York Times best-selling author of UFOs and the White House.

“It also tells me the veil of secrecy and shadows that has kept the public in the dark so long is finally beginning to lift,” the ufologist adds.

As readers know, the U.S. government finally began opening up about UFOs in recent years, a 180 from the secrecy and cover-ups of generations past.

The Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office has logged more than 1,600 sightings of UAPs — unidentified anomalous phenomena, as UFOs are now known — over the last four years.

Since 2022, Congress has held three public hearings featuring startling testimony from retired and active military whistleblowers detailing unsettling encounters with UFOs.

Many UFOs seem to defy the laws of physics, some demonstrate instantaneous acceleration, while others were able to switch our nuclear weapons on and off, military sources told Farah.

Jay Stratton, onetime director of the government's UAP Task Force, admits in the film, “I have seen, with my own eyes, non-human craft and non-human beings,” per Variety.

Farah, meanwhile, attributes the skyrocketing number of sightings in recent decades to increasing alien curiosity about us! “We've evolved technologically very rapidly over the last 80 years, but our morals have not really [kept pace],” he says. “We're [still] a violent species, threatening war on sovereign nations … and we can [thus] be perceived as a potential threat.”

The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, has opened ‘Dead Sea Scrolls: The Exhibition,' featuring a collection of ancient Jewish manuscripts along with 200 other artifacts.

Rumors and stories of special appearances made by Jesus Christ in the town of Dozulé, France, have been declared not true.

In the 1970s, a Catholic mother, Madeleine Aumont, reported seeing Jesus 49 times, sharing that the Lord told her to build an enormous cross in the French town.

The ""Glorious Cross of Dozulé"" was to be built to a height of over 2,000 feet; it also needed to be illuminated, according to claims. 

POPE LEO XIV ANNOUNCES TWO NEW SAINTS, INCLUDING FIRST CANONIZED MILLENNIAL

There is a similar and smaller cross on display in the town. 

""The phenomenon of the alleged apparitions ... is to be regarded, definitively, as not supernatural in origin, with all the consequences that flow from this determination,"" text from the doctrinal office approved by Pope Leo XIV said.

Father Patrick Mary Briscoe, a Dominican friar based in Rome, Italy, told Fox News Digital the Dozulé messages inspired curiosity in some circles.

""[The message was] never embraced by the wider Church,"" he said. ""Perhaps that is because the Church plainly teaches that the cross of Christ is the summit of revelation.

""Pope Leo is keeping the focus where it belongs — on Christ.""

""The Church's decision is a reminder that our hope isn't in private revelations or sensational claims, but in the power of the sacraments and the truth of the Gospel.""

Father Briscoe said Pope Leo's approval of this declaration shows how seriously the church takes discernment in spiritual matters — ""not to suppress faith, but to purify it"" — and to ensure that faith is not anchored by emotion or speculation, but truth.

""It's clear that Pope Leo intends to speak directly to our scientific age,"" Father Briscoe also said. ""His recent comments on compulsive gambling and internet addiction, for example, show that he's thinking about pressing issues.""

He shared that doctrinal clarity helps protect Christian teaching from superstition and excess.

""The Vatican's discernment here safeguards authentic devotion. This is about protecting believers from confusion,"" said Briscoe. ""The Vatican isn't closing the door on devotion. Instead, Pope Leo is keeping the focus where it belongs — on Christ.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Strategy's Michael Saylor Has a Message for Bitcoin Investors as Its Price Falls","https://www.investopedia.com/strategy-s-michael-saylor-has-a-message-for-bitcoin-investors-as-its-price-falls-11849689","Fri, 14 Nov 2025 19:18:55 GMT","

 The bitcoin faithful are turning to one of their most vocal evangelists for a sign amid an intensifying market rout. His message? HODL.


 We're talking about Michael Saylor, chief of Strategy (MSTR), the enterprise software company known for stockpiling bitcoin. The price of the world's most valuable cryptocurrency has been falling lately, and rumors broke out on social media that the company was selling amid the slide. Saylor dismissed those rumors, but the notion that latched onto the possibility that the man who might be bitcoin's best-known bull was turning tail shows the negativity radiating from the market at present.


 As X users started to fret, Saylor posted an image of himself on a life raft as a burning ship sank behind him. ""HODL,"" he said, using an acronym for ""hold on for dear life.""


 The sell-off in risk assets this week—a bleed that the end of the U.S. government shutdown couldn't stem—has put a dent in the price of bitcoin and the narrative that it could be a useful hedge against stocks or a safe haven like gold. Bitcoin sank below $95,000 on Friday morning to levels not seen since early May. Some crypto-linked stocks diverged, with MicroStrategy declining about 4%, while Coinbase Global (COIN), and Robinhood (HOOD) were up at least 1%.


Bitcoin is sometimes considered a hedge against stocks, characterized as a portfolio diversification tool. Lately, it's been falling with the broader market as sentiment has soured.

 Saylor, who in recent months had forecast that bitcoin would climb to $150,000 by the end of the year, said Strategy was ""buying quite a lot"" lately in a Friday interview with CNBC. He also stopped short of providing a price target, though he said bitcoin over the long-term would ""outperform"" both gold and the S&P 500.


 ""Obviously it's hard to make a forecast for the end of the year right now given what's happened over the past few weeks,"" he said.


 The cryptocurrency has erased almost all of its 2025 gains, lagging gold's 50%-plus climb and the broad market's 14% year-to-date rise. ETF investors appear to be in selling mode: Spot bitcoin funds including iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin (FBTC) collectively showed nearly $867 million in outflows yesterday, according to Farside Investors.


 Meanwhile, crypto watchers have become less sanguine about the market rout as investors rushed to sell. Vitaliy Shtyrkin, chief product officer at Estonia-headquartered platform B2BinPay, said sentiment weakened after bitcoin fell through a key technical support zone of $100,000 to $102,000. Dean Chen, an analyst at derivatives trading platform Bitunix, likened the latest decline as more than ""a simple technical correction.""


 Though Strategy might be buying at these levels—and just a few days ago, some experts sounded bullish as bitcoin seemed to bounce—others are sitting out. ""We're in this awkward in-between zone. I don't want to be buying,"" All Star Charts' senior crypto analyst Louis Sykes said during an X live-stream discussing what to do about crypto now. ""Just go play some golf.""

⚽ Friday's World Cup qualifiers, 7.45pm GMT kick-offs

7 min: Kaminski darts down the Poland left and shoots low, but straight at Verbruggen.

“One element of qualification that doesn't seem to have got much attention yet is the (in my humble one) lunacy of the Nations League route to a playoff,” emails Tom.

“Sweden have had about as bad a qualifying campaign as you could imagine, yet throughout they've been all but guaranteed a playoff spot. I get that Uefa wants to make its new(ish) tournament attractive, but undermining their World Cup qualification groups seems an odd way of going about that.

“The thought also occurs that, if you were a weaker side playing smart, it might be a good idea to tank a Nations League campaign, get into a lower division then win that and sneak a route into a World Cup?”

All sounds extremely sensible Tom. Thanks for your message.

2 min: What a start for Poland! But what a miss too. Matty Cash is in space on the right, and crosses for Nicola Zalewski, who is six yards out with only the keeper to beat. The bouncing ball gets a bit big on him, and he shins a clumsy effort over the bar and wide. What a chance for Poland. And what a miss by Zalewski. Cash looks a bit miffed.

Allez!

We've had the anthems in Warsaw. Now it's time for some football. I'll be keeping an eye on goals elsewhere too.

I make no apology for also posting Zielinski's recent work of art:

Here's that Micky van de Ven belter from the other week:

I can't see the name Micky van de Ven without thinking of Peep Show and “Men with Ven”. How about you?

Poland's recent record in major tournaments is woeful. The players' relationship with the fans can be a complicated one. And much like England, they have an ageing and overrated striker leading the line.

Malta's earlier win in Finland meant that Poland's playoff place is secure.

Surely, though, Poland are too far behind on goal difference to win the group, even if they win tonight?

Stranger things have happened I suppose. Let's pretend this is a winner-takes-all clash just for a bit of fun.

Seriously, though, do send me an email. I can't do this without you.

Looking forward to seeing Zielinski for Poland. As readers of today's earlier blog will know, he scored a belting side-footed volley for Inter the other week.

I also saw him score a cracker for Napoli with my own eyes a few years back.

Which countries have qualified, and how did they do it?

Thomas Tuchel wants his England substitutes to channel any anger they feel at not starting into making the difference when they can because the team that win the World Cup will be defined by productivity off the bench.

The head coach will prepare a heat-proof gameplan for the finals next summer when temperatures at many of the venues in the United States, Mexico and Canada are expected to be stifling and a major part will involve how best to use his substitutes.

Poland (4-4-1-1): Grabara; Kedziora, Ziolkowski, Kiwior, Cash; Szymanski, Zielinski, Skoras, Zalewski; Kaminski; Lewandowski. Substitutes: Kochalski, Szczesniak, Rozga, Swiderski, Kapustka, Grosicki, Wszolek, Buksa, Kozlowski, Bereszynski, Dragowski.

Netherlands (4-3-3): Verbruggen; Geertruida, Timber, Van Dijk, Van de Ven; Gravenberch, De Jong, Malen; Kluivert, Gakpo, Depay. Substitutes: Flekken, Valente, Quinten Timber, Lang, Reijnders, Schouten, Roefs, Van Hecke, Emegha, Simons, Ake, De Ligt.

Referee: Maurizio Mariani (Italy)

Teemu Pukki came off the bench for Finland on 78mins – plenty of the Malta players would have seen him play many times on the telly. But Malta held on for their win.

“The Maltese are celebrating, as they should, while the Finns look shell-shocked,” writes Kári Tulinius, watching events unfold in Helsinki.

“I'd say the post-match commentary on Finnish TV was funereal, but it was more like a group of people discussing whether they should stage an intervention. At one point, there was discussion whether this was rock bottom or not.”

Things can always get worse, that's my motto. Thanks for the update as always, Kári.

Malta are ranked 166th in the world, Finland are 72nd. That's a bona fide giant-killing.

Finland have just lost 1-0 at home to Malta, which is a turn-up for the books in Group G. Jake Grech's goal on 81min won it for the visitors. That's Malta's first win in seven games in this campaign, to go with two draws. Dancing in the streets of Valletta tonight?

Luxembourg: Moris, Jans, Korac, Carlson, Bohnert, Olivier Thill, Martins Pereira, Olesen, Barreiro, Sinani, Dardari. Substitutes: Djabi Embalo, Curci, Avdusinovic, Muratovic, Pereira Cardoso, Veiga, Selimovic, Dzogovic, Sebastien Thill, Martins, Fox, Moreira.

Germany: Baumann, Baku, Anton, Tah, Raum, Pavlovic, Goretzka, Sane, Wirtz, Gnabry, Woltemade. Substitutes: Thiaw, Kimmich, Leweling, Ouedraogo, Burkardt, Nubel, Nmecha, El Mala, Schlotterbeck, Schade, Brown, Dahmen.

Referee: John Brooks (England)

Gibraltar: Hankins, Jolley, Ronan, Lopes, Jessop, Torrilla, Annesley, Mauro, Pozo, Borge, James Scanlon. Substitutes: Banda, Del Rio, Morgan, Richards, Lopez, Bent, Perera, Olivero, McCafferty, Vinet, Mouelhi, Bartolo.

Montenegro: Nikic, Marusic, Tuci, Sipcic, Radunovic, Jankovic, Adzic, Bulatovic, Milan Vukotic, Osmajic, Krstovic. Substitutes: Popovic, Petkovic, Milic, Simun, Rubezic, Vesovic, Brnovic, Perovic, Djukanovic, Kostic, Loncar, Camaj.

Referee: Anastasios Papapetrou (Greece)

Can the Netherlands do it on a cold night in Warsaw? We'll be focusing mostly on the match at the top of Group G. If Poland can win, they'd draw level on points with their opponents at the top of the group, although the Dutch goal difference is vastly superior: before kick-off it's +19 to Poland's +6. On Monday Poland are away in Malta while the Netherlands host Lithuania. Barring a shock the Netherlands will win the group regardless.

Netherlands v Poland, Luxembourg v Germany, Slovakia v Northern Ireland and Croatia v Faroe Islands are just some of the top football matches occurring this evening on the road to the 2026 Fifa World Cup. Gibraltar v Montenegro is also a football match, whether it counts as top, I will leave others to decide.

Germany need to tread carefully in Group A after losing their opener to Slovakia, while the Dutch and the Poles are duking it out for top spot in Group G. Northern Ireland are also in with a shot in Group A, but an away assignment in Slovakia won't be easy.

For all your permutations, consult Ed Aarons' definitive group-by-group breakdown below. I'll also bring you some permutations musings shortly, plus team news and other stuff. You can always send me an email with your thoughts, too. Let's get it on.
