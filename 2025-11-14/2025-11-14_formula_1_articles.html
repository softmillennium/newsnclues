                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Cooldown Room: F2's Luke Browning takes on a charades challenge All 10 current Formula 1 teams will continue to sponsor a livery and driver in F1 ACADEMY, while Cadillac are set to join the all-female series as a sponsor from 2027. F1 ACADEMY and Formula 1 have announced that all 10 current F1 teams have reaffirmed their commitment to sponsor a livery and driver in the all-female series as part of a multi-year partnership. The Cadillac Formula 1 team, who will join F1 in 2026, have also confirmed that they will join the F1 ACADEMY grid as a sponsor from 2027. This agreement not only reiterates the sport's deep commitment to increasing female participation in motorsport, on and off the track, but also reflects the rapidly expanding and highly competitive pool of drivers competing for a seat in the all-female F4-level series. This new provision reflects a tailored approach to nurturing talent and will be granted exclusively to drivers whose performance indicates strong potential for continued growth throughout a third campaign. The news comes at a time of continued global growth for F1 ACADEMY. The series' brand platform has grown rapidly in the three seasons since its launch in 2023, with races broadcast in over 170 global territories, the seven-part documentary series on Netflix produced by Reese Witherspoon's production company Hello Sunshine, F1: The Academy, and a cumulative social audience across Instagram, YouTube, X and TikTok of 1.38 million. “We're not just providing a platform for the current generation of female drivers; together, we're building a pathway to support generations of talent to come. “A sharpened focus on individualised talent development, including the opportunity for drivers with high potential to compete in up to three seasons, will give standout drivers the support and platform needed to fully realise their potential, while ensuring that the F1 ACADEMY grid consistently features the very best female talent.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Cooldown Room: F2's Luke Browning takes on a charades challenge F1 The Movie has been making headlines since its release earlier this summer, but now it's racing into entirely new territory – the Grammys. The film's official soundtrack has picked up not one – but three nominations at the 2026 Grammy Awards, including Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media and two songs for individual consideration. For a sport where finding the right rhythm is everything, tensions build to stratospheric levels, and releases of intense emotion after a race are not uncommon, it's hardly surprising that the sport translates so naturally into music. Hans Zimmer's cinematic orchestration blends flawlessly with contemporary artists, so every movie moment has a perfectly matching sound. Tate McRae's hit Just Keep Watching is up for Best Dance Pop Recording and already has over 400 million streams on Spotify. Back in June, Billboard's Top Movie Songs chart was dominated by the album, with seven of its tracks appearing in the top 10 – a clear sign of how strongly the soundtrack resonated with F1, music, and movie fans. Whether or not F1 The Album takes home a trophy, it's already made an impact on the sport – turning the sound of Formula 1 into something fans can blast over race weekends, play on a long drive, or simply to score their everyday lives. Since its debut series in 2019, the Netflix docuseries has undoubtedly transformed F1's audience, pulling in millions of new fans into its captivating world. Its unique behind-the-scenes storytelling highlights, unseen garage moments, and intricate team politics – completely reshaping how viewers can connect with the sport. The show's critical acclaim from fans has been matched by industry recognition. It's no exaggeration to say the series helped shift the global image of motorsport too – and its countless Emmy wins and nominations simply confirmed what fans already knew: the drama of F1 never stops... But it's not just Drive to Survive that has been recognised for its enthralling storytelling in the world of F1. Brawn: The Impossible Formula 1 Story on Disney+, another F1 documentary and narrated by Keanu Reeves, captured the imagination of fans and critics alike. Its vibrant retelling of Jenson Button's title winning 2009 season – when Ross Brawn's underdog team shocked the world in a fairytale season – earned an International Emmy for Best Sports Documentary. Ron Howard's 2013 film Rush, which dramatised James Hunt's epic rivalry with Niki Lauda, was nominated for Best Film (Drama) at the Golden Globes and received BAFTA nods for its editing and sound design. The film, featuring Chris Hemsworth, Daniel Bruhl, and Olivia Wilde, remains one of the most critically acclaimed sports biopics of the modern era – and is still an entertaining watch over a decade later. And in 2023, Villeneuve Pironi: Racing's Untold Tragedy, a feature documentary exploring the complex friendship turned rivalry between Ferrari drivers Gilles Villeneuve and Didier Pironi, won Best Feature Documentary at the International Motor Film Awards. The film was praised for its sensitivity, historical insight, and cinematic craft, highlighting how the real life drama of F1 can rival anything scripted when it comes to Hollywood thrills. The 2010 documentary movie Senna which charted the life and career of F1 legend Ayrton Senna, also received plenty of accolades, as it won two BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) awards for Best Documentary and Best Editing. When it comes to sporting prestige, few honours carry the weight of the Laureus World Sports Awards – and F1 has featured prominently amongst its winners. “A big thank you to everyone voting for me from the Laureus Academy. It was a recognition of not only Hamilton's sixth world title at the time, but also of his influence beyond the track with his tireless work in diversity and environmental advocacy. Daniel Ricciardo followed Hamilton's footsteps, earning the Breakthrough in 2015 after his remarkable debut season with Red Bull. The late Niki Lauda was recognised a year later with the Laureus Lifetime Achievement Award, celebrating a career defined not just by his exceptional three World Championship titles, but by his infamous resilience, leadership, and extraordinary contribution to F1 on and off the track. Teams have also shared the spotlight, with Mercedes winning Team of the Year in 2018 after a fourth-consecutive Constructors and Drivers' Championship double, while Brawn GP and Button were honoured in 2010 for their unlikely Championship wins. The star power of Formula 1 has never burned brighter. From the latest Grammys nominations and Emmy wins to numerous red-carpet appearances and chart-topping soundtracks – the sport's reach is undeniably growing. One thing's for sure: whether it's on the podium, a playlist, or the big screen, F1 isn't done collecting trophies just yet...</p>
