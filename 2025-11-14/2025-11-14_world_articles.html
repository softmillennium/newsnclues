                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Global markets have fallen after a tech sell-off that fuelled Wall Street's worst day in a month and weak economic data in China showing an unprecedented slump in investment. Japan's tech-heavy Nikkei fell 1.8% on Friday, South Korea's Kospi plunged 2.6% and there was a 1.5% fall in Australia, after a torrid day on Wall Street as Nvidia and other tech companies tumbled over valuation concerns. Figures showed that fixed-asset investment shrank 1.7% in the first 10 months, a record decline, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. China's CSI 300 fell 0.7%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.9% and Taiwan's Taiex slumped by 1.4%. A growing number of officials have also signalled caution over the prospects of a US rate cut next month. Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Jim Reid, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said: “It's certainly been a volatile week in terms of sentiment, with relief over the end of the shutdown vying with concerns over AI valuations and whether the Fed will cut rates again after several speakers have struck a more cautious tone this week. “The S&P 500 posted its worst day in over a month with a December cut probability falling sharply from about 59% at Wednesday's close to 49% last night.” Kyle Rodda, a senior financial market analyst at Capital.com, said: “The weakness in Asian markets wasn't quite as profound as what was experienced on Wall Street. “But there was still a high degree of sluggishness in Asian risk assets, notwithstanding a brief pop in Chinese stocks after underwhelming data, including extraordinarily weak investment figures, raised hopes of more stimulus from Chinese authorities.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia unleashed a massive combined attack on Kyiv early Friday, sparking fires and scattering debris across many districts of the capital, mayor Vitali Klitschko said. At least 11 people were injured as emergency crews responded to multiple strikes, he said in a statement. Five people were hospitalised, including one man in critical condition and a pregnant woman, after a series of powerful explosions sounded in the city and air defences were activated. City authorities warned that power and water outages were possible. There are a great many damaged multi-storey apartment buildings, in practically every district,” Tymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv's military administration, wrote on the Telegram messaging app. Klitschko said Kyiv's heating system had also sustained damage, with service interrupted in one district. He warned of possible disruptions to power and water supplies. A car caught fire after being hit by falling fragments. In the Podilskyi district, five residential buildings and a nonresidential structure were damaged. Several fires were caused by falling debris elsewhere in the city. In the Kyiv region, Russian strikes damaged critical infrastructure and private homes, injuring at least one civilian, regional head Mykola Kalashnyk said. A 55-year-old man in Bila Tserkva suffered thermal burns and was hospitalised, he said. The strike came as European Union officials warned this week that Ukraine must continue to crack down on corruption following a major graft scandal that has put top nuclear energy officials under scrutiny.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he told President Volodymyr Zelensky that the number of young Ukrainian men coming to Germany should be reduced, AFP reported on Nov. 13. Following a phone call with the Ukrainian leader, Merz said that young Ukrainians should remain to "serve in their own country." Close to 1.3 million Ukrainian refugees have been recorded in Germany as of October 2025 after fleeing Russia's full-scale invasion. This represents the highest number among all EU countries. Military-age men have faced strict travel restrictions under martial law, instituted when Russia launched its all-out war in 2022. Germany said that young Ukrainian men began arriving in large numbers after Kyiv eased travel rules for those aged between 18 and 22 in August. As a result, the number of Ukrainian men in this age group registering in Germany went from 100 a week to almost 1,000, according to the German Interior Ministry. Around 490,000 Ukrainians of working age staying in Germany are receiving unemployment benefits, a point of criticism from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Facing political pressure, Germany's ruling coalition is preparing a bill that would reduce benefits for Ukrainians who arrived after April 1, with the aim of incentivizing them to seek employment. Based in Lviv, Martin often reports on international politics, with a focus on analyzing developments related to Ukraine and Russia. Following a phone call with Zelensky, Merz said that young Ukrainian men should remain to "serve in their own country." Ukrainian drones struck the Russian port city of Novorossiysk on Nov. 14, damaging an oil terminal and sparking a large fire, multiple Russian Telegram channels reported. Ukrainian drones struck a military base in occupied Crimea used for the storage and maintenance of Russian "Orion" drones, Robert "Madyar" Brovdi, the commander of Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces, reported on Nov. 13. Kyiv has previously managed to free civilian Ukrainian captives during exchanges with Moscow. Ihor Fursenko, one of the key members of the group allegedly laundering money from the scheme, was formally employed at Fire Point to save him from mobilization and allow him to travel outside of Ukraine, according to a snippet of dialogue released in the trial. Rubio also confirmed that the U.S. is not interfering in the expansion of a Hungarian nuclear power plant by a Russian company. Independent journalism is never easy, and it's even harder in wartime.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investigation by Guardian and Carbon Brief finds just a fifth of funds to fight global heating went to poorest 44 countries China and wealthy petrostates including Saudi Arabia and UAE are among countries receiving large sums of climate finance, according to an analysis. The investigation found a broadly functioning system that shifts capital from rich polluters to vulnerable nations, helping them clean their economies and adapt to a hotter world. But it also found that because the distribution of the largest part of the funds had no central oversight and was entirely at the discretion of individual countries, it was subject to political interests and not always directed where it was most needed. Some LDCs received more than two-thirds of their climate finance in the form of loans, whose repayment terms can push governments further into debt traps. Most of the world's developed countries provide finance to support climate action in developing ones, bilaterally and through multilateral organisations such as development banks. The projects include $625m for an offshore electricity transmission project in Abu Dhabi and $452m for a waste incinerator in Dubai. Saudi Arabia, which is one of the top 10 carbon emitters thanks to its giant oilfields and majority-ownership of Aramco, received about $328m in Japanese loans, including $250m to its electricity company and $78m for a solar farm. Joe Thwaites, a climate finance advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said overall flows of climate finance were increasing but “not enough” was getting to the poorest and most vulnerable communities, with debt-distressed countries needing more grants and concessional loans. Over the two years under consideration, about $33bn was committed to the LDCs, which include Haiti, Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Yemen. India was the single largest recipient of finance over the reporting period, receiving about $14bn, while China received $3bn, mostly from multilateral banks. China's economy, for instance, has boomed since the UN classified it as developing in the 1990s, and its emissions have surpassed European levels on a per capita basis. The UN's development categories have not changed since they were drawn up in 1992. “That allows countries such as Israel, Korea, Qatar, Singapore and UAE – all of which have become wealthy nations with large carbon footprints over the last 30 years – to shirk their international responsibilities,” said Sarah Colenbrander, climate director at the Overseas Development Institute. “It is absurd that such nations remain in the same category as countries like Togo, Tonga and Tanzania.” Some of the world's poorest countries receive more than two-thirds of their climate finance in the form of loans, despite warnings that many cannot afford the terms and interest repayments. “The hidden story of climate finance is not in the volume of commitments, but in their forms,” said Ritu Bharadwaj, climate finance director at the International Institute for Environment and Development. “Climate finance is increasing the financial burden on poorer nations. Data from the World Bank shows that over the same period, LDCs have together repaid almost $91.3bn in external debts – three times their climate finance budgets. “Conventional thinking is that taking on more debt isn't bad if it is being used to fund growth-enhancing expenditure,” said Shakira Mustapha, a finance expert at the Centre for Disaster Protection. “My concern is whether countries are just taking on new debt to repay old debt and we are just kicking the can down the road.” The foreign ministries of China, Japan, Saudi Arabia and UAE did not respond to a request for comment. The Guardian and Carbon Brief analysis on climate finance includes the bilateral and multilateral public funding that developed nations have committed for climate projects in developing countries. The analysis excludes other types of funding that contribute to the $100bn target for climate projects such as private donations and export credits. Likewise, using OECD methodology, we calculated the share of multilateral climate finance which is attributable to this group. This is based on a methodology that has been used by analysts at the World Resources Institute and ODI. But many projects remain unclassified because the recipients are not specified, are reported as “multi-country”, or are part of a group of countries for which the funding cannot be disaggregated. These projects have not been included when calculating the amount of finance that individual developing countries received, but they are included in the total figures. A spokesperson for UN Climate Change said: “The inequities revealed in climate finance flows highlight why a shift in the global financial system is urgently needed. Treating climate finance as charity has held back the progress the world needs, as has treating it purely as a cost and ignoring the massive human and economic dividends it pays.” Last week, the heads of the two most recent UN climate summits published a report that explored ways of sustainably raising the cash that included taxes on fossil fuels and climate-resilient debt clauses. It also called for an expansion of concessional and grant-based climate finance.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares. Saratov Oblast Governor Roman Busargin confirmed that drones attacked the region overnight and said that "civilian infrastructure" in Saratov had been damaged. Emergency services are operating at the site, he said. Photos and videos of explosions circulated on social media amid the attack. It produces over 20 different petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel, fuel oil, and bitumen. The refinery has been hit several times this fall. Previous attacks forced the facility to temporarily halt oil intake in August, Bloomberg reported. Ukraine regularly launches long-range drone attacks on industrial and military facilities in Russia. Oil refineries, which fund and fuel Moscow's war machine, are frequent targets. Abbey Fenbert is a senior news editor at the Kyiv Independent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three Chinese astronauts landed back on Earth on Friday, according to state media, more than a week later than their scheduled landing, capping an extended stay in space after a suspected debris hit left their spaceship with a cracked window. After the capsule hatch opened medical teams found that the astronauts were in good physical condition, Chinese state media outlet CCTV reported. The crew of the Shenzhou-20 spaceflight had been due to finish their mission at China's Tiangong space station last Wednesday; they'd even handed the keys to the space station to a new crew who had just arrived for their own six-month mission. But instead, their journey home was postponed “due to a suspected impact from tiny space debris” to their ship, according to state-run news agency Xinhua. During their extra week in space, the crew continued working and living alongside the newly arrived Shenzhou-21 astronauts, as the space station has enough capacity to support two crews in orbit, according to Xinhua. The Tiangong station is only one of two operating space stations, alongside the International Space Station. Since it was completed in 2022, the biannual launches of China's Shenzhou program have been a source of national pride. Recent advances have seen China break an American-held record for the longest spacewalk, with a nine-hour sortie, and it's about to open the doors of the Tiangong to foreigners for the first time, with plans to welcome an astronaut from Pakistan next year. The new crew on board the Shenzhou-21 – who are now without a spaceship to return in – include China's youngest astronaut to be sent to space, 32-year-old Wu Fei. The Shenzhou-22, due to launch sometime next year, will include one astronaut who stays more than a year for a “long-duration residency experiment,” Xinhua reported. China's rapid development in space exploration has raised alarm bells in Washington, which is racing to put an astronaut on the moon again. The Trump administration placed bans on Chinese citizens with US visas participating in NASA programs. What was meant to be a short stay on the International Space Station stretched into a more than nine-month mission for two American astronauts earlier this year after their spacecraft malfunctioned.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three Chinese astronauts landed back on Earth on Friday, according to state media, more than a week later than their scheduled landing, capping an extended stay in space after a suspected debris hit left their spaceship with a cracked window. After the capsule hatch opened medical teams found that the astronauts were in good physical condition, Chinese state media outlet CCTV reported. The crew of the Shenzhou-20 spaceflight had been due to finish their mission at China's Tiangong space station last Wednesday; they'd even handed the keys to the space station to a new crew who had just arrived for their own six-month mission. But instead, their journey home was postponed “due to a suspected impact from tiny space debris” to their ship, according to state-run news agency Xinhua. During their extra week in space, the crew continued working and living alongside the newly arrived Shenzhou-21 astronauts, as the space station has enough capacity to support two crews in orbit, according to Xinhua. The Tiangong station is only one of two operating space stations, alongside the International Space Station. Since it was completed in 2022, the biannual launches of China's Shenzhou program have been a source of national pride. Recent advances have seen China break an American-held record for the longest spacewalk, with a nine-hour sortie, and it's about to open the doors of the Tiangong to foreigners for the first time, with plans to welcome an astronaut from Pakistan next year. The new crew on board the Shenzhou-21 – who are now without a spaceship to return in – include China's youngest astronaut to be sent to space, 32-year-old Wu Fei. The Shenzhou-22, due to launch sometime next year, will include one astronaut who stays more than a year for a “long-duration residency experiment,” Xinhua reported. China's rapid development in space exploration has raised alarm bells in Washington, which is racing to put an astronaut on the moon again. The Trump administration placed bans on Chinese citizens with US visas participating in NASA programs. What was meant to be a short stay on the International Space Station stretched into a more than nine-month mission for two American astronauts earlier this year after their spacecraft malfunctioned. Both countries are also competing in nascent institution-building efforts, with the US-led Artemis Accords on lunar exploration matched up against the Chinese- and Russian-led International Lunar Research Station.

Russian state media RIA Novosti also resported that a civilian vessel in the port was hit during the mass UAV strike, leaving three crew members injured. "Meanwhile, Russia is hitting residential buildings and energy infrastructure." The strike on Novorossiysk came as Russia pounded Kyiv with waves of drones and missiles during a massive attack that left at least 14 people injured and a dozen apartment buildings in flames.Novorossiysk, a key hub for Russia's Black Sea logistics and energy infrastructure, has been repeatedly targeted in Ukrainian strikes. Kyiv considers Russian oil refineries and petrochemical facilities to be valid military targets as they help fund Moscow's war efforts. Following a phone call with Zelensky, Merz said that young Ukrainian men should remain to "serve in their own country." Ukrainian drones struck the Russian port city of Novorossiysk on Nov. 14, damaging an oil terminal and sparking a large fire, multiple Russian Telegram channels reported. Ukrainian drones struck a military base in occupied Crimea used for the storage and maintenance of Russian "Orion" drones, Robert "Madyar" Brovdi, the commander of Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces, reported on Nov. 13. Kyiv has previously managed to free civilian Ukrainian captives during exchanges with Moscow. Ihor Fursenko, one of the key members of the group allegedly laundering money from the scheme, was formally employed at Fire Point to save him from mobilization and allow him to travel outside of Ukraine, according to a snippet of dialogue released in the trial. The two Ukrainian companies targeted were Ekofera and Imperative Ukraine, which the U.S Treasury says are Ukrainian front corporations. Rubio also confirmed that the U.S. is not interfering in the expansion of a Hungarian nuclear power plant by a Russian company. Independent journalism is never easy, and it's even harder in wartime.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than half a million people in South Korea sat for the country's grueling university entrance exam on Thursday as police mobilized to ensure they made it to the test sites on time and all flights were halted for half an hour. Most of the candidates were born in 2007 when there was a surge in births because it was considered an auspicious time to have a baby. Flights at all airports, including Incheon International Airport, were banned from landing or takeoff between 1:05 p.m. and 1:40 p.m. to ensure there was no disturbance while the students sat for the listening comprehension section of the English test. The decision affected 140 flights, including 65 international arrivals and departures. Flight trackers showed aircraft circling near airports as the Transport Ministry restricted aircraft from altitudes below 3,000 meters (9843 ft). Financial markets and offices opened an hour later than usual to ensure test candidates arrived on time for the nine-hour exam that is seen as crucial for success in the hyper-competitive society. “This exam has been a goal for nearly 20 years and also a new beginning,” said Yeseon Kim, who was waiting outside a test site where her daughter was sitting the exam. A total of 554,174 people registered this year, up 6% from last year and the highest since 2019. Some 496,000 babies were born in 2007 in a jump that paused a steady decline since the mid-1990s. South Korea is one of the world's fastest-aging societies, although its birthrate rose to 0.75 in 2024.</p>

SEOUL, November 14. /TASS/. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui has denounced the appeal of the foreign ministers of the Group of Seven (G7) states to denuclearize calling it hostile machinations, according to the Central Telegraphic Agency of Korea (KCNA).

"I express my complete dissatisfaction and regret over the outright hostile machinations of the G7 foreign ministers, which are a direct encroachment on the constitution of our state," she said, referring to a joint G7 foreign ministers' statement issued after their meeting in Canada.

North Korean nuclear status is specified in its constitution.

She called the G7's desire for denuclearization a manifestation of "inertia of thought" because the international community "understands its impossibility."

"No one has the right to force us to violate the constitution, and no one can try to change it," Choe Son Hui said.

"The current status of the DPRK will not change under the influence of external rhetoric and insistence, in today's harsh geopolitical environment, the possession of nuclear weapons is the most accurate choice to deter the most dangerous states."

Choe Son Hui called on the international community to pay attention to the threat to peace and security from the Group of Seven, which she called a "nuclear alliance." She reiterated that North Korea will possess nuclear weapons until "the nuclear threat from external forces is put an end to, as long as there are forces that consider nuclear weapons to be a means of their tyranny."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The British intelligence services and the military have stopped providing the United States with intelligence on the movement of ships in the Caribbean on recommendation of Attorney General for England and Wales Richard Hermer, The Times reported citing sources. According to them, Hermer fears an international lawsuit against the UK over its involvement in the US strikes on ships in the Caribbean. CNN was the first to report on November 12 that the United Kingdom had stopped providing the intelligence. According to the newspaper, the recommendations indicated that the UK had signed up to stricter rules of conduct in international waters than the United States, and could be considered complicit in what the UN called "extrajudicial executions." The government declined to comment saying only that the United States remains Britain's closest partner in defense, security and intelligence matters. Washington accuses Venezuela of not actively fighting drug smuggling. The US Navy has deployed eight ships, one nuclear submarine, and more than 10,000 troops in the Caribbean Sea and is destroying high-speed boats in international waters, allegedly involved in drug smuggling from Venezuela. According to The New York Times, US President Donald Trump has authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela. The American media has repeatedly reported that the United States may soon begin attacking drug cartel facilities in Venezuela. However, on October 31, Trump said he was not considering attacks on Venezuelan territory.</p>
