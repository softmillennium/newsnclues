                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. In September, Trump issued an executive order seeking to change the department's name. “This name sharpens the Department's focus on our own national interest and our adversaries' focus on our willingness and availability to wage war to secure what is ours,” Trump's order states. According to six sources speaking to NBC News — including two senior Republican congressional staffers, two senior Democratic congressional staffers, and two other individuals briefed on the price tag — the name change could cost as much as $2 billion. Several signs have already been changed, including one outside the Pentagon that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth installed himself as part of a photo op this week. But other signs have yet to be removed and replaced, NBC News reported. Republican members of Congress have submitted legislation to make the name change official, but the administration has not formally pushed for lawmakers to prioritize it. The move “appears to prioritize political theater over responsible governance, while diverting resources from core national security functions,” a group of Democratic lawmakers wrote in a letter to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in September, requesting information on cost estimates. The name change signals that the president and his department heads are willing to spend money on pet projects while making cuts elsewhere, ostensibly justifying doing so as a means of reducing federal spending. But those cuts have come with huge consequences, including detrimental effects on military veterans. The cuts also meant veterans would “lose access to therapies” and other important treatment options, those doctors added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pete Skandalakis appointed himself to take over 2020 election interference case from district attorney Fani Willis Pete Skandalakis, a Republican and the executive director of the prosecuting attorneys' council of Georgia, the state body that provides legal training and is often charged to mitigate prosecutorial conflicts, wrote in a statement on Friday that he would be taking over for Willis. The case remains the only criminal prosecution of Trump remaining, but it has been on life support after Willis was disqualified by the Georgia supreme court, which ruled that her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, revealed in dramatic court filings in January 2024, created an impermissible appearance of a conflict of interest. While president, Trump is protected from state-level prosecutions, but the other 14 remaining defendants are still subject to prosecution. Fulton county's courts have called on Skandalakis to resolve a conflict before in this case, after Scott McAfee, Fulton county's superior court judge, found that Willis's office had a conflict of interest with Burt Jones, who served as one of 16 “alternate” GOP electors in Georgia to cast a vote for Trump during the 2020 legal conflict over election results. Skandalakis ultimately declined to press charges in the case against Jones, who is now Georgia's lieutenant governor and a candidate for governor in 2026. McAfee set a 14 November deadline for Skandalakis to find a new prosecutor on the Trump racketeering indictment to avoid dismissing the case entirely. Accordingly, it is important that someone make an informed and transparent determination about how best to proceed.” Skandalakis noted that he did not receive the complete investigative file from Fulton county prosecutors until last week. In addition to Trump, Mark Meadows, the president's former chief of staff, and former New York mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani remain defendants in the case. Trump pardoned Meadows and Giuliani of any federal crime related to the 2020 election, a largely symbolic gesture.</p>

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! People held at the Core Civic-run Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) jail in Kern County, California are denied medical care, access to their attorneys, and, for disabled detainees, the most basic accommodations, according to a class-action lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and others this week in the the U.S. District Court for Northern California. The complaint says people at the California City Detention Facility are also subjected to solitary confinement and brutal attacks by staff. “No human being, immigrant or not, should be subjected to these horrendous conditions,” Gustavo Guevara, one of seven named plaintiffs in the suit, said in a statement. Earlier this year, CoreCivic entered into a contract with ICE to reopen the jail, which had previously operated as a prison and closed in 2023. Currently there are more than 800 people held at the jail, although that number is expected to significantly grow. In advance of CoreCivic's third quarter earnings call, which was held on November 6, the company announced its total revenue for the quarter was $580.4 million, an increase of 18.1 percent from the prior year's quarter. “Ongoing demand for the solutions we provide, particularly from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), contributed to a solid third quarter,” Damon T. Hininger, CoreCivic's Chief Executive Officer, said in a statement. Their fortune is built on — and only possible because of — mass suffering. People are locked in concrete cells the size of a parking space for hours on end, and officers threaten them with violence and solitary confinement. Temperatures are frigid; those who cannot afford to buy sweatshirts from the exorbitantly priced commissary suffer in the cold, some wearing socks on their arms as makeshift sleeves. “Some of the people I'm detained with don't even have soap — they take showers without soap — and they're losing weight because they don't have enough to eat,” plaintiff Sokhean Keo said in a statement. Yuri Alexander Roque Campos, one of the plaintiffs, has been denied his heart medications for days at a time, which has resulted in two hospitalizations. During the last hospitalization, a doctor said he could die if this were to happen again. Another named plaintiff, Fernando Viera Reyes, has been waiting for months for a biopsy so he can receive a formal diagnosis of prostate cancer and begin treatment, according to the complaint. Viera Reyes is experiencing increasingly abnormal bloodwork results and bleeding with urination,” the suit says. “Although he still has not seen a specialist, these results indicate that his cancer may have metastasized while he has been waiting for an appointment.” Plaintiff Fernando Gomez Ruiz, who has lived in California for more than twenty years, was abducted by ICE while he was eating at a food truck outside a Home Depot. An insulin-dependent diabetic, he's been denied regular doses of insulin while detained at the jail. He has a large ulcer on the bottom of his foot “which he is forced to cover with soiled bandages and bloody shoes.” The plaintiffs allege that people with disabilities are denied necessary accommodations, including wheelchairs, sign language interpreters. When plaintiff Jose Ruiz Canizales, who is deaf, tries to speak with staff “they often shrug their shoulders, walk away, or laugh at him,” according to the complaint. Since he arrived at the jail in August, he has only interacted with a sign language interpreter once, and that was through a video call. Earlier this month, California City staff confiscated custom orthopedic shoes and insoles from a man who has amputated toes, “which cause an imbalance when he walks,” according to the complaint. “He previously fractured his remaining toes from walking with that imbalance, leading his podiatrist in the community to order these accommodations for him,” the suit says. “He spoke to both an officer and a nurse at California City to request the custom shoes and insoles as a disability accommodation, but neither provided them.” In another incident, an officer was speaking to a person who did not speak English and did not understand the officer. In September, detainees organized a hunger strike and sit-ins to protest their conditions, and sent the warden a list of demands: We have medical needs and records that prove it. Stop threatening us with solitary confinement for requesting these basic necessities. Stop threatening us with retaliatory transfers for asserting our rights. Allow us access to our mail and phone calls. Staff placed many protesters in solitary confinement, and medical staff threatened to withhold medication from hunger strikers unless they ceased their protest. “Conditions remained bleak for people civilly detained at California City, resulting in a widespread sense of hopelessness, desperation and, in some cases, self-harm and suicidal ideation,” the suit says. On October 9, a man hung himself in his cell. It allegedly took staff about ten minutes to cut him down. Those who did not immediately return to their cells after the incident were given disciplinary tickets, according to the complaint. “This is bigger than me, but filing this lawsuit feels like something I can do to call for help for myself and everyone else here.” Truthout relies on individual donations to publish independent journalism, free from political and corporate influence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the 37th edition – part competition, part a celebration of cheese – kicked off in Switzerland on Thursday, some visitors might wish the offerings had more holes. Connoisseurs, culinary experts and curious consumers flocked to the three-day event in a country where cheese is both food and folklore. All those offerings in the same Bern exhibition hall made for an original mélange of odours. John Farrand, managing director of the Guild of Fine Food in Britain, the event organizer, says some people who tell him they “don't like cheese, it's that awful smelly thing” just need to take time and consider the myriad choices. “I get so many people say to me just impulsively ‘I don't like blue cheese' and that's impossible really. There's so much of a range of blue cheese from over here to over here,” – Farrand gesticulated around the hall – “there's always a blue cheese for somebody.” He rhapsodized about a 120-kg wheel of cheese that teams rolled in and “broke” – or cut open – unleashing a powerful cloud of odour. “The aroma of this Emmentaler just hit me,” Farrand said. Some 46 countries took part in the World Cheese Awards, a record count of competitors from Australia to Austria, Bulgaria to Brazil.Anthony Anex/The Associated Press Some may turn up their noses at bacteria-blued “bleu” cheeses or reject the strong odours of varieties like Limberger, Taleggio, “Stinking Bishop” and Époisses de Bourgogne – a Burgundy specialty reputed to be Napoleon's favourite, and one so stinky that urban legend claims it's banned from public transport in France. More adventurous tasters will try the most gooey or mouldy cheeses, looking for the most rich, creamy or meaty varieties on hand. For the judges, no such compunction: It's more about scrutiny, savouring, criticism and curiosity. They sliced wedges out of hard cheeses and pressed them to their noses, or used spreaders to scoop up soft cheeses, inspecting the consistency and licking or dribbling them onto their tongues. Journalists were allowed into the area only under escort, and were only allowed to view and smell the cheeses – not taste or even touch them. It was a blind taste test for the 265-odd judges on hand: All identifying packaging or marking was removed from the cheeses. Their job was to poke, peruse, sniff, touch and taste the offerings – a tall order with so many to choose from – before making their selections for gold, silver and bronze awards based on attributes like aroma, body, texture, flavour and “mouthfeel.” While the final products from the “caseiculture” – the curdling, coagulating, cheddaring and other processes involved in making cheeses – can be judged on aspects like craftsmanship and quality, taste is an individual thing. This year's winner was Swiss: A “spezial” Gruyere from the Vorderfultigen Mountain Dairy about 20 kilometres south of Bern, which scored 85 points from the jury. The raw cow's milk cheese was drained overnight and dry salted before being matured for more than 18 months. A creamy, flower-sprinkled “Crémeux des Aldudes aux fleurs” from the village of Etxaldia in French Basque country was runner-up, trailed by a 9-month-aged Swiss Appenzeller Edel-Würzig. Many cheeses come away with other accolades: More than 20 were selected as national or regional “bests” – such as best American, Basque-country, Japanese or Ukrainian cheese. The competition started in Britain, but Italy, Spain and Norway have also hosted. Charlie Turnbull, director of the Academy of Cheese, poked his nose toward a round, soft brownish-orange cheese with a pungent smell caused by the Brevibacterium linens – “a close relative to the kind of bacteria you get in boys' trainers when they're about 15 years old.” But he added that once one got past the smell, the cheese tasted wonderful, noting “hints of fruit, lots of meaty notes, some ham stock.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A series of exchanges between child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Larry Summers, the former US treasury secretary, showing a relationship as confidants emerged among the emails released by Republican legislators this week in the continuing political turmoil over Epstein's connections to Donald Trump. Summers, a former president of the university who lost his position in a scandal after making sexist comments about female academics, went on to say in the email to Epstein: “I observed that half of the IQ In [the] world was possessed by women without mentioning they are more than 51 percent of population.” But questions have lingered about his association with Epstein, a longtime associate of Trump. After the Wall Street Journal revealed a previous tranche of emails between Epstein and Summers in a 2023 piece, a spokesperson for Summers told the paper that he “deeply regrets being in contact with Epstein after his conviction”. Summers's spokesperson has not yet responded to a request for comment from the Guardian. Democratic lawmakers released emails from the Epstein estate this week that suggest Epstein believed Trump was aware of conduct by the now-convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. In response, Republican lawmakers released a much bigger tranche of 20,000 emails from the Epstein estate. In the emails, Summers and Epstein discuss politics – particularly Summers's contempt for Trump – as well as the details of philanthropic social networking – and women. making you pay for past errors,” Epstein wrote in an exchange on 16 March. Summers reiterated his regret to the Harvard Crimson on Wednesday. “I have great regrets in my life,” he wrote. “As I have said before, my association with Jeffrey Epstein was a major error of judgement.” The university later concluded Epstein “lacked the academic qualifications visiting fellows typically possess and his application proposed a course of study Epstein was unqualified to pursue”. Harvard only stopped accepting Epstein's donations after he pleaded guilty to child sex offenses in 2008. Summers would eventually win appointment as director of the White House national economic council (NEC) from January 2009 until November 2010. After Summers left the White House, he began asking Epstein for philanthropic advice for his wife, Elisa New, a Harvard professor pursuing a poetry project, according to reporting by the Wall Street Journal. After reporting about Epstein's donations emerged, New's charity made a donation “in excess” of that received to anti-sex-trafficking organizations, a spokesperson told journalists in 2023.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kiev is prepared to take any measures, including information provocations, to force young Ukrainians back from Europe as potential recruits, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters. "There is intel indicating that the Kiev clique, despite officially lifting the ban on men aged 18 to 22 traveling abroad, is ready to take any measures — including staging information provocations — to force potential recruits who fled the country to return," the diplomat said. "The emphasis will be placed on curtailing the Kiev regime's temporary protection programs and projects supporting Ukrainian emigrants. They will also apply their own methods, such as provocation, denunciation, and discrediting of forced migrants. In particular, they will simulate the negative perception of Ukrainians by citizens of European Union countries," the spokeswoman said. "So what does all this mean? Zelensky is expected to kill more Ukrainian citizens. Now, everyone understands this because, apart from redistributing colossal funds and schemes with weapons, his task is also to destroy the citizens of Ukraine and this region," Zakharova added. "As for the hatred toward Russia and everything Russian, we raise this issue constantly. There is simply no other way to interpret or explain what is happening," the diplomat concluded.</p>

MOSCOW, November 14. /TASS/. Russia will always remember the North Korean military's vital role in the hazardous and challenging task of clearing mines in the Kursk Region, Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday.

"We will never forget this assistance [from North Korea in mine clearance of the Kursk region]," he said at a news briefing. "This work continues, it is dangerous and difficult."

"And indeed, our Korean friends are helping us immensely, we highly appreciate it," Peskov said in response to a question about the Kremlin's assessment of the North Korean military's assistance to clear the Kursk Region of mines.

Mine-clearing operations in the Kursk Region, which was earlier freed from Ukrainian forces, are still underway. Alongside Russian specialists, combat engineers from North Korea are taking part in the difficult task of clearing the area from explosive devices.

A unit of North Korean combat engineers was formed and deployed to the region by order of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The decision followed bilateral agreements based on a comprehensive strategic partnership deal inked during his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Pyongyang in June 2024.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Attempt to pressure Republicans against signing petition for Epstein files vote fails The secure, wood panelled room on the West Wing's ground floor is usually reserved for top secret meetings about military operations and national security issues, but that morning there was another burning issue on the agenda: Jeffrey Epstein. Ms Boebert, 38, was one of four Republicans to sign the petition, which would finally secure the required 218th signature later that day when Democrat Adelita Grijalva was sworn in. The top level meeting came hours after the Democrats released three of Epstein's email exchanges which raised questions over how much Mr Trump knew about his former friend's conduct. On Tuesday, Mr Trump himself had reportedly called Ms Boebert as part of an intense pressure campaign to push her to tow the party line. The campaign failed and reportedly only strengthened Ms Boebert's conviction. “It just exposes a true weakness, possibly a lack of full understanding that the White House has around the Epstein matters, that their own efforts or denials are damaging to only themselves right now.” “It was less so a masterstroke of party discipline than it was an actual firewall against bipartisan sunlight that could scorch reputations across the aisle. The discharge petition now has enough signatures to force a vote on the House floor, which House Speaker Mike Johnson has suggested could be held next week. It is expected to pass with support from dozens and possibly 100 Republicans, sources told Politico. There are still significant, and somewhat insurmountable, hurdles to jump through before the files are released: it must pass through the Senate and would require Mr Trump to sign it off himself. But if swathes of Republicans vote for transparency it will symbolise the strength of feeling for these files to be released, flames Mr Trump fanned himself before he became president. But her refusal to bow to pressure from Mr Trump shows how split the US president is from some of his core supporters on this issue. She came under fire this Halloween after she dressed up as a Mexican woman and her boyfriend Kyle Perry wore an ICE agent costume. Tell me if juicy ICE coming”, which appeared to mock the pronunciation of “you see”. Ms Mace, another Maga loyalist, put out a statement explaining her own experience of sexual abuse and rape and how the Epstein petition “is deeply personal” but doubled down on her loyalty to Mr Trump saying she will “defend every last attack” on Mr Trump “to the death”. On social media Mr Trump has branded the Epstein issue a “hoax” and blamed the Democrats and has called his own supporters “stupid” for refusing to move on from it. He even sent Todd Blanche, his deputy attorney general, to interview convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell about Epstein in an effort to exonerate himself. “Ultimately, it's Trump himself who is fully responsible for turning a bipartisan transparency push into a loyalty litmus test that risks alienating the very hardliners who could define his post-presidency influence.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An unidentified drone was sighted over a gunpowder plant in southwestern France on Nov. 12, following similar incidents just two days earlier, French news channel BFM TV reported, citing prosecutors. The incident is the latest in a string of suspicious drone sightings across European airports, defense factories, and other strategic civilian and military sites in recent months. Recent drone sightings have caused disruptions in several European countries, including Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands. As investigations continue, local authorities have not ruled out that Russia may be behind the incursions. In recent weeks, unidentified drones have been spotted in Belgium over a nuclear power plant, Brussels Airport, and the Kleine Brogel Air Base. The country's military has issued orders to open fire against drones in case of further incursions. The unexplained drone sightings were preceded by Russian aircraft and drones violating NATO airspace on several occasions. Polish forces shot down several Russian drones that entered their airspace during an attack on Ukraine in early September. Incursions by Russian warplanes were later reported over Estonian and Lithuanian territory. The incidents prompted calls for a more forceful response, including downing Russian aircraft and drones if necessary. Serhii Vlasenko, 35, has served in Ukraine's Emergency Service for 15 years and was on duty as a shift supervisor when the attack occurred. Pokrovsk, a city that held back some of Russia's fiercest assaults for over a year, is now on the verge of falling. The statement follows reports that President Volodymyr Zelensky's former business partner Timur Mindich had been tipped off about possible searches and left the country beforehand. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius also announced that Berlin has agreed to allocate an additional 150 million euros ($175 million) in military aid to Kyiv under the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) initiative. Ukrainian drones struck the Russian port city of Novorossiysk on Nov. 14, damaging an oil terminal and sparking a large fire, multiple Russian Telegram channels reported. "We do not accept this obviously unlawful solution contrary to European values," Orban said on a weekly radio show. "We are turning to the European Court of Justice." Russia has actively recruited, hoodwinked and kidnapped workers for its war machine from across the developing world. Independent journalism is never easy, and it's even harder in wartime.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The second round of infrastructure plans includes long-term bets on energy and critical minerals considered vital to future trade and industrial needs Prime Minister Mark Carney has unveiled the second round of projects to be considered for fast-track approval because of their perceived national importance. All the projects announced Thursday are related to energy and critical minerals mining, resources that are considered vital to future trade and industrial needs. But not all the projects are going swimmingly. One is entangled in opposition from neighbouring First Nations. At least one has faced a long delay. And some just need a lot of money. The office was set up to speed along infrastructure and resource development proposals, as part of Mr. Carney's efforts to deliver on his campaign promise to reduce Canada's economic reliance on the United States amid President Donald Trump's trade war. The Nisga'a Nation-backed Ksi Lisims LNG project is a planned export terminal that would enable liquefied natural gas to be sent from northwest British Columbia. But the project has faced opposition from nearby Indigenous groups and climate activists. Construction costs alone for Ksi Lisims are expected to reach $10-billion, plus another $12-billion for the Prince Rupert Gas Transmission (PRGT) pipeline project, which would transport natural gas more than 750 kilometres from northeast B.C. to Pearse Island located on Nisga'a territory. Two floating production platforms are to be constructed in South Korea for Ksi Lisims, while various other LNG infrastructure would be built in B.C. Ksi Lisims would rely on natural gas from PRGT, which is co-owned by the Nisga'a and Houston-based Western LNG. The Nisga'a, Western LNG and a group of natural gas producers named Rockies LNG are partners in Ksi Lisims. Shell PLC-led LNG Canada started shipping natural gas in liquid form to Asia from Kitimat, B.C., in June, when it became the country's first LNG export terminal. A group of Wet'suwet'en Nation hereditary chiefs has led a campaign opposing Coastal GasLink, the first export pipeline for natural gas across northern B.C., which is supplying gas to the LNG Canada site in Kitimat. BC Hydro's North Coast Transmission Line (NCTL) project would effectively twin the existing 450-kilometre transmission route in British Columbia from the Williston substation near Prince George to the Skeena substation near Terrace. BC Hydro has said that it would normally take eight to 10 years to devise and construct a major transmission project, in collaboration with First Nations. The proposed transmission line routes have not been determined. The proposed transmission line routes have not been determined. The proposed transmission line routes have not been determined. “The North Coast Transmission Line is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to drive economic growth in B.C. 's Northwest – powering traditional industries and unlocking new ones,” B.C. Energy Minister Adrian Dix said in a statement on Thursday. The Canada Infrastructure Bank, a federal Crown corporation, said on Thursday that it has finalized a $139.5-million loan to BC Hydro to help back early activities on NCTL. The corridor would support development such as projects for critical minerals and hydroelectricity. 's next chapter,” BC Hydro president Charlotte Mitha said in a news release. Nickel project in Northern Ontario with a US$2-billion price tag With a price tag of more than US$2-billion, the project is aimed at supplying the electric vehicle and stainless steel markets with nickel as well as chromium, cobalt, platinum and palladium over its 41-year life. The development will include ore crushing and processing facilities as well as carbon-removal in the form of tailings carbonization technology that could store 1.5 million tonnes of carbon per year. The government's referral of the Crawford project to the Major Projects Office will help attract international investors and potential offtake partners to chip in for construction as well as put its remaining permits in the priority line, Canada Nickel chief executive Mark Selby told reporters on Thursday. To help stay afloat during the mine planning and permitting stages, Canada Nickel sold equity stakes in the company to Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd., South Korea's Samsung SDI, British Anglo American PLC and Taykwa Tagamou Nation. Bid to disrupt China's dominance in graphite mining Nouveau Monde Graphite Inc. is developing its Matawinie Mine 120 kilometres north of Montreal. Expected to come online in 2027 or 2028, it is slated to produce roughly 106,000 tonnes of graphite concentrate annually over its 25-year life. Natural flake graphite is used in lithium ion battery anodes, fuel cells, aerospace components and advanced coatings for defence and infrastructure. The Quebec government in 2021 issued authorization for Matawinie. NMG is now advancing financing discussions toward a final investment decision on the second phases of both the mine and the company's Bécancour Battery Material Plant, which will process graphite from Matawinie. NMG is being included on the major projects list after Ottawa signed an offtake agreement with the company for 15,000 tonnes of graphite concentrate each year. Another 15,000 tonnes will be offered to allied countries or companies. Eric Desaulniers, NMG chief executive, told media Thursday that Canada is the only G7 supplier of graphite. Dominic LeBlanc, Minister of Internal Trade, added that including NMG on the major projects list sent a “very strong signal about the potential of this project for Canada's economy and for Canadian sovereignty.” “Once the mine and the plant are operational, Canada will be able to secure a supply of a critical mineral, which is an essential component in clean energy technologies like electric vehicle batteries and energy storage systems,” he said. The company has also secured commercial offtake agreements with Panasonic Energy Co. and Traxys North America LLC, and is in negotiations with an unnamed established anode manufacturer, according to its website. New Brunswick tungsten project has been stalled for a decade The project will include on-site processing and is expected to employ approximately 200 to 300 people, with a mine lifetime of 27 years. “These are very important critical minerals that can shape the future of Canada and its allies,” said Andrew Ing, chief executive of Northcliff Resources Ltd., in an interview. Tungsten production is dominated by China, which produces 80 per cent of global supply. There are no producing tungsten mines in Canada or the U.S. In February, Beijing added the critical mineral to its export restriction list, sending prices higher and sparking questions about mineral sovereignty. The project has struggled to secure private investment, Mr. Ing said. China can flood the market to keep competition out and this deters investment. Mr. Ing is hoping Ottawa will follow this announcement with price-floor guarantees for tungsten. In October, G7 environment ministers gathered in Toronto unveiled a Canada-led critical minerals pact that will involve purchase agreements, price floors and stockpiling of critical minerals. These funds will go toward updating the original 12-year old feasibility study, which should be completed in the second quarter of 2026, Mr. Ing said. Construction is expected to begin mid-2027 and last two years. Inuit-owned hydro project aims to stabilize electricity costs The notion of building hydroelectric dams near Iqaluit, the largest community in Nunavut with a population of about 7,400, first surfaced two decades ago, but progress has been elusive. Nunavut Nukkiksautiit Corp. (NNC) aims to build a hydroelectric dam in a remote location along the Kuugaluk River, about 60 kilometres northeast of the community. With a proposed capacity between 15 and 30 megawatts, it's expected to cost around $500-million. It would be among Canada's northernmost hydroelectric dams. “This is a breakthrough for Arctic sovereignty and sustainability,” Mr. Carney asserted Thursday. “It will save $1.9-billion in diesel costs over the next 50 years, while providing affordable, reliable, emission-free power.” Sprawling and thinly populated, Nunavut lacks a territorial power grid: each community is served by its own distribution system and a diesel-powered power plant. “We've heard loud and clear from Inuit that they've been waiting a long time for renewable energy to come to Nunavut,” said Jess Puddister, NNC's manager of strategy and operations. “Inuit are really tired of having to be diesel-dependent. It's not something they ever asked for in the first place.” Ms. Puddister said that with additional funding and quicker data collection for the project, it might begin as early as 2028. Crown utility Qulliq Energy Corp. is the territory's sole electricity provider. It considered a hydro project around Iqaluit in 2005, eventually proposing a 12.5-megawatt dam at Jaynes Inlet, 60 kilometres southwest of the city. But Qulliq, which operates about two-dozen aging diesel generators, couldn't finance the project and put it on hold in 2014. NNC is now negotiating a power purchase agreement that will determine how much electricity Qulliq will agree to buy from the project, at what price and on what terms. Ms. Puddister said her company expects to provide an update on those talks by the end of this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he told President Volodymyr Zelensky that the number of young Ukrainian men coming to Germany should be reduced, AFP reported on Nov. 13. Following a phone call with the Ukrainian leader, Merz said that young Ukrainians should remain to "serve in their own country." Close to 1.3 million Ukrainian refugees have been recorded in Germany as of October 2025 after fleeing Russia's full-scale invasion. This represents the highest number among all EU countries. Military-age men have faced strict travel restrictions under martial law, instituted when Russia launched its all-out war in 2022. Germany said that young Ukrainian men began arriving in large numbers after Kyiv eased travel rules for those aged between 18 and 22 in August. As a result, the number of Ukrainian men in this age group registering in Germany went from 100 a week to almost 1,000, according to the German Interior Ministry. Around 490,000 Ukrainians of working age staying in Germany are receiving unemployment benefits, a point of criticism from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Facing political pressure, Germany's ruling coalition is preparing a bill that would reduce benefits for Ukrainians who arrived after April 1, with the aim of incentivizing them to seek employment. Based in Lviv, Martin often reports on international politics, with a focus on analyzing developments related to Ukraine and Russia. Following a phone call with Zelensky, Merz said that young Ukrainian men should remain to "serve in their own country." Ukrainian drones struck the Russian port city of Novorossiysk on Nov. 14, damaging an oil terminal and sparking a large fire, multiple Russian Telegram channels reported. Ukrainian drones struck a military base in occupied Crimea used for the storage and maintenance of Russian "Orion" drones, Robert "Madyar" Brovdi, the commander of Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces, reported on Nov. 13. Kyiv has previously managed to free civilian Ukrainian captives during exchanges with Moscow. Ihor Fursenko, one of the key members of the group allegedly laundering money from the scheme, was formally employed at Fire Point to save him from mobilization and allow him to travel outside of Ukraine, according to a snippet of dialogue released in the trial. Rubio also confirmed that the U.S. is not interfering in the expansion of a Hungarian nuclear power plant by a Russian company. Independent journalism is never easy, and it's even harder in wartime.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A strong Pacific storm is bringing soaking rain to Southern California and raising the risk of life-threatening flooding, mudslides and debris flows, especially near burn scars in the Los Angeles area. Widespread rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches were observed along the coast into Friday morning, with isolated amounts of 3 to 5 inches in the coastal mountain ranges. An initial wave of heavy rain for southern California caused flooding and a mudslide late Thursday night on portions of Highway 101 in southern Santa Barbara County, according to the National Weather Service. This round of rain is expected to ease by Friday afternoon. A second, more intense wave will move into the region Friday night into Saturday, with prolonged heavy rain possible. This second round of rain will also have the added danger of falling over already-wet ground, which struggles to absorb additional rain and will start flooding quicker than dry ground. There's also the potential for isolated severe thunderstorms embedded within the heavier rain Friday night into Saturday. Some of these storms could produce damaging wind gusts, hail and perhaps a short-lived tornado. Much of the Los Angeles area is under a flood watch through 10 p.m. Saturday. The National Weather Service warns that the storm could trigger life-threatening debris flows, knock out power and flood roads. Burn scar areas from recent wildfires in the region will be particularly vulnerable to mudslides and debris flows. Not only do wildfires destroy vegetation that would normally soak up some of the rainfall, but their extreme heat can alter the soil, creating a water-repellent layer just below the surface. Officials have warned residents near the recent Palisades, Hurst and Sunset fires' burn scars to be prepared to evacuate. “Residents, especially those in vulnerable areas, should start taking precautions immediately to prepare for the storm and protect their interests,” the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said. “This scenario would potentially create many significant impacts area-wide, including possible debris flows in the burn areas, significant ponding of roads and highways, mudslides through the canyons, fallen trees, etc.” Residents can pick up sandbags at Fire Stations throughout the City, with sand also available for free at select locations. Showers linger into Sunday, and the ground will be saturated. It won't take much rain to trigger more minor flooding or keep roads slick, especially in spots that usually drain slowly after big storms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three Chinese astronauts landed back on Earth on Friday, according to state media, more than a week later than their scheduled landing, capping an extended stay in space after a suspected debris hit left their spaceship with a cracked window. After the capsule hatch opened medical teams found that the astronauts were in good physical condition, Chinese state media outlet CCTV reported. The crew of the Shenzhou-20 spaceflight had been due to finish their mission at China's Tiangong space station last Wednesday; they'd even handed the keys to the space station to a new crew who had just arrived for their own six-month mission. But instead, their journey home was postponed “due to a suspected impact from tiny space debris” to their ship, according to state-run news agency Xinhua. During their extra week in space, the crew continued working and living alongside the newly arrived Shenzhou-21 astronauts, as the space station has enough capacity to support two crews in orbit, according to Xinhua. The Tiangong station is only one of two operating space stations, alongside the International Space Station. Since it was completed in 2022, the biannual launches of China's Shenzhou program have been a source of national pride. Recent advances have seen China break an American-held record for the longest spacewalk, with a nine-hour sortie, and it's about to open the doors of the Tiangong to foreigners for the first time, with plans to welcome an astronaut from Pakistan next year. The new crew on board the Shenzhou-21 – who are now without a spaceship to return in – include China's youngest astronaut to be sent to space, 32-year-old Wu Fei. The Shenzhou-22, due to launch sometime next year, will include one astronaut who stays more than a year for a “long-duration residency experiment,” Xinhua reported. China's rapid development in space exploration has raised alarm bells in Washington, which is racing to put an astronaut on the moon again. The Trump administration placed bans on Chinese citizens with US visas participating in NASA programs. What was meant to be a short stay on the International Space Station stretched into a more than nine-month mission for two American astronauts earlier this year after their spacecraft malfunctioned. Both countries are also competing in nascent institution-building efforts, with the US-led Artemis Accords on lunar exploration matched up against the Chinese- and Russian-led International Lunar Research Station.
