The move prioritizes “political theater over responsible governance,” a group of Democrats said in a statement.

President Donald Trump's order to rebrand the Department of Defense (DOD) as the “Department of War” this past summer will cost billions of dollars, a new report suggests.

In September, Trump issued an executive order seeking to change the department's name. Only a bill passed by Congress and signed into law by the president can make the change official, but the order requires all government agencies within the executive branch to refer to the DOD as the Department of War. 

“This name sharpens the Department's focus on our own national interest and our adversaries' focus on our willingness and availability to wage war to secure what is ours,” Trump's order states.

But the change — which has no impact on the mission, makeup, or strategies of the DOD — comes with financial consequences. 

According to six sources speaking to NBC News — including two senior Republican congressional staffers, two senior Democratic congressional staffers, and two other individuals briefed on the price tag — the name change could cost as much as $2 billion. This includes administrative costs like changing signage (both within the U.S. and around the world), letterheads, employee badges, vast amounts of rewriting coding on websites and internal software, and other items.

Officials at the DOD tried to justify the costs by parroting the language of Trump's executive order.

“The Department of War is aggressively implementing the name change directed by President Trump, and is making the name permanent,” chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said, adding that a “final cost estimate has not been determined at this time” and that the name change “is essential because it reflects the Department's core mission: winning wars.”

The U.S. has conducted hundreds of military operations over the past 100 years, including lengthy invasions and occupations in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan, as well as its current, and likely illegal, attacks on boats in the Caribbean and Pacific. But the last time the government formally declared war was during WWII — meaning that, definitionally speaking, the idea of changing the DOD's name to reflect a mission of “winning wars” is flawed. 

Several signs have already been changed, including one outside the Pentagon that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth installed himself as part of a photo op this week. But other signs have yet to be removed and replaced, NBC News reported.

Republican members of Congress have submitted legislation to make the name change official, but the administration has not formally pushed for lawmakers to prioritize it.

Democrats have decried the DOD's informal change to the Department of War as being “both wasteful and hypocritical.”

The move “appears to prioritize political theater over responsible governance, while diverting resources from core national security functions,” a group of Democratic lawmakers wrote in a letter to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in September, requesting information on cost estimates.

The name change signals that the president and his department heads are willing to spend money on pet projects while making cuts elsewhere, ostensibly justifying doing so as a means of reducing federal spending.

But those cuts have come with huge consequences, including detrimental effects on military veterans. Among the plethora of cuts that occurred under the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” earlier this year, reductions in spending within the Department of Veterans Affairs led to “severe and immediate impacts,” including the cancellation of “life-saving cancer trials,” doctors within the department said in a message to the administration at the time. 

The cuts also meant veterans would “lose access to therapies” and other important treatment options, those doctors added.

Pete Skandalakis appointed himself to take over 2020 election interference case from district attorney Fani Willis

US politics live – latest updates

The only remaining criminal case against Donald Trump has been revived after the head of Georgia's prosecutor's council appointed himself to replace Fani Willis, the Fulton county district attorney, who was removed from the election interference case in September.

Pete Skandalakis, a Republican and the executive director of the prosecuting attorneys' council of Georgia, the state body that provides legal training and is often charged to mitigate prosecutorial conflicts, wrote in a statement on Friday that he would be taking over for Willis.

A grand jury in Atlanta indicted Trump and 18 others in August 2023, using the state's anti-racketeering law to accuse them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn Trump's narrow 2020 loss to Joe Biden in Georgia. The alleged scheme included Trump's call to the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, urging him to find enough votes to beat Biden.

The case remains the only criminal prosecution of Trump remaining, but it has been on life support after Willis was disqualified by the Georgia supreme court, which ruled that her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, revealed in dramatic court filings in January 2024, created an impermissible appearance of a conflict of interest.

Four people have pleaded guilty. Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty. While president, Trump is protected from state-level prosecutions, but the other 14 remaining defendants are still subject to prosecution.

“The filing of this appointment reflects my inability to secure another conflict prosecutor to assume responsibility for this case,” Skandalakis said. “Several prosecutors were contacted and, while all were respectful and professional, each declined the appointment.”

Fulton county's courts have called on Skandalakis to resolve a conflict before in this case, after Scott McAfee, Fulton county's superior court judge, found that Willis's office had a conflict of interest with Burt Jones, who served as one of 16 “alternate” GOP electors in Georgia to cast a vote for Trump during the 2020 legal conflict over election results. Skandalakis ultimately declined to press charges in the case against Jones, who is now Georgia's lieutenant governor and a candidate for governor in 2026.

McAfee set a 14 November deadline for Skandalakis to find a new prosecutor on the Trump racketeering indictment to avoid dismissing the case entirely.

“While it would have been simple to allow Judge McAfee's deadline to lapse or to inform the court that no conflict prosecutor could be secured – thereby allowing the case to be dismissed for want of prosecution – I did not believe that to be the right course of action,” Skandalakis said. “The public has a legitimate interest in the outcome of this case. Accordingly, it is important that someone make an informed and transparent determination about how best to proceed.”

Skandalakis noted that he did not receive the complete investigative file from Fulton county prosecutors until last week. He appointed himself as prosecutor to “complete a comprehensive review and make an informed decision regarding how best to proceed”.

In addition to Trump, Mark Meadows, the president's former chief of staff, and former New York mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani remain defendants in the case. Trump pardoned Meadows and Giuliani of any federal crime related to the 2020 election, a largely symbolic gesture.

Upon receipt of Skandalakis's letter naming himself as prosecutor, McAfee immediately scheduled a pretrial status conference for 1 December, asking prosecutors to tell him whether they intend to seek a superseding indictment to continue the case.

“No human being, immigrant or not, should be subjected to these horrendous conditions,” said one of the plaintiffs.

People held at the Core Civic-run Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) jail in Kern County, California are denied medical care, access to their attorneys, and, for disabled detainees, the most basic accommodations, according to a class-action lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and others this week in the the U.S. District Court for Northern California.

The complaint says people at the California City Detention Facility are also subjected to solitary confinement and brutal attacks by staff.

“No human being, immigrant or not, should be subjected to these horrendous conditions,” Gustavo Guevara, one of seven named plaintiffs in the suit, said in a statement. “It's not right that because we're immigrants they feel they can treat us this way.”

Earlier this year, CoreCivic entered into a contract with ICE to reopen the jail, which had previously operated as a prison and closed in 2023. Currently there are more than 800 people held at the jail, although that number is expected to significantly grow.

With the capacity to hold up to 2,560 people, the lock-up is the largest immigration jail in California. CoreCivic predicts the jail will bring in approximately $130 million annually once “the activation is complete.”

The Trump administration has been a financial boon to the private prison industry. In advance of CoreCivic's third quarter earnings call, which was held on November 6, the company announced its total revenue for the quarter was $580.4 million, an increase of 18.1 percent from the prior year's quarter.

“Ongoing demand for the solutions we provide, particularly from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), contributed to a solid third quarter,” Damon T. Hininger, CoreCivic's Chief Executive Officer, said in a statement.

“We expect detainee populations to continue to grow as ICE implements its interior enforcement plan, contributing to a strong 2025,” he continued.

Their fortune is built on — and only possible because of — mass suffering.

The complaint says:

Sewage bubbles up from the shower drains, and insects crawl up and down the walls of the cells. People are locked in concrete cells the size of a parking space for hours on end, and officers threaten them with violence and solitary confinement. Food is paltry and people go hungry. Temperatures are frigid; those who cannot afford to buy sweatshirts from the exorbitantly priced commissary suffer in the cold, some wearing socks on their arms as makeshift sleeves.

“Some of the people I'm detained with don't even have soap — they take showers without soap — and they're losing weight because they don't have enough to eat,” plaintiff Sokhean Keo said in a statement.

Medical care at the jail is atrocious, according to the complaint. Yuri Alexander Roque Campos, one of the plaintiffs, has been denied his heart medications for days at a time, which has resulted in two hospitalizations. During the last hospitalization, a doctor said he could die if this were to happen again. Yet, he has not seen a cardiologist and still does not consistently receive his medication, the suit says.

Another named plaintiff, Fernando Viera Reyes, has been waiting for months for a biopsy so he can receive a formal diagnosis of prostate cancer and begin treatment, according to the complaint.

“Mr. Viera Reyes is experiencing increasingly abnormal bloodwork results and bleeding with urination,” the suit says. “Although he still has not seen a specialist, these results indicate that his cancer may have metastasized while he has been waiting for an appointment.”

Plaintiff Fernando Gomez Ruiz, who has lived in California for more than twenty years, was abducted by ICE while he was eating at a food truck outside a Home Depot.

An insulin-dependent diabetic, he's been denied regular doses of insulin while detained at the jail. He has a large ulcer on the bottom of his foot “which he is forced to cover with soiled bandages and bloody shoes.”

The suit says that Gomez Ruiz fears that without proper medical care, his foot will have to be amputated.

The plaintiffs allege that people with disabilities are denied necessary accommodations, including wheelchairs, sign language interpreters. When plaintiff Jose Ruiz Canizales, who is deaf, tries to speak with staff “they often shrug their shoulders, walk away, or laugh at him,” according to the complaint. Since he arrived at the jail in August, he has only interacted with a sign language interpreter once, and that was through a video call.

Earlier this month, California City staff confiscated custom orthopedic shoes and insoles from a man who has amputated toes, “which cause an imbalance when he walks,” according to the complaint.

“He previously fractured his remaining toes from walking with that imbalance, leading his podiatrist in the community to order these accommodations for him,” the suit says. “He spoke to both an officer and a nurse at California City to request the custom shoes and insoles as a disability accommodation, but neither provided them.”

Staff routinely brutalize detainees. In one incident, officers entered the cell of a man in solitary confinement, who was handcuffed. The suit says they hit him with riot shields, threw him to the ground, and held him down with their knees on his back.

In another incident, an officer was speaking to a person who did not speak English and did not understand the officer. When the man turned to walk away, the officer pepper sprayed him, according to the suit.

In September, detainees organized a hunger strike and sit-ins to protest their conditions, and sent the warden a list of demands:

Medical. We have medical needs and records that prove it. Give us medical care.

Cease oppressive behavior. Stop threatening us with solitary confinement for requesting these basic necessities. Stop threatening us with retaliatory transfers for asserting our rights. Stop keeping us locked in our cells for the majority of the day. Let us have contact visits with our family.

Legal resources and access. Let us access a law library. Let us make copies of documents for our cases free of charge. Give us pens. Allow us access to our mail and phone calls.

Hygiene and Health. Unclog our toilets. Give us drinkable water. Clean the prison or at least give us the proper supplies to do so. Properly handle our food, and give us nutritious food.

Property. Give us back our property, including our books and religious items that were confiscated.

Staff placed many protesters in solitary confinement, and medical staff threatened to withhold medication from hunger strikers unless they ceased their protest.

“Conditions remained bleak for people civilly detained at California City, resulting in a widespread sense of hopelessness, desperation and, in some cases, self-harm and suicidal ideation,” the suit says.

At least three people at the jail have attempted suicide, according to the complaint.

On October 9, a man hung himself in his cell. Detainees screamed for help. It allegedly took staff about ten minutes to cut him down. Those who did not immediately return to their cells after the incident were given disciplinary tickets, according to the complaint.

Keo, one of the plaintiffs, was friends with the man and saw him hanging in his cell. The suit says he remains haunted by flashbacks.

“ICE is playing with people's lives, and they treat people like they're trash, like they're nothing,” he said in a statement. “This is bigger than me, but filing this lawsuit feels like something I can do to call for help for myself and everyone else here.”

The first thing that hits you at the World Cheese Awards is the smell.

As the 37th edition – part competition, part a celebration of cheese – kicked off in Switzerland on Thursday, some visitors might wish the offerings had more holes. With descriptions of odours including “stinky socks” and “sick dog,” it's clearly a festival – and a challenge – for the nose as much as mouths, fingers and eyes.

Welcome to sensory overload.

Connoisseurs, culinary experts and curious consumers flocked to the three-day event in a country where cheese is both food and folklore. The first day got going with the competition, which featured over 5,200 cheeses, nearly one-fifth from Switzerland. Some 46 countries took part, a record count of competitors from Australia to Austria, Bulgaria to Brazil.

All those offerings in the same Bern exhibition hall made for an original mélange of odours. But once past that medley of smells, the sights, flavours and individual scents of the cheeses were tantalizing.

 

The Associated Press

John Farrand, managing director of the Guild of Fine Food in Britain, the event organizer, says some people who tell him they “don't like cheese, it's that awful smelly thing” just need to take time and consider the myriad choices.

“I would grab them and sit down with them and take them on that journey through cheese,” he said. “I get so many people say to me just impulsively ‘I don't like blue cheese' and that's impossible really. There's so much of a range of blue cheese from over here to over here,” – Farrand gesticulated around the hall – “there's always a blue cheese for somebody.”

He rhapsodized about a 120-kg wheel of cheese that teams rolled in and “broke” – or cut open – unleashing a powerful cloud of odour.

“The aroma of this Emmentaler just hit me,” Farrand said. “That's the first time that that cheese has released its greatness and the aroma ... just makes you hungry.”

Some may turn up their noses at bacteria-blued “bleu” cheeses or reject the strong odours of varieties like Limberger, Taleggio, “Stinking Bishop” and Époisses de Bourgogne – a Burgundy specialty reputed to be Napoleon's favourite, and one so stinky that urban legend claims it's banned from public transport in France.

Others might not get over the hump of hesitation to taste a camel (or buffalo or donkey) cheese, or cringe at unpasteurized or squishy cheeses. More adventurous tasters will try the most gooey or mouldy cheeses, looking for the most rich, creamy or meaty varieties on hand.

For the judges, no such compunction: It's more about scrutiny, savouring, criticism and curiosity.

Scores of judges in yellow aprons circled the rows of long, numbered rectangular tables before digging in. They sliced wedges out of hard cheeses and pressed them to their noses, or used spreaders to scoop up soft cheeses, inspecting the consistency and licking or dribbling them onto their tongues.

The judging zone was set off by a waist-high fence and ropes, and security guards kept watch. Journalists were allowed into the area only under escort, and were only allowed to view and smell the cheeses – not taste or even touch them.

It was a blind taste test for the 265-odd judges on hand: All identifying packaging or marking was removed from the cheeses. Their job was to poke, peruse, sniff, touch and taste the offerings – a tall order with so many to choose from – before making their selections for gold, silver and bronze awards based on attributes like aroma, body, texture, flavour and “mouthfeel.”

Only those honoured as “Super Gold” made the cut for the glitzy “Super Jury” selection of 14 finalist cheeses. The judges – and the public – only found out where the cheeses were from after the voting on each was completed.

Paul Thomas, a cheesemaker from Urstrom Kaese, south of Berlin, sliced into a blue cheese covered with cherries and billed as having hints of a Manhattan cocktail. After tasting it, he said he was “pleasantly surprised throughout most of that flavour journey.”

“But right at the end it leaves me with something just ... it's a slightly off flavour toward the back of the tongue,” he added.

Experts admit that choosing a winner is tricky. While the final products from the “caseiculture” – the curdling, coagulating, cheddaring and other processes involved in making cheeses – can be judged on aspects like craftsmanship and quality, taste is an individual thing.

This year's winner was Swiss: A “spezial” Gruyere from the Vorderfultigen Mountain Dairy about 20 kilometres south of Bern, which scored 85 points from the jury. The raw cow's milk cheese was drained overnight and dry salted before being matured for more than 18 months.

A creamy, flower-sprinkled “Crémeux des Aldudes aux fleurs” from the village of Etxaldia in French Basque country was runner-up, trailed by a 9-month-aged Swiss Appenzeller Edel-Würzig. Other finalists were from Britain, Japan, the Netherlands, Slovakia and the United States.

Many cheeses come away with other accolades: More than 20 were selected as national or regional “bests” – such as best American, Basque-country, Japanese or Ukrainian cheese. Other trophies were given out by category such as the best cheddar, raw-milk, goat or ewe, or smoked cheeses.

While the U.S. state of Wisconsin hosts the World Championship Cheese Contest and a competition in France selects the world's best cheesemonger, organizers of the World Cheese Awards say it's the largest cheese-only event anywhere. The competition started in Britain, but Italy, Spain and Norway have also hosted.

Charlie Turnbull, director of the Academy of Cheese, poked his nose toward a round, soft brownish-orange cheese with a pungent smell caused by the Brevibacterium linens – “a close relative to the kind of bacteria you get in boys' trainers when they're about 15 years old.”

“It's challenging,” Turnbull said with a slight wince. But he added that once one got past the smell, the cheese tasted wonderful, noting “hints of fruit, lots of meaty notes, some ham stock.”

“At the end of the day, taste trumps everything,” he said.

The child sex offender and the former US treasury secretary shared personal views about politics and relationships

US politics live – latest updates

A series of exchanges between child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Larry Summers, the former US treasury secretary, showing a relationship as confidants emerged among the emails released by Republican legislators this week in the continuing political turmoil over Epstein's connections to Donald Trump.

The exchanges, from 2013 to early 2019, showed the two men sharing personal – and sometimes unseemly – views about politics and relationships.

“I'm trying to figure why [the] American elite think if u murder your baby by beating and abandonment it must be irrelevant to your admission to Harvard,” Summers wrote to Epstein in a 2017 email. “But hit on a few women 10 years ago and can't work at a network or think tank. DO NOT REPEAT THIS INSIGHT.”

At the time, Harvard University was wrestling with an admissions debate after a formerly incarcerated woman's admission to a PhD program. Summers, a former president of the university who lost his position in a scandal after making sexist comments about female academics, went on to say in the email to Epstein: “I observed that half of the IQ In [the] world was possessed by women without mentioning they are more than 51 percent of population.”

Summers was once a leading light in Democratic circles – a former treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, one of the primary engineers of Barack Obama's response to the financial crisis and a stalwart in the liberal commentariat. But questions have lingered about his association with Epstein, a longtime associate of Trump. Epstein was accused of running a wide-ranging child sex trafficking operation before his death in jail in 2019 in New York City.

After the Wall Street Journal revealed a previous tranche of emails between Epstein and Summers in a 2023 piece, a spokesperson for Summers told the paper that he “deeply regrets being in contact with Epstein after his conviction”.

Summers's spokesperson has not yet responded to a request for comment from the Guardian.

Democratic lawmakers released emails from the Epstein estate this week that suggest Epstein believed Trump was aware of conduct by the now-convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. In response, Republican lawmakers released a much bigger tranche of 20,000 emails from the Epstein estate.

The documents show that Summers maintained congenial contact with the convicted child sex trafficker well into 2019, with the last email exchange occurring only months before Epstein's arrest.

Trump wrote on Truth Social on Friday that he would be asking the Department of Justice and the FBI to investigate Epstein's “involvement and relationship” with Summers, among other prominent Democrats and business leaders.

In the emails, Summers and Epstein discuss politics – particularly Summers's contempt for Trump – as well as the details of philanthropic social networking – and women. Summers, 70, confided in Epstein in a 2019 exchange about his romantic gestures toward an unnamed woman, and being rebuffed.

“shes smart. making you pay for past errors,” Epstein wrote in an exchange on 16 March. “ignore the daddy im going to go out with the motorcycle guy, you reacted well.. annoyed shows caring., no whining showed strentgh.”

Summers reiterated his regret to the Harvard Crimson on Wednesday. “I have great regrets in my life,” he wrote. “As I have said before, my association with Jeffrey Epstein was a major error of judgement.”

Summers was president of Harvard University from 2001 to 2006. Epstein donated more than $9m to Harvard and its affiliated programs between 1998 and 2008, and was appointed a visiting fellow to conduct research. The university later concluded Epstein “lacked the academic qualifications visiting fellows typically possess and his application proposed a course of study Epstein was unqualified to pursue”.

Harvard only stopped accepting Epstein's donations after he pleaded guilty to child sex offenses in 2008.

By then Obama's star was rising. Summers would eventually win appointment as director of the White House national economic council (NEC) from January 2009 until November 2010.

After Summers left the White House, he began asking Epstein for philanthropic advice for his wife, Elisa New, a Harvard professor pursuing a poetry project, according to reporting by the Wall Street Journal. Epstein and his foundations made philanthropic donations to projects connected to Summers's wife, and the two men met a dozen times between 2013 and 2016, often for dinner.

After reporting about Epstein's donations emerged, New's charity made a donation “in excess” of that received to anti-sex-trafficking organizations, a spokesperson told journalists in 2023.

Marine Mammal Center in Morro Bay and local harbor patrol teamed up for mission to reunite pup with its mother

It was a foggy October afternoon on the central California coast when the Marine Mammal Center got a call on their public hotline: there were distressed cries coming from the frigid waters in Morro Bay.

The center's experts were able to determine that the calls – which sounded almost like a human baby screeching – were coming from a roughly two-week-old sea otter pup that had been separated from its mother.

That could be deadly for young sea otters, according to Shayla Zink, who works at the center in Morro Bay.

“That pup is really relying on everything it learns from the mother to be able to survive in the ocean,” Zink said, adding that a mother sea otter cares for her pup for up to nine months, often carrying her small baby on her chest.

The employees at the center, with the help of the Morro Bay harbor patrol, jumped into action in what would be an hours-long journey.

First, they put the baby otter, who they named Caterpillar, into a safe container where it wouldn't overheat. Then, they recorded the sound of the pup's frantic cries.

The plan was to boat around the area blasting the sound of the baby through a Bluetooth speaker to attempt to lure the mother towards the boat. They used a recording because they were worried that the pup would get tired and stop screaming, leaving them without any way to let the mom know that her pup had been found.

It wouldn't be easy, but it wasn't the first time that a sea otter pup had been reunited with its mother that way – a similar technique had been used in 2019.

The center presides over marine mammals that live across approximately 600 miles (about 966km) of California coastline, but the small crew was determined, searching for two hours and playing the screeching cry nonstop, Zink said.

“Our intern had kept hitting play every once a minute,” she said. “I think we all went home and it was still playing over and over in our brains.”

Eventually, a female otter popped her head above water and followed the boat, which is behavior that Zink said wasn't normal since otters typically only sleep, eat and groom their thick, furry coats – uninterested in humans on boats.

But this female otter was persistent, Zink said. Zink played the speaker on one side of the boat and then ran to play it on the other – and each time the otter followed her.

Eventually, once they felt certain that the otter was looking for her baby, the Zink lowered the pup into the water. Video shows the mother swimming over to her baby, who floats helplessly on its back. Eventually, the mom grabs her baby in her arms and appears to smell him, running her small hands over its dense fur.

“I definitely cried a bit,” Zink said.

The reunion has bigger significance to the region, where sea otters play a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of marshy banks and preserving biodiversity.

By the 1920s, sea otters were nearly wiped out by centuries of industrial-scale hunting for their fur pelts, decimating a global population that once stretched from Alaska to California, as well as into Russia and Japan.

Hunting bans and habitat restoration efforts helped southern sea otters recover some of their former range, but Zink said that there are still only roughly 3,000 southern sea otters located in the California region.

“It's just a really special moment to be able to reunite this threatened species with its mother, because any and every individual in this population is so, so important to keeping it going and bringing it back from that threat status,” Zink said.

Documents include emails depicting coordinated effort to influence online search results and journalists

Jeffrey Epstein and his associates worked to suppress negative press and rebuild his image in the years after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to state charges in Florida of solicitation of prostitution and of solicitation of prostitution with a minor, newly released documents reveal.

The documents, among 20,000 pages released on Wednesday by Republican members of the House oversight committee, include emails and memos that depict a coordinated effort to influence online search results and journalists, and restore Epstein's reputation.

In December 2010, Epstein, who was released from jail in July 2009, exchanged a series of emails with Al Seckel, an eccentric collector who appeared to be helping manage Epstein's online reputation. An obituary says Seckel died in France in 2015.

“The google page is not good,” Epstein complained on 11 December. “After sept when you told me you thought it would take appox twenty thousand to clean up and hopefully in time for Nov 1, then another ten thousand, and another ten thousand and your emails about how you are all about results.”

Seckel sent Epstein screenshots of the first page of Google search results for Epstein's name, assuring the financier that the “daily beast article is gone” from the list, and that “the other ones, including the powerful Huffington Post, are about to be pushed off”.

The screenshots show a HuffPost story titled “Jeffrey Epstein, Convicted Pedophile and Former Hedge Fund Titan Now a Free Man” published on 21 July 2010, as the seventh link on the list of search results.

A few days later, on the 15th, Seckel informed Epstein that “the bots did the sweep”.

“You only have one negative article left on front page of google, which is the Huffington Post article,” Seckel said. “The Huffington Post is extremely hard to move, because it is so powerful, has millions of links to it, and uploads massive new and original content it on a daily basis with posting from outside readers.”

Still, he claimed that he had been able to “push it down the page”. In the attached screenshot, the HuffPost story was now eighth on the search results.

Seckel also claimed that “toxic suggested search engine terms that popped up automatically when you typed in your name” had also been removed.

In the email, Seckel celebrated what he described as an “important victory” when it came to Epstein's Wikipedia page. “The headlines do not mention convicted sex offender or pedophile,” he said, “instead, Philanthropic work, Epstein Foundation, Promotion of Scientists.

“Your wiki entry now is pretty tame,” he claimed, adding that “bad stuff has been muted” and pushed to the bottom. “We hacked the site to replace the mug shot and caption, and now has an entirely different photo and caption,” he added. “This was a big success.”

Wikimedia, the non-profit organization that hosts Wikipedia, did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.

But Seckel warned that while the results were “up and in the direction we hoped” they were “still new, and subject to volitility, especially if new original content is not added on a minimum of a weekly basis”. He told Epstein that the work “needs to be maintained” and told the financier that payments were “now due if you want to continue”.

Epstein pushed back, responding that he was “never told never that there was a 10K fee per month” adding: “you initially said the project would take 20..then another 10. then another 10.”

Seckel replied that while his “initial estimate” was “25”, the job was “far far worse” than “originally expected” and told Epstein: “You have a dedicated group of people trying to undo and damage you, including now.”

Later in the email, Seckel wrote: “I spend literally four months of non-stop work, creativity and my own political capital to get you this so far, which not only saved you time, but countless dollars and isn't something that can be readily bought.

“We were trying to fix up your mess,” he added. “I didn't create it. Just thought it would be something to help. This was NEVER about pulling money out of you.”

In another email that month, Seckel wrote that they had “managed to knock out Daily Beast again” and they had “managed to push” the HuffPost piece near the bottom of the page of search results, and said that it could be “pushed off” but that it would “take a bit more work”.

The HuffPost story, according to the screenshot shared, was now down to the 10th on the search list.

The documents also show associates making efforts to shape media coverage. In March 2011, R Couri Hay, a New York-based publicist, who, in 2019, told Town & Country that he had spoken with Epstein three times and that Epstein had come to him for help with his image, wrote to Epstein saying that a Newsweek reporter was working on a story about him, focused on Epstein's “reemergence in New York post your previous problems”.

“If you hire me I feel confident that I can positively affect this feature on your behalf,” Hay, who told the New York Times in 2019 that he ultimately declined to work for Epstein and had misgivings about Epstein's sincerity, wrote. “That does not mean I can control it completely or that they would reference past problems. However, I can assure you that the story will be fair and balanced and that your side will be represented intelligently.”

Hay suggested arranging interviews with people who “have seen the good things that you have done in business, science, and philanthropy”.

In a message several days later, Hay wrote that the story was being “written without your input” and tells Epstein that he has been “subtly guiding” the reporter “on your behalf”. In the email, Hay added that he would like to “formalize this job with your attorneys and then I would really need to give names and numbers of pro Jeffery power brokers” for the reporter to call.

Hay did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.

A June 2011 memo from public relations firm Osborne & Partners, titled “Issues of Reputation”, is also among the documents, and appears to have been put together for Epstein and outlines a strategy to repair his image. The Guardian reported earlier this year that in 2012 Epstein had been in contact with Ian Osborne, who ran the PR firm. Osborne & Partners did not respond to a request for comment for this story.

The memo advises minimizing any mentions in the tabloid press, restoring “your profile” in select media, political and philanthropic circles, establishing “you as a pioneering support of science and technology” and suggests hosting “some kind of annual event which brings together your business and philanthropic interests”.

Under “tabloid press attention”, the memo stated: “Since it is an unambiguous objective of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday to take down Prince Andrew, it is disastrous for you to be seen in any way to facilitate his lifestyle, or to help with his well documented issues.

“Their sole interest in you and Ghislaine is as a means to attack Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson,” the firm added. “You need to studiously avoid any involvement whatsoever with the couple, which will lessen the interest and we can establish a constructive relationship on your behalf with them.”

The firm also suggested a “clean-up” of search results on “all major search engines where your name is part of a search query”, describing it as an “urgent priority”. The firm also advised engaging with “top editors and columnists”, especially “serious business and financial journalists”.

In July 2011, Epstein emailed prominent publicist Peggy Siegal urging her to reach out to Arianna Huffington to enlist HuffPost to investigate “Andrews accuser”, seemingly referencing the late Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's most prominent accusers who also alleged that she had been sexually assaulted by Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. He has consistently denied the allegations and settled Giuffre's sexual assault case in 2022.

In the email, Epstein wrote that Huffington “should champion the dangers of false allegations” and “send a reporter or reporters to investigate” Giuffre. “The palace would love it,” he added.

“The girl in the photo, was nothing more than a telephone answerer, she was never 15, according to her version she worked for trump, first at that age, at MAra lago [sic],” Epstein added.

Siegal replied that “if you rewrite your last email in better grammar (and so I have a better understanding) I can cut and paste and send it to Arianna Huffington from me”. Epstein responded with a rewrite.

In a phone call on Thursday, Siegal told the Guardian that she never forwarded Epstein's edited email to Huffington and had “no reason to call her”.

“It was preposterous for him to think that I would get involved in his idiotic nefarious affairs and jeopardize my good relationship with Arianna,” Siegal said, adding that she had a working relationship with Huffington, who published her Oscar diaries every year.

“Jeffrey was completely delusional and lived in his own fantasy of a world that revolved around him as he always thought he was the smartest person in the room,” she said. “He was a complete ego-maniac who was obsessed with his own false sense of power.”

In a statement, a spokesperson for HuffPost said: “Arianna Huffington has not been affiliated with HuffPost since 2016. To the best of our knowledge, no talk of this coverage ever made it to HuffPost.”

MOSCOW, November 14. /TASS/. Kiev is prepared to take any measures, including information provocations, to force young Ukrainians back from Europe as potential recruits, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters.

"There is intel indicating that the Kiev clique, despite officially lifting the ban on men aged 18 to 22 traveling abroad, is ready to take any measures — including staging information provocations — to force potential recruits who fled the country to return," the diplomat said. "To this end, the regime has decided to exploit the growing sentiment among Europeans in favor of not abolishing but significantly reducing the benefits and preferences granted to the Ukrainians who have flooded the continent."

"The emphasis will be placed on curtailing the Kiev regime's temporary protection programs and projects supporting Ukrainian emigrants. Western partners will advertise EU initiatives to return refugees to their homeland. They will also apply their own methods, such as provocation, denunciation, and discrediting of forced migrants. In particular, they will simulate the negative perception of Ukrainians by citizens of European Union countries," the spokeswoman said.

The diplomat stressed that one of the tasks set by the West for Vladimir Zelensky is "the elimination of the Ukrainian population."

"So what does all this mean? Zelensky is expected to kill more Ukrainian citizens. Now, everyone understands this because, apart from redistributing colossal funds and schemes with weapons, his task is also to destroy the citizens of Ukraine and this region," Zakharova added.

"As for the hatred toward Russia and everything Russian, we raise this issue constantly. <...> I would like to emphasize that it is now impossible to deny that one of the objectives set by the aggressive West, or the global minority represented by liberal Western regimes, is the destruction of the Ukrainian population. There is simply no other way to interpret or explain what is happening," the diplomat concluded.

MOSCOW, November 14. /TASS/. Russia will always remember the North Korean military's vital role in the hazardous and challenging task of clearing mines in the Kursk Region, Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday.

"We will never forget this assistance [from North Korea in mine clearance of the Kursk region]," he said at a news briefing. "This work continues, it is dangerous and difficult."

"And indeed, our Korean friends are helping us immensely, we highly appreciate it," Peskov said in response to a question about the Kremlin's assessment of the North Korean military's assistance to clear the Kursk Region of mines.

Mine-clearing operations in the Kursk Region, which was earlier freed from Ukrainian forces, are still underway. Alongside Russian specialists, combat engineers from North Korea are taking part in the difficult task of clearing the area from explosive devices.

A unit of North Korean combat engineers was formed and deployed to the region by order of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The decision followed bilateral agreements based on a comprehensive strategic partnership deal inked during his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Pyongyang in June 2024.

As he faces scrutiny amid latest Epstein email release, US president seeks to use Department of Justice to investigate opponents including Bill Clinton



The president continued to post on Truth Social today, notably saying that he will direct attorney general Pam Bondi and the FBI to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's “involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, JPMorganChase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him”.

Trump went on to claim, baselessly, that this is “another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats”.

Flight logs state that former president Bill Clinton travelled on Epstein's private jet several times. According to several emails from Epstein, released by the House oversight committee, Clinton never visited his private island. Meanwhile, Reid Hoffman – the longtime Democratic donor and venture capitalist – has said he engaged with Epstein in a fundraising capacity for the Massachussets Institute of Technology. Larry Summers, former treasury secretary under Clinton, was a friend of Epstein's and several emails between the two appear in the committee's most recent release.

In the tranche of documents published this week, Epstein said that Donald Trump “spent hours” at Epstein's home with one of his victims in an email to co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell. The president has maintained the correspondence released by House Democrats was part of the ongoing “hoax” around Epstein, and simply a deflection from their performance during the government shutdown.

Tom Homan, the president's border czar, has hit back against the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, after they issued a rare condemnation of the administration's immigration agenda.

“Secure borders save lives, and I wish the Catholic church would understand that,” Homan said, speaking to reporters outside the White House today. “So the Catholic church is wrong, I'm sorry. I'm a lifelong Catholic … I think they need to spend time fixing the Catholic church in my opinion.”

The border czar declined to comment on whether options for land strikes in Venezuela had been presented to Trump, or whether ICE agents would soon be conducting their next major operation in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Further to my last post on the announcement of a framework agreement, the White House has said in a statement that the US, Switzerland and Liechtenstein aim to conclude negotiations to finalize their trade deal by the first quarter of 2026.

Of the $200bn pledged Swiss investments in the United States, at least $67bn will come in 2026, it said, adding that the investments will target a range of sectors including pharmaceuticals, medical devices, aerospace and gold manufacturing.

Earlier we reported that US trade representative Jamieson Greer said that the US has “essentially reached a deal with Switzerland”, after the country was hit with a 39% tariff on Swiss exports to the US.

My colleague Callum Jones reports that Donald Trump has agreed to slash US tariffs on Switzerland to 15% as part of a new trade pact, lowering duties that strained economic ties and hit Swiss exporters.

The two countries have signed a “non-binding memorandum of understanding”, the Swiss government announced, following bilateral talks in Washington and intense lobbying by Swiss firms.

The Trump administration agreed to limit US tariffs on Switzerland and Liechtenstein “to a maximum of 15%” under the deal, according to a statement from the Swiss government.

This brings US tariffs on Switzerland in line with those on the European Union – allowing Swiss exporters the same treatment as rivals in neighboring countries.

In return, Switzerland will reduce tariffs “on a range of US products”, the statement said. “In addition to all industrial products, fish and seafood, this includes agricultural products from the US that Switzerland considers non-sensitive.”

Swiss officials also committed to granting a series of quotas for US goods that can be exported to Switzerland on a duty-free basis, including 500 tonnes of beef, 1,000 tonnes of bison meat and 1,500 tonnes of poultry.

“The date for implementing these market access concessions will be coordinated with the US to ensure that customs duties are reduced at the same time,” the statement said.

A series of exchanges between child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Larry Summers, the former US treasury secretary, showing a relationship as confidantes emerged among the emails released by Republican legislators this week.

The exchanges, from 2013 to early 2019, showed the two men sharing personal – and sometimes unseemly – views about politics and relationships.

“I'm trying to figure why [the] American elite think if u murder your baby by beating and abandonment it must be irrelevant to your admission to Harvard,” Summers wrote to Epstein in a 2017 email. “But hit on a few women 10 years ago and can't work at a network or think tank. DO NOT REPEAT THIS INSIGHT.”

At the time, Harvard was wrestling with an admissions debate after a formerly incarcerated woman's admission to a PhD program. Summers, a former president of the university who lost his position in a scandal after making sexist comments about female academics, went on to say in the email to Epstein: “I observed that half of the IQ In [the] world was possessed by women without mentioning they are more than 51 percent of population.”

After the Wall Street Journal revealed a previous tranche of emails between Epstein and Summers in a 2023 piece, a spokesperson for Summers told the paper that he “deeply regrets being in contact with Epstein after his conviction”.

In the massive trove of 20,000 emails from the Epstein estate released by Republican lawmakers this week are documents that show that Summers maintained congenial contact with the convicted child sex trafficker well into 2019, with the last email exchange occurring only months before Epstein's arrest.

Trump wrote on Truth Social today that he would be asking the DOJ and the FBI to investigate Epstein's “involvement and relationship” with Summers, among other prominent Democrats and business leaders.

In the emails, Summers and Epstein discuss politics – particularly Summers' contempt for Trump – as well as the details of philanthropic social networking – and women. Summers, 70, confided in Epstein in a 2019 exchange about his romantic gestures toward an unnamed woman, and being rebuffed.

“shes smart. making you pay for past errors,” Epstein wrote in an exchange on 16 March. “ignore the daddy im going to go out with the motorcycle guy, you reacted well.. annoyed shows caring., no whining showed strentgh.”

Summers reiterated his regret to the Harvard Crimson on Wednesday. “I have great regrets in my life,” he wrote. “As I have said before, my association with Jeffrey Epstein was a major error of judgement.”

The only remaining criminal case against Donald Trump has been revived after the head of Georgia's prosecutor's council appointed himself to replace Fani Willis, the Fulton county district attorney, who was removed from the election interference case in September.

Pete Skandalakis, a Republican and the executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia, the state body that provides legal training and is often charged to mitigate prosecutorial conflicts, wrote in a statement on Friday that he would be taking over for Willis.

A grand jury in Atlanta indicted Trump and 18 others in August 2023, using the state's anti-racketeering law to accuse them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn Trump's narrow 2020 loss to Joe Biden in Georgia. The alleged scheme included Trump's call to the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, urging him to help find enough votes to beat Biden.

The case remains the only criminal prosecution of Trump remaining, but it has been on life support after Willis was disqualified by the Georgia supreme court, which ruled that her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, revealed in dramatic court filings in January 2024, created an impermissible appearance of a conflict of interest.

Four people have pleaded guilty. Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty. While president, Trump is protected from state-level prosecutions, but the other 14 remaining defendants are still subject to prosecution.

“The filing of this appointment reflects my inability to secure another conflict prosecutor to assume responsibility for this case,” Skandalakis said. “Several prosecutors were contacted and, while all were respectful and professional, each declined the appointment.”

Trump's move, to focus on his rivals' affiliations and relationships with Epstein, is seemingly his latest effort to distance himself from the renewed focus on his own relationship with the disgraced financier, who died by suicide in federal prison in 2019, and the extent to which he was aware of his conduct.

The president continued to post on Truth Social today, notably saying that he will direct attorney general Pam Bondi and the FBI to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's “involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, JPMorganChase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him”.

Trump went on to claim, baselessly, that this is “another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats”.

Flight logs state that former president Bill Clinton travelled on Epstein's private jet several times. According to several emails from Epstein, released by the House oversight committee, Clinton never visited his private island. Meanwhile, Reid Hoffman – the longtime Democratic donor and venture capitalist – has said he engaged with Epstein in a fundraising capacity for the Massachussets Institute of Technology. Larry Summers, former treasury secretary under Clinton, was a friend of Epstein's and several emails between the two appear in the committee's most recent release.

In the tranche of documents published this week, Epstein said that Donald Trump “spent hours” at Epstein's home with one of his victims in an email to co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell. The president has maintained the correspondence released by House Democrats was part of the ongoing “hoax” around Epstein, and simply a deflection from their performance during the government shutdown.

Several Republican senators have expressed disapproval about a provision tucked into the stopgap spending bill passed this week, which would allow lawmakers to sue the federal government because their phone records were subpoenaed in 2023 by the special counsel investigating Donald Trump's effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

“There needs to be accountability for the Biden DOJ's outrageous abuse of the separation of powers, but the right way to do that is through public hearings, tough oversight, including of the complicit telecomm companies, and prosecution where warranted,” said senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, one of the eight lawmakers whose phone data the FBI sought and obtained.

For his part, House speaker Mike Johnson has pledged to repeal the provision next week, and many House Republicans are incensed about the language in the bill.

“Interesting seeing my colleagues express outrage over this provision yet still vote for it when they could have been strong and not let the Senate jam the House,” said GOP member Greg Steube, who represents the Florida suncoast. “There was no reason this needed to be in the bill to reopen the government. The Senate used a crisis to pass an unethical provision and now the House is complicit.”

Donald Trump has claimed on social media that Democratic lawmakers are doing “everything in their withering power to push the Epstein Hoax again”. This comes after emails released this week by the House oversight committee seem to suggest that the president may have known about Jeffrey Epstein's conduct.

In his post on Truth Social a short while ago, Trump added that the latest batch of documents are being used to “deflect” from Democrats' “bad policies and losses, specially the SHUTDOWN EMBARRASSMENT, where there party is in total disarray and has no idea what to do”.

The president has yet to address the emails, or the wider record release, which included more than 20,000 pages. On Thursday, he took no questions from reporters at an executive order signing in the East Room. He has, however, been resolute about his stance online. White House officials have recapitulated his claims that the new information is merely a distraction.

“Some Weak Republicans have fallen into their clutches because they are soft and foolish,” Trump wrote on Friday. “Epstein was a Democrat, and he is the Democrat's problem, not the Republican's problem! Ask Bill Clinton, Reid Hoffman, and Larry Summers about Epstein, they know all about him, don't waste your time with Trump. I have a Country to run!”

Americans should “raise hell” to protect US national parks through the “nightmare” of Donald Trump's presidency, according to a former National Park Service director, amid alarm over the impact of the federal government shutdown.

Jonathan Jarvis claimed the agency is now in the hands of a “bunch of ideologues” who would have no issue watching it “go down in flames” – and see parks from Yellowstone to Yosemite as potential “cash cows”, ripe for privatization.

Jarvis, who led the NPS from 2009 to 2017, faced intense scrutiny, a five-hour grilling in Congress and calls for his resignation after closing all 401 national park sites during a previous shutdown, in October 2013.

He was certain, despite the backlash, that it was the right thing to do: keeping them open with a skeleton staff would have put parks and their visitors at risk, his team concluded.

Over the past month, hundreds of NPS veterans including Jarvis, 72, have watched aghast as most of the agency's workers were furloughed during the longest shutdown in US history – while the Trump administration kept all national parks open.

There have been consequences.

A fire at Joshua Tree national park burned through about 72 acres. Yosemite faced a wave of illegal Base jumping. Yellowstone grappled with bear jams.

Vandalism included graffiti in Arches national park. A stone wall at Gettysburg national military park was damaged. Trash started to gather at various sites.

Thousands of NPS workers are typically around to guide visitors safely through parks, point them in the right direction, swiftly rescue them from danger, keep traffic moving, monitor wildlife and protect the landscape.

“You take all of that away – all of those employees – you basically are, on one hand, creating unsafe conditions for the visitor,” Jarvis said, adding: “And you're putting basically these irreplaceable resources at risk.”

On Wednesday morning, hours before the House voted to reopen the federal government after the longest shutdown in US history, senior White House officials and members of Donald Trump's cabinet filtered into the Situation Room.

The secure, wood panelled room on the West Wing's ground floor is usually reserved for top secret meetings about military operations and national security issues, but that morning there was another burning issue on the agenda: Jeffrey Epstein.

The extraordinary summit gathered top officials including Kash Patel, the FBI director, and Pam Bondi, the attorney general, to meet with Colorado Representative Lauren Boebert in an effort to convince her to remove her signature from a petition to force a vote on releasing the Epstein files.

Ms Boebert, 38, was one of four Republicans to sign the petition, which would finally secure the required 218th signature later that day when Democrat Adelita Grijalva was sworn in.

The top level meeting came hours after the Democrats released three of Epstein's email exchanges which raised questions over how much Mr Trump knew about his former friend's conduct.

On Tuesday, Mr Trump himself had reportedly called Ms Boebert as part of an intense pressure campaign to push her to tow the party line. He had also tried to call Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican who also signed the petition.

The calls and meeting are understood to have come after a months-long effort to urge Ms Boebert to reverse course.

White House officials had asked Ms Boebert what it would take for her to remove her signature and issued vague threats about how breaking with Mr Trump could impact her popularity, according to the New York Times.

The campaign failed and reportedly only strengthened Ms Boebert's conviction.

But the remarkable intervention from Mr Trump and his top team reveals the lengths the Republican leader is willing to go to try and kill the Epstein issue which has plagued his second term.

“It's somewhat astonishing to have the White House and even the president try to pressure members of Congress and put the full force of the presidency behind this only to fail,” said Matthew Barlett, a Republican strategist and former Trump appointee to the State Department in the first administration.

“It just exposes a true weakness, possibly a lack of full understanding that the White House has around the Epstein matters, that their own efforts or denials are damaging to only themselves right now.”

“The White House's frantic scramble to peel Representatives Boebert and Mace off the Epstein discharge petition exposed the fragility of Trump's grip on his own flank,” Rina Shah, the Republican strategist, told The Telegraph.

“It was less so a masterstroke of party discipline than it was an actual firewall against bipartisan sunlight that could scorch reputations across the aisle. This desperate move from the White House is a reminder that, in Washington, transparency is the one weapon both sides fear most.”

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, heralded the meeting as an example of “transparency” and of how administration officials “are willing to sit down with members of Congress and address their concerns”.

The discharge petition now has enough signatures to force a vote on the House floor, which House Speaker Mike Johnson has suggested could be held next week.

It is expected to pass with support from dozens and possibly 100 Republicans, sources told Politico. There are still significant, and somewhat insurmountable, hurdles to jump through before the files are released: it must pass through the Senate and would require Mr Trump to sign it off himself.

But if swathes of Republicans vote for transparency it will symbolise the strength of feeling for these files to be released, flames Mr Trump fanned himself before he became president.

Following the top level meeting Ms Boebert thanked White House officials on social media for the meeting, writing: “Together, we remain committed to ensuring transparency for the American people.”

But her refusal to bow to pressure from Mr Trump shows how split the US president is from some of his core supporters on this issue.

Ms Boebert is a political firebrand who was previously called a “Maga warrior” and has always been fiercely loyal to the Republican president. With her perfectly styled dark hair and penchant for cowboy boots bearing the stars and stripes, the mother-of-four epitomised the Maga movement.

She came under fire this Halloween after she dressed up as a Mexican woman and her boyfriend Kyle Perry wore an ICE agent costume.

Ms Boebert, who wore a sombrero, reportedly held a sign which said “Mexican Word of the Day: Juicy. Tell me if juicy ICE coming”, which appeared to mock the pronunciation of “you see”.

Ms Mace, another Maga loyalist, put out a statement explaining her own experience of sexual abuse and rape and how the Epstein petition “is deeply personal” but doubled down on her loyalty to Mr Trump saying she will “defend every last attack” on Mr Trump “to the death”.

Signing the petition is somewhat of a risky move for Ms Mace, who is running to become South Carolina governor next year.

Mr Trump has been plagued by the Epstein issue ever since his administration reversed course and said it would not release the documents the government holds on its investigation into the paedophile.

On social media Mr Trump has branded the Epstein issue a “hoax” and blamed the Democrats and has called his own supporters “stupid” for refusing to move on from it.

He even sent Todd Blanche, his deputy attorney general, to interview convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell about Epstein in an effort to exonerate himself.

“For Trump, this Epstein petition fiasco is a self-inflicted tripwire: his frantic Situation Room summons and phone-tag diplomacy with Boebert and Mace spotlight old associations and they erode the ironclad loyalty he's known to demand,” Ms Shah said.

“Ultimately, it's Trump himself who is fully responsible for turning a bipartisan transparency push into a loyalty litmus test that risks alienating the very hardliners who could define his post-presidency influence.”

MOSCOW, November 14. /TASS/. A corruption scandal in Ukraine may spiral into a political crisis as US bombers with nuclear missiles are seen performing flights near the Russian border. Meanwhile, Russia warns risks of another war in Lebanon. These stories topped Friday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

The G7 has actually supported a probe by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office into the inner circle of Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky as a major corruption scandal coincided with problems facing the EU in providing more funding to Kiev.

"We made it clear to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrey Sibiga that Ukraine must take decisive action against corruption in order to maintain strong Western support," Germany's top diplomat Johann Wadephul told reporters, commenting on the results of the G7 Foreign Ministers' meeting with Sibiga in Canada on Wednesday.

The corruption scandal, among other things, was discussed in a phone conversation between German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Zelensky on November 13. Germany will support the initiative to expose the misuse of funds by the Ukrainian leadership as Berlin is Ukraine's second-largest sponsor after Washington, concurs Artyom Sokolov, a senior researcher at the European Studies Institute of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. Besides, the expert continues, the European community has grown weary of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, especially in light of the Ukrainian retreat on the front lines, thus, Germany may take a more meticulous attitude to Kiev. However, it is too early to talk about any termination of European funding for Ukraine, the political analyst noted.

European countries are unlikely to stop financing Ukraine, as the Ukrainian army relies heavily on this aid for its combat capabilities, Alexander Kamkin, associate professor at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, told Vedomosti. However, the expert argued, the corruption scandal may prompt the EU to monitor financial aid flows more closely. And military assistance to Kiev is not going anywhere, as Germany plans to spend $3 billion for this purpose next year, the expert said.

Now, Ukrainian politicians are under pressure from anti-corruption agencies, but the West has so far refrained from attacking Zelensky personally, head of the Ukraine division at the Institute of CIS Countries Ivan Skorikov told Vedomosti. "In theory, Zelensky may turn on his associates under pressure, like he did to businessman Igor Kolomoisky. As the stakes get higher, it could be useful for him to get done with his inner circle," the expert concluded.

 

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has reaffirmed Washington's readiness to start testing nuclear weapons and their carriers. The United States' top diplomat explained this was needed "to make sure these things work, and they are safe." And such tests seem to have already started.

Images of a B-52H Stratofortress bomber equipped with a prototype of the latest American cruise missile AGM-181A Long-Range Standoff (LRSO), performing flights on November 4 and 8, have leaked to the media. The photos were taken near a US air base in California. Experts say the images of missiles may indicate a start to testing nuclear weapon carriers in the United States. Earlier, President Donald Trump announced plans to resume testing of US nuclear capabilities, even as no official statements have been made yet.

Reports that three B-52H Stratofortress strategic bombers, according to data from NATO, recently arrived in Europe for Bomber Task Force Europe 26-1 and patrolled the airspace over Estonia, the Baltic Sea and Finland on November 12 look very alarming against this backdrop. While it is unclear if they carry the newest LRSO missiles, the very flight close to Russia's border itself represents a potential threat.

"Maneuvers currently taking place in Europe, involving Bomber Task Force Europe 26-1, can be viewed as a follow-up to the US nuclear exercise Global Thunder. For all B-52H Stratofortress bombers are considered nuclear weapon carriers," military expert and retired Lieutenant General Yury Netkachev said in an interview with Nezavisimaya Gazeta.

Netkachev noted that simultaneously with NATO's Bomber Task Force Europe 26-1 Finland is hosting a ground exercise with more than 15,000 troops taking part. British and Swedish militaries, too, are participating in the maneuvers. The goals include solving tasks on the ground and practicing cooperation and methods of air defense warfare with allies, Western media reported.

 

An explosive situation has been reported in southern Lebanon, Russian Ambassador to Beirut Alexander Rudakov told Izvestia, and Russia sees the likelihood of large-scale battles erupting there anew. Despite the ceasefire, Israel has been violating Lebanon's airspace almost every day, delivering strikes inside Lebanese territory, the diplomat noted. Hezbollah is ready to surrender weapons to the state, but not under fire, Rudakov said.

Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told Izvestia that the Shiite movement has been rebuilding its military infrastructure as it smuggles weapons and builds production facilities to manufacture weapons in Lebanon.

In the past few weeks, the IDF has broadened the scope of strikes, including operations in southern Lebanon and the Beqaa Valley. Lebanon has estimated that 309 people were killed, and 598 others sustained injuries in attacks in less than a year, with more than 5,000 ceasefire violations registered.

According to Jamal Wakim, a professor at the Lebanese University, Israel has been stepping up pressure on Lebanon in order to force it into direct talks with the Jewish state, a goal being pursued by Washington.

While Hezbollah retains a substantial deterrence potential, the likelihood of a major war remains, the expert told Izvestia.

 

Around 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion barrels of oil is currently concentrated in oil tankers in the oceans, with many of those standing still and not going to any ports of destination. And a large portion of oil barrels accumulated in these tankers belongs to economies sanctioned by the United States, namely Russia, Iran and Venezuela, Bloomberg reported, citing data from Vortexa, Kpler and OilX.

This amount of oil has accumulated in global seas and oceans since late August. Naturally, this concentration is primarily associated with the latest US sanctions on Russian oil majors and tougher restrictions against Iran and Venezuela.

According to Maxim Malkov, head of Oil and Gas Services at Kept, the situation is quite extraordinary and things looked the same in 2020 amid the pandemic when global oil demand declined heavily. If the data from Bloomberg is correct, an additional supply overhang is being formed on the market that can put pressure on prices. However, if the amount is not precise or exaggerated, this looks like an attempt at informational intervention to manipulate market expectations.

If the data is correct indeed, Daniil Tyun, who heads the department of client services at AMCH, argues, sanctions and excessive supply are to blame here: many ports and companies refuse to take Russian and Iranian oil as they fear to breach the restrictions. And the loss of major buyers would force Russian exporters to sell their crude to smaller traders or the "shadow fleet" or even keep oil at sea while waiting for buyers.

The situation is unlikely to persist for long, as alternative supply routes to bypass sanctions will likely be established, along with new supply and settlement chains. The downside for Russia is that no rise in oil prices appears imminent. Oleg Abelev, Head of the Analytical Department at Rikom-Trust, told Rossiyskaya Gazeta that oil benchmarks will be under pressure in the coming months.

 

Since the start of this year, the market share of Russian wines has increased from 58% to 63%, while wine imports have declined by one-third, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Patrushev revealed. The assortment of wines, too, has expanded, and in 2025, the vineyard area exceeded 110,000 hectares, a 14% increase from 2020. "This is one of the highest growth rates globally," Patrushev said. And one-third of Russian vineyards are quite young, meaning the growth potential is significant.

The government views enotourism as a growth driver. The State Duma has already adopted a first reading of a bill allowing businessmen to build wine tourism facilities on lands that are suitable for cultivating vineyards. And the minimal vineyard area for such projects will be 5 hectares, Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee for Economic Policy Sergey Altukhov noted.

In parallel to this, the international agenda is unfolding. The initiatives include holding a BRICS wine summit and establishing a wine export center that will enable Russian winemakers to take part in international fairs collectively. "Our common ambitious goal is to make Russian wine, like Italian, French or Spanish wines, not only a beverage but a true point of national pride and a strong international brand," Rosselkhozbank Board Chairman Boris Listov believes.

The perception of Russian wine has already strengthened. Alexander Oslon, President of the Public Opinion Foundation, cited a recent survey showing that 70% of Russians believe domestic wines can compete with imported brands. "So far, wine has been the most dynamic segment of the alcohol market, and the culture of wine consumption continues to improve," he said.

An unidentified drone was sighted over a gunpowder plant in southwestern France on Nov. 12, following similar incidents just two days earlier, French news channel BFM TV reported, citing prosecutors.

The incident is the latest in a string of suspicious drone sightings across European airports, defense factories, and other strategic civilian and military sites in recent months.

The factory, located in the Bergerac commune and capable of producing 1,200 tons of artillery gunpowder annually, is owned by Eurenco, one of Europe's leading ammunition and explosives companies.

Two illegal drone overflights were previously recorded over the plant on the evening of Nov. 10, BFM TV reported.

Despite searches, the drone operators have not been identified. Local authorities have launched an investigation into the incidents.

General Marc Le Bouil, the French commander of air defense and air operations, told lawmakers on Nov. 12 that the drone appeared to be a commercially available model made by the Chinese firm DJI.

Recent drone sightings have caused disruptions in several European countries, including Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands. As investigations continue, local authorities have not ruled out that Russia may be behind the incursions.

In recent weeks, unidentified drones have been spotted in Belgium over a nuclear power plant, Brussels Airport, and the Kleine Brogel Air Base. The country's military has issued orders to open fire against drones in case of further incursions.

The unexplained drone sightings were preceded by Russian aircraft and drones violating NATO airspace on several occasions.

Polish forces shot down several Russian drones that entered their airspace during an attack on Ukraine in early September. Incursions by Russian warplanes were later reported over Estonian and Lithuanian territory.

The incidents prompted calls for a more forceful response, including downing Russian aircraft and drones if necessary.

Serhii Vlasenko, 35, has served in Ukraine's Emergency Service for 15 years and was on duty as a shift supervisor when the attack occurred.

If carried out, the deportation would mark the highest number of Ukrainians removed from the U.S. in recent years, the Washington Post reported.



 Pokrovsk, a city that held back some of Russia's fiercest assaults for over a year, is now on the verge of falling. The Kyiv Independent's Francis Farrell explains how the battle reached this point and what Pokrovsk's fall could mean for the wider defense of Donetsk Oblast. 

Alvarez & Marsal has been tapped as the investment advisor for the U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal, officials announced on Nov. 14, the latest step in a widely-watched agreement to invest in Ukraine's critical resource sectors.

An Iskander-type missile fell on the embassy's territory, causing an explosion that damaged its facilities and service vehicles, Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry said. 





The statement follows reports that President Volodymyr Zelensky's former business partner Timur Mindich had been tipped off about possible searches and left the country beforehand.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius also announced that Berlin has agreed to allocate an additional 150 million euros ($175 million) in military aid to Kyiv under the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) initiative.

At least 11 apartment buildings throughout the city were struck in the overnight attack, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.

Ukrainian drones struck the Russian port city of Novorossiysk on Nov. 14, damaging an oil terminal and sparking a large fire, multiple Russian Telegram channels reported.

"We do not accept this obviously unlawful solution contrary to European values," Orban said on a weekly radio show. "We are turning to the European Court of Justice."

The two leaders will discuss bilateral cooperation in the "energy, economic, and defense fields," as well as progress in preparing security guarantees for Ukraine under the "Coalition of the Willing" framework.

Russia has actively recruited, hoodwinked and kidnapped workers for its war machine from across the developing world.

The second round of infrastructure plans includes long-term bets on energy and critical minerals considered vital to future trade and industrial needs

Prime Minister Mark Carney has unveiled the second round of projects to be considered for fast-track approval because of their perceived national importance. All the projects announced Thursday are related to energy and critical minerals mining, resources that are considered vital to future trade and industrial needs.

But not all the projects are going swimmingly. One is entangled in opposition from neighbouring First Nations. At least one has faced a long delay. And some just need a lot of money.

Here are roundups of the strengths and weaknesses of the projects that made the second round and are being referred to the Calgary-based Major Projects Office. The office was set up to speed along infrastructure and resource development proposals, as part of Mr. Carney's efforts to deliver on his campaign promise to reduce Canada's economic reliance on the United States amid President Donald Trump's trade war.

LNG project faces Indigenous opposition 

The Nisga'a Nation-backed Ksi Lisims LNG project is a planned export terminal that would enable liquefied natural gas to be sent from northwest British Columbia. But the project has faced opposition from nearby Indigenous groups and climate activists.

Construction costs alone for Ksi Lisims are expected to reach $10-billion, plus another $12-billion for the Prince Rupert Gas Transmission (PRGT) pipeline project, which would transport natural gas more than 750 kilometres from northeast B.C. to Pearse Island located on Nisga'a territory. Two floating production platforms are to be constructed in South Korea for Ksi Lisims, while various other LNG infrastructure would be built in B.C.

Ksi Lisims would rely on natural gas from PRGT, which is co-owned by the Nisga'a and Houston-based Western LNG.

The Nisga'a, Western LNG and a group of natural gas producers named Rockies LNG are partners in Ksi Lisims.

Shell PLC-led LNG Canada started shipping natural gas in liquid form to Asia from Kitimat, B.C., in June, when it became the country's first LNG export terminal.

Ksi Lisims is facing two separate legal challenges in Federal Court, with one launched by the Lax Kw'alaams Band and the other by the Metlakatla First Nation from the Prince Rupert area.

Other Indigenous representatives in northwest B.C. who oppose LNG include Gitanyow hereditary chiefs.

The dispute risks escalating into a repeat of the conflict over the Coastal GasLink pipeline.

A group of Wet'suwet'en Nation hereditary chiefs has led a campaign opposing Coastal GasLink, the first export pipeline for natural gas across northern B.C., which is supplying gas to the LNG Canada site in Kitimat.

John Ridsdale, a climate activist whose Wet'suwet'en hereditary chief name is Na'Moks, is among the Indigenous leaders who opposed Coastal GasLink and is now also criticizing Ksi Lisims and PRGT.

Northern B.C. transmission line still requires financing

A worker walks in the BC Hydro Skeena Substation while under construction in Terrace, B.C., on Thursday.ETHAN CAIRNS/The Canadian Press

BC Hydro's North Coast Transmission Line (NCTL) project would effectively twin the existing 450-kilometre transmission route in British Columbia from the Williston substation near Prince George to the Skeena substation near Terrace.

Details yet to be worked out include how the $6-billion in capital costs would be financed.

BC Hydro has said that it would normally take eight to 10 years to devise and construct a major transmission project, in collaboration with First Nations. The hope is that the timing could be fast-tracked so that the first phase might be completed by 2032, with construction starting in 2026.

With the eventual addition of spur lines, the goal is to supply or increase electricity to B.C. customers such as the Port of Prince Rupert, mining companies and the proposed Ksi Lisims LNG project.

“The North Coast Transmission Line is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to drive economic growth in B.C.'s Northwest – powering traditional industries and unlocking new ones,” B.C. Energy Minister Adrian Dix said in a statement on Thursday.

The Canada Infrastructure Bank, a federal Crown corporation, said on Thursday that it has finalized a $139.5-million loan to BC Hydro to help back early activities on NCTL.

In September, Ottawa referred the concept of the “northwest critical conservation corridor” in B.C. to the Major Projects Office for consideration. The corridor would support development such as projects for critical minerals and hydroelectricity.

“We're ready to build the infrastructure that will support jobs, attract investment and deliver clean, reliable energy to fuel B.C.'s next chapter,” BC Hydro president Charlotte Mitha said in a news release.

Nickel project in Northern Ontario with a US$2-billion price tag 

Canada Nickel Co.'s Crawford Nickel Project is touted as the world's second-largest nickel-sulphide reserve. The junior miner has been working to advance the development, located 42 kilometres north of Timmins, Ont., since acquiring it in 2019.

With a price tag of more than US$2-billion, the project is aimed at supplying the electric vehicle and stainless steel markets with nickel as well as chromium, cobalt, platinum and palladium over its 41-year life. The development will include ore crushing and processing facilities as well as carbon-removal in the form of tailings carbonization technology that could store 1.5 million tonnes of carbon per year.

The government's referral of the Crawford project to the Major Projects Office will help attract international investors and potential offtake partners to chip in for construction as well as put its remaining permits in the priority line, Canada Nickel chief executive Mark Selby told reporters on Thursday. In addition, it can help the company take advantage of other government programs as it nears construction, he said.

To help stay afloat during the mine planning and permitting stages, Canada Nickel sold equity stakes in the company to Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd., South Korea's Samsung SDI, British Anglo American PLC and Taykwa Tagamou Nation. The company also has benefits and contracting agreements with the Mattagami, Matachewan, and Flying Post First Nations.

Its funding plans include $1-billion of equity, including federal refundable tax credits and carbon capture and storage tax credits worth more than US$600-million, $100-million from exercise of a Samsung SDI offtake option, up to $300-million from federal and provincial and well as G7 sources.

It is also planning on US$500-million of debt financing from Export Development Canada, $500-million from another Canadian government institution and any remaining needs from private investors.

Bid to disrupt China's dominance in graphite mining

Nouveau Monde Graphite Inc. is developing its Matawinie Mine 120 kilometres north of Montreal. Expected to come online in 2027 or 2028, it is slated to produce roughly 106,000 tonnes of graphite concentrate annually over its 25-year life. Natural flake graphite is used in lithium ion battery anodes, fuel cells, aerospace components and advanced coatings for defence and infrastructure. 

The Quebec government in 2021 issued authorization for Matawinie. NMG is now advancing financing discussions toward a final investment decision on the second phases of both the mine and the company's Bécancour Battery Material Plant, which will process graphite from Matawinie. 

NMG is being included on the major projects list after Ottawa signed an offtake agreement with the company for 15,000 tonnes of graphite concentrate each year. The government plans to stockpile the product to challenge China's dominance of the industry. Another 15,000 tonnes will be offered to allied countries or companies. 

Tim Hodgson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, announced the agreement on the sidelines of the G7 Energy and Environment Ministers Summit in Toronto last month. 

Eric Desaulniers, NMG chief executive, told media Thursday that Canada is the only G7 supplier of graphite. Dominic LeBlanc, Minister of Internal Trade, added that including NMG on the major projects list sent a “very strong signal about the potential of this project for Canada's economy and for Canadian sovereignty.”

“Once the mine and the plant are operational, Canada will be able to secure a supply of a critical mineral, which is an essential component in clean energy technologies like electric vehicle batteries and energy storage systems,” he said. 

The company has also secured commercial offtake agreements with Panasonic Energy Co. and Traxys North America LLC, and is in negotiations with an unnamed established anode manufacturer, according to its website. Together, those deals and the one with Ottawa would cover almost all of the flake graphite that would be produced by the second phase of the Matawinie mine.

New Brunswick tungsten project has been stalled for a decade

The Northcliff Sisson project is a New Brunswick tungsten-molybdenum mine that, according to a 2013 feasibility study, will haul 30,000 tonnes of ore out of the ground per day, drawing from one of the largest tungsten deposits in the world. 

The project will include on-site processing and is expected to employ approximately 200 to 300 people, with a mine lifetime of 27 years. 

“These are very important critical minerals that can shape the future of Canada and its allies,” said Andrew Ing, chief executive of Northcliff Resources Ltd., in an interview. 

Tungsten production is dominated by China, which produces 80 per cent of global supply. There are no producing tungsten mines in Canada or the U.S. In February, Beijing added the critical mineral to its export restriction list, sending prices higher and sparking questions about mineral sovereignty. 

But the Sisson project has been stalled at the pre-construction phase for over a decade. 

The project has struggled to secure private investment, Mr. Ing said. China can flood the market to keep competition out and this deters investment. 

Mr. Ing is hoping Ottawa will follow this announcement with price-floor guarantees for tungsten.

In October, G7 environment ministers gathered in Toronto unveiled a Canada-led critical minerals pact that will involve purchase agreements, price floors and stockpiling of critical minerals. 

Without follow-through on the price floors and purchase agreements for tungsten, the project is unlikely to get off the ground, said Brian Buss, a mining consultant who specializes in financing. 

“The model China uses currently is the model North America will need to adopt,” he said. 

In the past seven months, the Sisson project has received $29-million in combined funding from the Canadian and U.S. governments. These funds will go toward updating the original 12-year old feasibility study, which should be completed in the second quarter of 2026, Mr. Ing said. Construction is expected to begin mid-2027 and last two years. 

New Zealand-based, family owned conglomerate the Todd Corporation is the primary shareholder of Northcliff Resources Ltd. The Todd Corporation also has a 11.5-per-cent direct stake in the Sisson project.

Inuit-owned hydro project aims to stabilize electricity costs

The notion of building hydroelectric dams near Iqaluit, the largest community in Nunavut with a population of about 7,400, first surfaced two decades ago, but progress has been elusive. The latest proposal, backed by an Inuit-owned developer, was referred to the Major Projects Office Thursday.

Nunavut Nukkiksautiit Corp. (NNC) aims to build a hydroelectric dam in a remote location along the Kuugaluk River, about 60 kilometres northeast of the community. With a proposed capacity between 15 and 30 megawatts, it's expected to cost around $500-million. It would be among Canada's northernmost hydroelectric dams.

“This is a breakthrough for Arctic sovereignty and sustainability,” Mr. Carney asserted Thursday. “It will save $1.9-billion in diesel costs over the next 50 years, while providing affordable, reliable, emission-free power.”

Earlier this year, the territorial government identified the project as one of four priority projects it urged the federal government to back. The Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency committed up to $6-million in February to support the early engineering work, following on $7-million provided by the Northern Affairs department in 2021.

Sprawling and thinly populated, Nunavut lacks a territorial power grid: each community is served by its own distribution system and a diesel-powered power plant. The cost and logistical challenges associated with shipping diesel high into the Arctic contribute to some of the country's priciest power bills. 

The developer says the project would stabilize and possibly reduce electricity prices, while also eliminating air pollution and odour; Iqaluit's diesel plant would remain in service for backup and emergencies. 

“We've heard loud and clear from Inuit that they've been waiting a long time for renewable energy to come to Nunavut,” said Jess Puddister, NNC's manager of strategy and operations.

“Inuit are really tired of having to be diesel-dependent. It's not something they ever asked for in the first place.”

NNC said earlier this year it planned to make a final investment decision in 2029; construction could commence in 2030. Ms. Puddister said that with additional funding and quicker data collection for the project, it might begin as early as 2028.

Crown utility Qulliq Energy Corp. is the territory's sole electricity provider. It considered a hydro project around Iqaluit in 2005, eventually proposing a 12.5-megawatt dam at Jaynes Inlet, 60 kilometres southwest of the city. But Qulliq, which operates about two-dozen aging diesel generators, couldn't finance the project and put it on hold in 2014.

NNC is now negotiating a power purchase agreement that will determine how much electricity Qulliq will agree to buy from the project, at what price and on what terms. Ms. Puddister said her company expects to provide an update on those talks by the end of this year.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he told President Volodymyr Zelensky that the number of young Ukrainian men coming to Germany should be reduced, AFP reported on Nov. 13.

Following a phone call with the Ukrainian leader, Merz said that young Ukrainians should remain to "serve in their own country."

"They are needed there," the chancellor added.

Close to 1.3 million Ukrainian refugees have been recorded in Germany as of October 2025 after fleeing Russia's full-scale invasion. This represents the highest number among all EU countries.

Commenting on the phone call, Zelensky said he briefed Merz on the situation at the front and thanked Germany for its military and political support, without mentioning the issue of Ukrainian refugees.

Military-age men have faced strict travel restrictions under martial law, instituted when Russia launched its all-out war in 2022.

Germany said that young Ukrainian men began arriving in large numbers after Kyiv eased travel rules for those aged between 18 and 22 in August.

As a result, the number of Ukrainian men in this age group registering in Germany went from 100 a week to almost 1,000, according to the German Interior Ministry.

The development comes as Kyiv struggles with a continued manpower shortage on the front as Russia sustains offensive operations in the east and south of Ukraine.

Around 490,000 Ukrainians of working age staying in Germany are receiving unemployment benefits, a point of criticism from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.

AfD, Germany's leading opposition party, which has consistently criticized Berlin's military and economic support for Kyiv, suggested that unemployment benefits for Ukrainians should be replaced with lower-level payments for asylum seekers.

Facing political pressure, Germany's ruling coalition is preparing a bill that would reduce benefits for Ukrainians who arrived after April 1, with the aim of incentivizing them to seek employment.

If confirmed, this would mark the fourth time Ukraine has hit the Saratov oil refinery in fall 2025.

Ukrainian drones struck the Russian port city of Novorossiysk on Nov. 14, damaging an oil terminal and sparking a large fire, multiple Russian Telegram channels reported.

Ukrainian drones struck a military base in occupied Crimea used for the storage and maintenance of Russian "Orion" drones, Robert "Madyar" Brovdi, the commander of Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces, reported on Nov. 13.



President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to visit Greece over the weekend to sign an agreement in the energy sector, a source close to the Presidential Office told the Kyiv Independent on Nov. 13.









Saakashvili requested the status "with the corresponding legal consequences," adding that "Ukrainians never abandon their own." Kyiv has previously managed to free civilian Ukrainian captives during exchanges with Moscow.

Ihor Fursenko, one of the key members of the group allegedly laundering money from the scheme, was formally employed at Fire Point to save him from mobilization and allow him to travel outside of Ukraine, according to a snippet of dialogue released in the trial.

The two Ukrainian companies targeted were Ekofera and Imperative Ukraine, which the U.S Treasury says are Ukrainian front corporations.

Rubio also confirmed that the U.S. is not interfering in the expansion of a Hungarian nuclear power plant by a Russian company. "We want them to be able to complete it because we want them (Hungary) to be energy independent," he said.

            A strong Pacific storm is bringing soaking rain to Southern California and raising the risk of life-threatening flooding, mudslides and debris flows, especially near burn scars in the Los Angeles area.
    


            A mix of heavy rain and strong winds moved through northern and central California on Thursday. Widespread rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches were observed along the coast into Friday morning, with isolated amounts of 3 to 5 inches in the coastal mountain ranges.
    


            San Francisco received nearly an inch and a half of rain Thursday, almost  75% of November's average. November marks a transition into the rainier winter season, with December to February marking the wettest months of the year in the Bay Area.
    


            Winds in the higher elevations gusted 60 to 80 mph Thursday with San Francisco gusts topping 50 mph.
    


            The winds started to ease as the system dropped into Southern California early Friday, but the flood threat is intensifying as an atmospheric river feeds moisture from the ocean into the storm.
    


            Parts of the region – including much of the Los Angeles area – are under a Level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall on both Friday and Saturday, according to the Weather Prediction Center.
    


            An initial wave of heavy rain for southern California caused flooding and a mudslide late Thursday night on portions of Highway 101 in southern Santa Barbara County, according to the National Weather Service. This round of rain is expected to ease by Friday afternoon.
    


            A second, more intense wave will move into the region Friday night into Saturday, with prolonged heavy rain possible. Rainfall rates could be as high as an inch per hour at times.
    


            This second round of rain will also have the added danger of falling over already-wet ground, which struggles to absorb additional rain and will start flooding quicker than dry ground.
    


            There's also the potential for isolated severe thunderstorms embedded within the heavier rain Friday night into Saturday. Some of these storms could produce damaging wind gusts, hail and perhaps a short-lived tornado.
    


            Much of the Los Angeles area is under a flood watch through 10 p.m. Saturday. The National Weather Service warns that the storm could trigger life-threatening debris flows, knock out power and flood roads.
    


            Burn scar areas from recent wildfires in the region will be particularly vulnerable to mudslides and debris flows. Not only do wildfires destroy vegetation that would normally soak up some of the rainfall, but their extreme heat can alter the soil, creating a water-repellent layer just below the surface.
    


            Officials have warned residents near the recent Palisades, Hurst and Sunset fires' burn scars to be prepared to evacuate.
    


            “Residents, especially those in vulnerable areas, should start taking precautions immediately to prepare for the storm and protect their interests,” the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said. “This scenario would potentially create many significant impacts area-wide, including possible debris flows in the burn areas, significant ponding of roads and highways, mudslides through the canyons, fallen trees, etc.”
    


            Residents can pick up sandbags at Fire Stations throughout the City, with sand also available for free at select locations.
    


            The heaviest rain should ease late Saturday, but the region isn't in the clear right away. Showers linger into Sunday, and the ground will be saturated. It won't take much rain to trigger more minor flooding or keep roads slick, especially in spots that usually drain slowly after big storms.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story. 

Ukrainian drones attacked the Russian city of Saratov overnight on Nov. 14, striking the local oil refinery, residents claimed. 

If confirmed, this would mark the fourth time Ukraine has hit the Saratov oil refinery in fall 2025.

Saratov Oblast Governor Roman Busargin confirmed that drones attacked the region overnight and said that "civilian infrastructure" in Saratov had been damaged. Emergency services are operating at the site, he said. 

Locals, however, said that the drones struck the Saratov oil refinery — a frequent target of Ukrainian long-range attacks. Photos and videos of explosions circulated on social media amid the attack. 

The Russian Defense Ministry reported that air defense units shot down 45 drones over Saratov Oblast during the night. 

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims at the time of publication. 

The Saratov refinery lies in southwestern Russia, roughly 150 kilometers (100 miles) from the border with Kazakhstan and nearly 600 kilometers (370 miles) east of the front line in Ukraine.

The facility, owned by the Russian oil giant Rosneft, has a processing capacity of 140,000 barrels of crude per day. It produces over 20 different petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel, fuel oil, and bitumen.

The refinery has been hit several times this fall. Previous attacks forced the facility to temporarily halt oil intake in August, Bloomberg reported.

Ukraine regularly launches long-range drone attacks on industrial and military facilities in Russia. Oil refineries, which fund and fuel Moscow's war machine, are frequent targets.

Abbey Fenbert is a senior news editor at the Kyiv Independent. She is a freelance writer, editor, and playwright with an MFA from Boston University. Abbey served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Ukraine from 2008-2011. 

At least 11 apartment buildings throughout the city were struck in the overnight attack, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.

Following a phone call with Zelensky, Merz said that young Ukrainian men should remain to "serve in their own country."

            Three Chinese astronauts landed back on Earth on Friday, according to state media, more than a week later than their scheduled landing, capping an extended stay in space after a suspected debris hit left their spaceship with a cracked window.
    


            After the capsule hatch opened medical teams found that the astronauts were in good physical condition, Chinese state media outlet CCTV reported.
    


            The crew of the Shenzhou-20 spaceflight had been due to finish their mission at China's Tiangong space station last Wednesday; they'd even handed the keys to the space station to a new crew who had just arrived for their own six-month mission.
    


            But instead, their journey home was postponed “due to a suspected impact from tiny space debris” to their ship, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.
    


            After a nine-day wait, they finally headed home on the Shenzhou-21 spacecraft that transported the incoming crew, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).
    


            The damaged Shenzhou-20 ship had “a slight crack” in the window of its return capsule, likely caused by debris impact, making it unsafe for the crew to return in, according to the CMSA. The ship will stay in orbit to carry out experiments instead, the agency said.
    


            During their extra week in space, the crew continued working and living alongside the newly arrived Shenzhou-21 astronauts, as the space station has enough capacity to support two crews in orbit, according to Xinhua.
    


            The Tiangong station is only one of two operating space stations, alongside the International Space Station. Since it was completed in 2022, the biannual launches of China's Shenzhou program have been a source of national pride.
    


            Recent advances have seen China break an American-held record for the longest spacewalk, with a nine-hour sortie, and it's about to open the doors of the Tiangong to foreigners for the first time, with plans to welcome an astronaut from Pakistan next year.
    


            The new crew on board the Shenzhou-21 – who are now without a spaceship to return in – include China's youngest astronaut to be sent to space, 32-year-old Wu Fei.
    


            The Shenzhou-22, due to launch sometime next year, will include one astronaut who stays more than a year for a “long-duration residency experiment,” Xinhua reported.
    


            China's rapid development in space exploration has raised alarm bells in Washington, which is racing to put an astronaut on the moon again. The Trump administration placed bans on Chinese citizens with US visas participating in NASA programs.
    


            The US space agency is familiar with the difficulties of retrieving astronauts stuck in space. What was meant to be a short stay on the International Space Station stretched into a more than nine-month mission for two American astronauts earlier this year after their spacecraft malfunctioned. They eventually returned home in March.
    


            Both countries are also competing in nascent institution-building efforts, with the US-led Artemis Accords on lunar exploration matched up against the Chinese- and Russian-led International Lunar Research Station.

            The Tiangong station is only one of two operating space stations, alongside the International Space Station. Since it was completed in 2022, the biannual launches of China's Shenzhou program have been a source of national pride.
    


            Recent advances have seen China break an American-held record for the longest spacewalk, with a nine-hour sortie, and it's about to open the doors of the Tiangong to foreigners for the first time, with plans to welcome an astronaut from Pakistan next year.
    


            The new crew on board the Shenzhou-21 – who are now without a spaceship to return in – include China's youngest astronaut to be sent to space, 32-year-old Wu Fei.
    


            The Shenzhou-22, due to launch sometime next year, will include one astronaut who stays more than a year for a “long-duration residency experiment,” Xinhua reported.
    


            China's rapid development in space exploration has raised alarm bells in Washington, which is racing to put an astronaut on the moon again. The Trump administration placed bans on Chinese citizens with US visas participating in NASA programs.
    


            The US space agency is familiar with the difficulties of retrieving astronauts stuck in space. What was meant to be a short stay on the International Space Station stretched into a more than nine-month mission for two American astronauts earlier this year after their spacecraft malfunctioned. They eventually returned home in March.
    


            Both countries are also competing in nascent institution-building efforts, with the US-led Artemis Accords on lunar exploration matched up against the Chinese- and Russian-led International Lunar Research Station.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story. 

Ukrainian drones struck the Russian port city of Novorossiysk, Krasnodar Krai, on Nov. 14, damaging an oil terminal and sparking a large fire, multiple Russian Telegram channels and local officials reported.

The attack hit the Sheskharis oil complex, where infrastructure facilities were damaged and a blaze broke out. The facility is a major oil export terminal that serves as the endpoint for pipelines run by Russia's state-run Transneft, the world's largest oil pipeline company.

The Krasnodar Krai operational headquarters reported the hit at the oil terminal and said several coastal facilities had been damaged in the attack. Officials claimed the fire at the Sheskharis complex had been extinguished. 

Russian state media RIA Novosti also resported that a civilian vessel in the port was hit during the mass UAV strike, leaving three crew members injured.

Russian air defense units shot down 66 drones over Krasnodar Krai overnight, the Russian Defense Ministry said. 

The Kyiv Independent could not confirm these claims at the time of publication.

Andrii Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation, commented on the attack on social media. 

"This is the oil terminal in Novorossiysk after the strike," he wrote on Telegram. "Meanwhile, Russia is hitting residential buildings and energy infrastructure."

The strike on Novorossiysk came as Russia pounded Kyiv with waves of drones and missiles during a massive attack that left at least 14 people injured and a dozen apartment buildings in flames.Novorossiysk, a key hub for Russia's Black Sea logistics and energy infrastructure, has been repeatedly targeted in Ukrainian strikes. Kyiv considers Russian oil refineries and petrochemical facilities to be valid military targets as they help fund Moscow's war efforts.

At least 11 apartment buildings throughout the city were struck in the overnight attack, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.

Following a phone call with Zelensky, Merz said that young Ukrainian men should remain to "serve in their own country."

If confirmed, this would mark the fourth time Ukraine has hit the Saratov oil refinery in fall 2025.

Ukrainian drones struck the Russian port city of Novorossiysk on Nov. 14, damaging an oil terminal and sparking a large fire, multiple Russian Telegram channels reported.

Ukrainian drones struck a military base in occupied Crimea used for the storage and maintenance of Russian "Orion" drones, Robert "Madyar" Brovdi, the commander of Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces, reported on Nov. 13.



President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to visit Greece over the weekend to sign an agreement in the energy sector, a source close to the Presidential Office told the Kyiv Independent on Nov. 13.









Saakashvili requested the status "with the corresponding legal consequences," adding that "Ukrainians never abandon their own." Kyiv has previously managed to free civilian Ukrainian captives during exchanges with Moscow.

Ihor Fursenko, one of the key members of the group allegedly laundering money from the scheme, was formally employed at Fire Point to save him from mobilization and allow him to travel outside of Ukraine, according to a snippet of dialogue released in the trial.

The two Ukrainian companies targeted were Ekofera and Imperative Ukraine, which the U.S Treasury says are Ukrainian front corporations.

Rubio also confirmed that the U.S. is not interfering in the expansion of a Hungarian nuclear power plant by a Russian company. "We want them to be able to complete it because we want them (Hungary) to be energy independent," he said.

Editor's Note: Updated at 1:58 PM Kyiv time with new commentary from Ukraine's Security Service.

Ukrainian drones struck the Russian port city of Novorossiysk, Krasnodar Krai, on Nov. 14, damaging an oil terminal and sparking a large fire, multiple Russian Telegram channels and local officials reported.

Russian state media RIA Novosti also resported that a civilian vessel in the port was hit during the mass UAV strike, leaving three crew members injured.

Subsequently, Ukraine's Security Service, or SBU, told the Kyiv Independent that they and elements of Ukraine's armed forced were behind the attack, hitting "oil-loading arms at the wharves, pipeline infrastructure and pumping installations." 

The SBU said that powerful fires continued at the terminal as of just before 2 PM Kyiv time on November 14. 

Russian air defense units shot down 66 drones over Krasnodar Krai overnight, the Russian Defense Ministry said. 

The Kyiv Independent could not confirm these claims at the time of publication.

Serhii Vlasenko, 35, has served in Ukraine's Emergency Service for 15 years and was on duty as a shift supervisor when the attack occurred.

If carried out, the deportation would mark the highest number of Ukrainians removed from the U.S. in recent years, the Washington Post reported.



 Pokrovsk, a city that held back some of Russia's fiercest assaults for over a year, is now on the verge of falling. The Kyiv Independent's Francis Farrell explains how the battle reached this point and what Pokrovsk's fall could mean for the wider defense of Donetsk Oblast. 

Alvarez & Marsal has been tapped as the investment advisor for the U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal, officials announced on Nov. 14, the latest step in a widely-watched agreement to invest in Ukraine's critical resource sectors.

An Iskander-type missile fell on the embassy's territory, causing an explosion that damaged its facilities and service vehicles, Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry said. 





The statement follows reports that President Volodymyr Zelensky's former business partner Timur Mindich had been tipped off about possible searches and left the country beforehand.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius also announced that Berlin has agreed to allocate an additional 150 million euros ($175 million) in military aid to Kyiv under the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) initiative.

At least 11 apartment buildings throughout the city were struck in the overnight attack, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.

"We do not accept this obviously unlawful solution contrary to European values," Orban said on a weekly radio show. "We are turning to the European Court of Justice."

The two leaders will discuss bilateral cooperation in the "energy, economic, and defense fields," as well as progress in preparing security guarantees for Ukraine under the "Coalition of the Willing" framework.

Russia has actively recruited, hoodwinked and kidnapped workers for its war machine from across the developing world.

            More than half a million people in South Korea sat for the country's grueling university entrance exam on Thursday as police mobilized to ensure they made it to the test sites on time and all flights were halted for half an hour.
    


            The number sitting the test, essential to secure a place at the country's top universities, was the highest in seven years. Most of the candidates were born in 2007 when there was a surge in births because it was considered an auspicious time to have a baby.
    


            Flights at all airports, including Incheon International Airport, were banned from landing or takeoff between 1:05 p.m. and 1:40 p.m. to ensure there was no disturbance while the students sat for the listening comprehension section of the English test.
    


            The decision affected 140 flights, including 65 international arrivals and departures. Flight trackers showed aircraft circling near airports as the Transport Ministry restricted aircraft from altitudes below 3,000 meters (9843 ft).
    


            Financial markets and offices opened an hour later than usual to ensure test candidates arrived on time for the nine-hour exam that is seen as crucial for success in the hyper-competitive society.
    


            “This exam has been a goal for nearly 20 years and also a new beginning,” said Yeseon Kim, who was waiting outside a test site where her daughter was sitting the exam.
    


            A total of 554,174 people registered this year, up 6% from last year and the highest since 2019. Some 496,000 babies were born in 2007 in a jump that paused a steady decline since the mid-1990s.
    


            South Korea is one of the world's fastest-aging societies, although its birthrate rose to 0.75 in 2024.

Secretary of War Pete Hegseth unveiled a new U.S. military operation Thursday targeting “narco-terrorists” in the Western Hemisphere to stymie the flow of drugs into the United States, following orders from President Donald Trump.

Hegseth made the announcement in a post on X, saying that the operation aims to combat threats faced domestically by the United States.

SEOUL, November 14. /TASS/. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui has denounced the appeal of the foreign ministers of the Group of Seven (G7) states to denuclearize calling it hostile machinations, according to the Central Telegraphic Agency of Korea (KCNA).

"I express my complete dissatisfaction and regret over the outright hostile machinations of the G7 foreign ministers, which are a direct encroachment on the constitution of our state," she said, referring to a joint G7 foreign ministers' statement issued after their meeting in Canada.

North Korean nuclear status is specified in its constitution.

She called the G7's desire for denuclearization a manifestation of "inertia of thought" because the international community "understands its impossibility."

"No one has the right to force us to violate the constitution, and no one can try to change it," Choe Son Hui said.

"The current status of the DPRK will not change under the influence of external rhetoric and insistence, in today's harsh geopolitical environment, the possession of nuclear weapons is the most accurate choice to deter the most dangerous states."

Choe Son Hui called on the international community to pay attention to the threat to peace and security from the Group of Seven, which she called a "nuclear alliance." She reiterated that North Korea will possess nuclear weapons until "the nuclear threat from external forces is put an end to, as long as there are forces that consider nuclear weapons to be a means of their tyranny."

LONDON, November 14. /TASS/. The British intelligence services and the military have stopped providing the United States with intelligence on the movement of ships in the Caribbean on recommendation of Attorney General for England and Wales Richard Hermer, The Times reported citing sources.

According to them, Hermer fears an international lawsuit against the UK over its involvement in the US strikes on ships in the Caribbean. Earlier, the British shared with the Americans the coordinates of the boats, on which drugs were allegedly transported, as well as data on the number of people on board. CNN was the first to report on November 12 that the United Kingdom had stopped providing the intelligence.

According to the newspaper, the recommendations indicated that the UK had signed up to stricter rules of conduct in international waters than the United States, and could be considered complicit in what the UN called "extrajudicial executions."

The government declined to comment saying only that the United States remains Britain's closest partner in defense, security and intelligence matters.

Washington accuses Venezuela of not actively fighting drug smuggling. The US Navy has deployed eight ships, one nuclear submarine, and more than 10,000 troops in the Caribbean Sea and is destroying high-speed boats in international waters, allegedly involved in drug smuggling from Venezuela.

According to The New York Times, US President Donald Trump has authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela. The American media has repeatedly reported that the United States may soon begin attacking drug cartel facilities in Venezuela. However, on October 31, Trump said he was not considering attacks on Venezuelan territory.

            The Israeli government identified the deceased hostage whose remains were handed over by Hamas on Thursday as Manny Godard, 73, an Israeli resident of a kibbutz near the Gaza Strip.
    


            Godard and his wife Ayelet were killed during the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israeli communities near the Strip. His body was then taken to Gaza.
    


            During the attack, Godard and his wife hid in the safe room of their home in Be'eri Kibbutz. They later fled after their house was set on fire, and the attackers “ambushed them outside,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement Thursday. After the father of four was killed, “Ayelet hid in the bushes for several hours before she was also murdered,” the forum added.
    


            Godard spent his childhood on Israeli beaches alongside his father, who was a lifeguard, the forum said. Later, Godard also became a lifeguard, the group said.
    


            Israel's National Center of Forensic Medicine confirmed his identity after his remains were released by Hamas to the International Committee of the Red Cross and then turned over to Israeli authorities. The handover leaves three remaining deceased hostages in the Gaza Strip.
    


            Israel is “determined, committed and tirelessly working to bring back all of our fallen hostages for a proper burial in their homeland,” the prime minister's office said in a statement announcing the identification of Godard.
    


            In a transfer that was part of a US-brokered ceasefire agreement, Israel earlier said it received a coffin containing the remains via the Red Cross in Gaza and transported them to Israel's national forensics laboratory for identification. Hamas did not identify which of the last few deceased hostages it was handing over.
    


            Hamas' military wing said earlier Thursday that it would hand over the body of an Israeli found near Khan Younis in southern Gaza.
    


            This release of remains comes after a series of such transfers last week, including that of the longest-held deceased hostage in Gaza. On Sunday, Hamas handed over the remains of Lt. Hadar Goldin, who was killed in the final days of a 2014 conflict between Israel and Hamas. The transfer of Goldin's remains was the fifth such occurrence in little more than a week, bringing Hamas down to the final few deceased hostages still in Gaza.
    


Israeli intelligence has assessed that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza. But Hamas has continued to search for remains in different parts of Gaza.
    


            The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has continued to organize rallies in Tel Aviv and elsewhere across Israel calling for the release of the remaining deceased hostages.
    


            Eitan Horn, who was recently freed after 738 days in captivity, said in Hostages Square last weekend: “I cannot begin my journey of healing and recovery as long as I know there are families who are not with me on this journey. We have no future without the return of all the hostages.”
    


            Other freed hostages have expressed the same sentiment, saying they cannot begin to heal until all of the hostages – living and deceased – have returned home.

Thus far, the justices have signaled they may not let him — yet.

About a month ago, Trump v. Illinois looked like it was going to be one of the most consequential Supreme Court decisions of the entire Trump era. The case concerns President Donald Trump's attempt to deploy National Guard troops to an immigration facility in Broadview, Illinois, in order to suppress a small protest that has ranged in size from a few dozen people to about 200.

After two lower courts ruled that Trump's use of the National Guard in this way is illegal, Trump asked the Supreme Court — which has a Republican majority that frequently rules in his favor — to greenlight his use of troops in mid-October.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

Yet, in a break from their ordinary practice, the Court signaled in an October 29 order that they are skeptical of many of Trump's legal arguments. And they asked for additional briefing on a question that neither party raised to the justices. The first round of those new briefs were filed on November 10, and the Court is likely to rule on the case after briefing completes on Monday, November 17.

The upshot is that Trump's attempt to send troops to Broadview remains blocked by the lower court orders, at least for now. The Court's October 29 order, moreover, suggests that the justices may look to delay a showdown on whether and when Trump can use the military against Americans on US soil until a future case.

For now, in other words, the stakes of the Illinois case may be somewhat diminished. But, even if the Court does rule against Trump, that will likely only punt the question of when Trump is allowed to deploy troops against Americans until a future date.

Beginning in September, a small group of people have protested the Trump administration's immigration policies outside of a detention facility in Broadview. According to Judge April Perry, a federal district judge who ruled against Trump's use of troops, “the typical number of protestors is fewer than fifty,” and “the crowd has never exceeded 200.”

Some members of this small group of protesters have also been charged with crimes. Some allegedly vandalized federal law enforcement vehicles, and others have been arrested for more serious crimes such as aggravated battery.

When Illinois first reached the Supreme Court, the case seemed to turn on whether federal law permits using National Guard members against such a minor protest. Ordinarily, the National Guard is under the command and control of state governments. But Trump relied on a federal law that permits the president to take command of the Guard if there is “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States” or if “the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

In their initial brief to the justices, Trump's lawyers made some very aggressive arguments. Among other things, they claimed that the decision to take control of National Guard members “is committed exclusively to the president” and cannot be reviewed by federal courts. They also claimed that the small group of protesters constitutes a “rebellion” that justifies military force.

But, in their October 29 order, the justices dodged these questions and instead asked for briefing on an unrelated question: “Whether the term ‘regular forces' refers to the regular forces of the United States military, and, if so, how that interpretation affects the operation of” the relevant federal statute.

The fact that the Court did not immediately rule for Trump on his more aggressive arguments suggests that a majority of the justices are skeptical of them. There would be no need, for example, to parse the meaning of the words “regular forces” if Trump's decision to deploy troops against protesters cannot be reviewed by the courts.

It is likely, moreover, that the justices are sympathetic to a reading of these two words that would require them to rule against Trump in the Illinois case. But a ruling against him on these narrow grounds would merely delay the question of whether and when Trump can use the military against Americans on US soil.

Recall that federal law permits the president to use the National Guard to quell domestic unrest if “the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.” Prior to the Supreme Court's October 29 order, both the Trump administration and the lower courts read the phrase “regular forces” to refer to civilian law enforcement officials. Thus, as Trump's lawyers presented the case to the justices, Illinois turned on whether Trump was unable to enforce US law in Broadview without relying on the military at all.

But an amicus brief filed by Georgetown law professor Marty Lederman argues that the words “regular forces” refers, not to civilian law enforcement, but to “the standing military forces of the Armed Services, within the Department of Defense.” Thus, under Lederman's reading, Trump may only deploy the National Guard to enforce domestic law if he has first demonstrated that he is unable to enforce the law using the actual Army or Marines.

And it appears that Lederman's argument is sufficiently persuasive that it convinced a majority of the justices to seek additional briefing from Trump and from the Illinois plaintiffs on whether Lederman is correct.

To understand Lederman's argument, it's helpful to understand some of the history of the National Guard. Many of the United States's founders feared a permanent, national, standing army; as the Supreme Court summarized this fear in a 1990 opinion, “there was a widespread fear that a national standing Army posed an intolerable threat to individual liberty and to the sovereignty of the separate States.”

Instead, the framers imagined that states would maintain a militia that would generally operate under the state's control. But the Constitution also permitted Congress to call this militia into federal service “to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions.”

The framers' original vision of a nation with no permanent federal army obviously no longer describes America's relationship with the military. The United States has the most powerful standing military forces in the world. By the dawn of the 20th century, the state militias had, in the Supreme Court's words, “proved to be a decidedly unreliable fighting force.” President Theodore Roosevelt warned that the laws governing these militias were “obsolete and worthless.”

In 1901, Roosevelt asked Congress to enact new legislation that would replace the atrophied militias with what became the modern-day National Guard. Notably, Roosevelt's message to Congress proposed that the armaments and other resources provided to this new militia should “be made identical with those provided for the regular forces.”

Congress responded with the regrettably named Dick Act of 1903 (the law is named after Rep. Charles Dick, who chaired an important congressional committee), which established “the organized militia, to be known as the National Guard of the State, Territory, or District of Columbia.”

As originally enacted, the Dick Act permitted the president to use the National Guard when he is “unable, with the other forces at his command, to execute the laws of the Union in any part thereof.” But Congress amended the law in 1908 to something more similar to the modern version. The 1908 version provided that the president may use the National Guard when he “is unable with the regular forces at his command to execute the laws of the Union in any part thereof.”

According to the Senate Committee on Military Affairs, this change was made to ensure that the National Guard would be the “second line of defense” after the use of other military forces. (Congress removed the words “at his command” in 1956 because it deemed them to be “surplusage.”)

In any event, much of Lederman's brief is a long list of historical examples showing that Congress used the words “regular forces” to distinguish a standing federal military from state militias. An 1806 law, for example, provides that militiamen are subject to the same rules of military justice as federal troops when “acting in conjunction with the regular forces of the United States.” A broader 1814 law concerned court martials of militiamen serving under the United States “whether acting in conjunction with the regular forces or otherwise.”

The Supreme Court also used the term “regular forces” in this way around the time that the Dick Act was enacted and first amended. In McClaughry v. Deming (1902), for example, the Court referred to the “substantial difference between the regular forces and the militia.”

There's more. But suffice to say, a majority of the justices appear to have found his evidence persuasive enough to set aside the Trump administration's arguments and instead demand additional briefing on the meaning of the term “regular forces.”

Unless you are a fan of military forces in US streets, the implications of Lederman's argument may seem alarming. If Trump isn't allowed to use the National Guard without first attempting to use the regular Army or the Marines, then he is likely to deploy the regular Army or the Marines against Americans protesting his policies.

But there are other laws that govern the use of regular military forces within the United States. One is the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the use of those forces “to execute the laws” except “under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.” Another law, commonly known as the Insurrection Act, permits the president to use the military to “suppress, in a State, any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy” — but only in limited circumstances laid out in that statute.

The Justice Department has long interpreted these circumstances very narrowly. In a 1964 memorandum signed by then-Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach, for example, the DOJ concluded that the Insurrection Act may only be used if “state authorities are either directly involved, by acting or failing to act, in denials of federal rights of a dimension requiring federal military action, or are so helpless in the face of private violence that the private activity has taken on the character of state action.”

Barring a court order permitting the use of troops, moreover, Katzenbach concluded that military force is only allowed under the Insurrection Act when “those engaging in violence are either acting with the approval of state authorities or have, like the Klan in the 1870s, taken over effective control of the area involved.”

Needless to say, the small group of protesters in Broadview hasn't come close to seizing control of that region in the same way that the Ku Klux Klan dominated many parts of the South in the post-Civil War era.

Still, the fact that the Justice Department has long interpreted the Insurrection Act narrowly does not mean that either the Trump administration or this Supreme Court — which is ordinarily so sycophantic toward Trump that it literally held that he is allowed to use the powers of the presidency to commit crimes — will read the same law as narrowly.

But a legal showdown over the meaning of the Insurrection Act is not currently before the Court. If the justices accept Lederman's interpretation of the amended Dick Act, then that will mean Trump will lose his bid to send National Guard members to Broadview. It will then be up to Trump to decide if he wants to set off a new legal fight by claiming authority under the Insurrection Act, and deploying regular forces to American cities.

By the time Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, he had established an enormous network of wealthy and influential friends. Emails made public this week show the crime did little to diminish the desire of that network to stay connected to the financier.

Thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday offer a new glimpse into what Epstein's relationships with business executives, reporters, academics and political players looked like over a decade.

They start with messages he sent and received around the time he finished serving his Florida sentence in 2009 and continue until the months before his arrest on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019.

During that time, Epstein's network was eclectic, spanning the globe and political affiliations: from the liberal academic Noam Chomsky to Steve Bannon, the longtime ally of President Donald Trump.

Some reached out to support Epstein amid lawsuits and prosecutions, others sought introductions or advice on everything from dating to oil prices. One consulted him on how to respond to accusations of sexual harassment.

Epstein was charged with sex trafficking in 2019, and killed himself in jail a month later. Epstein's crimes, high-profile connections and jailhouse suicide have made the case a magnet for conspiracy theorists and online sleuths seeking proof of a cover-up.

The emails do not implicate his contacts in those alleged crimes. They instead paint a picture of Epstein's influence and connections over the years he was a registered sex offender.

Epstein emailed current and former political figures on all sides, sending news clips and discussing strategy or gossip often in short, choppy emails laden with spelling and grammatical errors.

In several emails in 2018, Epstein advised Bannon on his political tour of Europe that year. Bannon first forwarded Epstein a news clip that described the German media as “underestimating” Bannon and that he was “As Dangerous as Ever.”

“luv it,” Epstein responded. 

Epstein wrote that he'd just spoken to “one of the country leaders that we discussed” and that “we should lay out a strategy plan. . how much fun.” 

Several months later, Epstein sent some advice: “If you are going to play here , you'll have to spend time, europe by remote doesn't work.”

“its doable but time consuming,” Epstein continued in a follow-up email, “there are many leaders of countries we can organize for you to have one on ones.” 

Just a few months earlier, Epstein was insulting Trump — whose movement Bannon was a representative of — in emails to Kathryn Ruemmler, the former White House counsel under President Barack Obama.

Ruemmler sent a message to Epstein calling Trump “so gross.” A portion of that message was redacted, but Epstein replied, “worse in real life and upclose.”

In other emails with Ruemmler, Epstein detailed a whirlwind of well-known people he appears to have been meeting, hosting or speaking with that week, including an ambassador, a tech giant, foreign business people, academics and a film director.

“you are a welcome guest at any,” he wrote.

Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokesperson for Goldman Sachs, where Ruemmler now works, declined to comment.

The financier emailed often with people in the upper echelons of wealth around the world, brokering introductions and chatting about politics and foreign affairs.

That included Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, who Epstein sent an email to in 2014 saying “that was fun , see you in 3 weeks.”

Four years later, Epstein asked if Thiel was enjoying Los Angeles, and, after Thiel said he couldn't complain, replied “Dec visit me Caribbean.” It's unclear if Thiel ever responded.

In emails with Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, an Emirati businessman, Epstein complimented Bannon, saying in 2018 that “We have become friends you will like him.”

“Trump doesn't like him,” responded Sulayem.

A year earlier, Sulayem asked Epstein about an event where it appeared Trump would be in attendance, asking, “Do you think it will be possible to shake hand with trump.”

“Call to discuss,” Epstein wrote back.

In January 2010, biotech venture capitalist Boris Nikolic was attending the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and Epstein emailed to ask, “any fun?”

Nikolic replied that he had met “your friend” Bill Clinton, as well as then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy and “your other friend,” Prince Andrew, “as he has some questions re microsoft.”

But then Nikolic said he was getting sick of meetings. Later, he wrote Epstein that “it would be blast that you are here.” He mentioned flirting with a 22-year-old woman.

“It turns out she is with her husand. Did not have chance to check him out. But as we concluded, anything good is rented ;)” Nikolic wrote.

The theoretical physicist and cosmologist Laurence Krauss was among them. In 2017, Krauss reached out to Epstein via email for advice on responding to a reporter writing a story about allegations of sexual harassment against him.

“Is this a reasonable response? Should i even respond? Could use advice,” Krauss asked Epstein.

In an explicit exchange, Epstein asked Krauss if he'd had sex with the person in question and then suggested he should not reply to the journalist. 

“No. We didn't have sex. Decided it wasn't a good idea,” replied Krauss.

Krauss said in an email to The Associated Press that he never hid the fact that he knew Epstein, and interacted with him several times.

“I sought out advice from essentially everyone I knew when false allegations about me were circulated in the press in 2018,” said Krauss. “I was as shocked as the rest of the world when he was arrested” in 2019.

In an August 2015 email exchange, Epstein told Chomsky, the famed linguist and social scientist, to only fly to Greece if he feels well, joking he previously had to send a plane for another “lefty friend” to see a doctor in New York.

In the same exchange, which dipped into academic arguments about warning signs on currency collapses, behavioral science models, and Big Data, Epstein offered his residences for Chomsky's use.

“you are of course welcome to use apt in new york with your new leisure time, or visit new Mexico again,” Epstein wrote. 

The emails also show that Epstein kept up a friendly relationship with Larry Summers, who was the treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and former Harvard University president, and bantered about the 2016 presidential race and Trump.

Other emails showed a closer relationship. In 2019, Summers was discussing interactions he had with a woman, writing to Epstein that “I said what are you up to. She said ‘I'm busy'. I said awfully coy u are.”

Epstein replied, “you reacted well.. annoyed shows caring. , no whining showed strentgh.”

Summers issued a statement saying he has “great regrets in my life.”

“As I have said before, my association with Jeffrey Epstein was a major error of judgement,” the statement said.

Chomsky, Thiel, Bannon, and Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem did not immediately respond to requests for comment, which were sent through email addresses available on their own or their organizations' websites.

Thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee offer a new glimpse into what Jeffery Epstein's relationships with business executives, reporters, academics and political players looked like over a decade.

They start with messages he sent and received around the time he finished serving his Florida sentence in 2009 and continue until the months before his arrest on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019.

During that time, Epstein's network was eclectic, spanning the globe and political affiliations: from the liberal academic Noam Chomsky to Steve Bannon, the longtime ally of President Donald Trump.

The emails don't implicate his contacts in those alleged crimes. They instead paint a picture of Epstein's influence and connections over the years he was a registered sex offender.

Here's the latest:

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said air traffic controllers received 70% of their back pay Friday for working during the shutdown.

A number of controllers called out of work during the shutdown as they dealt with the financial pressure from going without pay for so long.

Some controllers even got side jobs to help make ends meet. That led to delays and other flight disruptions when the Federal Aviation Administration ran short of controllers at airport towers and other radar facilities.

Controller staffing improved significantly earlier this week as the shutdown drew to a close. Duffy said earlier this week that controllers would receive the rest of their back pay in the next few paychecks.

Duffy and President Donald Trump have also proposed that controllers who didn't miss a shift during the shutdown should receive $10,000 bonuses. But the details of exactly who might get those checks haven't been released.

Democratic members of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure asked federal officials for an explanation of the decision to cut up to 10% of flights at 40 major airports during the shutdown, along with details on staffing levels and how airports were chosen.

“It appears that the administration made this decision without adequate coordination with key aviation stakeholders,” said Friday's letter to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford, .

The group requested a briefing and written response by Nov. 20.

The FAA on Wednesday froze reductions at 6%, shortly before a deal was reached to end the shutdown. Requests for comment were sent to the department and FAA.

The president is planning to attend the World Economic Forum's meeting in Switzerland in January, according to a senior White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity to share plans that were not yet publicly announced.

The annual meeting in the Swiss Alps draws world leaders, business executives, celebrities and, sometimes, U.S. presidents. Trump attended in his first term in 2018 and 2020.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement is working with state and local law enforcement agencies to carry out welfare checks on roughly 450,000 migrant children.

They said the program kicked off Nov. 10 in Florida.

The administration launched a similar effort earlier  this year, but this one includes state and local law enforcement agencies authorized to work with ICE.

Migrant children traveling alone initially stay in government shelters before being released to sponsors.

Under the Biden administration, officials tried to release children to eligible sponsors within 30 days, reuniting many families quickly.

But there were problems, including some children released to adults who forced them to work illegally.

Migrant advocates are suspicious that the Trump administration's efforts could end up being a way to deport sponsors or children.

The effects of the rush to redraw U.S. political maps ahead of next year's midterm elections can be seen in the contrasts between two very different places now in the same Missouri congressional district.

The 18th and Vine area in Kansas City is predominately Black, once known for jazz joints and the meeting that created professional baseball's National Negro League when the established major leagues barred Black players. Boonville is a small, mostly white town set in an area teeming with cattle and row crops.

People in both areas worry about being ignored in the new district.

The incumbent is Democrat Emanuel Cleaver, who preached about racial justice as a Methodist minister and has worked for decades for federally funded projects in 18th and Vine. Boonville's decades-long project is a trail favored by cycling enthusiasts.

But their differences are deeper and extend to issues such as health care, education and gun rights.

A union representing federal prison workers is suing the Bureau of Prisons after the agency said it was canceling its collective bargaining agreement.

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in Connecticut federal court, seeks an injunction to block what the Council of Prison Locals union called an “arbitrary and capricious” move that has jeopardized the livelihoods of the agency's nearly 35,000 employees.

Bureau of Prisons Director William K. Marshall III announced the termination for the collective bargaining agreement Sept. 25, citing President Trump's executive order in March that exempts certain federal agencies from collective bargaining or recognizing employee labor unions.

Marshall said the union had become “an obstacle to progress instead of a partner in it.”

The union, in its lawsuit, contends the Bureau of Prisons failed to provide “any reasoned explanation” for its decision, as required under federal law.

The Swiss government says it's reached a deal with the United States to reduce U.S. tariffs on the rich Alpine country to 15% from 39%, which had been the steepest Trump administration tariff level faced by a developed Western country.

The Swiss Federal Council, the country's seven-member executive branch, said “Thank you President Trump for the constructive engagement” in a post on its X account.

Steve Sadow said he's confident that “fair and impartial review” will lead to a dismissal of the case against Trump.

“This politically charged prosecution has to come to an end,” he said in an email.

The president kicked off his Friday with posts on social media complaining about Democratic lawmakers focusing on thousands of documents from Epstein's estate released this week by the House Oversight Committee.

Trump called it a “hoax” and a distraction from Democrats' policies and the “EMBARASSMENT” of the government shutdown and decried “Weak Republicans” who “have fallen into their clutches because they are soft and foolish.” Trump seemed to be referring to the House Republican who are joining Democrats in a push to release files related to the sex trafficking investigation into Epstein.

Trump said Epstein is “not the Republican's problem” and “don't waste your time with Trump. I have a Country to run!”

“While it would have been simple to allow Judge McAfee's deadline to lapse or to inform the Court that no conflict prosecutor could be secured — thereby allowing the case to be dismissed for want of prosecution — I did not believe that to be the right course of action,” Pete Skandalakis wrote in a statement. “The public has a legitimate interest in the outcome of this case. Accordingly, it is important that someone make an informed and transparent determination about how best to proceed.”

That included those charged in Georgia. But that doesn't affect state charges.

The leader of a nonpartisan organization announced he will take over the Georgia election interference case against President Trump and others after Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis was removed from the case.

The Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia was tasked with finding someone to lead the case after Willis was disqualified over an “appearance of impropriety” created by a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she'd chosen to lead it. The organization's executive director, Pete Skandalakis, said Friday that he would take the case on himself.

While it's unlikely that any action against Trump could proceed while he's the sitting president, there are 14 other people still facing charges in the case, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former New York mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani.

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on CNBC on Friday that the White House plans to post details of the deal online Friday.

Greer said the agreement will see Switzerland move manufacturing of some pharmaceuticals, gold smelting and railway equipment to the United States.

Antifa-Ost — a German network suspected in attacks on people it perceived as fascists — was among four European left-wing groups designated as terrorist organizations by the Trump administration Thursday.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Josef Hinterseher said at a regular news conference in Berlin that his ministry has “taken note” of the designation. Asked whether the German government was contacted beforehand, he replied that “the U.S. decided independently on this.”

Interior Ministry spokesperson Sarah Frühauf said “we don't evaluate the decisions and assessments of other states, so I also have no assessment of whether we consider this proportionate or disproportionate.”

Trump does not have any pubic events on his schedule for today, but this evening he will travel to Mar-a-Lago.

Trump's administration on Thursday designated four European left-wing groups as terrorist organizations, following through on his vow to crack down on leftists after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

The networks targeted by Trump's administration all appear to be based in Europe, with no operations in the U.S. They are an Italian anarchist front that sent explosive packages to the then-president of the European Commission in 2003, two Greek networks believed to have planted bombs outside riot police and labor department buildings in Athens, and an anti-fascist group whose members were prosecuted by German authorities for a hammer attack against neo-Nazis in Dresden.

Europe has a long history of left-wing political violence, while in the United States political violence has been more likely to come from the right in recent decades, according to multiple studies, including by the Justice Department. However, there's been an uptick in American political attacks across ideologies in recent years, culminating in the September fatal shooting of Kirk by a gunman who prosecutors contend was driven by hostility toward Kirk's stance against transgenderism and other positions.

The frameworks are about increasing the ability of U.S. firms to sell industrial and agricultural products in these countries, according to a senior administration official who insisted on anonymity as a condition for briefing reporters on a call about the agreements.

The White House also released statements on the frameworks, which have yet to be finalized and are expected to be signed within roughly two weeks. It's all part of a broader effort by President Donald Trump to rewrite the rules of global commerce through the use of broad tariffs.

President Javier Milei of Argentina hailed his country's first bilateral trade framework with the U.S. in nearly a decade as “tremendous news.”

“As you can see, we are strongly committed to making Argentina great again,” he said.

Epstein emailed current and former political figures on all sides, sending news clips and discussing strategy or gossip often in short, choppy emails laden with spelling and grammatical errors.

In several emails in 2018, Epstein advised Bannon on his political tour of Europe that year after Bannon forwarded Epstein a news clip that the German media underestimated Bannon and that he was “As Dangerous as Ever.”

Ruemmler sent a message to Epstein calling Trump “so gross.” A portion of that message was redacted, but Epstein replied, “worse in real life and upclose.”

Trump and Epstein were friends for years but at some point had a falling out, even before underage girls started to come forward to accuse Epstein of sexual abuse.

Journalists sometimes reached out to Epstein, perhaps hoping he might have dirt to spill on Trump. One of those writers was Michael Wolff, who has written extensively about Trump. In a 2019 email to Wolff, Epstein mentioned that one of his best-known accusers, Virginia Giuffre, had worked at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.

“She was the one who accused Prince Andrew,” Epstein wrote.

Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year, had said that Epstein's longtime companion Ghislaine Maxwell recruited her from Mar-a-Lago to give sexualized massages to Epstein. And Trump had long claimed that he banned Epstein from coming to Mar-a-Lago.

Epstein said in an email to Wolff that Trump hadn't asked him to resign from the club, because he hadn't been a member.

“Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,” Epstein added.

            Top energy and nuclear officials in the Trump administration are planning to meet with the White House and National Security Council in the coming days to dissuade President Donald Trump from resuming testing of the nation's nuclear weapons, sources told CNN.
    


            Energy Secretary Chris Wright, National Nuclear Security Administration leader Brandon M. Williams and officials from the US National Laboratories are planning to inform the White House that they do not think blowing up weapons for nuclear warhead testing, as Trump suggested last month, is tenable, two sources familiar with the matter said. They asked not to be named to discuss a sensitive matter.
    


            It's the latest sign of fallout from Trump's October social media post instructing the Department of Defense to start testing nuclear weapons “because of other countries testing programs.”
    


            But NNSA, which falls under the Department of Energy, is the federal agency responsible for building and testing bombs and maintaining the nuclear stockpile, not the Defense Department.
    


            A White House official reiterated on Thursday that “because of other countries' testing programs, President Trump has instructed the Department of War and Department of Energy to test our nuclear weapons on an equal basis.”
    


            “Nothing has been eliminated from consideration as all decision-making authority lies with the President,” the White House official added.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Department of Energy.
    


            Today, the US tests every part of its nuclear weapons systems except for the explosive nuclear material in warheads. The last full-scale nuclear weapons test was done in the US in 1992, and the practice was banned by former President Bill Clinton in 1996.
    


            Trump's recent suggestion the US could resume nuclear testing comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin boasted in October that Moscow had successfully tested a Poseidon nuclear-powered torpedo.
    


            “The reason I'm saying — testing is because Russia announced that they were gonna be doing a test,” Trump told “60 Minutes” recently. “If you notice, North Korea's testing constantly. Other countries are testing,” he said, adding: “I don't wanna be the only country that doesn't test.”
    


            At the upcoming White House meeting, NNSA and DOE officials will be prepared to tell the administration that “there's not going to be any testing” involving exploding nuclear materials and will seek to steer the White House into a workable plan that doesn't involve blowing anything up, one source said.
    


            The source said officials hoped it would give the president the opportunity to align himself with NNSA's approach.
    


            However, Trump has the authority to order the tests anyway if he doesn't agree with the nuclear experts.
    


            An NNSA spokesperson declined to comment. “NNSA does not comment on ongoing or potential private meetings with the White House, especially regarding matters of nuclear security,” NNSA spokesperson Mariza Smajlaj told CNN in a statement.
    


            Mere minutes before he was due to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in Korea last month, Trump took to Truth Social to say that he had directed the “Department of War” to “start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.”
    


            Inside the NNSA, Trump's initial October suggestion was met with confusion, the sources said.
    


            “Nobody saw this coming,” one of them said.
    


            Wright, Trump's energy secretary, told Fox News earlier this month that US nuclear tests are “system tests” and “not nuclear explosions.”
    


            A senior White House official, when pressed this week on what exactly the president meant by his initial comments, told CNN that Trump was being “purposefully vague” in his calls to resume nuclear testing.
    


            The official argued the president became fixated on the idea while on his trip to Asia, telling CNN that some foreign leaders brought the issue up to Trump directly while he was abroad. 



            Another administration official argued that they viewed the president's comments as wanting to do more testing on nuclear-capable missiles, rather than detonating nuclear bombs.
    


            So far, Trump's comments haven't changed agency policy: No plans are underway for exploding nuclear weapons for testing purposes. One source told CNN that no one in the administration has explained to those in the agency what exactly Trump meant by his comments.
    


            NNSA officials recently prepared a memo for Wright and Williams outlining all the things the agency does to make sure its weapons are up to speed, including supercomputer bomb simulations and test flights of non-explosive warheads, the sources told CNN.
    


            That memo also lays out what the timeline would be if the administration directed NNSA to go back to nuclear testing like Trump had suggested. One source said it would take 36 months of underground testing at a minimum to obtain scientifically useful data, but that timeline could get much longer if the federal government were sued by environmental or other groups to delay or stop the testing.
    


            “If they wanted to just make the ground shake, you could probably do that sooner, but there wouldn't be a purpose to the test beyond political signaling,” the source said.
    


            If the US returned to nuclear testing, it would be done in Nevada – at the only underground site designed to explode nuclear weapons. That space sits on federal land in a vast desert, but the state government would also need to sign off on the testing – another thorny issue.
    


            “There's a big resistance from states about dealing with nuclear materials like we used to,” the source said.
    


            There is also the matter of legacy cleanup of nuclear waste due to decades of nuclear testing in Nevada. Testing has had devastating health impacts on nearby downwind communities, from radiation exposure to illnesses like cancer.
    


            There is no need for weapons testing, as the US still has a lot of “really good data” from Cold War-era nuclear testing, one of the sources said.
    


            There are concerns that if the US resumed testing, China could also use it as an excuse to perform nuclear tests — something it says it is not currently doing — raising the geopolitical temperature across the globe.
    


            Neither Beijing nor Moscow have tested a nuclear warhead in many decades, according to experts.
    


            In response to questions about whether the Trump administration has more intelligence on Russia and China's nuclear activities than what is publicly known, a person who worked in the West Wing during Trump's first term, including on national security issues, told CNN: “It would be hard for either country to blow up nuclear warheads underground and keep that quiet. That's not happening.”

Zack Cozart, a 2017 National League All-Star, is holding strong regarding his stance on minors receiving sex changes.

The former Cincinnati Reds shortstop claimed in a post on social media Friday that he has "been told [his] reputation is ‘tarnished'" for his conservative views and thinking minors should not be able to "change their sex."

"Let me be clear . . . if those things are true [because] I don't think a child should be allowed to change their sex, then so be it…" Cozart proclaimed. "[You] turn 18, do whatever [you] want, but when [you] can't get a tattoo until 18, I'm prob on the right side of the argument saying [you] shouldn't be able to change [your] sex under 18."

Cozart has also voiced his opinion on transgender athletes in girls' and women's sports.

"Imagine being against this lol," Cozart posted on X in July 2024 in response to a post that quoted President Donald Trump as saying, "We will not have men playing in women's sports. That will end immediately."

Earlier this week, he appeared to post sarcastically about the Olympics' reported decision to bar transgender athletes from female events after finding evidence of advantages for biological males.

"Wow they just now found it?" he wrote. 

Cozart did say he would no longer support Trump if the United States went to war back in June, but he reversed course after a cease-fire was announced at the time.

"I'll gladly eat my words for what has transpired today… lesson learned to trust the man," he wrote on X.

Thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee offer a new glimpse into what Jeffery Epstein's relationships with business executives, reporters, academics and political players looked like over a decade.

They start with messages he sent and received around the time he finished serving his Florida sentence in 2009 and continue until the months before his arrest on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019.

During that time, Epstein's network was eclectic, spanning the globe and political affiliations: from the liberal academic Noam Chomsky to Steve Bannon, the longtime ally of President Donald Trump.

The emails don't implicate his contacts in those alleged crimes. They instead paint a picture of Epstein's influence and connections over the years he was a registered sex offender.

Here's the latest:

Democratic members of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure asked federal officials for an explanation of the decision to cut up to 10% of flights at 40 major airports during the shutdown, along with details on staffing levels and how airports were chosen.

“It appears that the administration made this decision without adequate coordination with key aviation stakeholders,” said Friday's letter to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford, .

The group requested a briefing and written response by Nov. 20.

The FAA on Wednesday froze reductions at 6%, shortly before a deal was reached to end the shutdown. Requests for comment were sent to the department and FAA.

The president is planning to attend the World Economic Forum's meeting in Switzerland in January, according to a senior White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity to share plans that were not yet publicly announced.

The annual meeting in the Swiss Alps draws world leaders, business executives, celebrities and, sometimes, U.S. presidents. Trump attended in his first term in 2018 and 2020.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement is working with state and local law enforcement agencies to carry out welfare checks on roughly 450,000 migrant children.

They said the program kicked off Nov. 10 in Florida.

The administration launched a similar effort earlier  this year, but this one includes state and local law enforcement agencies authorized to work with ICE.

Migrant children traveling alone initially stay in government shelters before being released to sponsors.

Under the Biden administration, officials tried to release children to eligible sponsors within 30 days, reuniting many families quickly.

But there were problems, including some children released to adults who forced them to work illegally.

Migrant advocates are suspicious that the Trump administration's efforts could end up being a way to deport sponsors or children.

The effects of the rush to redraw U.S. political maps ahead of next year's midterm elections can be seen in the contrasts between two very different places now in the same Missouri congressional district.

The 18th and Vine area in Kansas City is predominately Black, once known for jazz joints and the meeting that created professional baseball's National Negro League when the established major leagues barred Black players. Boonville is a small, mostly white town set in an area teeming with cattle and row crops.

People in both areas worry about being ignored in the new district.

The incumbent is Democrat Emanuel Cleaver, who preached about racial justice as a Methodist minister and has worked for decades for federally funded projects in 18th and Vine. Boonville's decades-long project is a trail favored by cycling enthusiasts.

But their differences are deeper and extend to issues such as health care, education and gun rights.

A union representing federal prison workers is suing the Bureau of Prisons after the agency said it was canceling its collective bargaining agreement.

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in Connecticut federal court, seeks an injunction to block what the Council of Prison Locals union called an “arbitrary and capricious” move that has jeopardized the livelihoods of the agency's nearly 35,000 employees.

Bureau of Prisons Director William K. Marshall III announced the termination for the collective bargaining agreement Sept. 25, citing President Trump's executive order in March that exempts certain federal agencies from collective bargaining or recognizing employee labor unions.

Marshall said the union had become “an obstacle to progress instead of a partner in it.”

The union, in its lawsuit, contends the Bureau of Prisons failed to provide “any reasoned explanation” for its decision, as required under federal law.

The Swiss government says it's reached a deal with the United States to reduce U.S. tariffs on the rich Alpine country to 15% from 39%, which had been the steepest Trump administration tariff level faced by a developed Western country.

The Swiss Federal Council, the country's seven-member executive branch, said “Thank you President Trump for the constructive engagement” in a post on its X account.

Steve Sadow said he's confident that “fair and impartial review” will lead to a dismissal of the case against Trump.

“This politically charged prosecution has to come to an end,” he said in an email.

The president kicked off his Friday with posts on social media complaining about Democratic lawmakers focusing on thousands of documents from Epstein's estate released this week by the House Oversight Committee.

Trump called it a “hoax” and a distraction from Democrats' policies and the “EMBARASSMENT” of the government shutdown and decried “Weak Republicans” who “have fallen into their clutches because they are soft and foolish.” Trump seemed to be referring to the House Republican who are joining Democrats in a push to release files related to the sex trafficking investigation into Epstein.

Trump said Epstein is “not the Republican's problem” and “don't waste your time with Trump. I have a Country to run!”

“While it would have been simple to allow Judge McAfee's deadline to lapse or to inform the Court that no conflict prosecutor could be secured — thereby allowing the case to be dismissed for want of prosecution — I did not believe that to be the right course of action,” Pete Skandalakis wrote in a statement. “The public has a legitimate interest in the outcome of this case. Accordingly, it is important that someone make an informed and transparent determination about how best to proceed.”

That included those charged in Georgia. But that doesn't affect state charges.

The leader of a nonpartisan organization announced he will take over the Georgia election interference case against President Trump and others after Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis was removed from the case.

The Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia was tasked with finding someone to lead the case after Willis was disqualified over an “appearance of impropriety” created by a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she'd chosen to lead it. The organization's executive director, Pete Skandalakis, said Friday that he would take the case on himself.

While it's unlikely that any action against Trump could proceed while he's the sitting president, there are 14 other people still facing charges in the case, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former New York mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani.

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on CNBC on Friday that the White House plans to post details of the deal online Friday.

Greer said the agreement will see Switzerland move manufacturing of some pharmaceuticals, gold smelting and railway equipment to the United States.

Antifa-Ost — a German network suspected in attacks on people it perceived as fascists — was among four European left-wing groups designated as terrorist organizations by the Trump administration Thursday.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Josef Hinterseher said at a regular news conference in Berlin that his ministry has “taken note” of the designation. Asked whether the German government was contacted beforehand, he replied that “the U.S. decided independently on this.”

Interior Ministry spokesperson Sarah Frühauf said “we don't evaluate the decisions and assessments of other states, so I also have no assessment of whether we consider this proportionate or disproportionate.”

Trump does not have any pubic events on his schedule for today, but this evening he will travel to Mar-a-Lago.

Trump's administration on Thursday designated four European left-wing groups as terrorist organizations, following through on his vow to crack down on leftists after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

The networks targeted by Trump's administration all appear to be based in Europe, with no operations in the U.S. They are an Italian anarchist front that sent explosive packages to the then-president of the European Commission in 2003, two Greek networks believed to have planted bombs outside riot police and labor department buildings in Athens, and an anti-fascist group whose members were prosecuted by German authorities for a hammer attack against neo-Nazis in Dresden.

Europe has a long history of left-wing political violence, while in the United States political violence has been more likely to come from the right in recent decades, according to multiple studies, including by the Justice Department. However, there's been an uptick in American political attacks across ideologies in recent years, culminating in the September fatal shooting of Kirk by a gunman who prosecutors contend was driven by hostility toward Kirk's stance against transgenderism and other positions.

The frameworks are about increasing the ability of U.S. firms to sell industrial and agricultural products in these countries, according to a senior administration official who insisted on anonymity as a condition for briefing reporters on a call about the agreements.

The White House also released statements on the frameworks, which have yet to be finalized and are expected to be signed within roughly two weeks. It's all part of a broader effort by President Donald Trump to rewrite the rules of global commerce through the use of broad tariffs.

President Javier Milei of Argentina hailed his country's first bilateral trade framework with the U.S. in nearly a decade as “tremendous news.”

“As you can see, we are strongly committed to making Argentina great again,” he said.

Epstein emailed current and former political figures on all sides, sending news clips and discussing strategy or gossip often in short, choppy emails laden with spelling and grammatical errors.

In several emails in 2018, Epstein advised Bannon on his political tour of Europe that year after Bannon forwarded Epstein a news clip that the German media underestimated Bannon and that he was “As Dangerous as Ever.”

“luv it,” Epstein responded.

Epstein wrote that he'd just spoken to “one of the country leaders that we discussed” and that “we should lay out a strategy plan. . how much fun.”

Just a few months earlier, Epstein was insulting Trump — whose movement Bannon was a representative of — in emails to Kathryn Ruemmler, the former White House counsel under President Barack Obama.

Ruemmler sent a message to Epstein calling Trump “so gross.” A portion of that message was redacted, but Epstein replied, “worse in real life and upclose.”

Trump and Epstein were friends for years but at some point had a falling out, even before underage girls started to come forward to accuse Epstein of sexual abuse.

Journalists sometimes reached out to Epstein, perhaps hoping he might have dirt to spill on Trump. One of those writers was Michael Wolff, who has written extensively about Trump. In a 2019 email to Wolff, Epstein mentioned that one of his best-known accusers, Virginia Giuffre, had worked at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.

“She was the one who accused Prince Andrew,” Epstein wrote.

Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year, had said that Epstein's longtime companion Ghislaine Maxwell recruited her from Mar-a-Lago to give sexualized massages to Epstein. And Trump had long claimed that he banned Epstein from coming to Mar-a-Lago.

Epstein said in an email to Wolff that Trump hadn't asked him to resign from the club, because he hadn't been a member.

“Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,” Epstein added.

By the time Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, he had established an enormous network of wealthy and influential friends. Emails made public this week show the crime did little to diminish the desire of that network to stay connected to the billionaire financier.

Thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday offer a new glimpse into what Epstein's relationships with business executives, reporters, academics and political players looked like over a decade.

During that time, Epstein's network was eclectic, spanning the globe and political affiliations: from the liberal academic Noam Chomsky to Steve Bannon, the longtime ally of President Donald Trump.

Some reached out to support Epstein amid lawsuits and prosecutions, others sought introductions or advice on everything from dating to oil prices. One consulted him on how to respond to accusations of sexual harassment.

Epstein was charged with sex trafficking in 2019, and killed himself in jail a month later. Epstein's crimes, high-profile connections and jailhouse suicide have made the case a magnet for conspiracy theorists and online sleuths seeking proof of a cover-up.

            But here are some other top headlines from around the administration you might have missed. Click the links to read the full reporting.

            JPMorgan Chase ended its relationship with Jeffrey Epstein “years before his arrest on sex trafficking charges,” spokesperson Patricia Wexler said in a statement today, after President Donald Trump said he was asking the Justice Department to probe the bank's ties to the disgraced financier.
    


            JPMorgan paid $290 million in 2023 to settle a class action lawsuit filed by Epstein's survivors that alleged it turned a blind eye to unusual cash transactions that they claimed enabled Epstein's sex trafficking. JPMorgan also paid $75 million to settle with the US Virgin Islands. The bank did not admit or deny any wrongdoing in either settlement.
    


                    “The government had damning information about his crimes and failed to share it with us or other banks,” Wexler said. “We regret any association we had with the man, but did not help him commit his heinous acts.”
                





Earlier: Trump named several high-profile figures in his announcement about the DOJ probe today, including Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, “and many other people and institutions.”
    


            The president made this extraordinary move just days after Democrats released emails from the late Epstein that mention him.

            Food stamp recipients in Maryland will receive their full Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits beginning on Tuesday, the state Department of Human Services announced today.
    


            Maryland enrollees who were due their SNAP benefits received at least half their allotments this month, while the federal government's shutdown disrupted the issuance of the assistance. Distribution is normally staggered throughout the month.
    


            After saying it did not have the money to provide November's food stamp benefits, the US Department of Agriculture last week authorized states to make partial payments after a federal court ordered it to do so. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore announced that he would direct $62 million in state funds to support SNAP recipients, as well as $10 million in emergency food assistance.
    


            As of November 13, the state issued nearly $47 million in benefits to nearly 218,000 households to ensure they received at least half of their usual allotments.
    


            Residents who regularly receive their SNAP assistance before Tuesday will continue getting at least half their benefits, with all of these enrollees receiving the remainder of their allotments on that day. Those who are scheduled to receive their benefits on or after Tuesday will receive their full benefits.
    


            President Donald Trump said Friday he will ask Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's ties to many other high-profile figures, including some of his perceived political opponents, again blasting Democrats following the release earlier this week of emails from the late Epstein that mention him.
    


                    “Now that the Democrats are using the Epstein Hoax, involving Democrats, not Republicans, to try and deflect from their disastrous SHUTDOWN, and all of their other failures, I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
                





More context: The president has sought to dismiss questions over Epstein for months, pressuring Republicans to block a discharge petition in the US House forcing a vote on the release of the Justice Department's Epstein files — which the House speaker has said he'll schedule for next week.
    


            “This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats,” Trump wrote on Friday.
    


            CNN is reaching out to the Department of Justice and JP Morgan, as well as the people Trump named, about his comments.
    


            President Donald Trump lashed out at congressional Democrats — and some “weak Republicans” — Friday over the push to release the Jeffrey Epstein files, criticizing those Republicans as “soft and foolish” for backing the effort.
    


            “The Democrats are doing everything in their withering power to push the Epstein Hoax again, despite the DOJ releasing 50,000 pages of documents, in order to deflect from all of their bad policies and losses, especially the SHUTDOWN EMBARRASSMENT, where their party is in total disarray, and has no idea what to do,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
    


            “Some Weak Republicans have fallen into their clutches because they are soft and foolish,” Trump added.
    


            He went on the argue that Epstein is the Democrats' “problem,” not Republicans'.
    


            CNN has reported that House GOP leaders are bracing for a significant number of Republicans to support the bipartisan bill led by GOP Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna that would compel the Justice Department to release the Epstein files.
    


            The president has yet to respond on camera to this week's House Oversight Committee release of Epstein emails that mentioned Trump, not stopping to answer reporters' questions on Thursday during an event in the East Room.
    


            Jeffrey Epstein has been back in the news this week, and the rift between lawmakers and the Trump administration over releasing more information isn't going away any time soon.
    


            The House is expected to vote on a bill compelling the release of all of the Justice Department's Epstein case files next week – earlier than expected.
    


            So, here's what to know.
    


CNN's Annie Grayer, Ellis Kim, Alison Main, Manu Raju, Kristen Holmes and Sarah Ferris contributed reporting to this post.



            The sprawling 2023 racketeering indictment case against President Donald Trump and several allies for their efforts to overturn his 2020 electoral defeat in Georgia will continue and is now in the hands of a new prosecutor.
    


            The case was assigned in September to Peter Skandalakis, director of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia, a bipartisan collaboration of six district attorneys and three solicitors general from across the state.
    


            Skandalakis previously said he could also take the case himself if he could not find another prosecutor willing to take it on.
    


            “This morning, an Administrative Order appointing me to the case of State of Georgia v. Donald J. Trump, et al. was filed with the Clerk of the Superior Court of Fulton County,” Skandalakis wrote in a statement this morning.
    


Remember: Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis had launched the case, but was removed after a legal fight over her authority.
    


            Visitors will be able to go to many of the Smithsonian museums this weekend, after they were closed for more than a month due to the government shutdown.
    


            Here's when they are opening, according to the Smithsonian.
    


Friday:



Saturday:



By Monday:



            The Smithsonian previously said most museums, except for the museums of American History and Air and Space, would reopen Monday.
    


            In addition, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, which is not part of the Smithsonian Institution, will partially open today and fully open tomorrow.
    


            Republicans in Washington successfully defused the 43-day government shutdown without surrendering to Democrats' demands to spend billions more to offset spiking health insurance costs.
    


            Now, the GOP is under mounting pressure to figure out its own plan.
    


            Enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies are set to expire in just weeks  — which would more than double the cost of premiums nationally for tens of millions of Americans.
    


            And it's causing deep anxiety among some in the party, particularly in battleground seats, who worry Republicans will end up doing nothing to prevent those price hikes and enter a critical midterm year with the issue of health care haunting them once again.
    


            GOP leaders in the House have begun work on their own package, which is unlikely to extend those subsidies and instead will seek other ways to reduce costs, according to multiple people familiar with the discussions.
    


            But Republicans are not committing to doing anything on health care by December 31, when those subsidies expire and premiums are set to spike.

            People flying home for Thanksgiving will have one more thing to be thankful for this year: H.R. 5371, the funding bill President Donald Trump signed to end the longest shutdown in US history.
    


            The move is a step closer to normalcy for flyers after FAA-mandated cuts led to thousands of flight delays and cancellations at major airports across the country.
    


            But the disruptions aren't over. More than 600 US flights have been canceled as of early today and over 500 are delayed, according to FlightAware data. This is down from the nearly 1,000 flights canceled yesterday.
    


            The flight disruptions are primarily due to a combination of air traffic controller staffing issues and the mandated flight reductions — but also include unrelated flight cuts.
    


            Here is what we know about the plans to get more planes back up in the skies – and the uncertainty that remains.
    


            The past few weeks have been a wild ride for air travelers, who have seen flight cancellations and staffing shortages related to the US government shutdown, on top of the annual Thanksgiving crush still to come.
    


            Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said this week that he expects flight issues to be resolved before Thanksgiving travel ramps up.
    


            Still, we know this year, the thought of traveling may be even more stress inducing than usual given the recent disruptions. Did you change your holiday travel plans? Do you have a plan to get through possibly chaotic travel days? CNN wants to hear from you.
    


            More than a million federal employees went unpaid during the longest government shutdown in US history, while nearly 42 million Americans were left in limbo when the Department of Agriculture announced it could not distribute food stamps for November.
    


            Now that the government has reopened, agencies are working to get back to business as usual.
    


            Here's what we know about the post-shutdown timeline for various paychecks and benefits:

President Donald Trump said Friday he will ask Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's ties to many other high-profile figures, in an extraordinary step that comes just days after Democrats released emails from the late Epstein that mention him.
    


            Trump announced the directive in a Truth Social post that accused Democrats of trying to revive attention to his past ties with Epstein, contending they are “using the Epstein Hoax, involving Democrats, not Republicans, to try and deflect from their disastrous SHUTDOWN, and all of their other failures.”
    


            “I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,” Trump wrote.
    


            The move represents the president's most significant effort yet to discredit the push by Democrats and some Republicans to release all of the Epstein case files. And it serves as the latest example of Trump's belief that he can defuse the issue through sheer force of will, despite deepening fears among allies that his actions are only further amplifying it while damaging his own credibility.
    


            “Why doesn't he just release these? Just release them!” conservative podcast host Megyn Kelly said of the Epstein files during her show on Wednesday. “Now he's in a position of being, like, singled out as the only one, allegedly, as opposed to one of a slew of names.”
    


            Trump earlier this week tried and failed to convince Republicans to block a discharge petition in the US House forcing a vote on the release of the Justice Department's Epstein files, with the White House even holding a Situation Room meeting with one key GOP lawmaker who had signed on ahead of it receiving its decisive 218th signature.
    


            Officials during that meeting argued that the administration was not hiding anything, according to a senior White House official, including showing GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert unreleased documents obtained by the House Oversight Committee but they could not change her mind.
    


            The White House's approach to the Epstein case and its subsequent fallout has perplexed even some administration officials and Trump allies, some of whom have been telling him and his advisers to change strategy for months.
    


            In recent days, at least one ally on Capitol Hill directly told Trump that he was getting bad advice on his approach to the Epstein case by continuing to delay and downplay it, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            “These people have no idea what advice the president is getting,” another senior White House official said.
    


            The first senior White House official pushed back on the idea that the White House had been caught flat footed, noting that the administration, while aware of the emails, intentionally did not want to insert Epstein back into the news cycle. Asked about the message to the president from that congressional ally, a White House spokesperson reiterated that the emails released earlier this week “prove literally nothing” and pivoted to attacking Democrats for trying to use the Epstein “hoax” to distract from the shutdown.
    


            Multiple other sources told CNN that Trump himself has dictated the administration's response to Epstein-related developments, specifically opposing any actions that risk pushing the storyline forward.
    


            “Trump doesn't want his people to get ahead of it. Everybody has been instructed to wait until information comes out and then respond that it is a hoax or doesn't prove anything,” one of the sources said.
    


            In the House, Speaker Mike Johnson now plans to schedule a vote on releasing the Epstein files next week, in a strategic shift spurred by the realization that it could not be stopped. The vote is expected to attract significant support from rank-and-file GOP lawmakers.
    


            The president has declined to take questions from the press since the House Oversight Committee's release on Wednesday of emails Epstein wrote that mentioned Trump by name. Trump did not receive or send any of the messages, which largely predate his time as president, and he has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.
    


            But on Friday, Trump again vented his frustration over the state of affairs in a series of Truth Social posts, blasting Republicans backing the Epstein files release as “soft and foolish” and repeatedly branding the issue a “Hoax.”
    


            “This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats,” Trump wrote in one post.
    


            He announced his demand for a Justice Department investigation into “many other people and institutions” in a subsequent Truth Social post.
    


            In thousands of emails reviewed by CNN, Epstein corresponded with a wide group of powerful and influential people, including prominent Democrats.
    


            Among his most frequent communications were with former Obama White House chief counsel Kathryn Ruemmler, who represented Epstein as his attorney, and Summers, the former Clinton Treasury secretary and Obama National Economic Council director. (Corresponding with Epstein would not be a crime, and there's no evidence in the emails that any of them participated in Epstein's wrongdoing.)
    


            The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CNN has reached out to Clinton, Summers and Hoffman.
    


            In a statement, JPMorgan Chase spokesperson Patricia Wexler said the bank “ended our relationship with him years before his arrest on sex trafficking charges.”
    


            JPMorgan paid $290 million in 2023 to settle a class action lawsuit filed by Epstein's survivors that alleged it turned a blind eye to unusual cash transactions that they claimed enabled Epstein's sex trafficking. JPMorgan also paid $75 million to settle with the US Virgin Islands. The bank did not admit or deny any wrongdoing in either settlement.
    


            “The government had damning information about his crimes and failed to share it with us or other banks,” Wexler said. “We regret any association we had with the man, but did not help him commit his heinous acts.”

The longest government shutdown in history is over, but appropriators still have a long way to go to get nine of the 12 necessary funding bills over the finish line by Jan. 31, 2026.

The government reopened after 43 days, following the House's passage, mostly along party lines, with six Democrats voting in favor and two Republicans voting against, of a legislative package that extended funding until the end of January and included three appropriations bills.

However, with the new January deadline, appropriators are up against the clock, as both chambers must now agree on the nine remaining bills so they can be sent to President Donald Trump's desk before funding runs out once again.

Beginning Thursday, there are 57 weekdays until Jan. 31, but the House is only set to be in session for another 17 days, with the Senate in session for 20 days for the remainder of 2025. The House, in particular, is backlogged after being out of session for 54 days, already eyeing a stock trading bill and legislation to release the Jeffrey Epstein files.

As of now, the House has passed all 12 appropriations bills out of committee and passed the defense and energy bills on the floor, with defense gaining bipartisan support. The Senate, meanwhile, has passed eight of the 12 bills out of committee, but only the three in the minibus have made it to the floor.

House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole (R-OK) said the three-bill minibus and the January funding patch would “buy us time” to see how much “damage was done” during the shutdown.

“There's a lot of bipartisan things in them, but we need to sit down and go forward with the others,” Cole told reporters outside the Rules Committee hearing room on Tuesday night. “I still think that the biggest problem here all along has been Democratic leadership's decision to link this to Medicaid, which there's no way the Republicans are going to undo what they did in the big, beautiful bill.”

He had remained bullish that the appropriations process could move fast once the government reopened, telling the Washington Examiner last month he thought the remaining nine bills could be wrapped up by the end of December.

“Our numbers are a lot closer together than most people seem to realize,” Cole said Tuesday. “We know that those numbers, when we put them there, we're going to have to bargain up, because the Senate is going to spend more.”

Rep. Mike Simpson (R-ID), chairman of the interior subcommittee, told the Washington Examiner that he remains “optimistic” the appropriators can get back on track now that the government has reopened.

“I'm confident that under Speaker Johnson alongside House Leadership, and Chairman Cole, we will continue to restore regular order and pass the remaining appropriations bills,” Simpson said in a statement.

However, having a December CR was unlikely to garner any support from fiscal hawks such as those in the Freedom Caucus, whose considerable numbers could easily sink any bill, thanks to Speaker Mike Johnson's (R-LA) razor-thin majority. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins (R-ME) also would not hear of a December CR, instead favoring something that went into the new year.

Disagreements among the “four corners,” or the appropriations chairmen and ranking members in the House and Senate, that popped up during the shutdown fight signal more choppy waters ahead.

Only three of the four corners approved the minibus, after Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, refused to sign off on it.

“It is unfortunate Senate Republicans prematurely released partial text of the minibus without getting agreement from all corners,” DeLauro said. “While the military construction bill is better than the full-year CR, those programs were funded under for 2025. It is important to place it in the context of the entire legislative package that will be considered.”

DeLauro pointed to getting the rug pulled out from under her to reporters on Wednesday. She also claimed that the 54 days during which the House was out on recess could have been used for appropriators to work on bills.

“So my concern is that we're going to be here in the same situation on Jan. 30,” the ranking member said. “Because we've come to that, there really is a lack of trust. How do you believe people?”

The minibus only accounted for about 10% of the roughly $1.8 trillion it takes for Congress to fund various federal agencies. Under the Jan. 31 CR, all programs except those for veterans, food aid, farmer assistance, and legislative branch operations will remain funded at the Biden-era spending levels set by Congress in March 2024.

The remaining nine bills are expected to be even more complicated to pass, including the labor and health and human services appropriations bill, which is one of the most contentious and expensive.

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) acknowledged that there were more choppy waters ahead earlier this month after Trump signed the deal to end the shutdown.

“We've got to just find a resolution to get the lights back on,” Scalise said. “But the real negotiation is going to be: Can we get an agreement on how to properly fund the government with individual appropriations bills, packages of appropriations bills?”

The Senate is already eyeing a loophole to try to tie funding for the Pentagon and other agencies to House legislation sanctioning the International Criminal Court, as previously reported by the Washington Examiner.

By doing this, leadership could overcome a Senate rule that lets any one senator object to bundling two or more spending bills into a package known as a minibus. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) plans to put the Pentagon bill, as well as three other bills funding the departments of Labor, Transportation, Justice, and Health and Human Services, as soon as next Tuesday.

The strategy signals some lawmakers see the writing on the wall: that their troubles are far from over.

“We'll move as fast as we can so we're not waiting until the Jan. 30 deadline,” Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK), an adviser to Thune, told reporters Monday evening. “But you guys have been here long enough — we'll probably be having this conversation Jan. 28.”

Others are bullish that if they can move on to another minibus, they can avoid another shutdown come winter.

“If we do that, we'll have 87% of the government funded … so you really take away the risk of the shutdown, because you've got the work done,” Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND) said.

Other hiccups, such as the Trump administration's recessions requests and a last-minute Senate FBI provision tucked into the spending deal, are a cause for concern for Democratic appropriators that they will not be able to achieve a bipartisan negotiation.

“President Trump and Russ Vought's illegal stealing of funds from American communities has made it difficult to reach any appropriations agreement,” DeLauro said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “Those challenges are compounded by Senate Republicans' decision to secretly insert language into the Legislative Branch bill that would aid January 6th insurrectionists.”

“Democrats are ready to negotiate spending bills on a bipartisan basis that lower costs for families and protect Congress's constitutional power of the purse,” she added.

Johnson said he was “proud” of Congress being able to pass three appropriations bills through the minibus, but he was “really sad that it took us so long to get here.”

TRUMP RAGES AT DEMOCRATS AND THE FILIBUSTER IN SIGNING BILL TO END GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

“There was so much pain that had to be endured to get to this point,” Johnson told reporters during a victory lap after the House passed the spending deal to end the shutdown.

“So now that we've got the lights back on, we've got the government reopened … the Republicans will get right back to work that we promised the American people that we would do.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Unapproved peptide drugs have become a trendy new hack among wellness influencers, fitness coaches and celebrities, pitched as a way to build muscle, shed pounds and look younger.

Online stores will offer injectable vials for $300 to $600 each. Longevity and wellness clinics offer in-office evaluations and injections, sometimes with membership fees of thousands of dollars per month.

But many of the products have never been extensively studied in humans, raising concerns that they could cause allergic reactions, metabolic problems and other dangerous side effects.

Here's a closer look at the science, the hype and the potential risks surrounding the trend.

Within the human body, peptides are short chains of amino acids that perform essential functions. 

Insulin, for example, controls blood sugar levels and helps break down foods into energy. Likewise the popular weight loss drugs, GLP-1s — short for glucagon-like peptides — are based on a hormone found in the intestines that helps regulate blood sugar.

The Food and Drug Administration has approved both substances as drugs. But there are many more peptides that have never been approved by regulators as safe and effective, though some have shown interesting study results in rodents and other animals.

This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well.

Synthesized peptides are not new. Some doctors have prescribed them for decades off-label, or for unapproved uses, in patients with gastric ulcers, nervous system disorders and other conditions.

In recent years, peptides have become a focus for wellness gurus and other public figures with large online followings. That's driven interest in using obscure peptides for unsubstantiated uses like healing injuries, improving complexion and even extending life. Peptides in this group include an alphabet soup of injectable compounds, including BPC-157, thymosin alpha, GHK-Copper and many more. Some are banned by sports regulators as doping substances.




Experts who have studied the field are particularly concerned that some people are combining multiple peptides.

“These influencers are often advocating taking a stack of peptides each month, so it could be two, three, four different peptides,” said Dr. Eric Topol of Scripps Research Translational Institute. “This is really what I consider dangerous.”

Interest in the trend is being amplified by celebrities. 

Joe Rogan has repeatedly talked about using BPC-157 to recover from injuries. Jennifer Aniston has talked about using weekly peptide injections to improve her skin and currently serves as a paid spokesperson for a company selling peptide-enriched supplements.

“If any celebrity is using a peptide, and they're saying this is what worked for me, then of course it's going to be more mainstream and people are going to be looking into it,” said Kay Robins, a clinical nurse and operator of Pure Alchemy Wellness, a clinic outside of San Diego that sells peptide infusions and injections. 

Robins says she no longer offers BPC-157 and other peptides that have been targeted by the FDA.

Most of the unproven peptides promoted online are technically being sold illegally.

Any substance that is injected to produce a health benefit or prevent a medical condition is classified as a drug, which cannot be sold without FDA approval.

The agency considers many peptides to be biologics, the most complicated and potentially high-risk type of drugs, requiring extra precautions in their manufacture and storage. In recent years, the agency has added more than two dozen peptides to a list of substances that should not be produced by pharmacies due to safety risks.

Some companies market their peptides as dietary supplements, particularly those sold as pills, gummies or powders. 

While dietary supplements are less tightly regulated than drugs, the FDA still requires them to only contain ingredients found on a list of approved substances. Most peptides are not on that list and therefore are ineligible to be sold as supplements.

Experts generally agree that consuming peptides by mouth likely has little or no effect, since they will dissolve in the gut.

Most of the injectable peptides sold in the U.S. are produced by compounding pharmacies, which custom-mix medications that aren't available from drug manufacturers. Pharmacies are regulated at the state level and are generally not subject to the same scrutiny as companies overseen by FDA.

In recent years, compounding pharmacies have jumped into the market for blockbuster GLP-1 drugs. Under FDA regulations, compounding pharmacies can produce their own versions of a prescription drug when there's a shortage.

Earlier this year the FDA determined that the shortage of GLP-1s had ended, meaning compounders were expected to halt production. But many have continued making custom versions of the drugs — adding extra ingredients like vitamin B, which they say benefits patients.

“There had never been the monetary incentive to push the envelope of what is legally permissible with compounding before,” said Nathaniel Lacktman, a lawyer specializing in FDA-related issues. “The dollars weren't there.”

Some of the industry's new production capacity has gone into producing unapproved peptides, such as BPC-157.

The trend recently caught the attention of the FDA, which has added more than two dozen peptides to an interim list of substances that should not be compounded due to safety concerns.

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is among those who have touted the potential benefits of peptides. He has repeatedly vowed to end “FDA's war” on peptides, which have become popular among many followers of his Make America Healthy Again movement.

Some of Kennedy's friends and associates are also prominent marketers of peptides, including self-described “biohacker” Gary Brecka and functional medicine physician and author Dr. Mark Hyman.

Some in the peptide field expect Kennedy to roll back FDA's restrictions on the industry, which could include releasing a list of peptides that the agency will no longer try to keep off the market.

BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Luis Rubiales was pelted by eggs thrown by his own uncle when the former head of Spain's soccer federation was presenting a memoir late Thursday relating his downfall after kissing a player at the 2023 Women's World Cup.

Rubiales was seated on a stool on a low stage when he jumped up and spun quickly trying to avoid three eggs hurled his way. One impacted on the back of his dark jacket, and another splattered against a screen behind him as he charged into the small audience.

“A man entered who I later saw was my uncle, who is a troubled man, and always has been,” Rubiales told reporters. “He had some eggs and threw some at me, but I didn't know what he had in his hands, and when I first saw him I thought he might be carrying a weapon.”

Spanish media reported that the uncle was Luis Rubén Rubiales, an actor who has appeared in several domestic television shows.

Spanish police told The Associated Press they arrested the egg thrower. No motive was immediately given for the incident. A video shows a group of men in the audience grabbing the uncle immediately after he launched the eggs and escorting him away.

Rubiales also had a falling out with another uncle, Juan Rubiales, several years ago when Juan was working for him at the federation.

His book “Matar a Rubiales” (Killing Rubiales) is a 500-page version of his professional demise after kissing Spain forward Jenni Hermoso during the 2023 Women's World Cup awards ceremony. 




According to its publisher, Rubiales says he was the victim of a “conspiracy of different powers of Spanish public life” including the government and “the profitable world of feminism.”

Rubiales has always denied he kissed Hermoso without her consent. After initially clinging to power amid a national uproar, he stepped down under immense pressure from the government, soccer officials, women players and fans. 

Earlier this year he was found guilty of sexual assault for the unsolicited kiss by a Spanish court.

Rubiales, 48, is also under scrutiny by Spanish authorities probing his 2020 deal to move the Spanish Super Cup to Saudi Arabia.

As AI data centers use more electricity, the solar industry is ramping up to provide more power.

Texas startup Janta Power has secured $5.5 million in seed funding to expand its next-generation solar power towers, a vertical alternative to flat solar farms. The funding round was led by MaC Venture Capital with support from Collab Capital. The investment shows strong confidence in 3D solar systems that can reshape renewable energy worldwide.

Traditional solar panels cover large flat areas on rooftops or open fields. This approach uses a lot of land and misses much of the day's available sunlight. The sun moves across the sky, but flat panels capture energy best only when it is directly overhead.

Janta Power takes a different approach. The company's pivoting solar towers stack panels vertically to create a compact three-dimensional structure that captures more sunlight throughout the day. Think of it as the solar version of a skyscraper: more power from less ground space.

NEVER NEED AN EV CHARGING STATION AGAIN WITH THESE ROOFTOP SOLAR POWER PANELS

Each tower uses smart tracking software that follows the sun's path from sunrise to sunset. By adjusting its position throughout the day, the system collects more sunlight than traditional fixed panels. This design allows the towers to produce about 50% more energy while using only one-third of the land required by flat-panel systems.

Because of their vertical orientation, the towers can capture sunlight during early morning and late afternoon when flat arrays are least efficient. The result is a steadier flow of electricity across the entire day, reducing stress on power grids and lowering the need for short-term backup plants.

Janta's towers are also built for strength. Each structure can withstand winds up to 170 miles per hour. The towers feature durable steel frames and modular foundations that simplify installation in a wide range of environments.

Pilot programs are already operating at Munich International Airport, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and facilities managed by Aena, which oversees more than 70 airports worldwide. 

The company's 3D geometry gives each site a capacity factor of around 32%, compared to roughly 22% for flat panels. This greater efficiency lowers the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) to about $0.05 per kilowatt-hour, well below the global average of $0.15.

That advantage can make renewable power more accessible for industries such as data centers, universities and telecom operations that need reliable and consistent energy.

For businesses and communities, Janta Power's technology could mean smaller solar installations that deliver more energy for less money. Because the towers need less land, they can fit into urban areas, airports or industrial zones that could not host traditional solar farms.

For everyday consumers, these innovations can bring cleaner, more stable and more affordable power to local grids while supporting a greener energy future.

            As sports gambling accusations spread through Major League Baseball, the NBA and college basketball, the NCAA has one week to decide whether to adopt a proposed rule change that would allow college athletes and staff to bet on professional sports.
    


            The presumption from many in college athletics can be best summed up by one coach, who asked not to be named – “There's no way that happens, right?”
    


            And yet, to rescind the proposal that would OK betting on professional sports, two-thirds of the Division I member schools must submit paperwork by 5 p.m. ET on Friday, November 21.
    


            A source tells CNN that “as of right now, we are not meeting that threshold.''
    


             If the needed 241 (out of 361) D1 schools do not respond, the change will go into effect on November 22.
    


            For years, college athletes, coaches and staff members were prohibited from betting on any sport in which the NCAA crowns a champion. Horse racing, for example, was OK; baseball, football, basketball and hockey were not.
    


            But as sports betting becomes legal in more and more states and readily available to regular college students, the NCAA argued, that although it was not encouraging athletes to bet, prohibiting them from gambling on pro sports no longer made sense.
    


            Betting on college sports will remain a no-no.
    


            “This change recognizes the realities of today's sports environment without compromising our commitment to protecting the integrity of college competition or the well-being of student-athletes,'' Roberta Page, director of athletics at Slippery Rock and chair of the Division II Management Council, said in an NCAA statement.
    


            The change was initially meant to go into effect on November 1.
    


            A week earlier, the feds unsealed an indictment alleging two separate sports gambling schemes - one involving rigged poker games, the other point shaving - that included members of three New York crime families, two NBA players and an NBA head coach.
    


            The timing created immediate blowback at the NCAA's proposal.

            Southeastern Conference commissioner Greg Sankey wrote to NCAA president Charlie Baker, urging him to reconsider.
    


            “On behalf of our universities, I write to urge action by the NCAA Division I Board of Directors to rescind this change and reaffirm the Association's commitment to maintaining strong standards that keep college participants separated from sports wagering at every level,'' Sankey wrote in a letter obtained by ESPN.
    


            Three days later, the NCAA announced it was delaying its decision, but not because of public outrage. It was because less than 75 percent of the cabinet member votes were in favor of the change, prompting an automatic 30-day rescission process.
    


            It is worth noting that, of the 20 cabinet members who voted, and despite their commissioner's protests, the two representing the SEC - Jeremiah Donati, the athletic director at South Carolina, and Matt Boyer, the SEC's assistant commissioner for compliance - both voted in favor of the proposal per the NCAA committee's report.
    


            Of the eight people representing the four power conferences (each of whose votes is weighted: 2.75 versus 1), both ACC representatives voted against the initial proposal, the Big Ten and SEC voted in favor, and the Big 12 split its vote.
    


            In the three weeks since the NCAA implemented its rescission period, two MLB pitchers have been indicted for rigging games and six college basketball players from three separate schools have been permanently banned from NCAA competition for game fixing.
    


            On Thursday, the New Jersey Attorney General's office announced 14 people, including student athletes, were charged for running an illegal online sports betting scheme in conjunction with members of the Lucchese crime family.

Royal commentator Hilary Fordwich breaks down the royal family drama on Fox & Friends Weekend.

King Charles is reportedly weary and withdrawn as he marks his 77th birthday, burdened by the shadow of his disgraced brother's ongoing scandals.

Royal experts told Fox News Digital that the monarch will spend his birthday focused on duty — a hallmark of his reign. Yet behind palace walls, they say Charles remains deeply troubled by how ex-Prince Andrew's controversies continue to cast a long, painful cloud over both his family and the monarchy he leads.

Fox News Digital reached out to Buckingham Palace for comment.

"During Remembrance Sunday at the Cenotaph Parade, King Charles was particularly emotional, shedding a tear while standing in silence," British royals expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News Digital.

"He was withered and withdrawn, with one able to observe the toll the Andrew nightmare had taken on him. He appeared to be somewhat resolute. He is also known to be wanting to double down on duty, rather than anything verging on a shallow or frivolous celebration."

"While Andrew, of course, will always remain his brother, now that he's a private citizen, the king is likely to further publicly distance himself," Fordwich shared. "We won't be seeing Andrew at any birthday festivities. He's actually made it worse for himself due to his pride and pervasively privileged attitude, thinking he's still entitled."

Fordwich claimed that the former Duke of York, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, is "refusing to negotiate residence terms." She noted this has "merely served to widen the gulf between himself and the family at large." 

A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace previously told Fox News Digital they don't answer for Andrew as he's not a working royal.

"Charles is purportedly ‘fed up' with Andrew and, to the greatest extent possible, will be barring Andrew from any royal events," Fordwich added.

On Oct. 30, Buckingham Palace announced that Charles was removing his brother's titles and evicting him from his palatial Royal Lodge home over his relationship with late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Ongoing pressure has loomed over the palace to punish the 65-year-old over new revelations about his friendship with Epstein and renewed attention on sexual abuse allegations by one of Epstein's victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre. Her posthumous memoir was published last month.

Charles stripped Andrew of his princely title, one that he'd had since birth. But the scrutiny surrounding the late queen's favorite son is far from over.

On Tuesday, Democratic members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee made public tens of thousands of additional pages of documents from the estate of the late disgraced financier.

Emails included in the files referenced Andrew in connection with Giuffre, who accused him of sexually abusing her on three separate occasions in 2001 when she was a teenager after Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell trafficked her.

Andrew has consistently denied Giuffre's allegations and claimed he has no memory of meeting her. However, several emails included in the documents and obtained by The Telegraph and Sky News appeared to cast doubt on Andrew's denials, including statements that he made during a 2019 interview on BBC's "Newsnight."

In one email that Epstein sent to a journalist, he seemed to contradict a suggestion made by Andrew during the interview that a now-infamous photo showing the former prince with an underage Giuffre was fake.

The image, which allegedly showed Andrew with his arm around Giuffre's waist and Maxwell in the background, was first made public in February 2011 and became key to the controversy surrounding the royal.

In the newly released correspondence, which was sent in July 2011, Epstein appeared to confirm the image's authenticity and claimed "many" of his employees also took photos with Andrew.

"King Charles may be choking on his birthday cake as more allegations over Andrew are revealed," royal expert Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital.

"There is little more the king can do to further punish his erstwhile brother," he said.

"Andrew is sidelined. But the king wonders how he can preserve the monarchy from this latest twist, knowing that further recriminations may continue. Brotherly love between them is at an all-time low. Prince William is said to be demanding that all these revelations mean not showing any leniency towards Andrew."

In a 2015 federal lawsuit that Giuffre filed against Maxwell, she claimed that she met and was recruited by the socialite in the summer of 2000 when she was 16 and working as a spa attendant at President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.

In her book "Nobody's Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice," Giuffre — who died by suicide at the age of 41 earlier this year — provided further details about meeting Maxwell and how events unfolded afterward.

During his interview with the BBC, which was widely considered disastrous for the former prince, Andrew addressed the infamous image, saying, "I have absolutely no memory of that photograph ever being taken."

"Nobody can prove whether or not that photograph has been doctored, but I don't recollect that photograph ever being taken," Andrew continued.

"From the investigations that we've done, you can't prove whether or not that photograph is faked or not because it is a photograph of a photograph of a photograph," he added.

In another 2011 email obtained by The Telegraph from the newly released files, Andrew appeared to express distress over the mounting public and media scrutiny over his relationship with Epstein and Giuffre's allegations.

According to the outlet, a reporter from the Mail on Sunday emailed Epstein on March 4, 2011, to ask for comment on the relationship that he, Maxwell and Andrew had with Giuffre.

Per the outlet, Andrew appeared to reply directly to Maxwell after the email was forwarded to him, writing, "Hey there! What's all this? I don't know anything about this. You must SAY [sic] so please. This has NOTHING To do with me."

Fordwich noted that on his birthday, the king will be supported by his heir and beloved daughter-in-law as the royals navigate the media storm.

"Given the current fervor regarding Andrew, birthday celebrations for the king are likely to be subdued with a greater emphasis on service," said Fordwich. "They will demonstrate all the dedication to duty the monarchy stands for to ensure continuity."

"Prince William and Princess Catherine are stepping up, with her better health and his determination to move past his uncle," she said.

"They project stability and are focused on the future of the monarchy. They are intimately involved in succession planning, international engagements and global initiatives. Both of them are projecting a more reform-focused monarchy, only including a narrow inner circle with a far greater emphasis on accountability."

British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard told Fox News Digital that for Charles, the show must go on.

"The king's decision to keep his birthday celebrations low-key is a reflection of his philosophy that the monarchy should serve, rather than celebrate itself," she explained. "Instead of hosting a lavish reception, he will be engaging in official duties. A private celebration with Queen Camilla and a public cutting of a birthday cake will be on the menu."

"The relationship between Charles and Andrew is strained," said Chard. "The king's inner circle has also shrunk, with some now pushing for an even stronger stance against Andrew as he's still making headlines for all the wrong reasons."

"Andrew's downfall was brought on by his hubris. Despite these challenges, the king remains committed to his role."

            When Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested a woman at a Chicago day care this month, it sparked local uproar over ICE's tactics. But it also provided a window into the Trump administration's latest enforcement initiative — an intense effort to crack down on parents and guardians who paid for children to come across the border.
    


            The arrest of Diana Patricia Santillana Galeano, who after a vehicle stop fled into the childcare center where she taught, came weeks after her sons, ages 16 and 17, had crossed the US-Mexico border. They were transferred to a shelter in the Chicago area under the care of the Health and Human Services Department, which is responsible for migrant kids who crossed the southern border alone until they can be placed with a so-called sponsor, like a parent or relative, in the United States.
    


            But instead of leading to her being reunited with her kids, their arrival led to the government accusing Santillana Galeano of smuggling children.
    


            On Thursday, she was released following a judge's order. “We will continue to pursue her immigration claims to stay in the United States,” said Charlie Wysong, one of her attorneys.
    


            Senior Trump officials have focused for months on minors who crossed the US southern border alone under former President Joe Biden, when an unprecedented surge of kids overwhelmed federal resources. Recent moves involving multiple agencies, which have not been previously reported, signal the administration is doubling down on the targeting of those children — and their caretakers.
    


            So far, a pair of operations launched this year targeting parents, guardians or potential caretakers of migrant children have yielded nearly 3,000 arrests, according to federal data reviewed by CNN. A Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement to CNN that the arrests are “primarily the result of human smuggling investigations where an (unaccompanied child) was encountered as part of the smuggling incident.”
    


            White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller and other administration officials who favor the push see it as a relatively easy way to ramp up deportations of people who, unlike some migrants, can easily be located by the government, according to two people involved in the discussions. Trump officials believe it can also be portrayed effectively as a humanitarian effort, given the dangerous journey many migrant children make to the US.
    


            “Unless we put our foot down and say that we're not going to accept this as a nation, that we don't want kids smuggled across the border, it's going to continue unless there's a punishment for it,” a Health and Human Services official told CNN.
    


            As part of that concerted effort, ICE launched an initiative this week with state and local law enforcement leveraging standing agreements to fan out local authorities to conduct welfare checks on children, CNN exclusively learned. The UAC Safety Verification Initiative, as it's being called, began on Monday in Florida and will expand nationwide.
    


            Another operation, launched last month, builds on that by tasking Homeland Security agents with arresting sponsors if they are unlawfully present in the United States, used a smuggler, or have a criminal history, among other circumstances, according to two of the sources.
    


            Agents have been directed to see if they can levy charges, like smuggling if applicable, against those caretakers, leaving the children they're looking after in limbo or potentially placed back in US custody.
    


            “ICE HSI utilizes its federal authority/statutes to prosecute any individual and/or organization when a criminal offence has been committed to include but not limited to any violations of federal immigration law. We have been clear, anyone not legally authorized to be in this country is subject to removal,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
    


            The effort has dramatically reshaped the way the US addresses one of the most vulnerable immigrant populations, according to advocates who work with migrant children — and rapidly turned a tiny HHS office charged with caring for and uniting migrant kids with their guardians into yet another branch of President Donald Trump's sprawling mass deportation force.
    


            In a matter of months, the administration has mounted multiple additional hurdles for parents or guardians trying to retrieve the children from government custody, including the fact that the adults are at risk of being detained or arrested themselves in the process if they are undocumented. The administration is also setting up a call center, looking for leads on kids that the government can't locate.
    


            “It is putting so much pressure on the children, knowing their families are at risk in this way, and we've had children beg their sponsors not to go. They'll sacrifice themselves and stay in detention because they're too scared for their parent,” said Mickey Donovan-Kaloust, director of legal services at Immigrant Defenders Law Center.
    


            Though the volume increased during the Biden administration, unaccompanied migrant children have been arriving at the US southern border for years. Children are typically fleeing dangerous or deteriorating conditions in their origin country and reuniting with a parent or family member in the United States. It's a difficult trek — and one that often requires payment to a smuggler, as with anyone else crossing the border.
    


            “There's a lot that happens on the journey for these kids that has nothing to do with the family member here. … The ones that end up here have gone through the most and survived it somehow with or without the family's help,” said Marie Silver, managing attorney of the Immigrant Children's Protection Project at the National Immigrant Justice Center.
    


            The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which has been in place for more than two decades, provides protections for unaccompanied migrant children who arrive and reside in the US, including being screened to see if they are victims of human trafficking or have a credible fear of persecution in their home country.
    


            While an immigration judge determines if a child has protections in the US, case managers work to find a suitable sponsor, like a parent or relative, to care for them and therefore remove them from a detention setting. Many guardians of unaccompanied migrant children are undocumented.
    


            CNN previously reported Immigration and Customs Enforcement had taken hundreds of children into government custody this year following so-called welfare checks, either because their situations were deemed unsafe or because of immigration enforcement actions against sponsors, the majority of whom are the kids' parents or other family members. The administration also tried to abruptly remove hundreds of Guatemalan children who were in custody.
    


            New federal data reviewed by CNN provides more insight on who is being targeted. Homeland Security Investigations arrested more than 450 sponsors of unaccompanied children, according to internal federal data shared with CNN. The Department of Homeland Security told CNN many had committed crimes, though data shows that agents also detained caretakers without a criminal record who were in the country illegally.
    


            “Sponsors illegally in the United States are in violation of federal law, and as such, will be placed in removal proceedings. Parents always have the option to leave with their children,” the Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement.
    


            DHS provided a list of individuals accused of crimes who served as caretakers for unaccompanied children released to them, including a woman from Venezuela who sponsored three migrant children while in possession of fentanyl, a Honduran man who was arrested for alleged forced labor of two teenagers, and two men who DHS said “exploited” two kids by forcing them to work illegally.
    


            DHS has fanned out nationwide to conduct welfare checks of kids residing in the country and interviewing sponsors before children are released from custody. Under the Trump administration, DHS has had access to a trove of data housed at HHS identifying the whereabouts of migrant children in the United States.
    


            According to the HHS official, information sharing between HHS' Office of Refugee Resettlement and ICE is limited, though the various agencies work together in a war room set up at HHS to swap information relevant to ongoing operations.
    


            The intense scrutiny has sharply slowed the release of migrant children to sponsors; HHS data shows it handed just 118 kids over to guardians in the US in September, down from the more than 5,000 being released each month at the tail end of the Biden era. The average length stay for children in HHS' care has more than doubled over that same period.
    


            Advocates who work with children in custody told CNN that there's been an uptick in parents detained when completing new requirements despite passing all background checks and vetting.
    


            One child's father, who did not have a criminal history and passed vetting, was detained in Texas when presenting for his ID check, the last step in the process to retrieve his son from government custody. Now, both are detained, according to Alexa Sendukas, managing attorney of the Immigrant Children and Youth Program at the Galveston-Houston Immigrant Representation Project (GHIRP). In another case, a brother of an unaccompanied minor was arrested at his ID appointment.
    


            “They're languishing in detention for extended periods of time with no explanation. We had several cases that were approved and then remanded,” Sendukas said. “The kids are asking us, ‘Why can't I go home to my mom?' It's very sad. The detention fatigue is extremely palpable.”

ATLANTA (AP) — It was the worst summer in years. Sechita McNair's family took no vacations. Her younger boys didn't go to camp. Her van was repossessed, and her family nearly got evicted — again.

But she accomplished the one thing she wanted most. A few weeks before school started, McNair, an out-of-work film industry veteran barely getting by driving for Uber, signed a lease in the right Atlanta neighborhood so her eldest son could stay at his high school.

As she pulled up outside the school on the first day, Elias, 15, stepped onto the curb in his new basketball shoes and cargo pants. She inspected his face, noticed wax in his ears and grabbed a package of baby wipes from her rental car. She wasn't about to let her eldest, with his young Denzel Washington looks, go to school looking “gross.”

He grimaced and broke away.

“No kiss? No hugs?” she called out. 

Elias waved and kept walking. Just ahead of him, at least for the moment, sat something his mother had fought relentlessly for: a better education.

Last year, McNair and her three kids were evicted from their beloved apartment in the rapidly gentrifying Old Fourth Ward neighborhood of Atlanta. Like many evicted families, they went from living in a school district that spends more money on students to one that spends less.

Thanks to federal laws protecting homeless and evicted students, her kids were able to keep attending their Atlanta schools, even though the only housing available to them was in another county 40 minutes away. They also had the right to free transportation to those schools, but McNair says the district didn't tell her about that until the school year ended. Their eligibility to remain in those schools expired at the end of last school year.




Still wounded by the death of his father and multiple housing displacements, Elias failed two classes last year, his freshman year. Switching schools now, McNair fears, would jeopardize any chance he has of recovering his academic life. “I need this child to be stable,” she says.

With just one week before school started, McNair drove extra Uber hours, borrowed money, secured rental assistance and ignored concerns about the apartment to rent a three-bedroom in the Old Fourth Ward. At $2,200 a month, it was the only “semi-affordable” apartment in the rapidly gentrifying ward that would rent to a single mom with a fresh eviction on her record.

On Zillow, the second-floor apartment, built in 2005, looked like a middle-class dream with its granite countertops, crown molding and polished wood floors. But up close, the apartment looked abused and held secrets McNair was only beginning to uncover.

The first sign something was wrong came early. When she first toured the apartment, it felt rushed, like the agent didn't want her to look too closely. Then, even as they told her she was accepted, the landlord and real estate agent wouldn't send her a “welcome letter” laying out the agreement, the rent and deposit she would pay. It seemed like they didn't want to put anything in writing.

When the lease came, it was full of errors. She signed it anyway. “We're back in the neighborhood!” she said. Elias could return to Midtown High School.

But even in their triumph, no one in the family could relax. Too many things were uncertain. And it fell to McNair — and only McNair — to figure it out.

Midtown is a high school so coveted that school administrators investigate student residency throughout the year to keep out kids from other parts of Atlanta and beyond. For McNair, the day Elias returned to the high school was a momentous one. 

“Freedom!” McNair declared after Elias disappeared into the building. Without child care over the summer, McNair had struggled to find time to work enough to make ends meet. Now that the kids were back in class, McNair could spend school hours making money and resolving some of the unsettled issues with her new apartment.

McNair, the first person in her family to attend college, studied theater management. Her job rigging stage sets was lucrative until the writers' and actors' strike and other changes paralyzed the film industry in 2023. The scarcity of work on movie sets, combined with her tendency to take in family and non-family alike, wrecked her home economy.

The family was evicted last fall when McNair fell behind on rent because of funeral expenses for her foster daughter. The teen girl died from an epileptic seizure while McNair and everyone else slept. Elias found her body.

McNair attributes some of Elias's lack of motivation at school to personal trauma. His father died after a heart attack in 2023, on the sidelines of Elias's basketball practice.

On his first day back at school this August, Elias appeared excited but tentative. He watched as the seniors swanned into school wearing gold cardboard crowns, a Midtown back-to-school tradition, and scanned the sidewalk for anyone familiar. 

If Elias had his way, his mom would homeschool him. She's done it before. But now that he's a teenager, it's harder to get Elias to follow her instructions. As the only breadwinner supporting three kids and her disabled uncle, she has to work.

Elias hid from the crowds and called up a friend: “Where you at?” The friend, another sophomore, was still en route. Over the phone, they compared outfits, traded gossip about who got a new hairdo or transferred. When Elias's friend declared this would be the year he'd get a girlfriend, Elias laughed.

When it was time to go in, Elias drifted toward the door with his head down as other students flooded past.



Hours later, he emerged. Despite everything McNair had done to help it go well — securing the apartment, even spending hundreds of dollars on new clothes for him — Elias slumped into the backseat when she picked him up after class.

“School was so boring,” he said.

“What happened?” McNair asked.

“Nothing, bro. That was the problem,” Elias said. “I thought I was going to be happy when school started, since summer was so horrible.”

Of all of the classes he was taking — geometry, gym, French, world history, environmental science — only gym interested him. He wished he could take art classes, he said. Elias has acted in some commercials and television programs, but chose a science and math concentration, hoping to study finance someday.

After dinner at Chick-fil-A, the family visited the city library one block from their new apartment. While McNair spoke to the librarian, the boys explored the children's section. Malachi, 6, watched a YouTube video on a library computer while Derrick, 7, flipped through a book. Elias sat in a corner, sharing video gaming tips with a stranger he met online.

“Those people are learning Japanese,” said McNair, pointing to a group of adults sitting around a cluster of tables. “And this library lets you check out museum passes. This is why we have to be back in the city. Resources!”




McNair wants her children to go to well-resourced schools. Atlanta spends nearly $20,000 per student a year, $7,000 more than the district they moved to after the eviction. More money in schools means smaller classrooms and more psychologists, guidance counselors and other support.

But McNair, who grew up in New Jersey near New York City, also sees opportunities in the wider city of Atlanta. She wants to use its libraries, e-scooters, bike paths, hospitals, rental assistance agencies, Buy Nothing groups and food pantries.

“These are all resources that make it possible to raise a family when you don't have support,” she said. “Wouldn't anyone want that?”

On the way home, the little boys fall asleep in the back seat. Elias asks, “So, is homeschooling off the table?”

McNair doesn't hesitate. “Heck yeah. I'm not homeschooling you,” she says lightly. “Do you see how much of a financial bind I'm in?”'

McNair pulls into the driveway in Jonesboro, the suburb where the family landed after their eviction. Even though the family wants to live in Atlanta, their stuff is still here. It's a neighborhood of brick colonials and manicured lawns. She realizes it's the dream for some families, but not hers. “It's a support desert.”

As they get out of the car, Elias takes over as parent-in-charge. “Get all of your things,” he directs Malachi and Derrick, who scowl as Elias seems to relish bossing them around. “Pick up your car seats, your food, those markers. I don't want to see anything left behind.” Elias would be responsible for making the boys burritos, showering them and putting them to sleep.

McNair heads out to drive for Uber. That's what is necessary to pay $450 a week to rent the car and earn enough to pay her rent and bills.

But while McNair is out, she can't monitor Elias. And a few days after he starts school, Elias's all-night gaming habit has already drawn teachers' attention.

“I wanted to check in regarding Elias,” his geometry teacher writes during the first week of school. “He fell asleep multiple times during Geometry class this morning.”

Elias had told the teacher he went to bed around 4 a.m. the night before. “I understand that there may be various reasons for this, and I'd love to work together to support Elias so he can stay focused and successful in class.”

A few days later, McNair gets a similar email from his French teacher.

That night, McNair drives around Atlanta, trying to pick up enough Uber trips to keep her account active. But she can't stop thinking about the emails. “I should be home making sure Elias gets to bed on time,” she says, crying. “But I have to work. I'm the only one paying the bills.”

Ever since McNair rented the Atlanta apartment, her bills had doubled. She wasn't sure when she'd feel safe giving up the house she'd been renting in Clayton County, given the problems with the Atlanta apartment. For starters, she was not even sure it was safe to spend the night there.

A week after school started in August, McNair dropped by the apartment to check whether the landlords had made repairs. At the very least, she wanted more smoke detectors. 

She also wanted them to replace the door, which looked like someone had forced it open with a crowbar. She wanted a working fridge and oven. She wanted them to secure the back door to the adjoining empty apartment, which appeared to be open and made her wonder if there were pests or even people squatting there.

But on this day, her keys didn't work.

She called 911. Had her new landlords deliberately locked her out?

When the police showed up outside the olive-green, Craftsman-style fourplex, McNair scrolled through her phone to find a copy of her lease. Then McNair and the officer eyed a man walking up to the property. “The building was sold in a short sale two weeks ago,” he told McNair. The police officer directed the man to give the new keys to McNair. 

The next day, McNair started getting emails from an agent specializing in foreclosures, suggesting the new owners wanted McNair to leave. “The bank owns the property and now you are no longer a tenant of the previous owner,” she wrote. The new owner “might” offer relocation assistance if McNair agreed to leave.

McNair consulted attorneys, who reassured her: It might be uncomfortable, but she could stay. She needed to try to pay rent, even if the new owner didn't accept it.

So McNair messaged the agent, asking where she should send the rent, and requested the company make necessary repairs. Eventually, the real estate agent stopped responding. 



Finally, McNair moved her kids and a few items from the Jonesboro house to the Atlanta apartment. She didn't allow Elias to bring his video game console to Atlanta. He started going to bed around 11 p.m. most nights. But even as she solved that problem, others emerged.

It was at Midtown's back-to-school night in September that McNair learned Elias was behind in most of his classes. Some teachers said maybe Midtown wasn't the right school for Elias.

Perhaps they were right, McNair thought. She'd heard similar things before.

Elias also didn't want to go to school. He skipped one day, then another. McNair panicked. In Georgia, parents can be sent to jail for truancy when their kids miss five unexcused days. 

McNair started looking into a homeschooling program run by a mother she follows on Facebook. In the meantime, she emailed and called some Midtown staff for advice. She says she didn't get a response. Finally, seven weeks after the family's triumphant return to Midtown, McNair filed papers declaring her intention to homeschool Elias. 

It quickly proved challenging. Elias wouldn't do any schoolwork when he was home alone. And when the homeschooling group met twice a week, she discovered, they required parents to pick up their children afterward instead of allowing them to take public transit or e-scooters. That was untenable. 

Elias wanted to stay at home and offered to take care of McNair's uncle, who has dementia. “That was literally killing my soul the most,” said McNair. “That's not a child's job.”

Hell, no, she told him — you only get one chance at high school.

Then, one day, while she was loading the boys' clothes into the washing machine at the Atlanta apartment, she received a call from an unknown Atlanta number. It was the woman who heads Atlanta Public Schools' virtual program, telling her the roster was full.

McNair asked the woman for her opinion on Elias's situation. Maybe she should abandon the Atlanta apartment and enroll him in the Jonesboro high school.

Let me stop you right there, the woman said. Is your son an athlete? If he transfers too many times, it can affect his ability to play basketball. And he'd probably lose credits and take longer to graduate. He needs to be in school — preferably Midtown — studying for midterms, she said. You need to put on your “big mama drawers” and take him back, she told McNair.

The next day, Elias and his mother pulled up to Midtown. Outside the school, Elias asked if he had to go inside. Yes, she told him. This is your fault as much as it's mine.

Now, with Elias back in school every day, McNair can deliver food through Uber Eats without worrying about a police officer asking why her kid isn't in school. If only she had pushed harder, sooner, for help with Elias, she thought. “I should have just gone down to the school and sat in their offices until they talked to me.”

But it was easy for her to explain why she hadn't. “I was running around doing so many other things just so we have a place to live, or taking care of my uncle, that I didn't put enough of my energy there.”

She wishes she could pay more attention to Elias. But so many things are pulling at her. And as fall marches toward winter, her struggle continues. After failing to keep up with the Jonesboro rent, she's preparing to leave that house before the landlord sends people to haul her possessions to the curb.

As an Uber driver, she has picked up a few traumatized mothers with their children after they got evicted. She helped them load the few things they could fit into her van. As they drove off, onlookers scavenged the leftovers. 

She has promised herself she'd never let that happen to her kids.

            In the latest judicial blow to President Donald Trump's push to detain and deport undocumented immigrants en masse, a judge ruled Wednesday hundreds of people arrested in an Illinois immigration operation must be released.
    


            The detained people must be granted bond by the end of next week, the judge ruled, but big questions remain about how the process will play out – including locating those arrested, some of whom have been moved across the country, plaintiffs say.
    


            Here's what we know – and what we don't know – about what happens next.
    


            US District Judge Jeffrey Cummings, who was nominated by former US President Joe Biden in 2023, sided with attorneys from the National Immigrant Justice Center and the ACLU, who filed a lawsuit alleging federal agents violated a 2022 settlement agreement over warrantless arrests in the Chicago area.
    


            Last month, Cummings ruled agents violated the previously agreed upon consent decree.
    


            Under the decree, if ICE seeks to make a warrantless arrest, it must meet conditions like establishing probable cause that someone is in the country illegally, assessing their community ties and whether they could be a flight risk.
    


WLS: Judge orders release of hundreds arrested in Illinois immigration crackdown



            The plaintiffs alleged more than 3,000 people were arrested between June and October in “Operation Midway Blitz,” the federal government's immigration crackdown in Chicago and surrounding areas.
    


            The settlement remains in effect until February 2, 2026, and says if someone is arrested in a way “that violates the settlement in the Chicago Area of Responsibility — which includes in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Kansas, Kentucky, and Missouri — they may be able to seek individual remedies —including immediate release from detention.”
    


            Of the 3,000 people arrested between June and October, 615 – one-fifth – are not subject to mandatory detention and don't have final orders of removal, the ruling says. Those who remain detained out of that group, as long as they don't pose a high public safety risk, must be granted bond by noon on November 21, according to the ruling.
    


            But two challenges will remain: locating people and figuring out who and how their bond will get paid.
    


            “What's challenging is at this point, they've moved these people all over the country,” Fleming told CNN on Thursday. “Let's say we were able to post bond for a lot of these people and we were working on it with families, with other organizations … I'm not certain that the government is going to bring them back to Chicago and so they will drop them in the middle of nowhere where they've detained them.”

            The organization believes at least 1,100 of the 3,000 arrested individuals have voluntarily left the country, saying they “gave up” fighting their cases, Fleming said during a news conference Wednesday.
    


            “They are people who disproportionately had no interaction with the immigration or criminal justice system,” Fleming told CNN. “Who've lived in the community for years, have families, have businesses, you name it, who were stopped in the community, whether driving to work, picking up kids at school.”
    


            Government attorneys have requested a stay of Cummings' order until next Friday, according to Fleming; the legal pause could prevent the government from deporting or detaining someone until the court decides next steps.
    


            But immigration officials seem undeterred in their mission.
    


            “If (Pritzker is) pleased that he thinks operations are being ratcheted down, well, just the opposite is going to occur,” Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official leading Operation Midway Blitz, told Fox News on Thursday.
    


             “We're ratcheting operations up in Chicago,” he said.
    


            In response to the ruling, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the decision is putting the lives of Americans at risk.
    


            “At every turn, activist judges, sanctuary politicians, and violent rioters have actively tried to prevent our law enforcement officers from arresting and removing the worst of the worst,” McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN Wednesday. “Now an ACTIVIST JUDGE is putting the lives of Americans directly at risk by ordering 615 illegal aliens be released into the community.”
    


            The Trump administration filed a notice Thursday saying it will appeal the ruling and asked Cummings to put his order on hold while the appeal is heard. Cummings did not immediately rule on the request, instead asking the plaintiffs to respond by midday Monday.
    


            Meanwhile, Bovino left Chicago Thursday morning with his CBP agents and will head next to Charlotte, North Carolina, according to a source familiar with the planning.
    


            DHS declined to comment on his exact whereabouts, with McLaughlin saying Bovino “has multiple bounties on his head from Latin Kings and other cartels.” Bovino told Fox News later that day he was in West Virginia.
    


            Bovino and other federal agents have faced scrutiny, including from a federal judge, for alleged heavy-handed tactics and violent use of force against people getting arrested and protesters.
    


            “All of this, all of the tactics of Bovino, all of the tactics of (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) have been unlawful in the vast, vast majority of arrests,” Fleming said Wednesday.
    


            ICE will continue to carry out immigration enforcement operations in Chicago, McLaughlin previously told CNN, while other immigration legal challenges move through the courts.
    


            State advocates have alleged “inhumane” conditions at a federal immigration facility in a Chicago suburb, where protesters have been demonstrating for weeks, with some leading to arrests. Those protesters and news outlets are at the center of another legal battle as they claim federal agents violated their First Amendment rights by repeatedly using tear gas and other weapons on them.
    


            The state of Illinois and Chicago have also sued the Trump administration over its move to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago amid protests against the federal government's immigration enforcement campaign.

NEW YORK (AP) — Lawyers representing OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, branches of the Sackler family that own it, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others across the U.S. are expected to deliver a nearly unanimous message for a bankruptcy court judge Friday: Approve a plan to settle thousands of opioid-related lawsuits against the company.

If U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane abides, it will close a long chapter — and maybe the entire book — on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the U.S. since 1999, including deaths from heroin and illicit fentanyl.

Closing arguments were expected Friday in the third day of a hearing over a bankruptcy plan for the company, which filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars.

The saga has been emotional and full of contentious arguments between the many groups that took Purdue to court, often exposing a possible mismatch between the quest for justice and the practical role of bankruptcy court.

The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a previous deal because it said it was improper for Sackler family members to receive immunity from lawsuits over opioids. In the new arrangement, entities who don't opt into the settlement can sue them. Family members are collectively worth billions, but much of their assets are held in trusts in offshore accounts that would be hard to access through lawsuits.

This time, the government groups involved have reached an even fuller consensus and there's been mostly subdued opposition from individuals. Out of more than 54,000 personal injury victims who voted on whether the plan should be accepted. just 218 said no. A larger number of people who are part of that group didn't vote.




A handful of objectors spoke Thursday at the hearing, sometimes interrupting the judge. Some said that only the victims, not the states and other government entities, should receive the funds in the settlement. Others wanted the judge to find the members of the Sackler family criminally liable — something Lane said is beyond the scope of the bankruptcy court, but that the settlement doesn't bar prosecutors from pursuing.

A Florida woman whose husband struggled with addiction after being given OxyContin following an accident told the court that the deal isn't enough.

“The natural laws of karma suggest the Sacklers and Purdue Pharma should pay for what they have done,” Pamela Bartz Halaschak said via video.

A flood of lawsuits filed by government entities against Purdue and other drugmakers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains began about a decade ago.

Most of the major ones have already settled for a total of about $50 billion, with most of the money going to fight the opioid crisis.

The Purdue deal would rank among the largest of them. Members of the Sackler family would be required to pay up to $7 billion and give up ownership of the company. None have been on its board or received payments since 2018. Unlike a similar hearing four years ago, none were called to testify in this week's hearing.

The company would get a name change and new overseers who would dedicate future profits to battling the opioid crisis.

There are also some non-financial provisions. Certain members of the Sackler family would be required to give up involvement in companies that sell opioids in other countries.

Family members would also be barred from having their names added to institutions in exchange for charitable contributions. The name has already been removed from museums and universities.

And company documents, including many that would normally be subject to lawyer-client privilege, are to be made public.

Unlike the other major opioid settlements, individuals harmed by Purdue's products would be in line for some money as part of the settlement. About $850 million would be set aside for them, with more than $100 million of that amount carved out to help children born dealing with opioid withdrawal.

About 139,000 people have active claims for the money. Many of them, however, have not shown proof that they were prescribed Purdue's opioids and will receive nothing. Lawyers expect that those who had prescriptions for at least six months would receive about $16,000 each and those who had them more briefly would get around $8,000. Legal fees would reduce what people actually receive.

One woman who had a family member suffer from opioid addiction told the court by video Thursday that the settlement doesn't help people with substance use disorder.

“Tell me how you guys can sleep at night knowing people are going to get so little money they can't do anything with it,” asked Laureen Ferrante of Staten Island, New York.

Most of the money is to go to state and local governments to be used in their efforts to mitigate damage of the opioid epidemic. Overdose death numbers have been dropping in the past few years, a decline experts believe is partly due to the impact of settlement dollars.

By the time Jeffery Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, he had established an enormous network of wealthy and influential friends. Emails made public this week show the crime did little to diminish the desire of that network to stay connected to the billionaire financier.

Thousands of documents released by the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday offer a new glimpse into what Epstein's relationships with business executives, reporters, academics and political players looked like over a decade.

They start with messages he sent and received around the time he finished serving his Florida sentence in 2009 and continue until the months before his arrest on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019.

During that time, Epstein's network was eclectic, spanning the globe and political affiliations: from the liberal academic Noam Chomsky to Steve Bannon, the longtime ally of President Donald Trump.

Some reached out to support Epstein amid lawsuits and prosecutions, others sought introductions or advice on everything from dating to oil prices. One consulted him on how to respond to accusations of sexual harassment.

Epstein was charged with sex trafficking in 2019, and killed himself in jail a month later. Epstein's crimes, high-profile connections and jailhouse suicide have made the case a magnet for conspiracy theorists and online sleuths seeking proof of a cover-up. 

The emails do not implicate his contacts in those alleged crimes. They instead paint a picture of Epstein's influence and connections over the years he was a registered sex offender.

Epstein emailed current and former political figures on all sides, sending news clips and discussing strategy or gossip often in short, choppy emails laden with spelling and grammatical errors.

In several emails in 2018, Epstein advised Bannon on his political tour of Europe that year after Bannon forwarded Epstein a news clip that the German media underestimated Bannon and that he was “As Dangerous as Ever.”

“luv it,” Epstein responded. 

Epstein wrote that he'd just spoken to “one of the country leaders that we discussed” and that “we should lay out a strategy plan. . how much fun.” 

Several months later, Epstein sent some advice: “If you are going to play here , you'll have to spend time, europe by remote doesn't work.”

“its doable but time consuming,” Epstein continued in a follow-up email, “there are many leaders of countries we can organize for you to have one on ones.” 

Just a few months earlier, Epstein was insulting Trump — whose movement Bannon was a representative of — in emails to Kathryn Ruemmler, the former White House counsel under President Barack Obama. 

Ruemmler sent a message to Epstein calling Trump “so gross.” A portion of that message was redacted, but Epstein replied, “worse in real life and upclose.”

In other emails with Ruemmler, Epstein detailed a whirlwind of well known people he appears to have been meeting, hosting or speaking with that week, including an ambassador, tech giant, foreign business people, academics and a film director.

“you are a welcome guest at any,” he wrote.

Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokesperson for Goldman Sachs, where Ruemmler now works, declined to comment.

The financier emailed often with people in the upper echelons of wealth around the world, brokering introductions and chatting about politics and foreign affairs.

That included Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, who Epstein sent an email to in 2014 saying “that was fun , see you in 3 weeks.”

Four years later, Epstein asked if Thiel was enjoying Los Angeles, and, after Thiel said he couldn't complain, replied “Dec visit me Caribbean.” It's unclear if Thiel ever responded. 

In emails with Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, an Emirati businessman, Epstein complimented Bannon, saying in 2018 that “We have become friends you will like him.”

“Trump doesn't like him,” responded Sulayem.

A year earlier, Sulayem asked Epstein about an event where it appeared Trump would be in attendance, asking, “Do you think it will be possible to shake hand with trump.”

“Call to discuss,” Epstein wrote back. 

In January 2010, biotech venture capitalist Boris Nikolic was attending the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and Epstein emailed to ask, “any fun?” 

Nikolic replied that he had met “your friend” Bill Clinton, as well as then-French President Nicholas Sarkozy and “your other friend,” Prince Andrew, “as he has some questions re microsoft.”

But then Nikolic said he was getting sick of meetings. Later, he wrote Epstein that “it would be blast that you are here.” He mentioned flirting with a 22-year-old woman.

“It turns out she is with her husand. Did not have chance to check him out. But as we concluded, anything good is rented ;)” Nikolic wrote.

The theoretical physicist and cosmologist Laurence Krauss was among them. In 2017, Krauss reached out to Epstein via email for advice on responding to a reporter writing a story about allegations of sexual harassment against him.

“Is this a reasonable response? Should i even respond? Could use advice,” Krauss asked Epstein.

In an explicit exchange, Epstein asked Krauss if he'd had sex with the person in question and then suggested he should not reply to the journalist. 

“No. We didn't have sex. Decided it wasn't a good idea,” replied Krauss, who has previously denied all allegations of sexual harassment and assault.

In an August 2015 email exchange, Epstein told Chomsky, the famed linguist and social scientist, to only fly to Greece if he feels well, joking he previously had to send a plane for another “lefty friend” to see a doctor in New York.

In the same exchange, which dipped into academic arguments about warning signs on currency collapses, behavioral science models, and Big Data, Epstein offered his residences for Chomsky's use.

“you are of course welcome to use apt in new york with your new leisure time, or visit new Mexico again,” Epstein wrote. 

The emails also show that Epstein kept up a friendly relationship with Larry Summers, who was the treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and former Harvard University president, and bantered about the 2016 presidential race and Trump.

Other emails showed a closer relationship. In 2019, Summers was discussing interactions he had with a woman, writing to Epstein that “I said what are you up to. She said ‘I'm busy'. I said awfully coy u are.” 

Epstein replied, “you reacted well.. annoyed shows caring. , no whining showed strentgh.” 

Summers issued a statement saying he has “great regrets in my life.” 

“As I have said before, my association with Jeffrey Epstein was a major error of judgement,” the statement said.

Chomsky, Thiel, Bannon, Krauss and Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem did not immediately respond to requests for comment, which were sent through email addresses available on their own or their organization's websites.

Influencer Isabel Brown on findings that Gen Z prefers hybrid or in-office work to fully remote options in the post-COVID era.

Democratic National Committee employees were mercilessly mocked this week after news came out that staffers were very unhappy with a recent directive from DNC Chairman Ken Martin  end to remote work for employees who will now be required to show up to the office five days a week.

Leadership of the union representing DNC employees put out a statement following news of the new directive, describing it as "callous." Reports from those on the staff-wide call also described an immediate flurry of thumbs-down emojis and other signs of anger upon news of the new requirement.

"It was shocking to see the DNC chair disregard staff's valid concerns on today's team call," they wrote. "D.N.C. staff worked extremely hard to support historic wins for Democrats up and down the ballot last Tuesday, and this change feels especially callous considering the current economic conditions created by the Trump administration." Martin reportedly told employees that if they don't like the new policy, they should go find a job elsewhere. 

And Martin wasn't the only Democrat who had some harsh and pointed words for the Democratic Party staffers. Neera Tanden, former President Joe Biden's domestic policy advisor, had a similar message for DNC staffers, suggesting there were many eager folks waiting in line who would likely be more than willing to go into the office.

"If you think democracy is on the line – working in the office is not a big ask," Tanden wrote in a post on X. "And there are plenty of other people willing to step up. Get yourselves together people."

A left-wing group, the Center for New Liberalism, echoed the view that the staffers "should look elsewhere" if working from home is a "must-have."

"When you accept a job on a campaign, or with an org like the DNC, DCCC, etc, your single purpose is to win the election. It is a demanding job that requires long hours & sacrifices," the group wrote on X. "The other part of this is that I suspect [work from home] staff are probably losing opportunities for themselves by not being in the office. Campaigns require a lot of personal sacrifice, but the people who are good at their job and work to make themselves noticed in the office usually tend to go on to do big things!"

One Florida-based Democratic strategist, Steve Schale, who led Barack Obama's statewide efforts in Florida in 2008 and returned to help his campaign in 2012, said the DNC should implement a "requirement" to ensure those who want to work at the DNC really have what it takes.   

"There should be a requirement that to work at the DNC that you've done at least two cycles on an actual battleground campaign, where terms like flex hours & hybrid work don't exist," Schale wrote on X.

Meanwhile, Republicans did not spare the opportunity to slam Democratic Party staffers as well.  

"You can't make this up -- the DNC union is pissed that the Chairman is calling staff back into the office 5 days a week," former Trump White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said after learning of the anger. GOP strategist, Matt Gorman, quipped that the image of DNC staffers logging onto a Zoom call in their pajamas amid all the chaos of Biden's reelection "is hilarious."

"The best part is that they still get two full months before they actually have to get out of bed 5 days week," GOP National Press Secretary Kiersten Pels said. "Is this a political committee or a daycare?"

Martin reportedly told his employees that the work-from-home policy the DNC implemented during COVID was never meant to be permanent, describing it as a "Band-Aid" that has long needed to be ripped off. He did say that remote work would still be allowed on a case-by-case basis, however.

The staffer's union said it is considering all options in terms of challenging the measure. The group previously ratified a collective bargaining agreement with the DNC over the summer that "reaffirms its commitment to making hybrid work available," but also includes language that allows for a full return to in-person working as long as there is a 60-day notice period, according to the New York Times.     

Earlier this year, the Congressional Progressive Staff Association sent a letter to top House and Senate leaders proposing a rotating 32-hour work week for congressional staffers, arguing it would be a more "sustainable approach to work on a national level."

The proposal was widely mocked, however. 

"Why not be bold and ask for a 0-hour workweek?" quipped Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., at the time. "I wonder how blue-collar Americans would feel about white-collar workers demanding a 32-hour workweek."

Shohei Ohtani likes winning Most Valuable Player awards. He loves winning the World Series even more.

The two-way Japenese star did both for a second season in a row for the Los Angeles Dodgers, earning his fourth career MVP on Thursday night while unanimously earning the National League honor. He's just the second to win four MVPs after Barry Bonds with seven and the only player to win unanimously more than once.

Considering Ohtani is 31, overtaking Bonds doesn't seem out of the question. Especially if it leads to more Fall Classic opportunities.

“If I'm playing well as an individual that means I'm helping the team win, so in that sense, hopefully I can end up with a couple more MVPs,” Ohtani said through an interpreter. “But at the end of the day, it's all about winning games.”

In the American League, Aaron Judge became the New York Yankees' fourth three-time winner, edging Seattle's Cal Raleigh with 17 first-place votes to 13 for the switch-hitting catcher. The vote was the closest for an MVP since the Los Angeles Angels' Mike Trout topped Houston's Alex Bregman by 17-13 in 2019.

Judge, who won the AL award in 2022 and 2024, joined Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra and Mickey Mantle as three-time MVPs with the Yankees. The 33-year-old outfielder led the majors with a .331 batting average and 1.144 OPS while hitting 53 homers.

When asked about his place in MLB and Yankees lore, Judge acknowledged he's in rare company.




“It's tough for me to wrap my head around,” Judge said. “It's mind blowing from my side of things, because I play this game to win, I play this game for my teammates, my family, all the fans in New York.”

Later he added: “You've got to pinch yourself every single day. It's truly an incredible honor.”

Ohtani won a MVP for the third straight year, his second in the NL with the Dodgers after two in the AL with the Angels. He became the first to win in each league twice after getting the AL honor in 2021 and 2023. Ohtani signed with the crosstown Dodgers the following offseason and won NL MVP in 2024 during his first season in Chavez Ravine. He's also won the World Series in both his seasons with the Dodgers.

Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber finished second in the NL with 23 second-place votes and New York Mets outfielder Juan Soto was third with four.

Ohtani hit .282 and led the NL with a 1.014 OPS. He also had 55 homers, 102 RBIs and 20 stolen bases. 

The right-hander returned to pitching in June after missing 1 1/2 seasons on the mound because of an elbow injury. He struck out 62 batters over 47 innings, slowly increasing his workload while preparing for the postseason. 

Ohtani continued to shine in October with arguably the greatest single game in MLB history. He hit three homers while striking out 10 over six dominant innings on Oct. 17, leading the Dodgers over Milwaukee to finish an NL Championship Series sweep.

Schwarber, who earned a $50,000 bonus for finishing second, hit an NL-best 56 homers and led the big leagues with 132 RBIs for Philadelphia.

Soto overcame a slow start to the season to have his typically stellar offensive output. The four-time All-Star — who signed a $765 million, 15-year deal last December — had 43 homers, 105 RBIs and an NL-best 38 stolen bases. He received a $150,000 bonus for finishing third in the MVP voting.

Judge is the first AL player to win back-to-back MVPs since Detroit's Miguel Cabrera it in 2012 and 2013.

Raleigh, nicknamed “Big Dumper,” led the big leagues with 60 homers, the most for a player primarily a catcher. He started 119 games behind the plate and another 38 at designated hitter.

The 28-year-old also had a career-high 125 RBIs, leading the Mariners to one of their best seasons in franchise history. Judge said he got to know Raleigh a little during the All-Star break and the catcher asked for some leadership tips.

“Cal's a special player,” Judge said. “I could sit here and talk all night about the player he is, but really the kind of leader and person he is really stuck out to me at the All-Star Game.”

Cleveland's José Ramírez finished third in the AL. 

Arizona's Geraldo Perdomo was fourth in the NL voting, earning him $2.5 million annual salary increases in 2028 and 2029 along with the price of Arizona's 2030 club option.

The U.S. Coast Guard announced Thursday it detected a Russian military spy vessel operating near U.S. territorial waters Oct. 29, and personnel are continuing to monitor the ship.

Officials said the Vishnya-class intelligence ship was about 15 nautical miles south of Oahu, prompting a response by the Coast Guard HC-130 Hercules from Air Station Barbers Point and the Coast Guard Cutter William Hart.

The Coast Guard responded to the Russian Federation Navy Auxiliary General Intelligence ship, Kareliya, by conducting a safe and professional overflight and transiting near the vessel, according to a news release.

Acting in accordance with international law, the Coast Guard said personnel are monitoring the vessel's activities near U.S. territorial waters to provide maritime security for U.S. vessels operating in the area.

Coast guardsmen will also monitor the vessel to support U.S. homeland defense efforts.

"The U.S. Coast Guard routinely monitors maritime activity around the Hawaiian Islands and throughout the Pacific to ensure the safety and security of U.S. waters," Capt. Matthew Chong, chief of response for the Coast Guard Oceania District, wrote in a statement.

"Working in concert with partners and allies, our crews monitor and respond to foreign military vessel activity near our territorial waters to protect our maritime borders and defend our sovereign interests."

The Vishnya-class is a group of intelligence collection ships built for the Soviet Navy in the 1980s, according to the U.S. Army website. There are seven ships still in service with the Russian Navy. 

They are large, purpose-built vessels designed for signals intelligence gathering via an extensive array of sensors, according to the site. Data can be transmitted to shore via satellite link antennas.

While the ships are designed for intelligence gathering, they are armed with two AK-630 close-in weapon systems and SA-N-8 surface-to-air missile (SAM) launchers, for last resort self-defense, according to the Army.

Coast Guard Oceania District works in conjunction with U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and interagency partners to constantly monitor the activity of foreign military vessels operating near U.S. territorial waters to ensure homeland security and defense.

Under customary international law, foreign military vessels are permitted to transit and operate outside other nations' territorial seas, which extend up to 12 nautical miles from shore.

The Coast Guard did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Fox News correspondent Brooke Taylor reports on ICE's joint operation with Florida law enforcement targeting illegal sexual offenders and convicted murderers on ‘The Story'.

Locals in San Francisco, California, have begun passing out whistles to communicate and coordinate against ICE deportations.

Activists and organizations have started distributing whistles for local residents to coordinate against the federal government's immigration enforcement efforts, SFGate reported. 

"By following the same whistle code, locals can communicate from afar: Three short whistles signal that ICE is nearby, and one long whistle means that somebody is being detained," SFGate reported. 

Frameline, the nonprofit behind San Francisco's LGBTQ+ Frameline film festival, has been stocking "whistle stops" in the city, where people can pick up free whistles and join anti-ICE efforts. The organization explained in a post on Instagram that it was inspired by efforts in Chicago.

In an email to SFGATE, Roxie Theater manager Gabriella Siaton, whose venue is one of multiple participating whistle stops, said the theater's initial supply of whistles was gone within a day of arrival.

"Prior to this, I had not heard about the whistle code," she wrote. "I knew there were different sharings on social media regarding ICE agents being spotted in the Mission, but I appreciate how the whistle allows for a more instant and in-the-moment response."

This trend appears to have begun with Chicago's local anti-ICE efforts, where there are entire group meetups to assemble whistles to give out. 

"The sound of a whistle tells immigrants and other vulnerable community members to run away while also urging fellow neighbors to gather in a crowd and run toward the scene to film arrests," the California news outlet wrote.

Gavin Newsom held a redistricting press conference in Los Angeles, California, on Aug. 14. (Carlin Stiehl / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)

Similar efforts reportedly date back long before the immigration crackdowns of 2025, all the way back at least to the 1970s, where LGBTQ+ groups used whistles to alert people of alleged hate crimes in progress.

"We were inspired by the bold legacy of queer resistance — from San Francisco's Butterfly Brigade blowing whistles in the Castro to defend each other from violence to the community organizing coming out of Chicago now," Frameline's executive director Allegra Madsen told SFGate.

SEATTLE (AP) — First-term Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell conceded his reelection fight to progressive activist Katie Wilson on Thursday, handing another victory to leftist Democrats around the country frustrated with unaffordability, homelessness, public safety and the actions of President Donald Trump's administration.

Harrell, a centrist Democrat who previously served three terms on the City Council, led in early results. But Washington conducts all-mail elections, with ballots postmarked by Election Day. Later-arriving votes, which historically trend more liberal, broke heavily in Wilson's favor, adding to a progressive shift to the left nationally.

In a concession speech at City Hall on Thursday afternoon, Harrell said he had congratulated Wilson in a “delightful” call.

“I feel very good about the future of this country and this city still,” he said.

Wilson, 43, is a democratic socialist who has never held elected office. She told a news conference later Thursday that it was hard for her to believe she had been elected mayor, considering that at the beginning of this year she had no intention of running, and she acknowledged concerns about her lack of experience: “No one saw this coming.”

But she also spoke to the resonance of her volunteer-driven campaign among voters concerned about affordability and public safety in a city where the cost of living has soared as Amazon and other tech companies proliferated. Universal child care, better mass transit, better public safety and stable, affordable housing are among her priorities, and she said she would take office with a strong mandate to purse them, though she acknowledged the city also faces a significant budget shortfall.




Wilson called herself a coalition builder and community organizer, and said she would also work with those who questioned her qualifications to lead a city with more than 13,000 employees and a budget of nearly $9 billion: “This is your city too.” 

“When I say this is your city, that means you have a right to be here and to live a dignified life — whatever your background, whatever your income,” Wilson said. “But it also means that we all have a collective responsibility for this city and for each other. ... We cannot tackle the major challenges facing our city unless we do it together.”

She will be working with a relatively new City Council: Only two of the seven council members have served more than one term.

Harrell was elected mayor in 2021 following the chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic and racial justice protests over George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police. With crime falling, more police being hired, less visible drug use and many homeless encampments removed from city parks, the business-backed Harrell once seemed likely to cruise to reelection.

But Trump's return to office — and his efforts to send in federal agents or cut funding for blue cities — helped reawaken Seattle's progressive voters. The lesser-known Wilson, a democratic socialist, ran a campaign that echoed some of the themes of progressive mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani in New York. She trounced Harrell by nearly 10 percentage points in the August primary and quickly became favored to win the mayor's office.

Wilson studied at an Oxford University college in England but did not graduate. She founded the small nonprofit Transit Riders Union in 2011 and has led campaigns for better public transportation, higher minimum wages, stronger renter protections and more affordable housing. She herself is a renter, living in a one-bedroom apartment in the city's Capitol Hill neighborhood, and says that has shaped her understanding of Seattle's affordability crisis.

Wilson criticized Harrell as doing too little to provide more shelter and said his encampment sweeps have been cosmetic, merely pushing unhoused people around the city. Wilson also painted him as a City Hall fixture who bore responsibility for the status quo.

Harrell, 67, played on the Rose Bowl champion University of Washington football team in 1978 before going to law school. His father, who was Black, came to Seattle from the segregated Jim Crow South, and his mother, a Japanese American, was incarcerated at an internment camp in Minidoka, Idaho, during World War II after officials seized her family's Seattle flower shop — experiences that fostered his understanding of the importance of civil rights and inclusivity. 

Both candidates touted plans for affordable housing, combating crime and attempting to Trump-proof the city, which receives about $150 million a year in federal funding. Both want to protect Seattle's sanctuary city status. 

Wilson has proposed a city-level capital gains tax to help offset federal funding the city might lose and to pay for housing. Harrell says that idea is ineffective because a city capital gains tax could easily be avoided by those who would be required to pay it.

A flight carrying four federal lawmakers to Washington, D.C., was diverted to Kansas City after a passenger became disruptive and shouted about a ‘fascist state.' (@Adam_Burtner via X)

An American Airlines flight carrying four members of Arizona's congressional delegation to Washington, D.C., diverted Tuesday to Kansas City, Missouri, after a passenger became disruptive.

The airline told Fox News Digital that Flight 1218 left Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport Nov. 11, 2025, and was rerouted because of "a disruptive customer."

"On Nov. 11, American Airlines flight 1218, with service from Phoenix (PHX) to Washington, D.C. (DCA), diverted to Kansas City (MCI) due to a disruptive customer," American Airlines told Fox News Digital. "Law enforcement met the flight and removed the customer, and the flight later re-departed for DCA, where it landed normally.

"We thank our customers for their patience and our crew members for their professionalism."

WITH THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN THREATENING AIR TRAVEL, A GOP BILL SEEKS TO KEEP FLIGHTS RUNNING

Rep. Greg Stanton, a Democrat from Arizona, posted on X that he and three Republican colleagues — Reps. Eli Crane, Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar — were aboard when the incident occurred.

"Flying to DC rn to vote no on CR that fails to lower health care costs. @RepEliCrane, @RepAndyBiggsAZ & @RepGosar all on this flight. We're making emergency stop in Kansas City to remove disruptive passenger. None of my colleagues is the disruptor. Freedom Caucus losing its mojo," Stanton wrote.

Flight data shows the Airbus A320 had been airborne for roughly two hours and 40 minutes before diverting to Kansas City International Airport around 6:15 p.m. local time.

Video posted to X by another passenger shows Kansas City police officers boarding the plane to remove a woman who apologized as she was led away, saying, "We live in a fascist state."

The flight departed again about an hour later and landed at Reagan National Airport shortly after 10 p.m.

"On a serious note, thank you Kansas City police for handling the situation professionally and without incident," Stanton later wrote.

Stanton said he was headed to Washington to vote against the Republican continuing resolution to end the government shutdown, while his GOP colleagues supported the plan.

            Los Angeles Dodgers two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani is once again adding well-deserved hardware to his growing collection and further securing his reputation as a generational talent.
    


            The Japanese pitcher-slugger was again unanimously voted the National League's Most Valuable Player on Thursday, the second year in a row he has been named the league's best player. New York Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge took home honors in the American League for a second consecutive year.
    


            Ohtani, sitting next to his wife, Mamiko Tanaka, and their dog, Decoy, when his name was announced on MLB Network, gave a lil smooch to his pup to celebrate the occasion.

            The 31-year-old is now the first player in Major League Baseball history to win the award twice in both leagues. The five-time All-Star was named the AL MVP in 2021 and 2023 with the Los Angeles Angels before leaving for the cross-town Dodgers after signing a reported $700 million contract.
    


            Ohtani yet again proved why he is considered an all-time talent, leading the Dodgers to their second straight World Series win.
    


            The Japanese star hit 55 home runs, 102 RBI with a .282 batting average this season, highlighted by a magical postseason run that saw him hit three home runs on the way to the Fall Classic victory.
    


            Ohtani also made an impact on the mound for LA, making his return to pitching in June after an almost two-year layoff, following two procedures, including one to repair the right ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow and his left shoulder last offseason. In 14 starts, he went 1-1 with a 2.87 ERA and had 62 strikeouts.
    


Shohei Ohtani is having an October unlike any other. Tuesday night's game will be yet another for the history books



            The second-straight MVP award comes after posting a historic season last year in which he became the first player in MLB history to hit 50 home runs and steal 50 bases in a single campaign.

            Ohtani beat out award finalists New York Mets outfielder Juan Soto and Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber, getting all 30 votes to win unanimously.
    


            Ohtani gave a “shout out” to Soto and Schwarber for “bringing out the best” in him this season.
    


            “Biggest thing is winning the World Series,” Ohtani said via his translator on MLB Network. “That's first and foremost, it's icing on the cake to be able to get an individual award – being crowned MVP. But I just really want to appreciate the support from all my teammates, everybody around me, my supporting staff.”
    


            He joins Barry Bonds as the only player in MLB history to win four MVPs. Bonds, MLB's all-time home run leader, has won the award seven times.
    


            The 33-year-old Judge proved his value for the Bronx Bombers, hitting 53 home runs along with a .331 batting average, now winning the award for the second straight year and third time in his career.
    


            Standing at an opposing 6-foot-7, Judge became just the third player to hit at least 50 home runs and win a batting title in the same season, joining Yankees great Mickey Mantle and Jimmie Foxx.
    


            Judge called it “pretty wild” when asked about all the silverware he's won.

            “You try not to think about it during the season. I try to keep my head down through all 162,” Judge said with his family and two dogs beside him. “Just do whatever I can in today's game to help the team win. Do what you can, give it your all and you wake up the next day and do it again.”
    


            Judge beat out Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh and Cleveland Guardians third baseman Jose Ramirez with 17 first-place votes. Raleigh, affectionately known as the “Big Dumper,” came in second with 13 votes.
    


            The seven-time All-Star congratulated Raleigh and Ramirez for having “two incredible seasons.”
    


            “It's always fun playing against those two,” Judge said. “Especially when we play Seattle, the main objective is making sure Cal (Raleigh) doesn't beat you. He can beat you from both sides of the plate.”
    


            With the MVPs awarded, the league year is now complete, with the Winter Meetings scheduled to begin next week.
    


            On Wednesday, Detroit Tigers ace Tarik Skubal won his second straight AL Cy Young award, while Pittsburgh Pirates' 23-year-old phenom Paul Skenes was named the NL Cy Young winner.
    


            Earlier in the week, Athletics first baseman Nick Kurtz unanimously won the AL Rookie of the Year. Atlanta Braves catcher Drake Baldwin was named the NL Rookie of the Year.
    


            Milwaukee Brewers manager Pat Murphy was named the NL Manager of the Year and Guardians manager Stephen Vogt won AL Manager of the Year for the second consecutive year.

Witnesses say anti-Israel agitators violently stormed an event in Toronto, breaking glass and attacking attendees Nov. 5, 2025.

Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) Director Daniel Rogers, during a rare public appearance Thursday, said nearly one in 10 of the agency's terrorism investigations include at least one person under the age of 18, an alarming trend driven by online extremism.

Since 2014, there have been nearly two dozen violent extremist attacks in Canada resulting in 29 deaths and at least 60 injuries, according to Rogers.

Worryingly, he said, nearly one in ten terrorism investigations at CSIS, the country's domestic spy agency, include at least one "subject of investigation" under the age of 18.

In August, a minor was arrested in Montreal for allegedly planning an attack on behalf of the terrorist group Daesh, according to Rogers.

THE NEW MAFIA: TRUMP, CIVIL RICO AND THE GLOBAL INTIFADA

Just a few months earlier, a 15-year-old Edmonton-area minor was charged with a terrorism-related offense, after Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) investigators feared the teen would commit serious violence related to COM/764, a transnational violent online network that manipulates children and youth across widely accessible online platforms.

Rogers also noted two 15-year-olds were arrested in Ottawa for allegedly conspiring to conduct a mass casualty attack targeting the Jewish community in Canada's capital in late 2023 and early 2024.

"Clearly, radicalized youth can cause the same harms as radicalized adults, but the societal supports for youth may help us catch radicalization early and prevent it," Rogers said. "These tragic numbers would have been higher if not for disruptive actions taken by CSIS and our law enforcement partners."

The CSIS joined the RCMP and intelligence partners from the U.S., United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand in releasing a joint public report in December, highlighting the evolving issue of young people and violent extremism. 

The report provides advice to parents, guardians and others with information to help them identify early concerns and address youth radicalization before it's too late. 

"Since 2022, CSIS has been involved in the disruption of no fewer than 24 violent extremist actions, each resulting in arrests or terrorism peace bond charges," Rogers said. "In 2024, CSIS played an integral role in the disruption of two Daesh-inspired plots. 

"In one case, a father and son were allegedly in the advanced stages of planning an attack in the Toronto area. In another, an individual was arrested before allegedly attempting to illegally enter the United States to attack members of the Jewish community in New York. In these examples, and in many others I can't discuss publicly, our counter-terrorism teams have partnered with law enforcement and saved lives."

Canadian officials said they also blocked potentially 'lethal threats' by Iran. (Mert Alper Dervis/Anadolu Agency)

He attributed the radicalization to "eroding social cohesion, increasing polarization and significant global events," which he said "provide fertile ground for radicalization."

"Many who turn to violence radicalize exclusively online, often without direction from others," Rogers said. "They use technology to do so secretly and anonymously, seriously challenging the ability of our investigators to keep pace and to identify and prevent acts of violence."

Rogers also noted the CSIS collects intelligence and defends against transnational repression, previously focusing on transnational repression by the People's Republic of China, India and others. 

"In particularly alarming cases over the last year, we've had to reprioritize our operations to counter the actions of Iranian intelligence services and their proxies who have targeted individuals they perceive as threats to their regime," he said. "In more than one case, this involved detecting, investigating and disrupting potentially lethal threats against individuals in Canada."

Shohei Ohtani spoke with Tom Verducci after the Los Angeles Dodgers' Game 3 win over the Toronto Blue Jays in the World Series. 

The MLB Most Valuable Player Awards for the 2025 season are official, and while one league had a tight race, it wasn't close in the other. 

After winning his second World Series in as many years with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Shohei Ohtani also has back-to-back NL MVP Awards under his belt after a unanimous vote from the Baseball Writers' Association of America.

The two-way Japanese superstar was named the 2025 NL MVP, giving him four over his MLB career. He won his first two in the American League with the Los Angeles Angels. In fact, he has won an MVP Award in each of the last three seasons, having won the 2023 award in his final year as an Angels star.

Now, Ohtani has just Barry Bonds to chase for the most MVP Awards in MLB history. Bonds won seven NL MVPs, a feat some believe is still untouchable. Ohtani was tied with 10 other players with three over their careers, but the 31-year-old is in a new position now and only looking up at Bonds. 

The Philadelphia Phillies' Kyle Schwarber and New York Mets' Juan Soto were the two remaining finalists in the NL. Schwarber received 23 second-place votes to Soto's four. 

Ohtani, a five-time All-Star, led the National League in runs scored (146), slugging percentage (.622) and OPS (1.024), while mashing 55 home runs with 102 RBIs and a .282 average. Ohtani also sported a .392 on-base percentage with 20 intentional walks, which also led the NL. 

And after not being able to pitch in 2024, Ohtani was back on the mound this season with a 2.87 ERA in 14 starts (47 innings) with 62 strikeouts and nine walks.

The award is based strictly on the regular season, but Ohtani played a major part in the Dodgers' retaining their World Series title in an epic seven-game series against the Toronto Blue Jays. Over 17 postseason games, Ohtani slashed .265/.405/.691 with eight homers, three doubles and 14 RBIs. 

While it was virtually a lock Ohtani would be named the NL MVP, one of baseball's biggest debates revolved around the AL MVP. Was it going to be New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge going back-to-back, or would Seattle Mariners switch-hitting catcher Cal Raleigh's dream season end with the award?

The baseball writers chose Judge.

Judge received 17 first-place votes to Raleigh's 13, which the BBWAA said was the closest MVP race since 2019.

Judge has won the MVP three of the last four years in the American League.

While Raleigh had Judge beat in the home run department, the Yankees slugger won his first career batting title, leading MLB with a .331 average. He also led all of MLB with a .457 on-base percentage, .688 slugging percentage and 1.144 OPS and was the leader in the American League with 137 runs. 

Judge tallied 114 RBIs, and he was intentionally walked 36 times, blowing away Ohtani's NL-leading total.

This was Judge's seventh All-Star season as he continues to be arguably the best pure hitter in MLB. Unfortunately for him and the pinstripes, they were unable to make the run Ohtani and the Dodgers did. The Yankees were beaten by the AL pennant-winning Blue Jays in the ALDS, though Judge had a memorable moment in Game 3 with a clutch home run off the foul pole to keep the Yankees' season alive. 

Raleigh was one of the greatest baseball stories of the season. It just seemed Raleigh couldn't be stopped, and he couldn't stop breaking records in the process. 

Raleigh hit 60 home runs, which not only led MLB, but set the league record for the most ever by a catcher, a switch-hitter and a Mariners player. He finished with 125 RBIs while slashing .247/.359/.948 in 159 games.

Raleigh played in all but three games this season, which includes 128 games at the league's most demanding position as a catcher. 

Those pulling for Raleigh during the season pointed to how he was consistently breaking records for a position that usually gets overlooked for this type of award. He was a clear factor in the Mariners securing the AL West title for the first time since 2001, and they made a strong run in the postseason, too, before ultimately succumbing to the Blue Jays in Game 7.

War Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the commencement of Operation Southern Spear on Thursday evening, an operation he said is aimed at protecting the Western Hemisphere from “narcoterrorists.”

The announcement comes after months of U.S. Southern Command strikes in the Caribbean on alleged drug-trafficking boats, many of which the Pentagon said were suspected of sailing from the shores of Venezuela. Hegseth made the operation announcement in a post on X, noting that President Donald Trump ordered the action.

“Led by Joint Task Force Southern Spear and @SOUTHCOM, this mission defends our Homeland, removes narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere, and secures our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people. The Western Hemisphere is America's neighborhood – and we will protect it,” Hegseth said.

The Trump administration ordered a 20th strike on a suspected drug-smuggling boat Tuesday, killing four people in the Caribbean.

Hegseth's announcement of the operation follows the arrival of the Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier strike group in the Caribbean as the Pentagon bolsters its military presence in the region.

Venezuela has begun organizing its defense forces, with Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López announcing this week that the “entire country's military arsenal” is “on full operational readiness.”

The Pentagon referred the Washington Examiner to Hegseth's X post in response to requests for comment on further information about Operation Southern Spear.

The Pentagon also pointed to SOUTHCOM's Oct. 10 press release on the creation of the Joint Task Force Southern Spear, which Hegseth said will lead Operation Southern Spear.

“This is principally a maritime effort, and our team will leverage maritime patrols, aerial surveillance, precision interdictions, and intelligence sharing to counter illicit traffic, uphold the rule of law, and ultimately better protect vulnerable communities here at home,” Lt. Gen. Calvert Worth, designated JTF commander, said in the October release.

In late January, the Navy announced an “Operation Southern Spear” in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility. 

VENEZUELA ORDERS MAJOR MOBILIZATION AS US AIRCRAFT CARRIER ARRIVES IN NEARBY WATERS

The operation's deployment was “to help determine combinations of unmanned vehicles and manned forces to provide coordinated maritime domain awareness and conduct counternarcotics operations,” according to a January press release.

“Southern Spear will operationalize a heterogeneous mix of Robotic and Autonomous Systems (RAS) to support the detection and monitoring of illicit trafficking while learning lessons for other theaters,” Commander Foster Edwards, hybrid director of the U.S. 4th Fleet, said in a January statement.

New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's views have sparked fears that there will be an exodus of companies and capital from the city. But two of the city's top commercial real estate executives say it's simply not true, based on leasing activity and new building investments being made, with no pullback in plans ever since it became clear Mamdani would win, and through the democratic socialist's official election.

"New York City is back," said Scott Rechler, CEO of RXR, at CNBC's Delivering Alpha conference in New York on Thursday. "The people who work here, live here, they feel the energy, they have the conviction, and they have every right," he said.

"In our business right now, we are seeing CEO after CEO committing to the city," Rechler said. "We're seeing a record level of leasing in office buildings. And it's not just for next year, it's for 2028, 2030, 2032," he added.

"We will hit over 40 million square feet in commercial office leases signed at the end of this year," said Bill Rudin, co-executive chairman of Rudin Management. "Companies are growing here," he said. "We haven't seen any diminishment in meetings with brokerage firms," he said of activity since Mamdani's election. "People keep saying, 'Any impact?' No one has put their pencils down. No one is calling the moving trucks. Companies are expanding and taking space," Rudin said.

One good example: hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin of Citadel Securities, who is known for being outspoken with his conservative political views. Rudin, along with Steve Ross, Vornado Realty and Griffin, is breaking ground on a two-million square foot new office building at 350 Park Avenue. "Ken is committed and will have more employees at 350 Park than in Miami," Rudin said. And while the plans pre-date Mamdani's rise, Rudin noted they recently filed for a building permit and Griffin is a partner in the project, "so he is moving ahead and very excited about it and very much involved in the design and development of the project. ... How's that?" Rudin added.

RXR just signed a 300,000-square-foot lease with a law firm moving in 2029, and Rechler noted that the firm came back last week after the election and said they need to expand by another 200,000 square feet. JPMorgan's new building already needs seats for another 5,000 workers beyond the 10,000 it already can hold.

Rechler noted his firm already has an anchor tenant for a 2.8-million-square-foot project that will replace a Hyatt hotel in the 2031-2032 timeframe. "People believe in New York," he said. RXR has $7 billion in project financing and "you don't get that if people don't believe in the future of New York," he added, though he said it may require "a little bit of a longer lens."

But even right now, he said, in the wake of Mamdani's election, the correct word to use with tenants in the high quality office space market is "urgency" to sign deals, with reports he is hearing of companies signing leases that would normally take them a year to agree to within 21 days. "That's the market. ... enormous pipeline on the office side I've never seen my whole career, never seen it as strong as it is right now in tenant demand," Rechler said.

"As of today and yesterday, the information we are getting in real time is that tenants are still in the market and looking for good high quality space," Rudin said.

One reason for the bullish outlook on New York's real estate market is the need to attract and retain young professional talent.

"The people they want to be working in the companies are here in New York City," Rudin said.

"Every young professional wants to be in New York," Rechler added, citing a 1.5% vacancy rate in the multi- family property real estate market in the city. "People want to be here," he said.

Their view of the mayor — both real estate executives have met with him — isn't without reservations.

"Mamdani is not necessarily consistent with the capital of capitalism," Rechler said. "That's the biggest risk. We have a guy who is caricature, not a character, but a caricature," he said, and that could set Mamdani up to easily be defined as a socialist with no experience and just riding on social media savvy, he added.

It is a risk that Rechler says he is seeing play out among overseas institutional investors specifically. "When I leave the city and travel the world, they all have this big anxiety," he said. "It may impact foreign investors in multi-family projects in New York. They hear 'rent freeze,' just hear that word ... and maybe there is a pullback there," Rechler said, citing the fact that the mayor has power to appoint officials to a board overseeing those policies.

That perception is leading some institutional investors with whom RXR was talking about large investments in New York City to "pull back and say they want to see how it plays out," Rechler said. He added the tone of these conversations implies that there could be a "chill in capital flows" among these investors.

"I've been in the Middle East and Europe and the first thing people want to talk about is Mamdani," he said. Rechler is also on the board of directors of the New York Fed, and he said the topic of conversation is the same. "In the boardroom of the New York Fed they want to talk about it and their staff traveling around the world is being asked as they travel."

But the real estate CEOs both stressed that for a city that has survived and prospered through Covid, the financial crisis, 9/11 and the administration of Bill de Blasio, the fears seem hyperbolic. They also noted that when Michael Bloomberg was mayor, New York had a $60 billion budget. Now it is a budget of $116 billion, which leads them to believe Mamdani may become more realistic in his management approach than his campaign platform would suggest.

"When he first started running, there was no private sector in housing. He has moved off of that," Rudin said. He added that a "very liberal Greenwich Village congressman Ed Koch" realized when he became mayor he needed to move to the center to get things done. "Hopefully, Mayor-elect Mamdani understands he needs to manage and operate a $116 billion budget," he said.

Rudin said the issues the Mayor-elect has raised, such as housing affordability and availability, are legitimate issues, "and we will try to work with him," he said.

"What's driving Mamdani's success is the same thing that drove Trump's success," Rudin said, citing a disenfranchised segment of the economy, particularly among younger people, who feel they will not have the same economic opportunities as prior generations. "There is frustration with big business and government and they want an answer," he said. "Now, the Mayor-elect gave them a simple answer, which frankly is not really executable," he said.

But Rudin noted since Mamdani's earlier campaigning, he has pulled back from a policy of having government wholly dictate housing, and has expressed willingness to work with the private sector, and he added, it is now "incumbent on us to show him the pathway of how to create the housing we need."

"I talked to him before the election," Rudin said. "My sense is a very smart young man willing to listen and hear feedback on the issues."

The housing affordability crisis will not be a simple one to fix. Rudin noted that the administration of Mayor Eric Adams set up Mamdani for success by changing zoning laws across boroughs within the last year, but the real estate executives both said wage, labor union, sustainable development policies, and changes in tax provisions that make it less attractive financially to put up buildings over 100 units are all issues that stand in the way. "So it has to be a moment where labor, the governor, the city council, and the mayor have to come together ... if they want the housing, and we need it," Rudin said.

The real estate executives cited tax incentives created due to Covid which are allowing for the conversion of older office buildings into residential properties as another area where they can collaborate on affordable housing construction, with those incentives tied to buildings retaining 25% of units for affordable rents rather market rates.

Rechler noted that despite Mamdani's tax the rich rhetoric, the reality is that New York's governor has had significant fiscal authority over the city ever since the 1970s financial crisis. "At the end of the day, the governor has the veto pen on taxes," Rechler said. "And I had breakfast with her yesterday and she said income taxes won't be raised under her watch."

He added there will be political pressure on Governor Kathy Hochul given her own election needs.

"We have a governor's race in a year and she has to serve as that firewall, and if she doesn't, she will not be governor in a year," Rechler said. "The gubernatorial election will be about Mamdani."

For now, Rechler said what is maybe most telling about his interactions with Mamdani are a comparison to with how former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio interacted with business leaders when his star was rising.

"I met with [Mamdani] for an hour alone and he came in prepared and he was pivoting from campaign to governing mentality and said all the right things," Rechler recalled of a meeting in September when it was clear to him the election outcome was certain. "The proof will be in the pudding, but he realizes that he needs to lean into public-private partnerships, it's the only way to build the type of housing he wants."

"I want to contrast that with when I met with de Blasio," Rechler added. It was a meeting of 12 business leaders, he said, and the former mayor, "he looked around the table of business people and said 'none of you elected me and I'm not here to serve you.' And we lived with that for eight years. This guy at least starts with 'I know I need business people to work with to be successful."

President Donald Trump on Friday said that he is asking the Department of Justice to investigate relationships between notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and former President Bill Clinton, JPMorgan Chase, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, billionaire tech investor Reid Hoffman, and others.

Trump's statement comes as he faces renewed pressure over his own past friendship with Epstein, who killed himself in August 2019 after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.

In a Truth Social post, Trump claimed that "Democrats are using the Epstein Hoax ... to try and deflect from their disastrous SHUTDOWN, and all of their other failures.

Because of that, he wrote, "I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,.

"This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats," Trump wrote "Records show that these men, and many others, spent large portions of their life with Epstein, and on his 'Island.' Stay tuned!!!"

Trump's post comes two days after he hosted business leaders, including JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, at a White House dinner.

A spokesman for JPMorgan, in a statement to CNBC on Friday, said, "The government had damning information about [Epstein's] crimes and failed to share it with us or other banks."

"We regret any association we had with the man, but did not help him commit his heinous acts," said the spokeswoman, Patricia Wexler. "We ended our relationship with him years before his arrest on sex trafficking charges."

Epstein had been a longtime customer of JPMorgan, and also had been friends with former JPMorgan executive Jes Staley.

In 2023, JPMorgan, without admitting wrongdoing, settled separate lawsuits by victims of Epstein and the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands, who had accused the bank of facilitating and benefiting from Epstein's sex trafficking of young women. The bank agreed to pay the group of victims $290 million, and to pay the USVI $75 million.

CNBC has requested comment from Clinton, Summers, Hoffman, as well as from the White House and the DOJ, about Trump's post.

Emails released by the House Oversight Committee this week show Epstein and others talking about Trump.

In a 2018 email thread about Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleading guilty charges related to hush money payments on behalf of Trump, Epstein wrote, "I know how dirty donald is."

In another thread that same year, Epstein wrote of Trump: "its wild. because I am the one able to take him down."

Trump also faces a looming vote by the full House of Representatives on a petition demanding the release of criminal investigative files about Epstein that the DOJ refuses to make public despite prior promises to do so by Attorney General Pam Bondi and other Trump administration officials.

Trump has denied having known about Epstein's decades-long abuse of underage girls and young women.

The two men had a falling out in the early 2000s.

Among the email threads released Wednesday by the House Oversight Committee is one written in April in which Epstein told author Michael Wolff that Trump "knew about the girls." The email does not explain what Epstein meant by that

In another email, written in April 2011, Epstein told his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell: "I want you to realize that the dog that hasn't barked is trump."

Epstein, in the same thread, said that a person whose name was redacted in the email but whom lawmakers identified as a victim of his "spent hours at my house with" Trump.

"He has never once been mentioned," Epstein added.

Artificial intelligence has become one of the biggest investment stories in the market, helping drive a surge of assets into thematic exchange-traded funds that let retail investors bet on major technology trends. But experts warn that these funds can fall as quickly as they rise. It's a simple yet important point for investors to keep in mind as tech stocks look more vulnerable, and are leading the market lower in recent days. The Nasdaq has been flirting with a fall below its 50-day moving average for the first time since the April downturn and posted its third-straight losing session on Thursday.

"We have nearly 400 ETFs at ETF Action that we classify as thematic," Mike Akins, founding partner at research firm ETF Action, said on CNBC's "ETF Edge" on Monday. "The top performer is up over 150% year to date ... there's several negative 10%," he said.

Investors are drawn to thematic ETFs covering trends from AI to quantum computing, clean energy and defense technology, but they often overlook the risks, including how volatile the portfolios can be. Because thematic ETFs focus on specific sectors or technologies rather than just tracking broad indexes, they can deliver strong gains when a theme is in favor, but momentum may fade.

ETF Action divides the thematic ETF universe into 12 major categories with many subgroups. Within the disruptive technology category alone, which includes artificial intelligence, flows have been enormous this year. "AI disruptive tech has seen almost $20 billion in flows year to date," Akins said. Roughly $15 billion of that, he said, has "AI" in the ETF name.

The surge has helped lift funds like the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (AIQ) which has grown to about $7 billion in assets, attracting about $3 billion in net flows since the beginning of the year, according to ETF.com. Its top holdings are Advanced Micro Devices, Alphabet, Samsung, Tesla and Alibaba. Another example from Global X is the Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ), which has around $3 billion in assets under management. Its top holdings are Nvidia, ABB, Fanuc, Intuitive Surgical and Keyence.

Thematic ETFs do require more research than traditional funds. Case in point: among the 18 ETFs that ETF Action classifies as AI-focused, Akins said there is a performance spread of 60% this year.

"Every time you see a new ETF come to market, it introduces significant tracking error from just investing in the market," he said.

Through the first nine months of 2025, close to 800 ETFs were launched, besting a record for ETF launches set just last year, according to Reuters. Morningstar data indicates there are now more ETFs (over 4,300 U.S. listed ETFs) than individual stocks traded in the U.S.

Akins described the growth of the ETF market as "overwhelmingly positive" to the investor experience, but added that the growing number of opportunities also implies more risk.

Some of the themes that led the early wave of thematic investing can lose momentum as stand-alone investment stories even as the trends remain fundamental to the technology sector and market, Akins said. ETFs constructed around the themes of cloud computing and next-generation connectivity, for example, have seen billions of dollars in outflows over the past few years as the companies that were top holdings matured and became part of broad-based stock market indexes already held by investors. 

He stressed that is not a statement about whether cloud computing or connectivity are good or bad investment themes right now, but simply that there is a "lifecycle" to a theme which can lead to less attention and less flows as the theme matures. Ultimately, that can mean themes don't offer the same high-growth opportunities as they did when they first became popular.

But Akins added that the timeline for each trend's momentum is hard to pin down.

"I think every theme is unique to itself, so some are going to play out longer than others," Akins said. "That's part of the story with this space ... there's definitely the idea I'm going to invest in this because I believe it's going to play out over the next three to seven years."

Despite the recent jitters in the stock market and tech stocks specifically, it is important to note that the Nasdaq is less than 5% off an all-time record level and has gained close to 250% since its Covid low point. Akins said thematic investing is worthwhile for investors who understand what they are buying and can tolerate short-term volatility.

Seizing moments of opportunity in the market can also be key with thematic strategies. "Themes can run very, very quickly, so you should be taking advantage," Akins said. Significant gains in a short period of time may lead investors to consider taking some profits. "You still want to have an allocation to the theme, but maybe take some off the top," he added.

The threat of AI has sent shockwaves through the software sector, hammering share prices and creating, in the words of analysts at RBC Capital Markets, a rare opportunity for "opportunistic" buyers.

Once-high-flying software companies are now trading at deep discounts as investors worry about how generative AI could upend SaaS business models. That same anxiety, the analysts argue, is laying the groundwork for a new wave of dealmaking.

According to RBC, software M&A activity has surged 78% this year, with private-equity deal volume more than doubling as sponsors hunt for bargains.

"We continue to see software underperform on concerns around AI and as this underperformance drags on in spite of better-than-expected results, we may see more buyers opportunistically step in and take advantage of dislocations, particularly in private equity," the analysts wrote in a recent note to investors.

While noting they have no knowledge of any such deals, the analysts listed potential targets, all of which have solid customer bases and cash flow but limited AI narratives. Private-equity buyers, less constrained by quarterly earnings pressure, could move quickly to take these companies private, reset expectations, and rebuild them for an AI-first world.

While regulatory scrutiny remains a hurdle for mega-cap tech acquirers, financial sponsors are freer to strike. RBC expects deal momentum to accelerate as sentiment stabilizes and valuations remain depressed. For investors, the AI scare that crushed software stocks might soon become the catalyst for a new consolidation boom, one driven not by hype, but by hard-nosed value hunting.

Here's RBC's view on which software companies are potential mergers and acquisitions targets and why:

JPMorgan Chase has secured deals ensuring it will get paid by the fintech firms responsible for nearly all the data requests made by third-party apps connected to customer bank accounts, CNBC has learned.

The bank has signed updated contracts with the fintech middlemen that make up more than 95% of the data pulls on its systems, including Plaid, Yodlee, Morningstar and Akoya, according to JPMorgan spokesman Drew Pusateri.

"We've come to agreements that will make the open banking ecosystem safer and more sustainable and allow customers to continue reliably and securely accessing their favorite financial products," Pusateri said in a statement. "The free market worked."

The milestone is the latest twist in a long-running dispute between traditional banks and the fintech industry over access to customer accounts. For years, middlemen like Plaid paid nothing to tap bank systems when a customer wanted to use a fintech app like Robinhood to draw funds or check balances.

That dynamic appeared to be enshrined in law in late 2024, when the Biden-era Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized what is known as the "open-banking rule" requiring banks to share customer data with other financial firms at no cost.

But banks sued to prevent the CFPB rule from taking hold and seemed to gain the upper hand in May after the Trump administration asked a federal court to vacate the rule.

Soon after, JPMorgan — the largest U.S. bank by assets, deposits and branches — reportedly told the middlemen that it would start charging what amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars for access to its customer data.

In response, fintech, crypto and venture capital executives argued that the bank was engaging in "anti-competitive, rent-seeking behavior" that would hurt innovation and consumers' ability to use popular apps.

After weeks of negotiations between JPMorgan and the middlemen, the bank agreed to lower pricing than it originally proposed, and the fintech middlemen won concessions regarding the servicing of data requests, according to people with knowledge of the talks.

Fintech firms preferred the certainty of locking in data-sharing rates because it is unclear whether the current CFPB, which is in the process of revising the open-banking rule, will favor banks or fintech companies, according to a venture capital investor who asked for anonymity to discuss his portfolio companies.

The bank and the fintech firms declined to disclose details about their contracts, including how much the middlemen agreed to pay and how long the deals are in force.

The deals mark a shift in the power dynamic between banks, middlemen and the fintech apps that are increasingly threatening incumbents. More banks are likely to begin charging fintech firms for access to their systems, according to industry observers.  

"JPMorgan tends to be a trendsetter. They're sort of the leader of the pack, so it's fair to expect that the rest of the major banks will follow," said Brian Shearer, director of competition and regulatory policy at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator.

Shearer, who worked at the CFPB under former director Rohit Chopra, said he's worried that the development would create a barrier of entry to nascent startups and ultimately result in higher costs for consumers.

Proponents of the 2024 CFPB rule said it gave consumers control over their financial data and encouraged competition and innovation. Banks including JPMorgan said it exposed them to fraud and unfairly saddled them with the rising costs of maintaining systems increasingly tapped by the middlemen and their clients.  

When Plaid's deal with JPMorgan was announced in September, the companies issued a dual press release emphasizing the continuity it provided for customers.

But the industry group that Plaid is a part of has harshly criticized the development, signaling that while JPMorgan has won a decisive battle, the ongoing skirmish may yet play out in courts and in the public.

"Introducing prohibitive tolls is anti-competitive, anti-innovation, and flies in the face of the plain reading of the law," Penny Lee, CEO of the Financial Technology Association, told CNBC in response to the JPMorgan milestone.

"These agreements are not the free market at work, but rather big banks using their market position to capitalize on regulatory uncertainty," Lee said. "We urge the Trump Administration to uphold the law by maintaining the existing prohibition on data access fees."

President Donald Trump's administration said on Friday it was formally withdrawing a plan by his predecessor to require airlines to pay passengers cash compensation when U.S. flight disruptions are caused by carriers.

In December 2024, the U.S. Transportation Department under then-President Joe Biden sought public comment on writing rules to require airlines to pay $200 to $300 for domestic delays of at least three hours and up to $775 for longer delays.

In September, USDOT first disclosed it planned to withdraw the proposal. On Friday, USDOT said the rules would result in "unnecessary regulatory burdens" in explaining why it would not go forward.

Last month, a group of 18 Democratic senators urged the Trump administration not to drop the compensation plan.

"This is a common-sense proposal: when an airline's mistake imposes unanticipated costs on families, the airline should try to remedy the situation by providing accommodations to consumers and helping cover their costs," said the letter signed by Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal, Maria Cantwell, Ed Markey and others.

Airlines in the U.S. must refund passengers for canceled flights, but are not required to compensate customers for delays. The European Union, Canada, Brazil and Britain all have airline delay compensation rules. No large U.S. airline currently guarantees cash compensation for significant flight disruption.

USDOT said Friday in abandoning the compensation plan that it would "allow airlines to compete on the services and compensation that they provide to passengers rather than imposing new minimum requirements for these services and compensation through regulation, which would impose significant costs on airlines."

USDOT also announced in September it was considering rescinding Biden regulations requiring airlines and ticket agents to disclose service fees alongside airfares.

It also plans to reduce regulatory burdens on airlines and ticket agents by writing new rules detailing the definition of a flight cancellation that entitles consumers to ticket refunds, as well as revisiting rules on ticket pricing and advertising.

Airlines have pushed the Trump administration to go further and praised the action to rescind the Biden plan.

Lianna Frausto, who worked as a sales coordinator for Sonder in San Antonio, said she woke up Sunday morning to a whirlwind of confusion.

After the news broke that Marriott had terminated its licensing agreement with Sonder, a short-term apartment rental company, she spent the day reaching out to other employees and trying to figure out what it would mean for their jobs.

"I can't believe how many people I had to hear it from before I got it from the horse's mouth," she told Business Insider.

Frausto received an email from the company on Sunday evening that said Sonder was ceasing operations, but she said she still wasn't sure if that meant she was immediately out of a job. "Nobody told us that we were fired until the next day," she said.

Business Insider spoke to four Sonder employees who described how they coped as they dealt with spotty communication and upset guests, all while confronting an uncertain future.

"My employees looked to me for answers, and I didn't know what was going on because I hadn't been told anything," a manager at a Sonder hotel in New York, who learned of the situation from a crying guest, said.

As Business Insider has reported, the breakup between the company and Marriott also caused mayhem for guests who were told they needed to leave by 9 a.m. on Monday and that existing reservations would not be honored.

Sonder managed 140 Marriott-licensed properties and about 7,700 apartments as of September, according to Marriott's latest earnings report. On Monday, Sonder announced it was filing for bankruptcy protection and ceasing operations. The company had 1,421 employees as of the end of 2024.

Francis Davidson, the cofounder and former CEO of Sonder, told Business Insider on Thursday he was stunned by the company's downfall. Davidson stepped down earlier this year after Sonder completed its integration with Marriott. "We all felt good about the positive momentum we were seeing in June when I left," he said, "and so to then see that the business has now run into a brick wall, it's just shocking to me."

Neither Sonder nor Marriott responded to a request for comment.

The New York manager said everything at work was normal on Sunday morning until the guest appeared at 11:30 a.m. and said she'd received a phone notification from Marriott that the company was no longer affiliated with Sonder and that her reservation had been canceled.

More started to show up at the desk looking for answers, but the employees didn't have any. As of Sunday night, staff had not been officially told they were being let go, the manager said.

Employees showed up for work on Monday to help guests depart by the 9 a.m. deadline, even though, at that point, "we all knew we didn't have jobs the next day," the manager said.

Logan Ford, a manager of a group sales team at Sonder, said the confusion continued Monday with mixed messages about whether that would be his last day or if he might be asked to stay until Thursday to help close things out with clients.

"Monday, I sat there and waited to hear anything from the senior leadership team, but it was just dead air. Silence," Ford said.

A Sonder employee who worked in customer support said employees who believed they were all going to be laid off started saying their goodbyes on Slack.

Confirmation came in the form of a termination notice email on Monday shortly before 5 p.m.

It said they would be paid through November 10 and that their healthcare would remain in place until the end of the month. Employees were told to return their laptops, phones, and other company property.

"The Company's severance policy has been discretionary and, given the Company's financial circumstances at this time, the Company is not in a position to offer terminating employees severance pay," the memo, which was signed by interim CEO Janice Sears, said.

Soon after, the employees said, their accounts were shut down and their laptop access was cut.

Ethan Werchniak, a guest at a Sonder hotel in Montreal, told Business Insider that he learned he had to vacate the property on Monday morning because an employee knocked on his door to say his reservation had been canceled.

Werchniak said the employee told him, "I'm very sorry to be very blunt with you, I'm losing my job right now. My last task is to tell people that they need to leave."

"I'm like, OK, this guy's probably having a worse day than I am," Werchniak said. "So I don't tear him a new one."

Brett Johnson spent over a decade breaking into systems, stealing identities, and selling stolen credit cards on the dark web. He stole millions of dollars, often making over $100,000 a month through tax-return identity theft.

He's worked with the Secret Service and private companies as a consultant to help stop the kinds of crimes he once perpetrated. He told Business Insider's Carter Thallon in a recent interview that the crime world he helped invent is mutating into something harder to see — and almost impossible to stop.

Cybercrime is becoming increasingly organized, and that's a problem, he said. The next wave of cybercrime will come from entire operations powered by artificial intelligence, where machines write the scams, fake the evidence, and even talk to the victims in real time.

Here are the three rising cyber threats that alarm him most.

Johnson said deepfakes that convincingly mimic real people will become central to online fraud. Criminals already use them to forge voice messages and fake live video calls. Soon, this technology will make it impossible to trust what we see or hear online, Johnson said.

"In order for me to defraud you, I have to get you to trust me," he said. However, deepfakes enable criminals to essentially bypass the effort of gaining trust by posing as an already trustworthy person, accelerating the process of victimizing you.

One finance clerk, last year, for example, was conned into approving overseas transfers amounting to more than $25 million, Shubham Agarwal reported for BI. The clerk had been instructed to do so during a video call that turned out to be full of deepfakes recreations of his real coworkers, including the organization's chief financial officer.

"We get to the point where we're no longer able to trust anything that we see or hear in an online environment, and that becomes really dangerous," he said.

That threat is compounded by the speed of AI tools, which can mimic speech patterns, create realistic faces, and write messages tailored to a target's personality.

Gone are the days when fraudsters acted alone, Johnson said. Scam farms are becoming the new norm.

Scam farms are buildings packed with workers — who are often trafficked or forced into slave labor — running simultaneous cons.

Some of these operations specialize in "pig butchering," long-term relationship scams that drain victims' savings.

That's exactly what happened to Ahmet Tozal, who recently told BI's Matthew Loh of a relationship he built with a supposed woman online.

Over several weeks, the woman convinced him to invest over a year's worth of his wages into a cryptocurrency that didn't exist. He ultimately had to move from Turkey to Uzbekistan alone to find a higher salary to support his family.

These scam farms are structured businesses, with workers rotating shifts and supervisors overseeing them. "That's something we didn't see back then," Johnson said about the time he was scamming people in the 90s and early 00s.

"Back then, you did see criminals working together, networking in a co-op type fashion. But these days it's much more organized," he added.

The same automation fueling deepfakes is driving identity fraud to a new level.

Johnson calls synthetic identity fraud — a blend of real and fake personal data used to create a new digital person — the No. 1 form of identity theft in the world.

It's especially concerning because "synthetic fraud is almost invisible because that person doesn't really exist," he said, adding that "it's 80% of all new account fraud. It's 20% of all credit card chargebacks, 5% of all credit card debt. It's huge."

Once a fake identity establishes credit, it can be used to open bank accounts, apply for loans, or facilitate money laundering. Banks often discover the fraud only after the accounts vanish. If synthetic IDs continue to rise, it could make fraud detection exponentially harder.

Fraud is easier to achieve now than ever before. "A criminal now doesn't have to understand any aspect of the crime. They can immediately buy tutorials, take live instruction classes, buy anything that they need online, and immediately start being successful and profitable at crime," Johnson said.

So it's important to know how to protect yourself. Johnson told BI's Manseen Logan earlier this year, six ways to lower your risk of hacking:

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Yesterday was a rough day for the stock market. The three major indexes all notched their biggest one-day losses in more than a month as the artificial intelligence trade once again sputtered. Economic policy concerns also overshadowed investors' excitement around the federal government reopening.

Here's the breakdown:

Higher-income shoppers are looking for deals, and younger consumers are tightening their purse strings, according to recent earnings reports from consumer companies.

There are some notable exceptions — such as Coach and Swiss shoemaker On, which saw growth across all consumer segments — but shoppers' pullback could portend a rocky holiday retail period ahead. Investors will get more insight from next week's earnings reports, which include some of the biggest retailers: Walmart, Target, Gap and Home Depot.

Another economic warning sign: Data released yesterday showed new foreclosure starts in October jumped 20% from a year ago. As CNBC's Diana Olick notes, the uptick could signal cracks in a housing market that has been notoriously tight coming out of the pandemic.

Boeing defense workers voted to approve a new contract yesterday, ending the union's first strike since 1996. The stoppage, which lasted more than a three months, delayed production of Boeing's F-15 fighter jets.

The agreement includes increased up-front bonuses and 24% wage increases over five years. Employees rejected previous proposals that the union said didn't address their concerns.

We're also keeping an eye on the Starbucks barista strike that began yesterday in dozens of cities. The protest coincided with Red Cup Day, which has historically been a major sales event for the coffee chain.

The IRS released its 2026 guidelines for a variety of savings programs yesterday.

For 401(k) plans, the agency increased the employee deferral limit by $1,000 to $24,500. The caps for individual retirement accounts and Roth IRAs in 2026 each increased by $500 to $7,500.

The IRS also raised 401(k) catch-up contribution limits and increased income thresholds for Roth IRA contributions.

At CNBC's Delivering Alpha conference last night, attendees got expert examinations of today's market.

Mary Callahan Erdoes, CEO at JPMorgan Asset and Wealth Management, said AI should be viewed as an opportunity rather than a potential crisis. In fact, Erdoes called the idea of an AI bubble a "crazy concept."

Coatue Management founder Philippe Laffont, meanwhile, had a less optimistic take for the initial public offering market, calling it "completely broken" and "beyond repair." He noted that there are "very few" IPOs compared with prior decades.

It's been a busy week. Here are our recommendations for the weekend:

D.R. Horton, the nation's largest homebuilder, is tapping an artificial intelligence tool from Portland, Oregon-based startup Prophetic to build more homes and address the country's housing shortage.

Chronic underbuilding since the Great Recession has caused a deficit of roughly 4 million homes, according to analyses from several sources, including Zillow. The supply-demand imbalance has caused prices to rise over 50% from pre-pandemic levels.

Homebuilders are trying to respond but say that the cost of construction, along with the difficult and costly process for acquiring and developing buildable lots, is making that difficult.

"One of the largest challenges to providing affordable housing is the identification, acquisition and entitlement of land suitable for development. We are confident the insights provided by Prophetic are going to help us expand homeownership opportunities for hard-working American individuals and families," said Jason Jones, vice president of data analytics at D.R. Horton, in a release.

Prophetic has developed an AI-native platform for land acquisition and development analysis. For any potential parcel of land, Prophetic's software will pull every single zoning manual from every city and county in a state. The company said it is currently operational in 25 states and expects to be in all 50 by June.

"It's an incredibly large, tedious, detail-oriented process to take tens of thousands of these zoning documents and extract the rules, not only efficiently, but correctly," said Oliver Alexander, founder and CEO of Prophetic.

Among other things, the system looks at minimum lot size and minimum or maximum density setbacks, which differ by municipality and zone. It updates those quarterly. 

"Then it tells you where that information came from, which is the key differentiator," Alexander explained. "When you have that section title and the page that it came from, that builds trust, and then it becomes ultra-efficient, where you can analyze development potential in 30 seconds instead of two to three hours."

Alexander said there are a little over 440,000 different ways to describe what you're allowed to do on a piece of dirt in the states Prophetic has analyzed. Developers need to go through all of that information to figure out if they can build a single- or multifamily housing development on it. 

The AI's large language model-based analysis of these documents at scale can answer the questions and then feed that into search AI, which Alexander calls "the major unlock" – search plus the zone AI information together. At the ground level, with this AI, builders can figure out what they can build, where and how much at a much faster pace, making them more competitive with landowners.

"If you have that much of an edge in your speed to decision, you effectively control your entire market, because before anyone else can decide, you've tied it up," said Alexander.

As a handful of the world's most valuable companies set out to spend $1 trillion over the next five years on data centers for artificial intelligence, one line item is on the minds of executives and investors: depreciation.

In accounting, depreciation is the act of allocating the cost of a hard asset over the course of its expected useful life. It's an increasingly important concept in the tech industry, as companies predict how long the hundreds of thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs, they're purchasing will remain useful or retain their value.

Infrastructure giants like Google, Oracle and Microsoft have said their servers could be useful for up to six years. But they could also depreciate much sooner. Microsoft said in its latest annual filing that its computer equipment lasts two to six years.

That's a lot to consider for the investors and lenders financing the giant AI buildouts, because the longer equipment remains valuable, the more years a company can stretch out depreciation and the less it hurts profits.

AI GPUs represent a particular challenge because they're still relatively new to the market. Nvidia's first AI-focused processors for data centers came out around 2018. The current AI boom started with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. Since then, Nvidia's annual data center revenue has jumped from $15 billion to $115 billion in the fiscal year that ended in January.

There's no real track record for how long GPUs last when compared with other types of heavy equipment that businesses have been using for decades, said Haim Zaltzman, vice chair of Latham & Watkins' emerging companies and growth practice.

"Is it three years, is it five, or is it seven?" said Zaltzman, who works on GPU financings, in an interview. "It's a huge difference in terms of how successful it is for financing purposes."

Some of Nvidia's customers say AI chips will retain value for a long time and that customers will continue to pay for access to older processors because they'll still be useful for other tasks. CoreWeave, which buys GPUs and rents them out to clients, has used six-year depreciation cycles for its infrastructure since 2023.

CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator told CNBC this week, following quarterly earnings, that his company is being "data driven" about GPU shelf life.

Intrator said that CoreWeave's Nvidia A100 chips, which were announced in 2020, are all fully booked. He also added that a batch of Nvidia H100 chips from 2022 became available because a contract expired, and they were immediately booked at 95% of their original price.

"All of the data points that I'm getting are telling me that the infrastructure retains value," Intrator said.

Still, CoreWeave shares plunged 16% after its earnings report as delays at a third-party data center developer hit full-year guidance. The stock is down 57% from its high reached in June, part of a broader sell-off reflecting concerns about overspending in AI. Oracle shares have plummeted 34% from their record high in September.

Among the most vocal skeptics of the AI trade is short seller Michael Burry, who recently disclosed bets against Nvidia and Palantir.

Burry this week suggested that companies including Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google and Amazon are overstating the useful life of their AI chips and understating depreciation. He pegs the actual useful life of server equipment at around two to three years, and said companies are inflating their earnings as a result.

Amazon and Microsoft declined to comment. Meta, Google and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.

There are a number of ways AI chips could depreciate before six years. They could wear out and break, or they could become obsolete as newer GPUs are released. They could still be useful for running certain workloads, but with much worse economics.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has implied as much. When Nvidia announced a new Blackwell chip earlier this year, he joked that the value of its predecessor, the Hopper, would deteriorate.

"When Blackwell starts shipping in volume, you couldn't give Hoppers away," Huang said in March at Nvidia's AI conference.

"There are circumstances where Hopper is fine," he continued. "Not many."

Nvidia now releases new AI chips on an annual basis, versus the two-year cadence it had before. Advanced Micro Devices, its closest GPU competitor, followed suit.

Nvidia reports quarterly results next week.

Amazon, in a February filing, said it decreased the useful life for a subset of its servers from six years to five years because it conducted a study that found "an increased pace of technology development, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning."

Meanwhile, other hyperscalers are extending their GPU useful life estimates for newer server equipment.

Although Microsoft plans to build AI infrastructure aggressively, CEO Satya Nadella said this week that his company is trying to space out its AI chip purchases and not overinvest in a single generation of processors. He added that the biggest competitor for any new Nvidia AI chip is its predecessor.

"One of the biggest learnings we had even with Nvidia is that their pace increased in terms of their migrations," Nadella said. "That was a big factor. I didn't want to go get stuck with four or five years of depreciation on one generation."

Nvidia declined to comment.

Dustin Madsen, vice president of the Society of Depreciation Professionals and founder of Emrydia Consulting, said depreciation is a financial estimate by management and that developments in a fast-moving industry like technology can change initial predictions.

Depreciation estimates, Madsen said, generally take into account assumptions such as technological obsolescence, maintenance, historical lifespans of similar equipment and internal engineering analysis.

"You're going to have to convince an auditor that what you're suggesting what its life will be is actually its life," Madsen said. "They will look at all of those factors, like your engineering data that suggests that the life of these assets is approximately six years, and they will audit that at a very detailed level."

Merck will acquire Cidara Therapeutics in a nearly $9.2 billion deal, gaining access to an experimental flu drug in its effort to diversify ahead of patent loss for its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda.

The drugmaker will pay $221.50 per share in cash for Cidara, the companies said on Friday, a premium of 108.9% from its last closing price.

Shares of Cidara, which has a market capitalization of $3.3 billion as of Thursday, doubled in value to $217.89, while Merck slipped 1.3%.

Merck, which is set to lose patents for Keytruda later this decade, has nearly tripled its late-stage pipeline since 2021 through in-house development and big deals such as the $11.5 billion purchase of Acceleron for pulmonary arterial hypertension drug Winrevair.

The company had in July signed a $10 billion buyout of UK-based Verona Pharma, gaining Ohtuvayre, a newly approved drug for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, commonly known as "smoker's lung".

"There definitely seems to be a sense of urgency at Merck to add growth to their pipeline via deals," said James Harlow, senior vice president at Novare Capital Management.

Cidara's experimental long-acting antiviral drug CD388 is not a vaccine and is expected to be efficacious in individuals regardless of immune status. It has the potential to be a single-dose, universal prevention against all flu strains.

"The non-vaccine nature of CD388 is notable given the uncertainty around the FDA and CDC's views on vaccines," Harlow said.

It aims to protect those at higher risk of flu, with the potential to provide season-long protection.

"While this deal is somewhat complementary, it is not perfectly 'plug and play' with the rest of the Merck portfolio," said Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen, calling Cidara "essentially a single asset story".

Breen said the deal provides late-stage, lower-risk revenue into the portfolio at the end of this decade, but costs due to diversification and market building may be heavy.

The flu drug belongs to a class known as drug-Fc conjugates that combines zanamivir, the active ingredient of GSK's FDA-approved influenza drug Relenza, with a clinically validated human antibody fragment.

It is being studied in a late-stage trial in adults and adolescents at higher risk of developing complications from influenza.

"We are confident that CD388 has the potential to be another important driver of growth through the next decade," said Merck CEO Robert Davis.

Cidara aims to achieve target enrolment of 6,000 participants by December, it said earlier this month. The drug has received breakthrough designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which could speed up its approval process.

A single dose of the antiviral gave up to 76% protection from symptomatic influenza over 24 weeks compared to placebo, in a mid-stage trial studying the drug in healthy unvaccinated adults aged 18 to 64.

Merck, through a subsidiary, will acquire all of Cidara's outstanding shares. The transaction has an equity value of $6.96 billion, according to a Reuters calculation.

The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026.

Remember when Reels was dismissed as Meta's attempt to clone TikTok?

Well, now the five-year-old app is on track to generate $50 billion a year. It's turned into a huge win for Meta, and it has become one of the biggest "creator economy" businesses in the world.

But that number also makes something else clear: The creator economy's biggest winners aren't creators. It's the platforms that depend on them.

That's because almost every one of those platforms depends on the labor of creators — a shorter way of describing "people who make and/or own content" — but shares very little of the revenue those creators' stuff generates.

The one major exception is Google's YouTube, which is also a $50 billion business, and which, until recently, shared about half of all the money its videos made with the people who made the videos. Everyone else —Meta, TikTok, Snap — offers a different deal, which goes like this: Give us your stuff, for free. Maybe we'll give a small subset of you some kind of bonus from a "creator program" or something like that. But for the most part, we'll make money selling ads against your stuff on our platform — and you'll have to find another way to make money. You're welcome!

This is not news to people in and around the creator economy (again: you could just say "media business"). But Meta's boast about its success — made by Mark Zuckerberg last month, during his Q3 earnings call — puts it in sharp relief.

It's hard to build a $50 billion a year business doing anything, anywhere. But a $50 billion business built on other people's content that you get more or less for free? That's pretty special.

Even better for Meta and its peers: There's no sense that any of this is going to change. Every so often, someone will tell me about their plan to make it happen: They'll convince a bunch of content creators to take their stuff off the non-sharing platforms unless they get a better deal. It never happens.

And Meta and its peers have a pretty good argument for why that doesn't happen, though they generally don't say this out loud (I've asked Meta for comment). It's that their massive platforms offer creators the promise of exposure, which they can parlay into businesses they can build on their own.

Sure, maybe Meta isn't going to give you a meaningful cut of the money it makes selling ads against your videos. But someone else may pay you a bunch of money to feature their product in one of your videos. Win, win. And if you don't like it, go find another huge platform that gives you a better deal. Good luck.

Again, there is one place to get a better deal, which is YouTube. The world's biggest video site kicked off the creator economy way back in 2007, when it launched its "partner program," which still exists today. That one gives (most) big YouTube video-makers 55% of any ad dollars attached to their videos. And while YouTube creators have spent years complaining about that split, it's still the best deal in town.

Why haven't other platforms tried to do the same thing? I ask them all the time. Sometimes they'll mention that it's difficult to figure out how to share revenue for videos you swipe past in a vertical feed. But the real answer is that they've found they don't have to — why pay for something you can get for free? The margins are way better.

Even YouTube, the one platform that built real economics for creators, is backing away a bit. Shorts — its TikTok clone — gives creators a smaller cut, and ties payouts to a shared pool of ad money, not their actual videos. The message is clear: Even the platform that started out sharing the pie would like to keep more of it.

Why not? It works for Meta, and everyone else.

Nvidia is navigating some growing pains as its enterprise software sales team onboards massive clients in highly regulated industries.

Nvidia has been hitting astronomic highs amid the AI boom and even became the first $5 trillion market cap company last month.

At the same time, internal emails sent this summer by senior sales employees in its Worldwide Field Operations — which works with customers to deploy its technology — reveal it's contending with some hurdles as it tries to tell clients a "comprehensive software story" and sell those products alongside its highly sought-after AI hardware.

"Everyone is hacking their own decks together and we need to come up with one company message," one of the emails said.

The emails refer to sales of Nvidia AI Enterprise (NVAIE) and other software products, including Run:ai, which helps companies manage GPUs; Omniverse, a platform for simulating 3D worlds; and vGPU, which enables multiple workers to share GPUs.

Nvidia AI Enterprise is a suite of tools that helps clients make their own AI apps. It was launched in 2021 and designed to run with Nvidia's AI chips and CUDA, a Nvidia software package that allows the chips to handle a wide range of computing tasks. NVAIE's customer list includes Nasdaq, the IRS, and AT&T.

These internal discussions focus on the sale of those Nvidia business software products — not CUDA.

Nvidia declined to comment.

Nvidia specializes in designing GPUs and other AI hardware, which is the company's main business, and it doesn't break out revenues for business software in earnings reports.

While software is a smaller part of its business, it helps the company generate recurring revenue for a wider range of AI products across both hardware and software and deepen customer dependence.

Despite some hiccups, Nvidia is forecasting healthy software sales.

One internal email, sent in July, features a sales chart for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 in North and Latin America that shows stand-alone software is projected to hit 110% of sales targets. Software sold alongside hardware was expected to reach only 39% of its goal.

Overall, software sales forecasts were $78.7 million for the quarter, driven by NVAIE, which was forecast to hit 186% of the target.

The July email states Nvidia's sales partners and account managers need to develop a "comprehensive software story" around NVAIE and other software products. It mentions plans to create a workshop for customers to use NVAIE and other product libraries to plan potential AI ventures.

An email in August detailed the need for additional education — both internally and when negotiating with clients.

"Biggest pain point will be educating [a prospective client's] procurement and legal teams on what our AI Enterprise software is/isn't," the August email reads.

That email also says there is a "fundamental disconnect" between Nvidia and clients' legal and procurement teams in understanding Nvidia's software sales processes during negotiations — "particularly within highly regulated industries," such as finance and healthcare.

Data security and indemnity obligations, which are Nvidia's legal responsibility in the event that a client is sued, were other sticking points in negotiations, according to the August email.

Other concerns included requesting higher damages caps — the maximum amount that Nvidia would have to pay if something goes wrong — than Nvidia is comfortable with.

Nvidia is far from alone in contending with uneven AI adoption, as some companies view the white-hot technology as too early to deploy widely, according to a recent Goldman Sachs report.

Millions of Americans could see their health insurance premiums climb by a staggering average of 75% next year.

Enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies — which lower the cost of marketplace coverage for middle- and low-income households — are set to expire December 31. And, without a healthcare spending agreement from Congress, it's likely they won't be renewed. With open enrollment underway for those plans, Americans could be facing a new round of insurance sticker shock.

Extending these ACA tax credits has been a key goal of Democrats, contributing to the stalemate at the heart of the recently-ended government shutdown. While the government reopened on November 12 after a record 43 days, lawmakers failed to take action on the subsidies, although the deal reopening the government provides for a fresh debate over them next month. They also didn't reverse President Donald Trump's changes to Medicaid, another goal for Democrats.

For Americans, this all could mean less access to health insurance and higher costs for care.

Low- and middle-income households will feel the brunt of losing enhanced ACA subsidies.

Passed in 2021 under the Biden administration, the expanded tax credits boosted the amount of relief that Americans on marketplace plans could receive. Over the past decade, marketplace enrollment has jumped from 11 to over 24 million. This is partially because the enhanced subsidies were available to middle-income Americans up to 400% of the poverty line — which is $128,600 for a family of four — making marketplace plans more affordable.

Without these credits in place, people on ACA plans could see their out-of-pocket premium costs increase by an average of over 75%, a KFF analysis shows. Some enrollees would see their financial relief shrink and others would be disqualified entirely, depending on their income, with some premiums increasing by over $1,000 annually. On top of the direct loss of the enhanced subsidies, many insurers are likely to increase premiums to offset a projected decline in enrollment among healthier Americans.

Last year, nearly 20 million Americans received these enhanced ACA subsidies.

Medicaid recipients could also see an increase in their healthcare costs. Despite negotiations and the government shutdown, Congress didn't agree to reverse Trump's changes to that program from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

In the legislation, the president called for new Medicaid qualifications that would require non-exempt Americans to work 80 hours a month to qualify for insurance. The law also limits the amount of money states can funnel from provider taxes toward Medicaid. This means that hospitals will lose funding and some Medicaid recipients will experience higher out-of-pocket costs over the next several years.

Hospitals in rural areas and low-income Americans are likely to be highly impacted. Most Medicaid recipients live near the federal poverty line, though the exact threshold varies by state. As of mid-2025, about 83 million Americans were enrolled in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program.

The demise of a key consumer protection agency could push relief for student-loan borrowers further out of reach.

Attorneys for Russell Vought, acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, wrote in a legal filing on November 10 that the administration "anticipates exhausting" the CFPB's available funds in early 2026, meaning that after that point, the agency created in 2011 to protect Americans from another financial crisis will be defunct.

Vought wrote in a memo that the CFPB's funding structure, which relies on money from the Federal Reserve, is not constitutional, marking the Trump administration's most significant step to date in attempting to shut down the agency. Vought argued that the agency can only draw from the Fed when the central bank is turning a profit, which it has not done in recent years.

Getting rid of the CFPB would remove a level of oversight on financial institutions — and also raises increased risks for student-loan borrowers, John Rao, a senior attorney with the National Consumer Law Center, told Business Insider.

"Earlier administrations have worked closely with the CFPB to ensure that servicers comply with the contracts they have to service student loans, and also to make sure that the laws are carried out as they should," Rao said. "And I don't think any of us have any confidence at this point that that's going to occur."

Since the CFPB was created, it has fined student-loan servicers for misleading borrowers about payments and debt relief, sued major student-loan lenders, and returned millions of dollars to borrowers who the CFPB determined were affected by predatory behavior. It also took on private student debt — the CFPB sued servicer PHEAA in 2024 over accusations that it illegally collected borrowers' private loans that were already discharged through bankruptcy.

The agency's work, however, was halted soon after President Donald Trump took office. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent ordered CFPB employees to cease most of their work in February, and in an April memo, the agency's chief legal officer said that the CFPB will "deprioritize" student-loan oversight.

Should the CFPB run out of funding next year, Rao said that oversight of the student-loan industry would likely fall into the hands of the states, and the level of oversight would vary depending on each attorney general's priorities.

"A lot of those offices are strapped for resources," Rao said. "So it would be hard to say that they would be an equal replacement for the CFPB, but that is a possibility, and that's not going to happen in every state."

The Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that the CFPB's funding is constitutional, siding with the agency over payday lenders who brought the lawsuit. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who helped create the CFPB, said in a statement that Vought's latest move to shut down the CFPB is "plainly illegal, and federal judges have already rejected his fringe theory. If the courts continue to uphold the law, Vought will fail again."

With or without the CFPB, student-loan oversight has dwindled this year. The Department of Education has slashed its staff as part of Trump's larger goal to shut down the agency altogether, meaning there are limited resources to ensure student-loan servicers are complying with their contracts and meeting their obligations to borrowers.

Still, the department announced in September that it would develop a new "common manual" intended to serve as a centralized place for servicing and debt collection practices, with the idea that consistent guidelines for borrowers and servicers would make it easier for the department to pursue enforcement actions.

Oversight over the industry will become more critical next year; the Trump administration is set to implement its sweeping changes to student-loan repayment plans, which include new borrowing caps on graduate and professional student loans and fewer repayment plan options.

Rao said that, absent the CFPB, servicers will face less pressure from regulators to ensure they're following the law.

"Things could get worse rather than better because there's not effectively a regulator, another regulator saying you need to do this," Rao said.

A leadership shakeup at what was once Europe's most valuable company is likely to be cemented Friday as Novo Nordisk's controlling shareholder tightens it's grip on the weight-loss drugmaker, even as minority shareholders express discontent.

Novo has found itself in an increasingly chaotic situation as of late, with shares plunging and investor confidence waning, as its role as the leading player in the highly lucrative weight-loss space is being called into question.

The maker of diabetes and weight-loss drugs last month announced an Extraordinary General Meeting for Nov. 14 to replace its independent board members, including Chair Helge Lund, after it became impossible to reach an agreement between the views of the current board and the Novo Nordisk foundation board — the company's majority shareholder.

Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), one of the larger minority shareholders, said earlier this week it would abstain from voting at Friday's EGM, indicating discontent. Other shareholders, such as California State Teachers' Retirement System, have also said they'll vote against the proposal. NBIM and CalSTRS both declined to comment further.

Lund will be replaced by company veteran Lars Rebien Sørensen, already chair of the Foundation board. The 71-year-old also served as Novo Nordisk CEO between 2000 and 2016.

The foundation also proposed Cees de Jong to become vice chair and Mikael Dolsten, Britt Meelby Jensen and Stephan Engels to become members.

Early Friday, Novo said Dolsten, formerly head of R&D at Pfizer, had decided to withdraw his candidacy to the board due to personal circumstances. Novo shares were down 1.8% to $312.90 in morning trading.

"It is rare that a company of that scale to make that degree of change that quickly," Andrew Pettigrew, Emeritus professor at University of Oxford, and an expert of theories of change, told CNBC.

"It's usually precipitated by some awful crisis, which is throwing them off a cliff, but probably also a period when they were blind to what was going on underneath them. In other words, they were surprised by a sudden change, and it usually takes that to overthrow an existing power group in a company, especially if they've been in power for a long time," Pettigrew added.

The current board was "too slow in recognizing the significance of the market changes in the United States," Sørensen told analysts at a call following the announcement, adding that two more members would be announced in due course.

Novo is broadly viewed as having fallen behind U.S. peer Eli Lilly which has rapidly taken market share from Novo, as its rival drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound have shown more pronounced weight loss at the highest dose.

"It's a matter of urgency and scope," Sørensen said in October about the proposed changes to the board, however also saying the foundation is "fully aligned" behind Novo's current strategy under new CEO Mike Doustdar.

Another rationale for the board cull is that a new configuration would bring in more people with direct experience from a U.S. consumer perspective to help navigate the challenging market. It comes amid increasing competition both from Eli Lilly and so-called compounding pharmacies that make cheaper copycat version of the drugs, and a shift towards direct-to-consumer sales.  

Like for many pharmaceutical companies, the U.S. is Novo's largest market. In the first nine months of 2025, the U.S. market accounted for 56% of total sales, measured in Danish kroner.

Analysts, however, have expressed scepticism that the new board will bring in the intended experience. "On balance, it might seem the new board actually possesses less rather than more commercial, large pharma expertise," Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Papadakis said.

Novo shares have fallen 12% since the board shakeup was announced and have lost 58% since the start of this year. Last week, the company reported third-quarter results that missed estimates, and lowered the upper range of its full-year guidance citing slower growth expectations for Ozempic and Wegovy.

It's but one of many dramatic happenings taking place at the Danish pharma giant lately.

"There have been so many moves this year that show Novo as a conflicted company," noted Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen. "With such a new direct-to-patient market emerging as a critical piece of future obesity drug sales growth, and compounders remaining a real competitor in the market, it's not hard to imagine that the boards and management might not have the same vision for how Novo should respond," she added.

Over the weekend, Novo pulled out from a dramatic bidding war against U.S. giant Pfizer over an experimental weight-loss drug by clinical-stage biotech Metsera, stepping away from a deal analysts have described as unusual.

The board changes come just months after Novo appointed Doustdar as chief executive, booting former CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, in part blaming him for the current trajectory of the company and its shares. Doustdar has since announced a reorganisation, including laying off over 10% of employees globally.

British government bond yields rose sharply on Friday following reports Finance Minister Rachel Reeves is no longer planning to raise income tax rates in the Autumn Budget later this month.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt rose around 12 basis points in early trade, before paring gains to trade at 4.498%. Yields and prices move inversely to one another.

The moves came as investors reacted to a report from the Financial Times of an income tax U-turn. The Treasury was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC on Friday morning.

U.K. stocks were also lower. The FTSE 100 index shed over 1% at 8:54 a.m. in London (3:54 a.m. ET), with Lloyds, Natwest, and Barclays banks occupying the bottom of the index, each losing more than 2.8%.

Reeves had spent the past week apparently laying the groundwork for a manifesto-breaking rise in income tax, which split Labour party lawmakers and led to further turmoil in the already embattled party, whose leader Prime Minister Keir Starmer has dismal approval ratings. 

A proposed 2p national income increase was to be offset by a 2p reduction in national insurance. There are now expectations, however, that the £30 billion ($39.5 billion) hole in the government's budget will be filled by a patchwork of smaller rises.  

It could be a "fiscal reckoning" as a patchwork approach will put pressure on the gilt market, Wren Sterling's investment chief Rory McPherson told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Friday.  

"Within the U.K., if we have more of the smaller taxes being targeted as part of the programme from Rachel Reeves, I think that's going to put more pressure on the government, more pressure on them to go back to the bond markets and ask for more money, which in turn puts more pressure up on yields," McPherson said.

He added that there has been a "big march down" in yields but now "we're pulling away that that." 

Volatility this year has left long-term borrowing costs hovering at their highest level since the late 1990s, with U.K. debt having the heftiest price tag in the G7. 

McPherson said that the Bank of England will still be able to make an interest rate cut after the budget, if it wants to. Other investors appear to have curbed their optimism, with bets on cuts shedding six basis points compared with Thursday, according to data compiled by LSEG.

The Autumn Budget is expected on Nov. 26.

U.S. markets had their worst day since Oct. 10. That marks a sharp reversal for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which shed 1.65% to settle at 47,457.22, a day after it closed above 48,000 for the first time. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 lost 1.66% and the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.29%.

The slump in stocks can partly be traced to a turnaround in sentiment regarding artificial intelligence. Tech behemoths such as Nvidia, Broadcom and Oracle slumped, with the last losing more than one-third in value since it rocketed 36% in September.

Investors, it seems, are growing worried over the high valuations of tech names, as well as the gigantic amount of capital expenditure they are committing to — with some, like Oracle, having to take on debt to fulfil those obligations.

Uncertainty over an interest rate cut in December is also putting a downer on Wall Street. It's a coin toss as to whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy then, according to the CME FedWatch tool. That's a huge difference from a month ago, when traders were pricing in a 95.5% chance of a December cut.

Not having October's employment and inflation numbers, and possibly never getting them, means the Fed lacks visibility into the state of the economy — and whether it should try to support the labor market or continue reining in inflation.

After all, flying blind makes it hard to see where you'll land. As of now, that applies both to the Fed and investors trying to navigate the still-hazy ambitions of tech companies.

Stocks pull back on AI sell-off. All major U.S. indexes fell Thursday stateside dragged down by heavyweight technology names. Asia-Pacific markets also retreated Friday. South Korea's Kospi sank more than 3% and investors sold off SoftBank stock for the third straight day.

China's economic slump deepens. The country's fixed-asset investment, which includes real estate, shrank 1.7% in the January-to-October period. The last time this measure contracted was in 2020 during the pandemic, according to Wind Information.

A December rate cut doesn't seem so certain. A lack of economic data because of the government shutdown — now ended — is complicating the Fed's decision. Fed official Susan Collins on Wednesday said holding rates will "likely be appropriate."

Air India losses to weigh on Singapore Airlines. Singapore's national carrier reported Thursday that its second-quarter earnings plunged 82%. Analysts think profits might remain muted because of persistent losses at Air India, in which SIA has a 25.1% stake.

[PRO] Be wary of stocks with zero revenue. The year-to-date rally in stocks means some could be trading at elevated prices. CNBC Pro found a few names with market caps of at least $1 billion — but haven't generated revenue over the last 12 months.

CEO of Southeast Asia's largest bank says AI adoption already paying off: ‘It's not hope, it's now'

"The proliferation of generative AI has been transformative for us," DBS CEO Tan Su Shan told CNBC on the sidelines of Singapore Fintech Week. She adding that the company was experiencing a "snowballing effect" of benefits thanks to machine learning. 

Tan expects AI adoption to bring DBS an overall revenue bump of more than 1 billion Singapore dollars (about $768 million) this year, compared to SG$750 million in 2024. That assessment is based on about 370 AI use cases powered by over 1,500 models throughout its business.

Transportation Security Administration officers "who served with exemplary service" during the 43-day government shutdown will receive $10,000 bonus checks, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced on Thursday.

She was seen onstage in Houston giving out bumper $10,000 bonuses to TSA agents.

Noem said this reward was in addition to back pay, which agents are set to receive in the coming days.

Before giving out the checks to around a dozen staff standing behind her, Noem lauded TSA officers who'd worked without pay for "outstanding patriotism and service."

"We're going to continue to evaluate every single employee that helped during the shutdown and stepped up and went above and beyond," Noem said, adding that employees will be rewarded if they performed "exceptional service."

It is unclear how many TSA agents will get this bonus.

DHS said in a press release on Thursday that it is paying for these bonuses using carryover funds from fiscal year 2025.

"This funding is available thanks to President Trump and Secretary Noem's commitment to fiscal responsibility, enabling DHS to save the American taxpayer over $13.2 billion since President Trump returned to office," the press release said.

Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection, and TSA did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Noem also said on Thursday that Americans were "damaged and harmed by what Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries and the Democratic Party did," blaming congressional Democrats for triggering the shutdown.

In an earlier clip in October, Noem said TSA operations had been disrupted and that most employees were working without pay because "Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government."

Noem's move comes after President Donald Trump recommended on Monday that air traffic controllers who did not call in sick during the shutdown should receive a $10,000 bonus.

"For those that did nothing but complain, and took time off, even though everyone knew they would be paid, IN FULL, shortly into the future, I am NOT HAPPY WITH YOU," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Monday, adding that those who continued working are "GREAT PATRIOTS."

Air traffic controllers who failed to come back to work immediately would be substantially "docked," Trump said, presumably referring to their salary.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Tuesday that air traffic controllers could be penalized if they stopped working before missing a paycheck.

The government shutdown ended on Wednesday after a prolonged back-and-forth in the Senate and House. Some Democratic lawmakers broke with the party line this week and voted with their GOP colleagues to end the shutdown, funding the government through January 30.

The 43-day shutdown was the longest in US history. It caused widespread travel chaos, as air traffic controllers faced staffing shortages, and FAA flight reductions led to widespread cancellations.

On November 6, the FAA ordered airlines to cut flights by 4% at 40 major airports, a reduction that took effect last Friday.The FAA added that the flight reductions would be mandated to increase to 10% by Friday to "maintain the highest standards of safety."

But even with the shutdown now over, travel disruptions are expected to stretch into Thanksgiving, which is typically the busiest travel period of the year.

Pressed on when flight schedules might return to normal, Duffy said Tuesday that delays would likely continue even after the shutdown ended, citing ongoing shortages of air traffic controllers.

Business Insider Edition 

Rising violence in Mali has forced Ivory Coast to implement an emergency border lockdown. Officials say the measure is necessary to manage the sudden influx of refugees fleeing attacks in the southern part of the Sahel nation.


        Ivory Coast has strengthened security along its northern border following an unexpected surge in refugees fleeing violence in neighbouring Mali. 



        The development, described by authorities as “several unusual flows of refugees,” reflects the persistent volatility in the Sahel and its spillover effects on coastal West African nations.
    


        According to a statement issued on Thursday, Ivory Coast's National Security Council (NSC) linked the sudden influx to “attacks against civilians by armed terrorist groups in several areas of southern Mali.”
    


        The council said it has moved swiftly to ensure that those arriving are properly documented, noting that “The National Security Council has instructed its Executive Secretary to take all necessary steps to register these asylum seekers.”
    


        In addition to the humanitarian response, the government has directed the military to increase its presence along the northern frontier.
    


        The NSC added that “the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces has been instructed to take appropriate measures to strengthen security at our country's northern borders,” signalling heightened concern about potential cross-border infiltration by armed groups.
    


        The refugee influx arrives at a pivotal moment for Côte d'Ivoire, which recently held its presidential election on 25 October 2025 and continues to garner international recognition for its sound economic management.
    


        The country has been widely lauded for maintaining macroeconomic stability and a predictable policy environment that reduces investor risk, strengthening its position as one of West Africa's most attractive investment destinations.
    


        In 2024, Côte d'Ivoire ranked third in Africa for foreign direct investment, drawing $3.80 billion, a remarkable 53 percent year-on-year increase compared to the previous year.
    


        This momentum has carried into 2025, highlighted by the commissioning of a 3-million-metric-tonne Dangote Cement plant in Attingué.
    


        However, the escalating instability in Mali continues to cast a shadow across the region. The recent surge of refugees is linked to renewed attacks by Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), the al-Qaeda-affiliated coalition at the heart of Mali's insurgency.
    


        Formed in 2017 through the merger of several jihadist factions, JNIM has steadily expanded its operations beyond Mali into Burkina Faso, Niger, Ghana, Benin, Togo, and Ivory Coast.
    


        In October, the group carried out its first confirmed attack in Nigeria, killing a soldier and seizing ammunition and cash.
    


        The insurgent group has also sought to pressure Mali's military authorities by blocking key transport routes from Senegal and Ivory Coast, creating fuel shortages and causing severe economic strain in Bamako.
    


        As the crisis deepens, Mali has suspended school and university activities nationwide due to the worsening fuel shortage.
    


        Several countries, including Italy, the US, and France, have issued travel warnings to their citizens, citing growing security risks as the government faces mounting pressure from al-Qaeda-linked insurgents enforcing the blockade.



        The latest assault on the town of Loulouni, roughly 50km from the Ivorian border, forced hundreds of residents to flee this week, adding to the humanitarian burden on neighbouring countries.
    


        Ivory Coast, which already hosts about 90,000 refugees from Burkina Faso, now faces additional demands with the arrival of Malian nationals.

When high-powered Democratic attorney Kathryn Ruemmler — now the top lawyer at Goldman Sachs — needed to vent about Donald Trump's rise in politics, she turned to their mutual acquaintance, Jeffrey Epstein.

"Trump is living proof of the adage that it is better to be lucky than smart," she told Epstein in an email in August 2015, while planning a visit to his Manhattan mansion.

Later, Ruemmler expressed alarm about Trump's climb in the polls.

"The Trump success is seriously scary," she wrote in February 2016.

The two chatted frequently about the 2016 presidential election and transition. (In one email, Ruemmler seemed to criticize Trump's Cabinet picks as "moronic.") They shared gripes well into Trump's first term, as well as news articles on everything from Trump's approach to Big Tech to the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

"Trump is truly stupid," Ruemmler wrote in one 2017 email. "Trump is so gross," she said a few months earlier.

The emails, released by the House Oversight Committee this week, were exchanged during Trump's first term in office and before Ruemmler joined Goldman Sachs five years ago.

Ruemmler has previously said she regrets her association with Epstein.

"​​The personal emails exclusively occurred before Kathy worked at Goldman Sachs, when Ms. Ruemmler was the global head of the White Collar Defense practice at Latham and Watkins," Goldman Sachs spokesperson Tony Fratto told Business Insider Thursday. "As we've said before, and has been repeatedly reported, Ms. Ruemmler had a professional relationship with Mr. Epstein when she was at Latham & Watkins."

The newly released emails suggest a deeper relationship between Ruemmler and Epstein than was previously known.

Ruemmler confided in Epstein when a rival law firm tried to poach her, when looking for a New York City apartment, and when she was being vetted for consideration as attorney general of the United States. She also turned to him for minor issues, like what it's like to fly Emirates, the airline.

"When I go to Dubai on Emirates, do I need to go first or is business class good enough given that I only care about slepeping?" Ruemmler asked Epstein after telling him Apple had hired her for a patent lawsuit.

Epstein said "biz is ok," but offered her a ride on a friend's private jet. Ruemmler said she'd stick with the commercial airline.

The exchanges span from 2014, shortly after Ruemmler left her job as White House Counsel under President Barack Obama, until June 2019, a month before Epstein was arrested on sex-trafficking charges. Nothing in the emails, which the House Oversight Committee obtained from Epstein's estate, suggests Ruemmler had knowledge of the alleged conduct.

At the time, Ruemmler worked at the Big Law firm Latham & Watkins, which had previously said Epstein was never a client of the firm; it did not respond to requests for comment about the latest emails.

Ruemmler was widely viewed as a legal star in the Democratic Party. She was floated as a possible Supreme Court pick and had served as a lawyer in Bill Clinton's White House.

Ruemmler moved to Goldman Sachs in 2020 and now serves as the investment bank's chief legal officer and general counsel. She serves on Goldman Sachs' Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee, according to the bank's website.

Epstein — a financier with connections to titans of finance, science, and global politics — killed himself in his Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial in 2019. He had previously pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting an underage girl for sex.

It is unclear from the emails whether Epstein ever hired Ruemmler as a lawyer. At least three emails from Ruemmler to Epstein were redacted for what was described as "privilege." A lawyer for the executors of Epstein's estate, which provided the emails to the House Oversight Committee, didn't respond to a request for comment about the redactions.

On several occasions, Epstein looped Ruemmler into email discussions with other prominent attorneys he had personally hired, including Alan Dershowitz, Ken Starr, Martin Weinberg, and Darren Indyke.

Epstein and Ruemmler often emailed each other asking to speak on the phone. He included her in emails with other attorneys about responding to press inquiries about his relationship with Trump and Clinton. Epstein also forwarded to her a plan that the writer Michael Wolff presented to him in 2016 about countering the impending negative press from the James Patterson book "Filthy Rich," which is about Epstein.

In a January 2019 draft of his will, Epstein named Ruemmler as the backup executor to his estate, according to a copy released by the House Oversight Committee earlier this year. The final edition of the will, completed while Epstein was incarcerated and shortly before his death, replaced her with Boris Nikolic, a former science advisor to Bill Gates. Epstein's estate was ultimately co-executed by his first choice: Indyke and accountant Richard Kahn.

In October 2014, news publications reported that Ruemmler turned down an offer from then-President Barack Obama to serve as the head of the Justice Department, replacing Eric Holder.

Some of the most intense discussions between Epstein and Ruemmler took place in the weeks leading up to the public announcement that Holder would step down, as Ruemmler considered whether to take his job. Epstein compared the indecision to Shakespeare's "Hamlet."

Ruemmler said she had recently found a high-rent apartment in New York. And she was unsure she would secure enough votes to be confirmed in the US Senate.

"I signed the lease in my name for a year, so I think I am pretty stuck," she told Epstein. "It is $11,000 a month and Latham reimburses me $8000 a month."

Days before The White House's public announcement about Holder stepping down, Ruemmler confided in Epstein that she wanted to lead the nation's most powerful law enforcement agency.

"I think I should do it," she wrote.

At another point in the discussion, Epstein advised Ruemmler to "talk to boss" about taking the job.

"Agreed, but I need to be prepared to say yes before I talk to him," Ruemmler responded.

In the same conversation, Epstein offered to introduce her to powerful people in his network, including Leon Black, Woody Allen, Peter Thiel, Larry Summers, and Nikolic.

Earlier, in 2016, Ruemmler had sought other career advice from Epstein. She forwarded emails from a recruiter with Hogan Lovells, another big law firm, seeking to hire her.

Epstein suggested she push for more details about compensation.

"ask him for a financial proposal," he wrote. "Subject to Mutually acceptable conditions."

Some of the emails are cryptic. On one occasion, Epstein asked, "how did musk call go?"

"Well, I think, but not because of me," Ruemmler responded. "The existential crisis thing is not a PMS or menopausal pose."

In a July 2018 email, Ruemmler sent a context-free message to Epstein about Trump.

"​​Your boy should distance himself from Trump. Quick," she wrote.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Levi Pells, 32, a life coach and retreat leader in Japan. It's been edited for length and clarity.

I spent five years as a recruiter in Tokyo.

From my high-rise apartment in Roppongi, with Tokyo Tower glowing in the distance, I had everything I thought I wanted: a steady paycheck, a girlfriend, and the trappings of success. Yet I felt completely alone.

My achievements were measurable; my happiness wasn't. So I walked away — from Tokyo, and the life I'd built — to start over in the Japanese countryside.

I was born in Texas and raised in Hawaii. As a teenager, I became interested in the Japanese language and culture. I dated a Japanese girl and watched a bunch of movies and TV shows. After a family trip to Japan when I was 20, I was hooked.

After graduating from Boston College, I joined the JET Program, a government initiative that sends foreign graduates to teach English in Japan.

While most wanted to be placed in Tokyo or Kyoto, I requested a location that was remote. They sent me to a mountain village on Shikoku Island. The village had about 670 people, and it took an hour to get to the nearest supermarket.

The village taught me patience and humility. Every interaction required effort; even buying bread was a small victory in broken Japanese. My classes were small, and I joined a local volleyball team composed mostly of people in their 70s.

It was the most connected I'd ever felt.

After two years, someone at a career fair pitched me the dream of recruitment in Tokyo: fast money and faster promotions. I went for it. My second interview landed me a job at a recruitment agency, where I began cold-calling investment bankers at firms like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan.

Within a few years, I was managing a small team and earning more than I ever imagined. I was surrounded by ambition, but also exhaustion. My happiness rose and fell with my quarterly performance.

When my father was diagnosed with late-stage cancer in 2020, I flew back to Hawaii before flights were grounded. I stayed nine months, working remotely and learning to surf with my brother on empty beaches.

For the first time in years, I felt grounded.

When I returned to Japan, I realized that the one thing I was certain of was my desire to surf.

So I left Tokyo for Chiba, a quiet beach town an hour away. I surfed at sunrise, worked remotely, and spent weekends helping local farmers. Covered in dirt and sweat, I felt more fulfilled than I ever had in an office. That's when I realized I didn't just want a new job — I wanted a new life.

I quit recruiting and started my own coaching practice in 2024. This year, I hosted my first digital detox retreat.

Most of my clients are expats in high-pressure jobs — recruiters, consultants, UX designers — who want to disconnect from screens and reconnect with themselves.

Retreat activities I've organized include organic farming, meditation, yoga, sauna sessions, cold plunges, art therapy, and group coaching. Meals and accommodations are included, often in renovated countryside homes near the coast.

In May, four people joined my first retreat — one a former coaching client, the others from LinkedIn. I charged 58,000 yen, about $380, each and barely broke even. But their positive feedback convinced me I was onto something.

Since then, I've run three retreats at two venues, raised the price to 85,000 yen, and now make a profit of about $500 to $600 per session. I pay local partners — the family who hosts meals, a yoga teacher, a sound healer, and a sauna business — about $1,000 per retreat.

In addition to the retreats, I offer one-day farm excursions, priced at $120 for adults and $60 for children, which include lunch at a farmhouse and optional temple walks or visits to hot springs. I also offer life coaching sessions and consulting for recruiters. I even sell peanuts with local farmers — a random but fun side gig.

At my peak as a recruiter, I earned 10 times what I do now, but I also spent far more. With lower costs and a slower pace, even a fraction of that feels like enough. I'm aiming to earn enough to cover my $2,800 monthly living costs.

I now live in a two-story apartment near the ocean with my girlfriend. The view isn't glamorous, but I'm minutes from the surf and surrounded by rice fields.

The community here feels closer than what I had in the city. I cook most meals at home with vegetables from my neighbors and meet friends — both Japanese and foreign — for morning surf sessions, followed by a cup of green tea.

My girlfriend works for the government and is an avid hunter. We spend weekends hiking, foraging, and cooking what we catch. If we ever had kids, I'd want to raise them in Japan, maybe we'd throw in a few years in Hawaii, too.

My life now follows a rhythm that feels honest and alive: far from skyscrapers, deadlines, and performance reviews.

 The bitcoin faithful are turning to one of their most vocal evangelists for a sign amid an intensifying market rout. His message? HODL.


 We're talking about Michael Saylor, chief of Strategy (MSTR), the enterprise software company known for stockpiling bitcoin. The price of the world's most valuable cryptocurrency has been falling lately, and rumors broke out on social media that the company was selling amid the slide. Saylor dismissed those rumors, but the notion that latched onto the possibility that the man who might be bitcoin's best-known bull was turning tail shows the negativity radiating from the market at present.


 As X users started to fret, Saylor posted an image of himself on a life raft as a burning ship sank behind him. "HODL," he said, using an acronym for "hold on for dear life."


 The sell-off in risk assets this week—a bleed that the end of the U.S. government shutdown couldn't stem—has put a dent in the price of bitcoin and the narrative that it could be a useful hedge against stocks or a safe haven like gold. Bitcoin sank below $95,000 on Friday morning to levels not seen since early May. Some crypto-linked stocks diverged, with MicroStrategy declining about 4%, while Coinbase Global (COIN), and Robinhood (HOOD) were up at least 1%.


Bitcoin is sometimes considered a hedge against stocks, characterized as a portfolio diversification tool. Lately, it's been falling with the broader market as sentiment has soured.

 Saylor, who in recent months had forecast that bitcoin would climb to $150,000 by the end of the year, said Strategy was "buying quite a lot" lately in a Friday interview with CNBC. He also stopped short of providing a price target, though he said bitcoin over the long-term would "outperform" both gold and the S&P 500.


 "Obviously it's hard to make a forecast for the end of the year right now given what's happened over the past few weeks," he said.


 The cryptocurrency has erased almost all of its 2025 gains, lagging gold's 50%-plus climb and the broad market's 14% year-to-date rise. ETF investors appear to be in selling mode: Spot bitcoin funds including iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin (FBTC) collectively showed nearly $867 million in outflows yesterday, according to Farside Investors.


 Meanwhile, crypto watchers have become less sanguine about the market rout as investors rushed to sell. Vitaliy Shtyrkin, chief product officer at Estonia-headquartered platform B2BinPay, said sentiment weakened after bitcoin fell through a key technical support zone of $100,000 to $102,000. Dean Chen, an analyst at derivatives trading platform Bitunix, likened the latest decline as more than "a simple technical correction."


 Though Strategy might be buying at these levels—and just a few days ago, some experts sounded bullish as bitcoin seemed to bounce—others are sitting out. "We're in this awkward in-between zone. I don't want to be buying," All Star Charts' senior crypto analyst Louis Sykes said during an X live-stream discussing what to do about crypto now. "Just go play some golf."

The U.S. Department of Justice rounded up several convictions in its pursuit of domestic helpers in schemes by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to pocket large amounts of cryptocurrency, and it also seized assets from cyber heists targeting crypto platforms, the department said in a Friday statement.



The five guilty pleas announced by the DOJ were connected to individuals that aided North Korea in getting U.S. jobs for fraudulent information-technology workers, obtaining stolen U.S. identities for the workers and helping mask their geographic origin as the IT employees pulled down paychecks from dozens of U.S. businesses. Probes conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation "continue to expose the North Korean government's relentless campaign to evade U.S. sanctions and generate millions of dollars to fund its authoritarian regime and weapons programs,” said Assistant Director Roman Rozhavsky of the FBI's counterintelligence division, in a statement. He urged companies to improve their vetting of remote workers to counter this trend.



The authorities have also been steadily seizing crypto assets from bad actors around the world, marking another $15 million in Tether's USDT from North Korean sources on Friday. The assets are associated with cyber heists tied to the group known as Advanced Persistent Threat 38, which is allegedly connected to the North Korean military.Read More: North Korean Hackers Were Behind Crypto's Largest 'Theft of All Time'



Earlier this week, the DOJ and other federal agencies also announced a Scam Center Strike Force to target the centers of so-called pig-butchering scams, typically clustered in Southeast Asia and run by Chinese criminal organizations. The authorities said they'd seized another $80 million in stolen funds in that pursuit. Victims will be compensated from seized money, according to the DOJ.



What's not yet clear is how much of these seized crypto funds will end up in the reserves President Donald Trump has sought to establish as a long-term investment for the U.S. government. His administration has been working to stand up a so-called bitcoin strategic reserve to hold all BTC taken in during criminal and civil forfeitures, and Trump also directed the creation of a separate reserve to hold all other digital assets. However, officials working on those reserves have suggested congressional action may be required to formally institute the plan.

Oops, something went wrong

Strategy's co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor denied rumors that Strategy is selling its Bitcoin on X, after describing the firm's hunger for BTC as insatiable—no matter how far its price faults—in a Friday interview on CNBC.

The Bitcoin-buying firm will continue adding to its $62.3 billion stockpile, and remains undeterred by the asset's recent plunge below the $100,000 mark, he added.

“We are buying Bitcoin, [and] we'll report our next buys on Monday morning,” he said. “I think people will be pleasantly surprised. In fact, we've been accelerating our purchases.”

Meanwhile, onlookers speculated that Strategy could be selling its Bitcoin, citing on-chain movements identified by crypto intelligence platform Arkham Analytics. The movements could signal that Strategy is now using Coinbase as a custodian, Arkham added.

On prediction market Myriad, traders penciled in an 8% chance that Strategy would sell Bitcoin in 2025 on Friday, but those odds had jumped as high as 14% earlier in the day. (Disclaimer: Myriad Markets is a product of Decrypt's parent company, Dastan.)

Strategy has always maintained that it would never willingly sell Bitcoin, TD Cowen Analyst Lance Vitanza told Decrypt. There are conditions under which Strategy has acknowledged that it would essentially be forced to do so, but they are “highly unlikely,” he added.

Theoretically, Strategy could need to sell Bitcoin to satisfy the maturity of its debt, but the company doesn't have convertible bonds maturing until 2028, Vitanza noted.

The only selling that Saylor referenced on CNBC was on behalf of “OG holders,” who were taking profits at the $100,000 mark after sitting on their holdings for an extended period.

Last week, Strategy signaled that the debut of Euro-denominated preferred shares in Luxembourg would generate $715 million in proceeds.

Strategy Buys Bitcoin With Proceeds From Preferred Shares as Key Premium Evaporates

Strategy's stock price has dropped 32% over the past month as Bitcoin has shed a majority of this year's gains, with MSTR shares trading around $204, according to Yahoo Finance. Bitcoin recently changed hands at $96,365, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko, after falling to a six-month low under $95,000 earlier Friday.

Saylor said he's “fairly comfortable” with Bitcoin at its current price level, describing the asset's recent dip as something that formed a base for it to rally from. However, it's currently difficult to predict where the asset's price could be at the end of the year, he added.

In response to a question from CNBC's Joe Kernen, Saylor said the company is “always buying,” but there have been several periods where Strategy didn't announce a purchase, aligning with the end of each fiscal quarter. 

In addition to common stock, Strategy has issued a blend of products to fund its Bitcoin purchases, including convertible bonds and preferred shares that feature dividend payments.

The company's critics, including short sellers like James Chanos, have questioned the sustainability of Strategy's business, but Saylor conveyed confidence on Friday. 

Saylor said Strategy's balance sheet is stable, and that Bitcoin's price could fall 80% and the company would still be overcollateralized in relation to its debt. As of Friday, the company had raised $8.2 billion through convertible bonds, according to its website.

Since dividend payments on Strategy's preferred shares are declared by the board, Saylor added that there “is no credit default situation” for the products currently worth $7.6 billion.

As Bitcoin Plunges Below $95K, Is Crypto in a Bear Market?

Echoing Saylor's outlook on preferred shares, TD Cowen's Vitanza said “the company is not legally required to make any dividend payments,” but acknowledged that skipping or deferring payments “would obviously impact their ability to issue more preferred shares.”

What's more, Strategy has a dividend burden of around $735 million per year, and Vitanza said he would be “be very surprised if this were to become a legitimate issue.”

Saylor's remarks come as the company's go-to funding mechanism has lost its effectiveness. Historically, the company has issued common stock to grow its Bitcoin holdings, while capitalizing on a premium that its shares have over the value of its Bitcoin stockpile.

On Friday, Strategy had a market cap of $59 billion while owning $62.3 billion worth of Bitcoin, yielding a so-called mNAV, or a multiple-to-net asset value, of nearly 0.95x. Strategy's website places the informal metric around 1.2x, using a calculation that accounts for Strategy's debt.

The sharp rise in gold prices and the potential impact of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) on central bank balance sheets are among emerging areas in central bank accounting and disclosures which would gain prominence in coming days said Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Deputy Governor Shishir Chandra Murmu.

Stating that the recent sharp rise in gold prices has garnered a lot of attention and discussions globally with respect to its impact on the central bank balance sheets, Mr Murmu said this development needed wider discussion.

“The RBI conservatively revalues the gold holdings at 90% of the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) gold price. However, gold revaluation practices vary across countries and the impact of high movement in gold prices on central bank balance sheets and income needs wider discussion,” he said.

As of September 2025, the RBI held a total of about 880.8 tonnes of gold reserves valued at ₹95 billion. To keep gold prices in perspective, in the last 20 years, gold rates have gone up at CAGR of 12.5%. In the last 5-6 years, it has more than tripled, according to industry officials.

Mr. Murmu was delivering the keynote address at the first International Conference on Central Bank Accounting Practices on the subject Central Bank Accounting Practices: The Reserve Bank of India and Global Approaches. The event was organised by RBI jointly with the SEACEN Centre in Mumbai.

Mr. Murmu said the issue of potential impact of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) on central bank balance sheets had also been attracting lot of international research and discussions.

“Some research papers have tried to explore how the design choices for CBDCs adopted by central banks may shape people's behaviour with respect to adoption of CBDC and potential substitution of banknotes and/or bank deposits with CBDC,” he emphasised.

“It is also being discussed and debated globally whether and how this may impact central bank balance sheet structures and the need for liquidity operations,” the Deputy Governor pointed out.

He said these emerging aspects would require ongoing engagement and collaboration in future as central banks learn from their respective experiences. “We should work closely in these areas and share our experiences and research with each other, which will help all of us in making better decisions,” he told the audience.

On the accounting practice followed by the RBI, Mr. Murmu said since the entire ownership of RBI remains vested with the Government of India, the central bank prepares its financial statements and sets its accounting policies as per the RBI Act of 1934 and the RBI General Regulations of 1949.

“Over time, within this legal framework, these policies have evolved to keep up with changing needs and practices. The has a strong and resilient balance sheet, with adequate level of risk provisioning,” he said. “Over the years, RBI has consistently worked to align its accounting practices with global best practices, while staying true to core principles of prudence and conservatism,” he added.

Oops, something went wrong

BitMine Immersion Technologies, the leading Ethereum treasury company with more than $11 billion worth of the cryptocurrency, announced Friday that it has appointed Chi Tsang as CEO and board member.

Tsang, who succeeds previous CEO Jonathan Bates, was recently the founder and Managing Partner of venture fund m1720, and had previously spent a decade at HSBC, where he finished in 2022 as Head of Asia and TMT Global Banking.

"The transformation and innovation now facing Wall Street through blockchain and Ethereum mirror the explosion of opportunity that mobile phones and the internet unleashed on telecoms and technology in the 1990s," said Tsang, in a statement. "With its substantial Ethereum holdings and credibility with both Wall Street and the Ethereum ecosystem, BitMine is positioned to become a leading financial institution."

The firm also appointed a trio of new board members in Robert Sechan, Olivia Howe, and Jason Edgeworth.

BitMine Chairman Tom Lee, who has been the face of BitMine since its Ethereum pivot earlier this year, said in a statement that the new appointments "bring a unique blend of experience, insight, and leadership across technology, DeFi, and financial services, enabling BitMine to further position itself as the bridge between traditional capital markets and the supercycle Ethereum ecosystem."

Shares of BMNR are down about 4% on the day, recently changing hands just over $35. The firm's stock has fallen nearly 34% over the last month as crypto prices fall, diminishing the value of the company's ETH stash.

BitMine Stock Rises After Tom Lee's Firm Buys the Dip, Adding $389 Million in Ethereum

As of Monday, the company holds over 3.5 million ETH, currently valued around $11.2 billion, making it the largest corporate holder of Ethereum by far—significantly outpacing runner-up SharpLink Gaming, with about $2.75 billion worth.

Ethereum is down 5.5% over the last day to a recent price of $3,200, pushing its 30-day plunge to more than 20%. The price of ETH has fallen by 35% since the asset hit a new all-time high price just shy of $5,000 in August.

Users on Myriad—a prediction market platform operated by Decrypt's parent company, Dastan—remain slightly optimistic about Ethereum's next move, giving a nearly 53% chance that ETH is more likely to rise to $4,000 next rather than fall to $2,500.

Earlier this week, Myriad users penciled in a 77% chance of a rise to $4,000.

Canary Capital will likely hit pause on new crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings for the remainder of the year, with CEO Steve McClurg saying the firm has already submitted applications for every token currently eligible under existing regulatory guidelines.



Speaking in an interview with CoinDesk, McClurg said the XRP ETF launched this week and a pending Solana SOL$142.57 product round out the company's current slate.



 “After that, we will have filed everything that falls under the generic listing standards,” McClurg said, referring to the SEC's framework that allows certain crypto-backed exchange-traded funds to move forward without lengthy review processes.



Under these standards, a crypto asset must meet criteria like having a futures market that has traded for more than six months. That bar leaves only a short list of assets Canary believes can currently qualify.



McClurg noted that the firm will now shift its focus toward managing existing products and awaiting changes in how the Securities and Exchange Commission treats crypto ETFs. For any new launches, “we're just waiting for them to qualify, either under generics or via a 19b-4 approval,” he said, referencing a separate, more involved process for ETF authorization.



On Thursday, Canary brought the first spot XRP ETF to the market, which debuted with $58 million in trading volume, making it one of the most successful ETF launches this year, according to Bloomberg's ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.



McClurg believes the XRP fund could outperform its Solana counterparts, which launched earlier this month, as the XRP network is more familiar to traditional finance players than Solana, which is more embedded in the crypto-native ecosystem, he said.

Gold's soaring prices and central bank buying are prompting a global review of how gold is valued on sovereign balance sheets. The Reserve Bank of India is revaluing its gold at 90% of the LBMA price. Practices vary worldwide, necessitating wider discussion on the impact of gold price movements. This comes as India's gold reserves surpass $100 billion.

Decentralized finance heavyweight Uniswap introduced Continuous Clearing Auctions (CCA), a new protocol aiming to facilitate token offerings through its infrastructure.

According to a Thursday announcement, Uniswap's CCA “helps teams bootstrap liquidity on Uniswap v4 and find the market price for new and low-liquidity tokens.” The company said this was just “the first of several tools” it is building to help projects launch and deepen token liquidity on the platform.

The announcement coincided with preparations for the first CCA-enabled sale. Privacy-focused Aztec Network opened its community-only AZTEC token sale on Thursday, with a public phase scheduled for Dec. 2.

The Aztec team claimed that it has “taken the community access that made the 2017 ICO era great and made it even better.” The team reportedly worked alongside Uniswap to develop the new protocol and “prioritize fair access, permissionless, on-chain access to community members and the general public pre-launch.” The team said the AZTEC token will be 100% community-owned once tokens unlock.

Uniswap and Aztec did not respond to requests for comment. 

A new token sale system

Uniswap said in the press release that “liquidity formation often happens behind closed doors,” leading to “information gaps, privileges a few players,” and sometimes “thin and unstable” markets. With CCA, the two partners hope to implement an onchain native market creation with transparent pricing, bidding and settlement, as well as gradual price discovery and automatic liquidity seeding to Uniswap's decentralized exchange (DEX).

“No gatekeepers or offchain deals,” Uniswap said.

CCA sales begin with projects defining the number of tokens on sale, the starting price, and the duration of the auction. They can also support running in tranches, verification tools such as ZK Passport (a privacy-enhanced, zero-knowledge proof-based Know Your Customer implementation), or entirely custom modules.

Users can then place their bids, specifying a maximum price and a total spend. Bids cannot be withdrawn while in range, but there is no limit on the number of bids. Each bid is automatically spread across the remaining blocks of the auction and only fills if the block's clearing price is at or below the limit price.

CCA's price discovery mechanism

At the end of each block, the protocol sets the highest price at which tokens were sold in that block. Higher bids fill first, then bids at the maximum price; everyone who fills in the block pays the same price.

Uniswap explained that as more bids divide the fixed per-block supply, clearing prices can either stay the same or increase. Early bidders are expected to get the better deals “since a larger portion of their bid can fill in earlier, cheaper blocks.”

The decentralized finance (DeFi) company announced that the CCA smart contract is now live and available to anyone. In the coming months, Uniswap also expects to release additional modules for the new token sale system.

The report came just days after Uniswap's token rallied by over 38% following the Uniswap Foundation and Uniswap Labs' proposal to activate a protocol-level fee mechanism to burn Uniswap (UNI) tokens. The team also announced a plan to burn 100 million UNI — roughly 16% of the UNI's circulating supply — from the treasury.

November 14, 2025 By Crypto Reporter PR 

Bitcoin breaking under 98000 reminded the market how quickly confidence can disappear. Periods of aggressive volatility push investors to rethink exposure and search for alternatives that offer real development and transparency. 



This market environment puts a spotlight on the best crypto presale category, where teams are building technology rather than depending on hype alone.

Nexchain captured attention not through price speculation, but through early execution of its Testnet 2.0 and AI driven infrastructure. The combination of raised capital, live milestones, and an active ecosystem has positioned it among top crypto presale discussions and many crypto presale projects competing for visibility.

Bitcoin dropped below $97000 in the last 12 hours, hitting its lowest point since early May. This decline was unexpected because broader macro signals had turned positive. The United States government officially reopened and financial support measures resurfaced, yet selling pressure accelerated.

Just days ago Bitcoin traded above 107000 after President Donald Trump confirmed tariff checks of at least 2000 for eligible Americans. The announcement sparked a wave of optimism and confidence across digital markets.

The reversal shows that price levels can break without warning, even during strong macro recovery news. Many traders shifted focus toward the best crypto presale opportunities as volatility intensified.

The movement continues to draw attention to emerging presale crypto projects that aim to offer real utility.

Nexchain is building a fully AI powered blockchain ecosystem created to deliver real transaction intelligence and advanced security across web3. The presale crypto event is live and the price increases with every stage. Many viewers consider it one of the best crypto presales because it offers innovations that operate in live environments rather than untested theory.

Testnet 2.0 goes live on November 17, earlier than scheduled. This date also marks the final day of the 100 percent purchase bonus using the code TESTNET2.0. The launch introduces the AI Risk Scoring module which analyzes smart contract activity.

It evaluates transaction type, value, associated tags, and sender reputation to identify security risk in real time.

Participants can join the ongoing 5 million NEX Airdrop until November 23 and earn rewards through weekly quests and competitions. The token price is currently 0.116, with a listing price set at 0.3 which reflects a 259 percent return at launch. Nexchain is now in Stage 29 of its crypto presale and has raised 11.72 million.

Many followers rank it among the top crypto presale options and watch it on the crypto presale list of leading cryptocurrency presales for 2025. It continues gaining visibility among long-term potential crypto supporters exploring where to buy presale crypto.

The Nexchain AI framework introduces an advanced speed infrastructure designed for decentralized blockchains. It merges Proof of Stake with the proprietary NEX AI layer to form a Hybrid Consensus mechanism capable of maximizing network responsiveness.

This design enables seamless deployment of next generation smart contracts and interoperability across multiple blockchain ecosystems.

The model includes daily rewards that distribute ten percent of all network gas fees back to NEX holders. Users only need to store tokens in a non custodial wallet to receive their proportional daily share automatically.

This approach commits to transparent value distribution without forcing complex staking requirements. It strengthens interest among best presale crypto followers who seek functional designs inside real blockchain project environments.

Altcoins fell sharply during the broader sell off. AAVE, ENA, RENDER, SUI, PEPE, and LINK each dropped more than 12 percent. Ethereum slid below 3200 after an 11 percent correction. Despite political stability returning in the United States, market sentiment remains strongly risk off.

Many traders exited short term volatility and moved toward presale crypto options with early access structures. Increased attention shifted to Nexchain as investors look beyond unstable markets for new crypto presale opportunities from high utility blockchain projects. Cryptocurrency presales with active development now appear more attractive than speculative momentum assets.

As uncertainty continues, more traders review new crypto presale openings and evaluate long term potential crypto assets with measurable progress. Those watching cryptocurrency presales and seeking balanced risk strategies continue to monitor how strong fundamentals influence future adoption.

Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen back under $100,000, dimming expectations of a year-end push to new all-time highs. But as BTC cools, activity around its fastest Layer-2, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), is moving sharply in the opposite direction. After crossing $27 million in total funding on Thursday, the project has attracted an additional $500,000 in a matter of hours.

Now, Bitcoin Hyper is more than halfway to its next milestone at $28 million, which could be reached over the weekend – or even sooner – given the current pace of funding. A hefty $494,000 whale buy helped lift the presale to its new total and triggered the next pricing round at $0.013275 per token.

Early investors looking to join the current round have roughly 34 hours left before the next price increase, or even less if the funding target is reached early, as it was on Thursday.

After the record-breaking 43-day U.S. government shutdown came to an end – an event many risk-asset investors expected to lift crypto markets – Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto sector instead continued to decline. Coming into Friday, BTC has now slipped to $99,600 at the time of writing.

Ethereum fell 5% overnight to $3,229, Solana (SOL) dropped 4.5% to $145, and Ripple (XRP) slid 3.9% to $2.31.

The disappointing price action has investors questioning whether this downturn is simply a temporary rotation, with capital first flowing back into equities before returning to higher-beta assets like crypto. 

Still, it raises the broader question of whether BTC has enough momentum to reach the bullish price targets frequently floated by analysts, such as $200,000 or even $250,000. 

That uncertainty is underscored by analyst MMCrypto, who flagged the $99,329 zone as critical support in an X post, noting that it “must hold.” A decisive break below this level, as MMCryto's chart indicates, could open the door to much lower prices.

BITCOIN: THIS SUPPORT MUST HOLD!

Let me repeat that: IT MUST HOLD!

Yet, against this backdrop, Bitcoin Hyper presents a sharp contrast because it is seeing accelerating inflows when BTC struggles – including a massive whale allocation, as mentioned earlier, into the presale.



Source: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe390ae1d27c056b54a72ba52832c9b7a24158c93f4dff44ba1bdb6850a965905

So whether this whale is “buying when others are fearful” or simply recognizing Bitcoin Hyper's potential to both support BTC's next major move and deliver outsized returns for its own native token, HYPER, the timing is notable – and investors are carefully watching.

The reason why there's an increase in early investor participation in Bitcoin Hyper comes down to its architecture that gives BTC another avenue to derive demand from: utility.

Inside the ecosystem, developers can spin up applications using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), meaning those apps inherit Solana's speed and low-cost execution while every transaction still settles safely on Bitcoin's rock-solid base layer. In other words, users get the best of both worlds.

This setup works through a canonical bridge that ties everything back to Bitcoin. BTC gets locked down on the base layer, then re-minted inside the Bitcoin Hyper environment as a wrapped asset that can move around freely. 



That wrapped BTC becomes the currency of choice across SVM-powered apps, whether that's DeFi, gaming, or real-world utilities.

So in this model, BTC isn't just sitting pretty as a store of value – it's finally being put to work. 

And if developers continue rolling out applications that rely on BTC for everyday activity, it could open the floodgates to a new wave of demand, which not only cushions BTC from further decline but could help push it toward the ambitious targets many bulls are calling for.

While investors are betting that Bitcoin Hyper can unlock higher value for BTC itself, their immediate exposure in the presale comes through the HYPER token. And that exposure matters because HYPER sits at the center of the ecosystem's economic engine.

In Bitcoin Hyper's design, BTC serves as the medium of exchange across applications, but another currency must handle gas fees and network payments. That role belongs to HYPER, making it indispensable to the system's day-to-day activity.

Early investors are bullish because if the ecosystem captures even 0.5% of Bitcoin's supply – roughly $9.5 billion at current prices – that value would be transacting across applications that require HYPER every single time a user interacts with the network. This means anyone using the ecosystem also needs to buy HYPER, creating a built-in demand loop tied directly to BTC activity.

Ultimately, the investment thesis is simple: if Bitcoin Hyper expands what BTC can do, then HYPER becomes essential to that growth. That's why many early backers see it as the closest thing to a second chance at early-stage Bitcoin-style returns.

Even trusted crypto news site Cryptonews predicts HYPER could go 100x post-presale.



Getting HYPER tokens is currently only possible through the ongoing presale. To join, visit the Bitcoin Hyper website and buy HYPER using SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or even a credit card. 

Bitcoin Hyper recommends Best Wallet – one of the best crypto and Bitcoin wallets – where HYPER is listed under its Upcoming Tokens section, making it simple to buy, track, and claim once live.

The Best Wallet app is available for download on both Google Play and the Apple App Store.

Central bank finalizes stablecoin regulations while three major banks complete first wholesale CBDC transactions

Singapore's central bank is moving forward with comprehensive digital asset initiatives spanning stablecoin regulation, wholesale CBDC pilots, and tokenized capital markets guidance, Monetary Authority of Singapore Managing Director Chia Der Jiun announced at the Singapore FinTech Festival on Thursday.

MAS has finalized features for its stablecoin regulatory regime and will prepare draft legislation, Chia said Wednesday. The framework prioritizes "sound reserve backing and redemption reliability" to ensure value stability, addressing concerns about unregulated stablecoins that have experienced recurring de-pegging events.

In a significant CBDC milestone, DBS, OCBC, and UOB successfully conducted interbank overnight lending transactions using Singapore's first live wholesale CBDC issuance for settlement. MAS plans to expand trials next year by issuing tokenized MAS Bills to Primary Dealers settled with CBDC.

The regulator launched the BLOOM (Borderless, Liquid, Open, Online, Multi-currency) initiative in October 2025, to support industry experimentation with tokenized bank liabilities and regulated stablecoins for settlement, inviting financial institutions and clearing operators to conduct trials.

Chia outlined three critical requirements for scaling tokenized assets: standardized tokens with interoperable networks, deep pools of safe settlement assets, and institutional-grade blockchain networks with clear governance and regulatory compliance.

Chia also added that MAS will publish a Guide on Tokenisation of Capital Markets Products this week, providing regulatory clarity through case studies, while acknowledging that despite commercial launches of tokenized bonds and money market funds, "asset-backed tokens have not yet achieved escape velocity."

The central bank emphasized a "co-opetition" model where market participants cooperate on standards while competing for liquidity, working through initiatives like Project Guardian to develop global tokenization frameworks.

As Trump touts Bitcoin's role in easing pressure on the dollar, his administration's pro-crypto stance is reshaping markets, regulation, and global competition.

When you think of financial innovation, Singapore is never far away. The country, which already made an impression by hosting the global TOKEN2019 event, continues to move forward at a rapid pace. In the crypto universe, the city-state increasingly positions itself as an open-air laboratory. The latest move: the issuance of Treasury bonds… in tokenized form. Public securities settled in central bank digital currency (CBDC). A transition that could well reshuffle the deck in state finance.

After TOKEN2049, Singapore takes a new step. At the Singapore FinTech Festival 2025, Chia Der Jiun, director of the MAS, unveiled a pilot operation: issuance of tokenized MAS Bills, reserved for primary dealers, and settled in digital Singapore dollar. A paradigm shift? Probably. Especially when you hear the MAS head state:

Are asset-backed tokens clearly out of the lab? Undoubtedly. Many commercial products have been launched. Bonds have been issued natively and settled on-chain. Money market funds have been tokenized.

The MAS does not stop there: the banks DBS, OCBC and UOB have already conducted interbank lending operations using CBDC. These initiatives confirm an assumed ambition: to impose public finance in the crypto ecosystem with safe, traceable, and agile digital tools. A role-play where states are no longer just regulators but also builders of monetary networks.

The real challenge is no longer technical, it is structural. In his speech, Chia Der Jiun mentions a major risk: that of a fragmented ecosystem, made of incompatible networks, tokens not recognized from one platform to another. The solution? A “coopetition” approach.

They must agree on common standards for asset-backed tokens, even while seeking to grow. A bond or fund token must be understood and accepted on another network than the original one.

The Guardian project, already launched in 2022, and the Global Layer One initiative aim to create these standards. Their mission: to ensure that any tokenized asset on network A can be recognized and exchanged on network B. This is not just an advance for crypto traders; it is a market overhaul itself. 

The regulator wants to avoid the emergence of closed monopolies or walled gardens. It supports open finance, driven by regulation but fueled by innovation. A hybrid model that could set an example far beyond Asia.

Behind the launch of these tokenized bonds, another battle is raging: the choice of settlement assets. The digital Singapore dollar, stablecoins, and tokenized bank liabilities are tested to serve as bases for dematerialized exchanges.

Key points to understand the stakes:

Each of these models has its strengths. CBDCs offer security and legitimacy. Regulated stablecoins allow smoother circulation. And bank liabilities bring private sector flexibility, provided they are interoperable. This plurality of approaches clearly shows one thing: no one yet holds the key to universal programmable money. But Singapore is moving forward, and fast.

Singapore only confirms a trend underway for several years. Like the Bank of France and the Bank of Switzerland, its central bank has already successfully tested wholesale CBDCs. By crossing this new threshold, it helps shape the contours of programmable, fluid finance but under close supervision. A complex score, where each note played already resonates well beyond its borders.

The crypto market is going through one of its strangest weeks. Altcoin ETFs are breaking trading records, but altcoin prices are still falling. Bitcoin has dropped below $98,000, marking its worst November in years, and altcoins are sliding even harder.

Altcoins Fall Even As New ETFs Surpass Records

The big shock is that this crash is happening while new altcoin ETFs are performing better than anyone expected. The Canary XRP ETF, named XRPC, launched on Nasdaq and recorded $58.5 million in first day volume. This beat the previous altcoin ETF record held by Bitwise Solana at $57 million. More than 2.26 million shares were traded, and XRP price failed to hit the $3 mark.

Why ETFs Did Not Trigger A Rally

Investors expected a strong rally after these ETF launches. Instead, the market dipped. According to Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg, ETF growth will be strong for a while because crypto is a new asset class, but only top coins will benefit long term. He compared crypto ETFs to commodity ETFs where gold dominates, silver follows, and smaller metals barely attract attention. Crypto may follow the same pattern with only a few strong winners and many weak performers.

Altcoin Crash Has A Bigger Cause

The drop is not only happening to XRP or SOL. The broader crypto market is falling with Bitcoin weakness pulling everything down. Rising dominance, macro pressure and profit taking have all added to the sell off. Even strong ETF launches are not enough to fight the wider negative trend.

When Will Altcoins Finally Pump

Analysts are watching Bitcoin dominance closely. It was rejected again at the 50 week EMA, the same pattern seen before the 2021 altcoin season. A sharp fall in dominance usually signals that altcoins are preparing for a big run. 

In September 2023, I said there would be a mini Altcoin Season, and no one believed me.

Now I'm saying the major #AltcoinSeason will come in Q1 2026, and most likely, no one will believe me again. pic.twitter.com/vf6cXbTqNr

One analyst who predicted a mini altcoin season in 2023 now believes the major altcoin season will arrive in the first quarter of 2026. If that plays out, coins like XRP, HBAR, SOL and ETH may see their strongest rallies after Bitcoin completes its next cycle move.

Conclusion

ETF launches are proving that institutional interest is rising fast. Money is flowing in, but price action is still lagging behind. Once market sentiment shifts and Bitcoin dominance breaks down, the altcoin rally investors are waiting for may finally begin.

FAQs

Altcoins are falling because Bitcoin weakness, macro pressure, and profit-taking outweigh gains from strong ETF launches.

ETF demand is rising, but broader market sentiment is negative, limiting price impact and keeping altcoins under selling pressure.

High Bitcoin dominance drains liquidity from altcoins; a sharp drop often signals the start of an altcoin-led market rally.

They show strong institutional interest, but prices may lag until sentiment improves and Bitcoin's influence weakens.

 Successful Trial Advances  Digital Asset Interoperability 

 HIGHLIGHTS 

 SINGAPORE, Nov. 14, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Citi and Swift today announced a landmark trial that proves the feasibility of settling payments between fiat and digital currencies, in a Payment-versus-Payment (PvP) workflow.

The trial demonstrates a powerful hybrid model for interoperability between traditional financial systems and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) networks.

This was achieved by leveraging existing Swift infrastructure, which was seamlessly augmented with institutional-grade blockchain connectors, orchestrators and smart contracts.

"These trials with Swift represent a significant leap forward in understanding and developing infrastructure required to support digital currency transactions," said Ayesa Latif, Head of FX Products. "Our collaboration has demonstrated how existing financial systems can be enhanced with blockchain technology to unlock new levels of speed, transparency, and risk reduction in cross-currency settlements."

 Jonathan Ehrenfeld, Head of Strategy at Swift, said: "Swift is uniquely positioned to be the secure and trusted single point of access for seamless connection between the tokenized ecosystems and the established global financial community. This collaboration with Citi proves that we can leverage the reach of our existing network while introducing advanced capabilities required to orchestrate fiat-digital currency PvP."

The initiative underscores Citi's commitment to delivering innovative, client-centric, and scalable solutions for the digital asset ecosystem.

The trials mark a significant milestone towards the development of market-ready solutions that can be scalable, standardized and integrated into global financial systems.

 Advancing Digital Asset Interoperability and Mitigating Settlement Risk The rapid growth of digital currencies, such as tokenized deposits and stablecoins, presents an unprecedented opportunity to revolutionize cross-border payments and financial infrastructure.

For stablecoins, Citi GPS has projected that total issuance market could reach USD1.9 trillion by 2030, driven by expanding use cases and increasing regulatory clarity. While stablecoin transaction volume is approaching USD1 trillion a month according to the report, they predominantly serve as an intermediary. Consequently, recipients of stablecoins – which are primarily US dollar denominated – often choose to exchange them for local fiat currency. 

Despite this demand, settlement between both fiat and digital currencies such as stablecoins remains challenging as they are fundamentally different in nature. Unlike fiat currencies that are typically held within accounts at correspondent banks, digital currencies are held by user wallets on various blockchains and generally do not allow for reversible transactions.

While FX messaging standards, such as MT30X, have been designed to identify digital assets and confirm FX deals on them, they are not meant to instruct synchronized settlement between fiat and digital currencies. The initiative between Citi and Swift aims to address this issue.

 How it Works:  Novel PvP ApproachCiti and Swift designed a holistic messaging standard capable of tracking the end-to-end process, from trade initiation to settlement confirmation.

This standard uniquely accounts for the distinct data fields and characteristics inherent in fiat-digital currency transactions.

The solution also incorporated an escrow mechanism to overcome the challenge of irreversible blockchain transactions, while ensuring PvP settlement and eliminating settlement risk of both parties.

A central orchestrator further managed the sequenced exchange of messages, coordinating between the fiat and DLT legs to ensure synchronization and finality. In the trial, Citi also utilized test USDC tokens from Circle on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet, to simulate a near-production environment.

Citi and Swift will continue to refine the approach in collaboration with the broader financial community and establish the messaging and operational standards necessary for scalable, institutional-grade digital asset transactions.

 *Payment versus Payment (PvP): While this mechanism mitigates settlement risk by ensuring both currency legs settle, the current implementation is not atomic. This is because the workflow spans two distinct technologies, meaning the payments are synchronized but not executed as a single indivisible transaction.

On Thursday, Cathie Wood-led Ark Invest executed significant trades, notably involving Circle Internet Group Inc (NYSE:CRCL), Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc (NYSE:BMNR), Bullish (NYSE:BLSH), Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), and Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT). These trades reflect Ark's strategic positioning in the market, with particular focus on the tech and crypto sectors.

Ark Invest purchased 188,941 shares of Circle across multiple ETFs, including Ark Fintech Innovation ETF (BATS:ARKF), ARK Innovation ETF (BATS:ARKK), and ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (BATS:ARKW). 

On Thursday, CRCL closed at $82.34, down 4.59%. Despite this dip, analysts at Bernstein remain optimistic about Circle's potential, citing its strong third-quarter performance and a $230 price target. Bernstein flagged intensifying competition from "frenemies" like Stripe and PayPal, who are building their own stablecoin ecosystems. Still, analysts said USDC's (CRYPTO: USDC) liquidity edge continues to outpace rivals, and Circle's Arc blockchain and Payments Network rollout bolster its long-term positioning.

The total value of Ark's purchase was approximately $15.5 million, calculated from the closing price and the number of shares acquired.

Ark Invest increased its holdings in Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc through ARKF, ARKK, and ARKW by purchasing 242,347 shares. BMNR shares closed at $36.57, a 9.86% drop. 

The company recently announced its Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) holdings, aiming to own 5% of the total supply. BitMine said it expanded its Ethereum holdings to 2.9% of total ETH supply, adding more than 110,000 ETH last week as it pushed toward its long-term 5% accumulation goal. The company now holds over 3.5 million ETH, along with 192 Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and $398 million in cash reserves. Chairman Tom Lee said growing institutional interest and Ethereum's role in tokenization continue to strengthen the firm's conviction.

Ark's purchase amounted to around $8.9 million.

Ark's interest in Bullish was evident in the purchase of 177,480 shares through ARKF, ARKK, and ARKW. BLSH shares ended at $41.02, down 9.85%. 

Bullish, backed by Peter Thiel, has been a focus for Ark, with previous million-dollar buys. The value of Ark's latest acquisition was approximately $7.3 million, showcasing continued support for the crypto exchange.

Ark Invest reduced its AMD position by 87,051 shares through ARKK. AMD shares closed at $247.96, a 4.22% decrease. Ark's sale was valued at about $21.6 million.

AMD's ambitious target of $20 EPS by 2030 drew mixed reactions from analysts. Some argued the stock already prices in these aggressive assumptions, while others warned the forecast depends heavily on steep growth, margin expansion and sustained hyperscaler spending.

Ark Invest sold Reddit shares through ARKF and ARKW. Reddit shares closed at $189.42, down 6.61%. The sale of 39,854 shares was valued at $7.5 million.

Reddit recently beat expectations with third-quarter earnings of 80 cents per share and $585 million in revenue. Daily active users rose 19% to 116 million, while ad revenue surged 74%. Margins and cash flow also improved sharply, with adjusted EBITDA climbing to $236 million.

Benzinga's Edge Stock Rankings indicate AMD stock has a Value in the 5th percentile. Here is how the stock compares with other semiconductor plays.

			OUR PICKS:		

Goodbye, Bitcoin? There currently are at least 32 crypto kiosks, according to St. Paul police, where users can deposit cash and see it converted into a digital alternative.

Soon, there may be none.

Alarmed by fraud cases that have cost victims millions of dollars nationally, the St. Paul City Council is poised to ban virtual currency kiosks that have proliferated citywide.

The ATM-like kiosks are placed in high-traffic areas such as convenience stores and allow users to make cash deposits, which are then converted into Bitcoin or other digital currencies and transferred into an account or virtual wallet. Digital currency is money that exists only in an electronic form and can be exchanged online. It often operates independently of central banks.

An ordinance before the city council calls for prohibiting any person from operating a virtual currency kiosk within city limits. It would not affect online virtual transactions conducted by businesses and residents.

Michael Carter, an enforcement audit director with the Minnesota Department of Commerce, told the council Wednesday that there have been 51 law enforcement reports statewide involving $700,000 lost to various kiosk scams. The real numbers likely are larger as many victims are too embarrassed to come forward.

Gordon Wrobel, a resident of St. Paul and an AARP volunteer, said the crypto kiosks need more regulations and oversight.

“The impact of fraud on victims and their families is wide reaching and can have an impact financially and emotionally,” said Wrobel, during a public hearing Wednesday. “Criminals are becoming more sophisticated in their approach which authorities struggle to keep up.”

However, Ethan McClelland, the director of government relations for Bitcoin Depot – a leading Bitcoin machine operator – called the proposed ordinance an overreaction. The company sued the city of Stillwater after it banned cryptocurrency machines earlier this year.

“We share the council's goal of protecting consumers from fraud,” McClelland said. “However, placing a reactionary ban on the industry that is already licensed and regulated by the state, which serves a legitimate purpose for St. Paul residents, is unnecessary and will deprive many customers their only way of participating in the digital economy.”

Law enforcement investigators have called crypto scams especially dangerous because there is no centralized authority to flag suspicious behavior, and they are often untraceable.

In 2023, Americans reported losing $5.6 billion in cryptocurrency scams, according to the FBI, which found that the frauds were more likely to target older people.

Often, residents unfamiliar with cryptocurrency are warned by fraudsters that they owe the Internal Revenue Service or another federal agency back payments, and they're pressured to use a kiosk to deposit cash to a serial number within a matter of hours, or they'll be prosecuted, they're told.

The Minnesota Legislature implemented a degree of cryptocurrency fraud protection in 2024. A new law required all kiosks to disclose terms and conditions, issue refunds for new customers, and set a maximum transaction limit of $2,000 for new customers.

Tim Greenfield, the city council's chief policy officer, said the state's measures haven't been effective in stopping scams, and fraudsters have quickly found ways around the regulations.

“These kiosks serve as a very specific flashpoint for which criminal activity defrauds citizens and no amount of disclosure or tapping of a screen or a receipt can be as effective as  simply removing them from operation,” Greenfield said.

Tim Plunkett, a St. Paul resident, said he fell victim to a scam in February. Scammers impersonated Xfinity technicians and told him abnormally high activity on his desktop had led them to find evidence of money laundering and other illegal acts. The scammers told Plunkett that they would report the activity to the Federal Trade Commission unless he transferred them money through a cryptocurrency kiosk.

Plunkett went to different kiosks four times. When he received an email from Rocket Coin, a cryptocurrency ATM company, he realized he had been scammed. It turned out that the scammers had locked him out of his computer and his bank account.

“The first thing they want you to do is to get you in a state of confusion,” he told the council.​

Council President Rebecca Noecker said the proposed kiosk ban is a way to protect the vulnerable.

“Part of this is we want to raise public awareness of the level of these scams for older members, low-income folks and the incarcerated and their families in our community,” Noecker said.​

Crypto scams have become lucrative crimes in recent years. In September, two men stole $8 million in cryptocurrency after kidnapping a father and his nine-year-old son in Washington County.

​In June, an Eagan couple was almost scammed out of $125,000. The couple was able to avoid losing all of their money when Gabby Conklin, an office assistant in the city attorney's office who had stopped at a convenience store for gas, intervened, Noecker said.

A scammer was trying to get the couple to deposit money into a kiosk by pretending to be an FTC agent.

“The elderly couple were literally one press of a button away from losing their life savings irreversibly, but through Gabby's work that was averted,” Noecker said.

The council will host a final vote on the proposed ordinance on Nov. 19.

Sheryl Estrada is a senior writer at Fortune, where she covers the corporate finance industry, Wall Street, and corporate leadership. She also authors CFO Daily.

Good morning. Blockchain technology is gaining mainstream traction in the U.S., with clearer regulations emerging as a key driver of adoption.

To explore what that means for financial infrastructure, I sat down with Jeremy Fox-Geen, CFO of Circle Internet Group, a leading stablecoin issuer. “We are at the beginning of what can only be described as a global megatrend—the building of the internet financial system,” Fox-Geen told me.





That system, he explained, encompasses blockchains, digital assets, and the applications built upon them—technologies that promise “massive benefits to businesses and consumers all around the world,” he said. While blockchain is already transforming parts of the economy, he emphasized that we are still in the early stages of its impact.





Fox-Geen described Circle as a market-neutral infrastructure company: a platform that sits within the internet financial system's foundation—spanning blockchain, digital-asset, and application layers. “We're a platform that other companies choose to build upon,” he said.





Stablecoins, such as Circle's USD Coin (USDC), are digital assets designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to and backed by the U.S. dollar or equivalent assets. In the U.S., the GENIUS Act has clarified how stablecoins are regulated, Fox-Geen noted. Regulatory certainty, he said, is “a major unlock” for large companies considering digital assets for corporate treasuries—and a driver of multi-year growth for Circle.




Key use cases for stablecoins include trading, settlement, dollarization, and cross-border payments. Circle's platform supports these use cases, aiming to reduce friction and cost in global financial transactions, Fox-Geen said.





Circle made its public debut on the New York Stock Exchange on June 5, marking the largest two-day post-IPO surge since 1980, Fortune reported. On Wednesday, the company reported its Q3 results: combined revenue and reserve income grew 66% year-over-year to $740 million, while net income rose 202% to $214 million. USDC circulation reached $73.7 billion, up 108% from a year earlier, and on-chain transaction volume jumped 580% to $9.6 trillion—evidence of its expanding real-world utility, Fox-Geen explained. JPMorgan has upgraded Circle's stock to “overweight” from “underweight” and increased its price target to $100 from $94, which helped rebound Circle shares in pre-market trading on Thursday.





Fox-Geen said that blockchain's transformation of the financial system is just beginning—comparable to the internet's evolution in the mid-1990s. “The disruption is underway, but the technologies are still maturing,” he said.





Banks, neobanks, payment firms, and capital markets participants are already integrating blockchain for trading, settlement, and supply-chain payments. “We're seeing use cases grow fastest where costs, frictions, and business needs are highest,” Fox-Geen added.





Fox-Geen has served as CFO of Circle since May 2021 and was previously CFO of iStar and Safehold. Before that, he was CFO for McKinsey & Company, North America, and held senior roles with PricewaterhouseCoopers and Citigroup.




Circle is now building the fourth generation of blockchains, he said, as well as Arc, a native Layer-1 blockchain optimized to bring economic activity to the internet.





To illustrate his thoughts on blockchain's promise, Fox-Geen posed this question:





“Why can't you send money to anyone in the world—instantly and for free—just like sending a photo or text message? When you put it like that, it's absurd that you can't.”





For CFOs and finance leaders exploring blockchain for the first time, his advice is pragmatic: fast follow.





“You don't have to be a pioneer,” he said. “Institutions will bring these benefits to you.”

"Record U.S. government shutdown is over—but Wall Street only has 10 weeks to relax before the next one could begin" is a Fortune report by Eleanor Pringle.


Pringle writes: "The U.S. government shutdown, the longest in history, has finally come to an end. An optimist might assume the funding deal will avert a similar crisis—perhaps until the next administration, or for a couple of years at least? Not so. The countdown is already on, and the clock is set to 78 days.


"Last night, President Donald Trump signed a funding bill to end the 43-day impasse on Capitol Hill. In it were funding provisions for departments including SNAP food aid, the Department of Agriculture, Congress, and veterans affairs through September next year. Unfortunately, the vast majority of federal departments only had their budgets approved until January 30." Read more here.


"AI and automation are already reshaping the future of work, but our collective choices will determine whether the disruption leads to decline or renewal. Deeper partnerships across government, academia, and industry will build a talent pipeline that is more innovative than ever before."

 Threshold has introduced upgrades to its tBTC bridge, which it claims will better position the $500 billion worth of Bitcoin held by institutions and whales to access DeFi opportunities. 

Crypto infrastructure platform Threshold has rolled out a major upgrade for its tBTC bridge, aimed at enticing institutions to put their billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin to work in decentralized finance protocols. 

Threshold's latest upgrade now enables institutions to mint tBTC directly to supported chains in a single Bitcoin (BTC) transaction, without secondary approvals and without gas fees, while redemptions back to the Bitcoin network are equally as straightforward, Threshold said in a statement.

Threshold's head of marketing, Rizza Carla Ramos, went into more depth in an interview with Cointelegraph at the Web Summit in Lisbon this week, explaining that the feature improvements could incentivize more Bitcoin-holding institutions to put their BTC to work in DeFi instead of just letting it sit there and waiting for it to appreciate:

“They're going to be wanting lending, they want yields on it because if they're investing for Bitcoin in the long run, you don't just want it sitting there, right?

“That's how we're going to build that next level of finance for Bitcoin, by allowing the institutions to get that part of the market onchain,” she added.

Every tBTC minted is verifiably backed 1:1 by Bitcoin, with no middlemen or custodian risk, by implementing a threshold rule where at least 51 out of 100 Bitcoin node operators must sign the transaction for it to be valid. It could empower more than $500 billion in institutional and whale-held Bitcoin to move into Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, Sui and other blockchains to chase DeFi opportunities.

Threshold has seen over $4.2 billion in cumulative volume cross its tBTC bridge since it launched five years ago.

It competes with Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and renBTC (RENBTC), which have seen far more trading volume than Threshold but operate on a more centralized model to move Bitcoin across other blockchains.

WBTC made a move of its own on Thursday, expanding to Hedera to bring more liquidity and Bitcoin tokenization opportunities to the high-speed chain.

Threshold also argued that tBTC would make the decentralized finance space more robust, as Bitcoin would deepen liquidity in decentralized exchange pools and lending protocols while enabling more sustainable yields.

Brain tumors, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and brain metastases, present a notable clinical challenge. Recent research highlights the presence of intratumor bacteria across many tumor types, yet the microbiome of brain tumors remains largely underexplored. Here we show that the microbiome of 322 brain tumors differs markedly by tumor type and location. Using multiple approaches to visualize, culture and sequence bacterial communities, we found that brain metastases harbor higher bacterial richness and diversity than GBM, with distinct microbial compositions. Moreover, metastases in posterior brain regions exhibited greater diversity than those in anterior regions. Pathway analysis revealed enrichment of bacterial metabolic pathways associated with tumor spread and metastasis in brain metastases while GBM was enriched with pathways supporting alternative phosphorus use. These findings provide valuable insights into the microbial landscape of brain tumors, highlighting tumor-type-specific and location-specific variation and suggesting potential roles for bacteria in brain tumor biology.

(a-c) Box plots showing Jaccard beta diversity comparisons between matched brain metastasis samples- multiple samples from the same patient and non-matched brain metastases samples from different patients. Only patients with more than one brain metastasis sample are included in the matched group. Analyses are presented for combined breast and lung cancer brain metastatic samples (matched: n = 45 pairwise comparisons from n = 37 patients, non-matched: n = 7,458 pairwise comparisons from n = 93 patients) (a), breast cancer brain metastases only (BCBrM; matched: n = 34 pairwise comparisons from n = 26 patients, non-matched: n = 2,522 pairwise comparisons from n = 42 patients) (b), and lung cancer brain metastases only (LCBrM; matched: n = 11 pairwise comparisons from n = 11 patients, non-matched: n = 1,264 pairwise comparisons from n = 51 patients) (c). Data points represent individual pairwise Jaccard index values. P-values were calculated using a two-tailed Student's t-test. Box plots show medians as central lines. Boxes represent the interquartile range (IQR), and whiskers extend to 1.5×IQR or to the minimum/maximum values if no point exceeds that range. No outliers were removed from the plots.

Source data

(a) Permanova results corresponding to Fig. 4a, showing tumor type-specific explained variance (R²) in the ordination space. Significance was assessed using a two-sided Permanova test with 999 permutations, followed by pairwise post hoc comparisons. P-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction. Reported values represent explained variance (R²) and adjusted P-values for tumor-type–specific sample groups. (b-c) Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on Jaccard dissimilarity indexes, comparing bacterial species profiles in GBM, breast cancer brain metastases (BCBrM), and lung cancer brain metastases (LCBrM) from (b) samples collected at Rambam and Galilee medical centers together (c) samples from all medical centers. All bacteria that passed filtering criteria in any of the tumor types were included in the analysis.

If it ever becomes achievable, hypersonic flight could dramatically reshape international travel. What currently requires an entire day could become a short trip lasting no more than a feature length movie. A route such as Sydney to Los Angeles, which now takes about 15 hours, might be reduced to only one hour.

"It really shrinks the planet," says Professor Nicholaus Parziale, whose work centers on turning hypersonic travel from aspiration into reality. Parziale recently received the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in recognition of his research into fluid mechanics at extreme speeds. "It will make travel faster, easier and more enjoyable."

The Challenges of Flying at Mach 10

Covering half the world in just one hour may seem impossible, yet the technology is not as far away as it appears. Some military aircraft already reach speeds of Mach 2 or Mach 3, which means two or three times the speed of sound. Mach 1 equals about 760 miles per hour. To travel from Los Angeles to Sydney in sixty minutes, an aircraft would need to reach Mach 10. The major obstacles are the extraordinary turbulence and heat produced during flight at these extreme speeds.

There is a fundamental difference between how air behaves around an aircraft at lower speeds and how it behaves at higher speeds. Engineers describe these conditions as incompressible flow and compressible flow. In incompressible flow, which occurs at lower speeds (below about Mach 0.3 or 225 miles per hour), the density of the air stays nearly the same. This consistency simplifies aeronautical design. Once an aircraft moves faster than the speed of sound, the airflow becomes compressible instead. "That's because a gas can 'squish,'" Parziale explains, meaning it can compress.

Why Airflow Behavior Matters for Hypersonic Design

When air compresses, its density changes in response to variations in both pressure and temperature. These shifts influence how an aircraft interacts with the air around it. "Compressibility affects how the airflow goes around the body and that can change things like lift, drag, and thrust required to take off or stay airborne." All of these factors play a major role in aircraft design.

Engineers already understand airflow fairly well for aircraft that fly below or near the speed of sound, a range called "low Mach" numbers. Creating hypersonic aircraft requires a much deeper understanding of how air behaves at Mach 5, Mach 6, or even Mach 10. Much of that behavior is still uncertain, except for guidance provided by Morkovin's hypothesis.

Morkovin's Hypothesis and the Mystery of Hypersonic Turbulence

Developed by Mark Morkovin in the mid 20th century, the hypothesis proposes that when air moves around Mach 5 or Mach 6, the fundamental nature of turbulence remains surprisingly similar to turbulence at lower speeds. Although high-speed airflow involves larger shifts in temperature and density, Morkovin suggested that the general pattern of turbulent motion stays mostly consistent. "Basically, the Morkovin's hypothesis means that the way the turbulent air moves at low and high speeds isn't that different," Parziale says. "If the hypothesis is correct, it means that we don't need a whole new way to understand turbulence at these higher speeds. We can use the same concepts we use for the slower flows." This also suggests that future hypersonic aircraft may not require a completely different design philosophy.

Despite its importance, the hypothesis has lacked solid experimental validation. That gap led to Parziale's recent research, described in his study Hypersonic Turbulent Quantities in Support of Morkovin's Hypothesis, published in Nature Communications on November 12, 2025.

A Laser and Krypton Experiment Eleven Years in the Making

In the study, Parziale's team introduced krypton gas into a wind tunnel and used lasers to ionize it. This process briefly created a straight, glowing line formed by the krypton atoms. High-resolution cameras then captured how this illuminated line bent, twisted, and distorted as it moved through the airflow, similar to how a leaf drifts and spins within small swirling currents in a river."As that line moves with the gas, you can see crinkles and structure in the flow, and from that, we can learn a lot about turbulence," Parziale says. He notes that developing the experimental setup required 11 years of effort. "And what we found was that at Mach 6, the turbulence behavior is pretty close to the incompressible flow."

Parziale's group received early support from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research Young Investigator Research Program (YIP) in 2016 and from the Office of Naval Research (ONR) YIP in 2020, with the latest work also funded by ONR.

What the Findings Mean for Future Flight and Space Access

While Morkovin's hypothesis is not yet completely proven, the new results move scientists closer to understanding how to design aircraft that can withstand hypersonic speeds. The findings indicate that engineers may not need to reinvent the fundamental approach to aircraft design for these extreme conditions, which simplifies the challenge significantly.

"Today, we must use computers to design an airplane, and the computational resources to design a plane that will fly at Mach 6, simulating all the tiny, fine, little details would be impossible," Parziale explains. "The Morkovin's hypothesis allows us to make simplifying assumptions so that the computational demands to design hypersonic vehicles can become more doable."

Parziale adds that the same principles could transform future access to space. "If we can build planes that fly at hypersonic speed, we can also fly them into space, rather than launching rockets, which would make transportation to and from low Earth orbit easier," he says. "It will be a game-changer for transportation not only on earth, but also in low orbit."

Some patients say this condition induces feelings of pure bliss, making them feel as one with the universe. 

For more than 40 years, Margot has suffered from epileptic seizures, which she describes as “unforgettable.” Ever since she was a child, these seizures have made her feel like she has a “special link” with God—“as if I was chosen,” says Margot, who chose to use a pseudonym for privacy. 

And she isn't alone. A small percentage of people with epilepsy experience a state of “oneness” with the world just before their seizures. The rare condition is called ecstatic epilepsy, and the altered state of consciousness patients experience just before a seizure can be life changing; according to some researchers, it could even explain profound religious experiences. 

Scientists don't yet understand where ecstatic seizures come from, but they do have some knowledge of epilepsy in general, which is a condition that causes an electrical storm in the brain. Occasionally, patients' neurons will rapidly misfire, which overwhelms the brain and causes seizures. One of many types of the disorder, ecstatic epilepsy is characterized by a warning sign called an epileptic aura, followed by a focal seizure that affects a localized area in the brain.

Not to be confused with the spiritual term for energy, epileptic auras are brief sensory experiences—such as visual hallucinations or feelings of déjà vu—that occur moments before a seizure. Ecstatic auras in particular are moments of pure ecstasy; patients experience brief, yet overwhelming feelings of heightened self-awareness and positivity. Margot notes that, while she has a few epileptic episodes a year, seizures that provoke this altered state of consciousness are infrequent and she's only experienced them a handful of times. 

Experts are getting closer to understanding where exactly these ecstatic experiences originate from. Researchers studying epilepsy generally point to a dysfunctional temporal lobe, the region of your brain responsible for functions like memory formation and sensory processing, as the culprit for ecstatic epilepsy. More recent studies suspect the anterior insula—a small, poorly understood region of the brain related to emotional processing—may be involved. 

For example, a 2021 study published in the journal Annals of Neurology showed that electrically stimulating the anterior insula can trigger an ecstatic aura, though the procedure is invasive and typically used to identify the origin of a patient's epilepsy before surgery. However, the authors note that not everyone reaches an ecstatic experience through stimulating the region. Meanwhile, another 2021 paper published in the journal Epilepsy & Behavior Reports proposes the hypothalamus—which is located near the pituitary gland and responsible for maintaining things like internal temperature and blood sugar—could be related to ecstatic epilepsy. 

The condition's origins may be a mystery, but the feelings it can create are palpable. Some patients report that their ecstatic auras feel “mystical” and have had a transformative effect on their lives, according to Fabienne Picard, MD, a French-Swiss neurologist who studies the rare form of epilepsy. For example, one patient says she no longer fears death because of the ecstatic states, Picard explains on the podcast Where the Wild Thoughts Are: Conversations in Science and Beyond. Another patient told Picard that her ecstatic auras made her more confident because she understood that “there is something greater than us.” 

Margot explains that her ecstatic auras transcend bodily experience. She emphasizes that she has no religious beliefs in her day-to-day life, yet before her seizures, there is a strange feeling of growth—like something is changing inside her. She feels like she is floating in the air and becomes flooded with an overwhelming sense of power, a greater understanding of the universe.

Some researchers believe that epileptic experiences like Margot's could even explain some mystical accounts from historical and religious figures like Joan of Arc, Saint Paul, and Saint Teresa of Ávila. Picard explains in an email that these “awakening experience[s]” could be due to a momentary slip of the brain's filter. She says humans have become increasingly good at predicting our environments, but ecstatic auras may interrupt that process, stripping away our preconceived notions and revealing a “direct perception” of the world. 

For some patients, the feelings they experience are so profound that they're hesitant to receive treatment to stop the seizures. “Most of them [would] not want to take medication” if they experienced only the ecstatic auras, Picard writes. However, these brief moments of serenity are often followed by a loss of consciousness or a convulsive seizure, which can be distressing and force patients to seek intervention. In other words, the short-lived bliss doesn't outweigh the eventual toll on the body and mind. 

Ecstatic epilepsy is a unique medical condition that requires more research to be fully understood—but it could eventually illuminate our knowledge of higher consciousness as a whole. In fact, those who don't suffer from ecstatic epilepsy might be able to achieve similar “mystical experiences,” Picard explains on the podcast. Possible methods include meditation and psychedelics, two practices commonly associated with higher consciousness. Regardless of how they're induced, Picard says these experiences are a core “aspect of human function,” and help explain our relationship with each other.   

“Behind everything, there is a fundamental interconnectedness,” Picard says on the podcast.

Tar was often used to seal coffins and not an usual part of the find, but the metal bars and layers of fabric archaeologists found with the coffins raised some questions.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The only way into the sealed crypt beneath the Church of St. John the Baptist and the Five Martyrs required archaeologists to tunnel beneath the monastery complex in Kazimierz Biskupi, Poland. Once they got inside the subterranean room under the church's altar—it took a month using modern mining techniques—the team was surprised with what they discovered. 

According to a translated statement from the Kazimierz Biskupi government, the crypt featured three layers of coffins stacked on top of each other, totaling six burials, with one layer was separated by metal rods. There was also an unusual layer of a fabric and tar mixture likely used to seal a burial. 

“Such a layered sandwich of fabric and tar has never been encountered in any research, at least not in my own studies,” said Malgorzata Grupa of the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, according to the Polish Press Agency. “I'm not aware of such a case in any publication.” 

The tar and fabric mixture were likely present because of a delayed burial. Tar was commonly used to seal coffins, so using some sort of fabric may have allowed for additional layers of tar on the coffin, possibly since the deceased was traveling from a significant distance to reach the monastery's crypt.

The employment of metal rods used to separate the first layer of coffins stuck out to the archaeologists. “It must have been a significant figure, since they didn't want to place the subsequent coffins directly on top of this person's coffin,” Grupa said. “This happens occasionally, but this is the first time we've encountered such a clear situation in Poland.” 

Getting to the site wasn't easy. The crypt was walled with brick, and the team needed to mine for over a month to tunnel 23 feet into the site under the church. Investigating the crypt has only just started. “We have to carefully remove them,” Grupa said of the layers of coffins. “The two underneath aren't attached to the walls. Once we remove the largest one, we'll see the state of preservation of the lower ones.” 

It's only after the coffins get to the lab can the team start to learn more about the history of the burial, including the date and who may have been buried there. 

Entering the crypt has been a few years coming, as researchers first started work in 2022 to investigate the remains of at least 100 people from dozens of coffins in the church's vaults. Built as a church and monastery complex between 1513 and 1520, the Polish Press Agency reported the site likely held the remains of the Bernardines, owners of the monastery, and local notables. Burials there likely started in the 17th century. 

With the remains removed from much of the crypt, teams have cleaned the site and plan to open them to the public, displaying artifacts found inside, such as two women's dresses, liturgical garments likely used in the church, and other pieces of clothing. The human remains will be repositioned in a side crypt.

China has made no secret of its goal to attract the world's best scientists. In the past three years, a parade of highly accomplished researchers has emigrated there. 

Wolfgang Baumeister, a molecular biologist, started working in China in 2019, following nearly three decades at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Munich, Germany.

Baumeister is the pioneer of cryogenic-electron tomography, which enables researchers to construct 3D images of large molecules and the insides of cells. For this work, he was awarded Hong Kong's Shaw Prize for life science and medicine this year. Now based at the iHuman Institute at the ShanghaiTech University in China, he continues to study the molecular machinery involved in type 2 diabetes.

Nature met with Baumeister in Hong Kong. The following is an edited version of that conversation, and his talk to journalists at the Hong Kong Laureate Forum 2025.

My colleagues and I had a big European Research Council grant for work on neurotoxic aggregates inside cells. But we have mandatory retirement in Germany. My contract was extended beyond the normal retirement age, and my colleagues in China knew that and said, ‘Why not come to China and you can continue?'

I also had offers from the United States to continue my research there, but they would have requested that I move there permanently. With ShanghaiTech University, I can come and go. I have been there six times this year, typically for two weeks at a time.

There are things I had to get used to. For instance, human resources departments at universities are more powerful here. In my role as managing director of the institute in Munich, I always tried to make sure that administration serves the scientists and does not command them.

In Germany, when we bought an instrument, I was used to making that decision myself. What happens here is that the university wants the responsibility for such a decision to be with a committee, who are often non-experts. Very often I say, okay, we can pay for the instrument and then I will be told that the committee will meet in two months and then make the decision. This is often a waste of time.

But when it comes to purchasing very expensive, high-end instrumentation, such as a $15 million electron microscope, I just talked to the president of the university for 10 minutes and he approved it. The very big things are often decided spontaneously by the leadership. That is pretty good.

How mRNA Vaccines Could Transform Cancer Treatment

From COVID shots to cancer therapy, mRNA is changing medicine.

Kendra Pierre-Louis: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Kendra Pierre-Louis, in for Rachel Feltman.

Cancer: it's a diagnosis that most of us have learned to fear. On the one hand decades of medical advancements have increased treatment and survival rates. A number of people who in the past might have died from cancer now go on to live long, full lives without recurrence.

But not everyone is so lucky. For certain kinds of cancers, including cancer of the pancreas, effective treatments largely remain elusive, so increasingly, researchers are looking to a perhaps unexpected tool for help: vaccines.

It turns out that before mRNA vaccines became a key tool to protect people against COVID-19, researchers were initially eyeing them as a way to target cancer. That work continues.

To learn more about how mRNA vaccines can help battle cancer we're talking to reporter Rowan Moore Gerety. He covered this topic for the December edition of Scientific American. 

What inspired you to write this story?

Rowan Moore Gerety: When this first came on my radar about a year ago, partly, I was just surprised to be reading kind of frank mentions of cancer vaccines because, you know, growing up we think of vaccines as one of these miraculous interventions in public health that can basically eradicate a disease, right? So it's important to note that, in the cancer context, these are therapeutic vaccines, so it's not about providing immunity on the level of the population. But all the same it's the same kind of mechanism, and so I was just really interested to understand, “Wow, like, this is an approach that is seeming like it may be viable for cancer.”

That seemed like kind of a paradigm shift to me because my father's a cancer survivor. I have, as we all have, grew up hearing of people becoming gravely ill and dying with different forms of cancer, and it often just seems like a roll of the dice. To some extent it still is. But just the notion that there are interventions that might have, what I guess in my sort of layperson's brain, like, a vaccine level of effectiveness seemed kind of astounding. And so I was really interested to learn more.

Pierre-Louis: Before we get into sort of, like, what makes these vaccines so unique, I think kind of on the, like, the specter of cancer and, like, the living with cancer, in the story you talk to Barbara Brigham, a woman who has been in remission from pancreatic cancer for four years. And that's a disease where most people don't make it five years. What was that kind of, like talking to someone who, absent this treatment, should be dead?

Moore Gerety: It was really inspiring. I mean, she is a very rye personality; this maybe came across a little bit in the piece. She has what I associate with a kind of grandmotherly wisdom and very sort of upbeat spirit. But I think, if you have known anybody who gets a pancreatic cancer diagnosis, often it's something that is sort of diagnosed as a terminal illness. There is nothing to do but sort of treat it and see, “Can we get a few more months—or a few weeks, even?”

And as I note in the story, you know, she has been able to do quite a lot: She welcomed a new grandchild. She got to see all these volleyball games of her other grandchildren. She saw one grandchild get married and another start graduate work. And she lives on Shelter Island, which is near the tip of Long Island, and she sort of has had a very active and full social life, partly, not necessarily as, like, a cancer-survivor support group, but the way she explained her—she has these weekly get-togethers where they play mah-jongg and eat dessert together, which sounds just lovely.

But she's in her late 70s. The people around her, I think, are [in] their late 70s or 80s or even, in some cases, 90s. And so there's a little bit of a quality of support group to, I think, any socializing you do in that phase of life. Everybody has lost spouses, siblings; parents are long gone. And so I think it has been really meaningful for her to be able to convene a group of people and talk about surviving and talk about enjoying life on a day-to-day level. One thing I love that she said to me was her mother said you should try to have a little bit of adventure every single day. And she's adopted that as kind of a maxim over these last four years, and I think it's really served her well.

Pierre-Louis: I also like that, like, the thing that is ailing her the most right now, at least that you put in the piece, is, like, her touch of arthritis. Meanwhile [laughs], she had pancreatic cancer. And it's funny that, like, the thing that she's like, “Ah, the arthritis,” you know? [Laughs.]

Moore Gerety: And she also survived breast cancer, actually, I should note ...

Pierre-Louis: Oh, wow.

Moore Gerety: In the interim. This did not make it into the story. While she's been in remission from pancreatic cancer she has fought off a bout of breast cancer, as I understand it. That actually was communicated to us since I spoke to her.

Yeah, she has gone through a lot and, obviously, has maintained a kind of positive point of view.

Pierre-Louis: Can we talk a little bit about how mRNAs work against some cancers and how that sets them apart from existing treatments or existing understanding of, like, how cancer works?

Moore Gerety: So one of the things that makes cancer unique among diseases, or relatively unusual, is that it's not like a virus, where, you know, you have this pathogen that's introduced into the body and the body goes, “Oh, my God, you look really, really different. I better go after you and attack you with all my might.” Cancer, because it arises from these genetic mutations in our own cells, a tumor's genetics end up looking quite similar to the rest of your body's genetics. And so it creates a kind of a quandary for the immune system of figuring out, “Where is that line?”

Researchers talk about “self” versus “not self,” and one of the kind of riddles of cancer treatment for a very long time has been how the body manages to make that distinction and how we can kind of put our thumb on the scales with medical interventions to accelerate immune responses to cancer.

The earliest interventions into cancer were major surgery, right: “Let's just cut out much of the organ, or all of the organ, that's being affected. And to some extent that still happens. And then you have chemotherapy and radiation, which are targeting still pretty broad parts of the body, or systems within the body. And so naturally, through all those things, there's a lot of collateral consequences. If you've ever talked to somebody who's going through chemotherapy, they're really tired. It's, like, an extremely exhausting, taxing process. And part of that's because, like, you are absorbing these chemicals into your body that are pretty toxic. Like, so these are not things that you would do to yourself absent having a life-threatening disease.

What is different about mRNA vaccines—and in this they're kind of part of this newer generation of treatments that are called immunotherapy—is that they are trying to leverage that immune response.

And there's one more distinction to draw here, which is that about 30 years ago researchers started to have success with something called checkpoint inhibitors. So in our body we are always fighting off pathogens of one kind or another. And the body's always deciding, like, “Do I need to pay attention to you, or, oh, is this thing over here more serious?” And so part of what controls that immune response is a group of proteins called checkpoint proteins, and cancers can actually kind of trick the body using those checkpoint proteins to say, “Hey, don't worry about me. It's all good over here. We can turn off your T cells,” those killer cells that would normally come after a tumor, “and instead just let the tumor grow.” So checkpoint inhibitors are a class of drugs that has been around for 20, 25 years that act on that capacity that tumors have to sort of shut off your T cells using checkpoint proteins.

And so that's sort of the basic hallmark of immunotherapies: they're trying to intervene in the immune response. But in order to intervene there has to be an immune response. And what's new about mRNA vaccines is that mRNA is really just a set of genetic instructions. And so rather than your body needing to know, “Hey, this is what your cancer looks like,” the mRNA vaccine can actually tell your body, “Hey, this is what your cancer looks like.” And in that way it can help your body form what people call a de novo, or a brand-new, immune response rather than just amplifying the existing immune response, which is what earlier forms of immunotherapy have done.

Pierre-Louis: And my understanding is researchers who are using the mRNA, it's not, like, a standalone thing. You don't just get a one-and-done shot, and you're on your merry way. It's, like, used in conjunction with other immuno treatments.

Moore Gerety: That's right. So because cancer's so serious, and I think because of, you know, the Hippocratic injunction “Do no harm,” you can't just say, “Well, to find out if this works we're gonna withhold the cancer treatments that we know work a little bit and just give you the shot and kind of see what happens.”

So the people who participate in early studies, or really any study, of mRNA vaccines—and this is now quite a huge area; there are 50-some-odd trials going on right now. All of those people are getting kind of state-of-the-art treatment, whether it's chemotherapy and immunotherapy, surgery or radiation and immunotherapy, right—whatever the sort of cocktail of interventions that researchers determine is, like, the best treatment for that form of cancer—and then they're also getting these shots over the course of a few months or a year.

Pierre-Louis: One of the [things] that surprised me in your piece was that, you know, for most of the world, and I think for most people in the U.S., mRNAs are sort of synonymous with the COVID vaccine; that's the thing that we think of. But we're kind of thinking of it a little bit backwards, which is they were tinkering with this treatment in order to treat cancer, and then the COVID pandemic broke out, and they were like, “Hey, we actually think we can use this as an inoculate against this, you know, very deadly virus.”

Moore Gerety: Yeah, this is a fascinating story and one that I was not familiar with through the pandemic even though, you know, I have, at this point, many mRNA shots in my arm.

Pierre-Louis: [Laughs.]

Moore Gerety: So two of the people who have been really critical in this history are the founders of BioNTech, which is one of the companies that came up with the first sort of viable COVID-19 vaccine right at the end of 2020. So this is a Turkish couple in Germany named Ugur Sahin and Özlem Türeci. And they first became interested in mRNA as cancer researchers 30 years ago because they were looking at precisely this question of: “How can we find a way to boost the immune response, and how can we personalize the response?”

So, you know, a little while ago I was talking about how cancer really looks like any other part of your body. Your cancer is gonna look more like you, perhaps, than it'll look like my cancer, and my cancer's gonna look more like me than our cancers will look like one another in some sense, right? They're mutations that arise from our own genes. And so even, you know, a generation ago the founders of BioNTech were really interested in figuring out, like, “How can we personalize treatment?” And they decided to kind of bet on mRNA as a platform.

And the reasons that they took this approach is that mRNA is a set of genetic instructions, and one of its real strengths is that it's very flexible. When you change between one patient and another or one disease and another you don't need to start from scratch. You can just go in and basically splice out a portion of those genetic instructions and say, “Okay, now go look for this genetic mutation,” and everything else in the molecule can remain the same.

And so when I say everything else, what that means is the cap and tail that essentially say to the mRNA, “Go to this part of the body. Try to be stable,” right—the body's kind of a messy place. “Don't get corrupted or kind of thrown off your axis by whatever's going on inside us. And deliver your jolt,” right? So they spent, like, decades, really, tinkering with that cap and tail, the rest of the mRNA molecule, in order to say, “Hey, how can we make this really stable? How can we make it persistent? And also, how can we make it powerful enough that it will engender a really strong immune response?”

When you're going after a virus your body produces antibodies, and those antibodies can then go throughout your body and sort of do their thing and go after it. When you're going after cancer it's actually the immune cells themselves that need to attack the cancer cells. And so what that means is, in terms of the demands of your body's immune response, it's much, much larger. I think they told me you have somewhere on the order of, like, tens of thousands of cells that would need to be active and creating an adequate immune response to fight off a virus, because those antibodies are always circulating, looking for the first signs of an invasion, but [for] a cancer response you might need billions of T cells to be engaged. And so in order to sort of customize the mRNA they had to figure out, “How can we make this molecule work so that it can generate a big enough immune response?”

So they spend decades doing this: kind of tinkering with the mRNA, finding a form they like. Along comes the pandemic, and they say, “I think mRNA could really help here because it's so flexible. Each time the COVID-19 virus changes we can just tinker with that middle section and then spit out a new vaccine in a few weeks.” And lo and behold that's exactly what happened, and that's what allowed us all to get boosters throughout the pandemic that were tailored to the genetic versions of the pathogen that was sort of most in evidence around the world so that when Omicron became a thing the vaccine's tailored to Omicron, and you can suppress whatever wave is happening that looks like Omicron.

So then after the pandemic, again, they realized, “Now we have this incredible proof of concept. All of that decades of work we did sort of pursuing mRNA vaccines as a good platform for cancer treatment, now we have shown people that it's safe, we have learned a lot about how to manufacture them effectively, and now we can kind of pivot and go back towards our original research interest.” And of course, BioNTech is not the only company that was going through that journey.

Pierre-Louis: You know, so far we've been talking about this technology and how wonderful it is and how it saved lives, but there's, like, a dark side, which is kind of the combination of people more broadly becoming anti-vaccination and partly because of the rise of the Trump administration gutting the National [Institutes] of Health. This research is maybe not quite at risk but, like, potentially moving a lot more slowly and helping less people than it could otherwise. And I was wondering if you could talk more about what you've seen in that regard, what researchers have told you. Like, what are we facing in terms of, like, actually having this technology be deployable on, like, larger scale?

Moore Gerety: So we are in a really hopeful moment in terms of the science here. A lot of the technological advances that have made mRNA vaccines possible and practical as a form of cancer treatment in this moment are things that just weren't around five or even 10 years ago. It's now really, really cheap to do a genetic sequence of a tumor. You have all these tools, these algorithms that can predict how different kinds of proteins will appear in the body, and that's important to sort of figure out which of the different mutations in a tumor we might go after with a vaccine.

So all of these exciting developments have kind of converged on this field at a moment when, all of a sudden, cancer research is kind of taking it in the chin. We saw what I think a Senate report estimated to be a [roughly] 30 percent reduction in federal funding for cancer research just in the first few months of the second Trump administration earlier this year. We have since seen cuts to major federal grant programs that supported mRNA vaccines for other diseases, so those haven't yet targeted the ongoing mRNA vaccine trials for cancer, but certainly, that is an anxiety that a number of researchers expressed to me.

And I think you also have, for Americans, this new reason to question the sort of primacy of the American research establishment on a global level. And institutions that are used to getting the absolute best and brightest scientists who are up and coming from around the world flocking to New York and flocking to L.A. and Boston, wherever it may be, to, you know, go and implement their bright new ideas, those people are now starting to kind of wonder. I had a couple conversations with folks just about how different it feels to recruit young postdocs who are figuring out, “Well, where does it make sense for me to start my researching life? Is the decades-long support for the kind of science I wanna do going to be there if I decide to make that choice in the U.S.?”

And so, as hopeful a moment as it is, I think there's a very long shadow over the field at this moment because these things take generations to develop, in some ways. Even the tissue samples in the study that developed a vaccine for Barbara Brigham, you know, the people who provided the earliest tissue samples that went into that study had, you know, died years earlier. And so there's this really long-term dimension to cancer research that is very, very important, and I think the longer the sort of interruption or pause or even just sort of uncertainty persists, the more people worry, “Are we going to be able to rebuild or sustain the institutions that have made this research possible?”

Pierre-Louis: It also feels like, a little bit, like—I don't wanna say that the people, you know, who died early on were choosing to sacrifice themselves, but it is a sort of sacrifice to say, “I know that I'm not gonna survive. I'm gonna allow myself to be kind of poked and prodded for medical science so that, you know, the future generations can survive.” And it seems like we're really at risk of kind of losing that sacrifice.

Moore Gerety: A hundred percent. You need to give people a reason to feel that what they are doing is going to matter to somebody.

I think it's great that people are willing to participate in studies, but as you say it's not that it's going to negatively impact their treatment, but the sales pitch is basically, “Hey, we don't know if this thing will work. You're at the, like, most difficult moment of your life. You may have limited time left with your family, whatever you wanna accomplish in your career. You have all kinds of new metaphysical thoughts about mortality and these things. And we're asking you to spend an extra day at the hospital, to meet with one more specialist, to allow our graduate students to be in the room, to go through a kind of selection process where we determine, ‘Are you, in fact, eligible for this kind of new line of treatment?'”

And so even if it does hold out a little bit of hope for improved health, it's not always, I've gotta think, an easy trade-off. And we should really cherish people's willingness to participate in what is really a sort of an act of solidarity not only just across place, but across time, and try to support that as best we can.

Pierre-Louis: That's really beautiful, and I think that's a really good place to end this, so thank you so much for your time.

Moore Gerety: Thank you.

I'm a self hosting GoGogs / Gitea user for almost 10 years, I did follow the Gitea fork. However regarding the Forgejo fork: the main contributors stayed with Gitea. The ideologically forked Forgejo made some license changes and hard fork decisions that increased the maintenance burden even more, resulting in missing upstream features and decreased security. Forgejo is more busy managing ideals, than creating software.

But then a couple of years have passed, and I started to hear about Forgejo more often only very recently, so I was wondering, if maybe the original project actually had some downfall and questionable technical decisions since. I still haven't switched, and was wondering if I should do so. As far, as I've heard it's still basically a matter of running the different docker container with the same volume, and it should work seamlessly. So what's about this "hard fork" you are mentioning? Did it actually break compatibility?

reply

Isn't it sensible for a European government to talk to a player that is being backed by European companies and has a cleaner approach to open source?I'm not arguing, I'm asking what's the rationale here.

reply

> resulting in missing upstream features and decreased securityI.e. it's a matter of technical superiority, which, to me, how the decisions should be made. Not by having friends in the community and all of us being Europeans and so on. (But, of course, I would be glad to hear more particular details/examples of Forgejo lagging behind.)

Auger, a startup building logistics and supply chain software, announced Yuqing Sun as its chief data and AI enablement officer. Sun joins the Bellevue, Wash.-based company from Johnson & Johnson where she has worked for nearly 20 years in a variety of supply chain, analytics and data science roles.

“Yuqing brings the rare combo of deep technical chops, operational scar tissue, and the calm that only comes from having seen every kind of supply-chain fire drill,” said Dave Clark, Auger's founder and CEO and a former Amazon executive.

Clark noted on LinkedIn that while at Johnson & Johnson, Sun worked to modernize “one of the most complex supply chains on the planet through data and AI innovations. She built and scaled more than 30 AI-driven products across optimization, simulation, IoT, machine learning, computer vision — you name it.”

Last month Auger appointed Justine Hastings as chief AI economist. The company, ranked No. 48 on the GeekWire 200 list of top Pacific Northwest startups, raised a $100 million Series A round last December.



— Amy Harris is the new public policy and government relations director for the Washington Technology Industry Association (WTIA).

For the past nine years, Harris has been a principal for Red Strategies, which bills itself as providing “fundraising consulting and event planning for right of center candidates and organizations.” She has also worked as an executive assistant for two members of Congress.

Randa Minkarah, CEO of the WTIA consortium, praised Harris' “deep experience in bipartisan coalition-building, strategic advocacy, and navigating complex political landscapes,” noting the skills will be instrumental in working in Washington state and the nation's capitol.

— Marc Brown, a former corporate vice president at Microsoft who helped lead the acquisition of companies including LinkedIn, GitHub and Minecraft, has joined the board of directors for Syncro, a software platform for IT professionals.

Seattle-based Brown was with Microsoft for more than two decades, managing more than 185 acquisitions and 80 equity investments.

— Pyramid Communications, a longtime Seattle-area public relations firm, named Emily Ryan as its first CEO. Ryan was with Pyramid for nearly 14 years before taking a year-long role as chief communications officer for Our Children's Trust in 2024.  

“During a tumultuous period in the world, Pyramid is doubling down on our commitment to support changemakers leading bold action for a better world,” the company posted on LinkedIn. “Emily's trusted, creative leadership will sustain our team and our clients as we continue to work alongside all of you…”

— Carbon Direct, a carbon management firm based in New York and Seattle, announced two leadership hires as a result of its recent acquisition of climate tech startup Pachama.

Slowly but surely, AMD is eating Intel's lunch.

AMD increased its share across all markets served by x86 processors at Intel's expense in the third quarter of 2025, according to Mercury Research. Intel is holding strong, and as its latest offerings for client and server systems got significantly more competitive than they were several quarters ago, the pace of AMD's gains has slowed down considerably. However, during the quarter, AMD achieved two important milestones: it now commands shipments of over 25% of all x86 CPUs, and it now ships over 33% (one-third) of desktop x86 CPUs.

Normally, we start our coverage of the x86 market based on data from Mercury Research with client CPUs, but the third quarter was very unusual as unit shipments of x86 CPUs were flat quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), which significantly contradicts the normal seasonal bump when PC makers start to prep for the back-to-school (BTS) season in June – July as well as Christmas season in September.

Indeed, PC and server makers increased their CPU procurements in Q3, but the weakness came almost entirely from Intel, which saw sharp drops in IoT/SoC and entry-level mobile processors as it shifted manufacturing capacity toward server processors, and strong shipments of such parts in Q2. By contrast, AMD's unit shipments were flat to slightly up, so the company gained share sequentially and year-over-year (YoY), hitting two psychologically important milestones.

For the first time in years, AMD's unit share of all x86 client and server CPUs shipped exceeded 25% and now stands at 25.6%, up from 24.2% in the prior quarter and up from 24% in the same quarter a year ago. Intel still commands 74.4%, but it lost some share in certain segments, allowing AMD to hit an important milestone amid a market shrink.

If we add embedded, IoT, and game consoles SoCs to the equation, then AMD's share looks even more impressive: a 30.9% share of all x86-based chips, up from 25% in the third quarter of 2024. While Intel maintains its dominant position with 69.1%, its 5.9% YoY share loss does not look very good. Yet, it should be noted that AMD shipped significantly more game console SoCs in the third quarter this year compared to the third quarter of 2024, which inflated its results a bit.

Strong desktop and mobile CPU lineups as well as Intel struggles with supply of small-core mobile CPUs and prior-generation desktop offerings allowed AMD to slightly outgrow Intel in the third quarter both sequentially and year-over-year, according to data from Mercury Research.

 




AMD's client unit share rose to 25.4%, up 1.5% QoQ and 1.4% YoY, driven mainly by strong desktop momentum. By contrast, Intel's share fell to 74.6%, down 1.5% sequentially and 1.4% compared to the same quarter a year ago, as its entry-level mobile shipments were constrained by reduced small-core CPU supply. Although Intel still dominates in total volume, Q3's numbers reflect the ongoing pressure on its mobile PC shipments and AMD's sustained improvement in desktops.

Both AMD and Intel saw strong sequential unit shipments growth in Q3 2025 on the desktop CPU market, although Q2 -> Q3 market growth in general was lower than normal seasonal rates, according to Mercury Research.

 




AMD grew far faster thanks to the popularity of its Ryzen 9000-series 'Granite Ridge' CPUs in the enthusiast and performance tiers, allowing the company to reach another all-time high: a 33.6% share of the desktop PC market, up from 32.2% in the prior quarter and a gain of 5.2% year-over-year. If we compare AMD's current share to its share in the second quarter of 2024, the gain would be a whopping 10.6%

Intel still held the majority of desktop shipments, but its share fell from 67.8% to 66.4% QoQ, and from 71.7% YoY, reflecting AMD's continued gains in both the mainstream and high-end segments and shortages of Intel's 13th and 14th Core 'Raptor Lake' processors that are still popular three years after their original release in 2022.

On the revenue front, AMD reached another record quarter for desktop CPU revenue, driven by higher shipments and a strong mix of premium SKUs, as the company noted in its conference call a week ago. Intel's revenue position weakened as its unit share declined and AMD absorbed more of the market's high-margin demand. Mercury Research notes that AMD's revenue growth in desktops significantly outpaced its unit growth, which confirms that the red company continued to strengthen its position in the most profitable parts of the desktop market.

AMD lost market share to Intel in the mobile CPU space in Q1 and Q2 2025, but the company outperformed Intel in Q3 2025 on a sequential basis, gaining unit share as Intel struggled with reduced shipments of its entry-level small-core processors.

 




AMD's mobile CPU unit share rose from 20.6% in Q2 to 21.9% in Q3, a sequential gain of 1.4%, while Intel's share fell from 79.4% to 78.1%, down 1.4% QoQ. Intel did manage to grow shipments slightly, but well below normal seasonal levels, allowing AMD to capture market share during the quarter, according to Mercury Research. Nonetheless, AMD lost 0.4% market share year-over-year, whereas Intel gained 0.4%.

On the revenue side, the mix probably favored both companies but helped AMD more. Intel's shortage of low-end CPUs pushed its average selling prices upward, while AMD — which does not have direct rivals for Intel Atom-like SoCs — benefited from increased shipments of mid-range and premium Ryzen mobile processors as Intel faced some shortages on this side of the spectrum as well.

In the server CPU market, Q3 2025 saw relatively flat unit shipments overall, but while AMD managed to edge out another small gain, its gains have been negligible this year. Then again, although the sequential movement was modest, it continued the longer-term trend of AMD steadily expanding its presence in x86 servers.

 




AMD's server unit share increased from 27.3% in Q2 to 27.8% in Q3, while Intel's share slipped 0.5% to 72.2%. Both companies saw YoY shipment growth, but AMD's increase was stronger, helping it push unit share higher compared to the same quarter a year earlier, so overall things look good for AMD.

Most of the real action in Q3 came from product mix rather than volume, according to Mercury. AMD's EPYC 'Turin' ramp accelerated, driving stronger demand for high-core-count EPYC processors, while Intel saw increasing adoption of Xeon 6 'Granite Rapids,' which helped lift its average selling prices despite slightly lower unit volumes.

On the revenue side, AMD hit another all-time high, as the mix shifted heavily toward its latest and more expensive EPYC 9005-series platform. The combination of flat unit shipments and rising prices meant that AMD's server revenue continues to grow significantly faster than its unit share, while Intel's revenue gains were more limited due to modest declines in its overall shipment mix.

In terms of unit share, AMD continued to gain ground in Q3 2025 across nearly all major x86 segments, helped by strong desktop growth driven by the halo effect of range-topping Ryzen 9000-series CPUs and Intel's struggles to ship enough previous-generation desktop CPUs, as well as the relatively low popularity of its latest offerings for desktops. As a result, AMD expanded its presence in client CPUs, reached a new high in desktops, and inched upward in servers, while Intel's share declined modestly as supply constraints and product transitions limited its ability to address all orders. Although Intel still led the market in total shipments, the balance continued shifting gradually toward AMD.

In terms of revenue, AMD delivered even stronger results, setting new highs in both desktop and server segments thanks to rising sales of premium processors and the ramp of its newest platforms. Intel's revenue performance was more mixed: constrained low-end supply pushed its average prices higher, but it ceded more of the high-margin market to AMD, especially in desktops and enterprise servers. Then again, the company announced price hikes of its popular Raptor Lake processors, which will impact its results in Q4.

Obesity wonder drugs Wegovy and Zepbound are already showing that they can reduce the risk of cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease in addition to helping people lose weight. Now, a US-wide trial will test whether tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound, may be an effective treatment for people with long Covid.

Part of a class of drugs known as GLP-1s, tirzepatide acts on receptors in the gut and the brain to regulate appetite. As a result, people shed pounds by eating less. But decreased body weight doesn't fully explain the positive effects on the heart and kidney. Mounting evidence suggests that the drugs have a broad anti-inflammatory effect on the body—a mechanism that's of interest for treating long Covid.

As many as 20 million people in the US have experienced long Covid, a chronic condition that lasts for at least three months after an initial infection. While more than 200 symptoms of long Covid have been documented, some of the most common include coughing, shortness of breath, brain fog, fatigue, mood changes, trouble sleeping, and body aches.

Scientists still don't fully understand how and why long Covid occurs, but they've found persistent inflammation in many patients. This chronic inflammation may be caused by lingering traces of virus in the body or by misdirected antibodies, known as autoantibodies, that attack a person's own cells and tissues. The hope is that tirzepatide could tamp down this inflammation to improve patients' symptoms.

“The rationale for a GLP-1 drug is its powerful body-wide and brain anti-inflammatory properties,” says Eric Topol, a cardiologist and the director of the La Jolla, California-based Scripps Research Translational Institute, which is sponsoring the trial.

Scripps researchers are recruiting 1,000 people across the country who are 18 years of age or older and have medical documentation of long Covid. Unlike most medical studies, which typically require multiple in-person visits, the Scripps trial is fully remote. Participants will be randomized to receive either tirzepatide or a placebo by mail and will take it for a year. They'll receive a fitness tracker so that researchers can measure their step count, an important indicator of fatigue. Participants will also get a smart scale and will weigh in regularly. Since GLP-1s are used for weight management, study investigators want to make sure participants don't lose too much weight during the trial.

Julia Moore Vogel, coprincipal investigator of the trial who herself has long Covid, says the remote design of the trial was intentional. “For the long Covid population, it's so crucial, because if you're requiring people to come into a clinic, you're systematically excluding the most severely affected folks who are housebound or bedbound. It was really important to us to make sure that those people are included.”

In-person drug trials for long Covid have struggled to recruit patients because the debilitating nature of the condition makes it difficult for patients to travel for studies.

A lack of investment from the pharmaceutical industry has also stalled research. And despite a hefty $1.8 billion investment into long Covid research under the Biden administration, progress on finding effective treatments has been slow. Getting vaccinated remains the best way to prevent long Covid, and studies have found that taking the antiviral Paxlovid during an infection can also reduce the risk of developing it.

“There is an urgent need for investment in long Covid clinical trials, and in decentralized clinical trials like this one in particular,” says Hannah Davis, cofounder of the Patient-Led Research Collaborative, a long Covid research and advocacy group. “Tirzepatide has shown to have anti-inflammatory, metabolic, and cardiovascular effects that could be promising to long Covid patients.”

One published study found that in 47 people with mast cell activation syndrome, or MCAS, a condition in which white blood cells release inflammatory chemicals, 89 percent benefited from a GLP-1, especially at low doses. The findings are relevant for long Covid, which shares many symptoms with MCAS.

David Kaufman, a private practice physician who specializes in MCAS, chronic fatigue syndrome, autoimmune diseases, and chronic infections, has been treating long Covid patients with small doses of tirzepatide at his clinic, the Center for Complex Diseases, in Seattle and Mountain View, California.

He started prescribing GLP-1s off-label after some of his patients started taking the drugs for weight loss but were also reporting less fatigue. “I want to be cautious. This doesn't cure everything. What it does is it seems to move the needle so patients can become more functional, but they may still need some fine tuning with the other medication,” he tells WIRED.

To avoid unwanted weight loss and the gastrointestinal side effects that come with GLP-1s, Kaufman typically starts patients out on one-tenth of the standard starting dose of 2.5 milligrams. He currently has 40 to 50 long Covid patients who are taking microdoses of tirzepatide. At a long Covid workshop in September, Kaufman presented his and other providers' experience treating more than 350 patients with microdosing. They have found a 60 to 90 percent decrease in fatigue, brain fog, pain, and MCAS symptoms.

The Scripps trial, meanwhile, is using the standard 2.5 milligrams of tirzepatide as the starting dose. An NIH-sponsored trial also plans to test a GLP-1 drug for long Covid.

Although GLP-1s are showing knock-on benefits for a variety of symptoms and conditions, there's reason for caution. Given the spectrum of symptoms associated with long Covid, there's unlikely to be a one-size-fits-all treatment.

What happened to Rad Power Bikes?

That's the question on many minds in Seattle and beyond after the startup revealed Monday it is facing a potential shutdown due to “significant financial challenges.”

Rad started as a scrappy hardware startup and grew into the largest e-bike seller in North America. The company's co-founders won Young Entrepreneur of the Year honors at the GeekWire Awards. Rad raised more than $300 million in 2021 and hit a $1.65 billion valuation — a rare unicorn in Seattle.

But a series of missteps and macroeconomic challenges led to more than seven rounds of layoffs and a remarkable downfall. Rad said it could shut down as soon as January. 

“We are still exploring every viable option to preserve the brand and the community that helped build it,” the company said in a statement to GeekWire.

During a ride along the Burke-Gilman Trail in Seattle this week, we met John Ward, who was cruising on his Rad City electric bike.

“It's a bummer,” Ward said of the hometown company's struggles. “I'm 76 and I don't like climbing up the hills anymore, and I got this Rad bike and I've been very happy.”

Ward, one of nearly 700,000 Rad riders around the globe, is a longtime cyclist who said he uses the e-bike for regular rides with friends and also trips to the swimming pool, the grocery store and the farmers market. He said he's concerned that if the company goes out of business it will be tough to get parts or service.

We spoke with former Rad execs, industry experts, bike shop owners, and hardware startup leaders to understand what went wrong at the company.

Rad's story is a case study in what happens when a breakout hardware brand bets its future on a once-in-a-century pandemic demand spike — and then gets hit with a supply chain storm and the realities of venture-backed consumer hardware.

Right product at the right moment

Rad gave customers “that feeling like they were a kid again,” co-founder Ty Collins told GeekWire this week. 

The company, born from founder Mike Radenbaugh's teenage tinkering, launched a direct-to-consumer model in 2015 with an e-bike at an approachable price.

“They made bicycles accessible to people that may be intimidated going into a bike shop,” said Peter Clancy, business partner at Westside Bicycle in Seattle.

Rad opened up a new “lifestyle” market segment — sub-$2,000 e-bikes for regular people, not hardcore cyclists.

“Rad kind of built the e-bike space,” said Justin Taylor, editor at Electric Bike Report.

Marty Pluth, general manager at Gregg's Cycle, remembers commuting over Seattle's 520 bridge and seeing “a ton of Rad bikes” owned by people in a ski jacket or baggy shorts — a sign the company had unlocked a new kind of customer.

Scrappy and scaling

The company's early team was a ragtag crew doing multiple jobs at once. It was also methodical. “We just really efficiently scaled our spend,” Collins said. 

Rad quickly found product-market fit after an initial crowdfunding campaign. From there, sales kept booming, from Ballard to Berlin. “We'd sell thousands of bikes in seconds,” Collins said. “We literally couldn't keep bikes in stock.”

The company reported $100 million in revenue in 2019 and landed investment from Darrell Cavens and Mark Vadon, former Zulily and Blue Nile execs. Later that year it inked a delivery partnership with Domino's. 

“I see a business with super passionate customers, a cool product, and awesome entrepreneurs,” Vadon told GeekWire that year. “That's what you want to be investing in.”

Pandemic boost

Then the e-bike market exploded as the pandemic hit. People wanted to get outside and have fun. There was also a climate-friendly element. 

Rad cited a 297% increase in demand in May 2020.

COVID brought the classic “is this a blip or a new normal?” dilemma for Rad and many other e-commerce companies experiencing a surge of orders.

“The thought was that this was a catalyst in the electric bike boom,” Collins said.

No matter what, “we had to make sure that we had inventory for it,” Collins said. “If people wanted to buy bikes, we needed bikes.”

Step on the gas

Rad raised more than $300 million from investors in 2021, doubled headcount to more than 600 employees, and bet big on sustained demand.

But like many other businesses during the pandemic, Rad dealt with supply chain delays and disruption. The company went to great lengths to meet demand — in mid-2021, it bought 64 containers and chartered its cargo from Asia into a non-traditional port near Seattle.

Bike companies over-ordered on long lead times assuming COVID demand would keep going, according to Pluth. But he said the surge slowed dramatically by the summer of 2022.

“Prices were driven down, margins were driven down,” Pluth said. “Rad was affected — everybody was.”

As the pandemic demand settled, Rad was saddled with hundreds of millions of dollars of inventory. 

“We just had too much inventory liability that we couldn't be flexible,” said Leah Hunkins, a former supply chain leader at Rad. “It's like walking around with a bowling ball around our ankles and going for a run — you can't move.”

Pluth stressed that selling bikes below cost to clear inventory can be problematic.

“The more you sell, the more money you're losing,” he said. “You're in between this double-whammy of lower demand and a lot of product in stock. The other companies were able to work through that, given they have a lot longer track record and more diversified product. I'm just not sure Rad was able to do that.”

A growth-at-all-costs mindset may have made sense while Rad's bikes were selling faster than they could be built. But it ended up causing problems down the road as the company started missing revenue expectations.

“The only thing we're probably guilty of is being overly optimistic that Rad was on this trajectory of growth that would never stop,” Hunkins said.

Collins, who stepped down in 2021, said the scarcity mindset began to shift once the company started raising outside capital. “When you have more money to spend … it does present a lot more doors that, in theory, could be opened,” he said. “It gives you a lot of keys to a lot of doors.”

He added that the “internal secret sauce” to Rad's success was allowing employees to “take real ownership over the brand and feel like they were really a part of everything.”

New kids on the block

At the same time, Rad faced an influx of strong competitors — Lectric, Velotric and others — plus traditional brands finally moving into e-bikes, all slicing off pieces of the pie.

As more options arrived — from cheap Amazon imports to higher-end brands — Rad was squeezed in the middle: not the cheapest, not the most premium.

“The differentiation of our product got more challenging,” Hunkins said. 

Ward, the rider on the Burke-Gilman, agreed that a saturated market may have created trouble for Rad. During his short stop to talk to GeekWire, cyclists riding e-bikes from Aventon, Lectric, Emotion, Super 73, Gazelle, Urban Arrow and more passed by on a trail that's been dominated by Rad in recent years.

Clancy noted how easy it was for new entrants to appear. “It takes nothing to become a bike brand,” he said. “If you have one decent credit card, you can order a dozen bikes, and off you go.”

Lawsuits, layoffs, recalls

Rad faced other speed bumps including a wrongful death lawsuit, a lawsuit related to property damage, and the recall of nearly 30,000 units due to a safety issue. More recent online posts about Rad highlight customer service issues.

While Rad's direct-to-consumer strategy was an advantage early on (shorter supply chain, bypass bike shops), it carried long-term service obligations. Rad's scale meant tens of thousands of riders looking for service in markets where independent shops had to juggle labor costs, parts sourcing and warranty expectations on bikes they didn't sell.

“It worked in the beginning, until people started having problems with proprietary parts,” said Matt Thomas, owner of The Polka Dot Jersey bike shop in Seattle.

Over time Rad had to stand up its own stores and service network to support hundreds of thousands of bikes in the wild — an expensive, operationally complex layer on top of already thin hardware margins.

Rad shut down its mobile services arm in 2022 and cut 100 jobs. Later that year, Radenbaugh stepped down as CEO. Rad pulled out of Europe starting in 2024 and closed some service shops. 

Meanwhile, the company went through multiple rounds of layoffs under new CEO Phil Molyneux, the former Sony president who departed earlier this year. The company is now led by CEO Kathi Lentzsch, who previously ran Bartell Drugs as CEO before the company sold to Rite-Aid in 2020.

Hard times for hardware

Rad's challenges reflect broader difficulties facing consumer hardware startups in the post-2022 investment climate.

“Hardware success requires patient capital as it will take a long time and money to build an enduring brand,” said Clayton Wood, former CEO of Seattle-based cooking automation startup Picnic. “That capital is very scarce in the last few years.”

Wood noted that pre-2022, venture capital focused on creating unicorns, and hardware companies could raise on high valuations because of high price points and gross profits. “In 2022 the game changed, leaving anyone who raised prior with overvalued companies,” he said. It's easier to pivot in software, he said, but hardware has high production setup and development costs. 

Amish Patel, managing director at Conduit Venture Labs, a hardware-focused startup studio, also pointed out structural challenges. 

Patel said consumer hardware companies with unit-margin-based business models face particular challenges. Hardware brands selling $250+ products rely almost entirely on consumer demand and scale, he said, and when margins tighten — with no software, service, or subscription revenue to offset — the business becomes extremely fragile.

“Add together over-ordering from the boom, inventory risk as demand cooled, high interest and debt servicing costs — and you get classic hardware scaling pain,” Patel said.

Rad's funding rounds may have been seen as a sign of strength. But others see it differently.

“It just seemed weird that a company like that couldn't stand on its own without huge cash influxes,” said David Johnson, owner of Electric & Folding Bikes Northwest. “It just didn't seem sustainable.”

Thomas, the owner at Polka Dot, shared a similar sentiment.

“I don't quite understand why anyone thought during the pandemic that they were going to sustain a 500% increase in business year-over-year for five years,” he said. “I mean, I own a bike shop. I'm not an analyst. But that one didn't seem too hard to figure out.”

GeekWire contacted Vadon and Cavens for comment, but have not heard back. The company's other investors include Fidelity Management & Research Company, Counterpoint Global (Morgan Stanley), Cercano Management, Durable Capital Partners LP, The Rise Fund (TPG's multi-sector global impact investing strategy), and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates.

The future of e-bikes

Rad wasn't the only e-bike maker to struggle. Europe's VanMoof filed for bankruptcy in 2023, while Belgium-based Cowboy and other rivals have struggled to find footing after pandemic-era highs. Some cite tariffs as a headwind.

But bike shop owners say e-bike demand remains strong. “We had three people today come in asking about e-bikes,” said Clancy of Westside Bicycle. 

The U.S. e-bike market is expected to reach $87.1 billion by 2032, up from $54.1 billion in 2025, according to MarketsandMarkets.

Rad says its team is working to “stabilize the business” and explore options for a long-term path forward. The company is still selling bikes and is promoting a Black Friday sale on its site.

“They are a good quality company that makes good bikes,” said Taylor, of Electric Bike Report. “And I do think the industry is better with them here.”

A German court has found that Google has abused its dominant market position in the price comparison sector and ruled that the company must pay a total of €572 million ($665.6 million) in damages to two German price comparison companies, according to a report by Reuters.

Google must pay the price comparison platform Idealo about €465 million (about $540 million) in damages, and €107 million (about $124 million) to Producto, another price comparison tool, the report said.

Idealo had claimed damages of €3.3 billion from Google, arguing that its lawsuit was a direct response to the European Court of Justice's ruling in 2024 that found the search giant was self-preferencing its own shopping comparison service, breaking competition rules, and fined it about $2.7 billion. 

Idealo said on Friday that it intends to continue its case against Google and seek the full damages it had sued for.

“We welcome the court holding Google accountable. But the consequences of self-favoring go far beyond the amount awarded. We will continue to fight – because market abuse must have consequences and must not become a lucrative business model that is worthwhile despite fines and compensation payments,” Idealo's co-founder and CEO Albrecht von Sonntag said in a statement.

Google said it intends to appeal both rulings. “The changes we made in 2017 are working well, with no intervention from the European Commission. The number of price comparison sites in Europe using the remedy Shopping Unit has multiplied from seven then to 1,550 today,” a Google spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

The company added that it offers rival comparison shopping services the same opportunity as Google Shopping to display ads, and said Google Shopping operates as if it were a separate business, participating in auctions the same as everyone else.

The ruling follows close on the heels of an EU investigation into how Google's spam policy affects publishers' search rankings. The company was recently fined €2.95 billion (just under $3.5 billion) by the EU for allegedly breaching EU antitrust rules by favoring its own advertising services.

Payment technology company Pine Labs, backed by PayPal and Mastercard, won over public investors on Friday, finishing its first day of trading 14% higher even after lowering its valuation for its $440 million IPO. This makes it the second-largest Indian fintech listing this year after online brokerage Groww's nearly $750 million debut earlier this week.

The stock opened at ₹242 and rose as high as ₹284 before settling at ₹252, up from the issue price of ₹221, resulting in a market capitalization of ₹289 billion (approximately $3.3 billion) for the Gurugram-based company. 

It's a step down from Pine Labs' 2022 private valuation of over $5 billion, but still a clear signal that investors are backing India's growing push to take its fintech model global.

Founded in 1998, Pine Labs has been steadily expanding beyond India and now operates in 20 markets, including Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, the UAE, the U.S., and some parts of Africa. What started as a point-of-sale terminal provider has since evolved into a broader payments platform that supports bill payments, account-aggregator transactions, and a range of merchant and acquiring services.

In India, Pine Labs competes with the likes of Razorpay, Paytm, and Walmart-owned PhonePe. The company became profitable in the June quarter, posting a net profit of ₹47.86 million (about $540,000), compared with a loss of ₹278.89 million a year earlier. Revenue from operations rose 17.9% year-over-year to ₹6.16 billion (around $69 million), while its overseas business contributed roughly 15% of total revenue, rising to ₹943.25 million (about $11 million) from ₹795.97 million a year earlier.

“We will never stop being a startup,” said Amrish Rau, CEO of Pine Labs, during its public listing ceremony. “Now that we are a listed company, [that word] will not be heard in our halls.”

Existing investors, including Peak XV Partners, Temasek Holdings, PayPal, and Mastercard, were among those who sold part of their holdings in the public listing.

“Pine Labs never wanted to compete on price,” said Shailendra Singh, managing director at Peak XV Partners. “It always wanted to compete on a superior proposition. And we know this company would keep compounding because there were such strong moats in the business, and it shaped our worldview of how to think about companies and be patient and let ecosystems mature.”

Peak XV Partners, which split from Sequoia Capital in 2023, first invested in Pine Labs in 2009 amid the global financial crisis. The VC firm is also seeing back-to-back partial public exits this week, as Pine Labs is its second portfolio company to list after Groww, which debuted on Indian exchanges with a 12% pop and closed its first trading day 29% above its issue price of ₹100.

Pine Labs' market debut is part of a broader wave, as the public-listing engine in India is revving up. From tech and fintech to e-commerce and manufacturing, more startups are choosing to go public — fueled by strong domestic investor appetite, eased interest-rate conditions, and regulatory nudges to boost listings. Globally, finance has been the top IPO sector this year, with IPOs worth $34.34 billion so far in 2025, more than doubling the $14.05 billion raised over the same period in 2024, according to Dealogic.

With its public debut, Pine Labs plans to keep widening its geographic footprint while deepening its presence in India with new products and services aimed at the country's rapidly expanding, internet-driven consumer base.

“Our core business will keep expanding. Our moats will be strengthened, and margins will grow,” Rau said.

AI just went from vibe hacking to a nation-state-sponsored cyberattack.

Anthropic, the AI company behind Claude, just published a report detailing how its agentic coding tool was used in a cyberattack that targeted 30 institutions, including tech, finance, and chemical manufacturing companies, plus some government agencies. The company alleges that a Chinese state-sponsored group was behind the campaign, and that it used a jailbroken version of Claude to conduct the sophisticated attack. According to Anthropic, this is the first time an AI-orchestrated cyber attack has been reported.

The company says that although AI with agentic capabilities has increased its usefulness in productivity-related tasks, it has also allowed bad actors to take advantage of AI tools to execute complicated attacks without needing constant human supervision. Although LLMs typically have built-in safeguards to prevent them from being used in criminal acts, the recent event showed that there are ways to circumvent this.

Recent developments in AI technology have enabled the threat actor to use Claude effectively in their intrusions. This includes increased intelligence, which allows the AI to follow multiple, layered instructions and understand the context in which they were to be executed; agency, allowing the tool to make decisions on its own without human input; and access to advanced tools through the Model Context Protocol, letting it use security-related software like password crackers and network scanners.

The attack was allegedly conducted in five phases — in Phase 1, the human operator assigns a target to Claude. In Phase 2, the AI is instructed to conduct its initial reconnaissance, using scan, search, data retrieval, and code analysis tools to deliver an initial analysis and summary of the target to its operator. Phase 3 is a more targeted version of Phase 2, where the AI runs a vulnerability scan based on its findings to determine how it will compromise the target.

This is also where the operator can instruct the AI to begin exploitation by engaging callback services. Again, the human operator reviews the AI's findings and may even give the tool additional directives, either to run the scan again and find more weaknesses in the network or to begin Phases 4 and 5. In the last phases of the attack, the human operator directs the AI tool to obtain credentials and access data. At these stages, both the human and the AI tool can use the exploitation tools to locate and exfiltrate data from the target.

Although the AI still reverts to the human operator in various steps of the network intrusion, it mostly does this to report its findings and for further instructions. Otherwise, it mostly runs independently, around 80% to 90% of the time, allowing the bad actors to run an elaborate operation much quicker and with fewer humans in the loop.

Anthropic says that Claude has built-in safeguards to help prevent this from happening, but the attackers were able to circumvent this. The first thing they did was to convince the LLM that it was working for a cybersecurity company, and that it was being used for penetration testing and red teaming. They also broke down the entire operation into smaller, seemingly innocent tasks. This prevented Claude from seeing the entire context of the operation and the true purpose of its instructions.

While AI has previously been used for “vibe hacking”, this is the first time that it was used in an attack of this magnitude. Advancing AI technology has now allowed smaller teams with fewer resources to conduct complex campaigns such as this, although it must be noted that Anthropic suspects that this was driven by a nation-state sponsor. Thankfully, its team soon discovered what was happening and took steps to document the entire operation. It also banned accounts that were detected to be engaged in illegal activity, as well as notifying both the targets and the authorities of what was happening. Aside from this, the company published its findings (PDF) on the first-reported AI-orchestrated cyber espionage campaign to help the industry detect these and develop countermeasures.

OLED panels and high refresh rates tend to drive gaming monitor prices high enough to question your entire hobby. The LG 34GX90SA just hit $679 on Amazon, slashed from its $1,399 list price, and this price makes premium curved ultrawide gaming a lot more accessible.

In one package, you're getting a 34-inch WQHD OLED display featuring a dramatic 800R curve, a 240Hz refresh rate, and 0.03ms response time that gets rid of the motion blur and screen tearing problems affecting normal monitors. This is the lowest price we have tracked for this monitor since it was released so it's been the early Black Friday deal gamers have been waiting for all year.

See at Amazon

That 240Hz refresh rate and the 0.03ms gray-to-gray response time of OLED creates motion clarity that no LCD panel can match, regardless of price. Fast-paced shooters like Valorant or Apex Legends benefit a lot from this speed, and allows you to track enemies through quick movements without ghosting or motion blur which causes you to miss shots.

The response time is basically a measure of how fast individual pixels change colors, and at 0.03ms, this monitor reacts about 100 times faster than typical gaming monitors that hover in the range of 3-5ms. This technical advantage translates into clearer visual information during heated moments of gameplay where split-second decisions make all the difference between winning and losing.

Where the OLED panel technology pays off is in perfect blacks created by turning off individual pixels rather than backlighting that bleeds through, like LCD displays. That equates to a contrast ratio of 1.5 million to 1-the darkest darks and brightest brights can exist on-screen at the same time without washing each other out. Games like Cyberpunk 2077 or horror titles like Resident Evil Village take on incredible depth and atmosphere when the shadows actually look black instead of murky gray. The 1300-nit peak brightness ensures HDR content displays properly with brilliant highlights that pop off the screen while the DisplayHDR True Black 400 certification guarantees consistent HDR performance across different content types.

Color accuracy goes up to 98.5% of the DCI-P3 color space which matters for both gaming and creative work like photo editing or video production. This wide color gamut means you see colors as developers intended them-from the vibrant neon lights of futuristic cityscapes to the subtle earth tones of realistic military shooters. Content creators working on projects bound for film or streaming platforms can trust the colors that show up on this monitor to accurately represent what viewers will see on other DCI-P3 calibrated displays.

The 800R curvature creates an immersive and wraparound effect that extends your peripheral vision and pulls you deeper into game worlds. That 800R measurement means the monitor would form a complete circle with an 800mm radius if you extended the curve all the way around, creating a much more dramatic bend than the gentle 1800R or 1000R curves found on most curved monitors.

Both AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-SYNC compatibility eliminate screen tearing and stuttering by synchronizing your graphics card's frame output with the monitor's refresh rate. This works across the whole 48-240Hz variable refresh rate range, keeping visuals smooth as the frame rate drops to 60fps in demanding scenes or hits 240fps in less intensive moments.

The integrated webOS platform converts this game monitor into a smart display, streaming Netflix, Prime Video, Disney Plus, and more than 300 free LG Channels without the need for a connected PC or streaming device. Cloud gaming services like Nvidia GeForce Now, Amazon Luna, and Blacknut run natively from the monitor's UI, enabling you to game without a dedicated gaming rig by streaming games over your internet connection. USB Type-C connectivity offers 65W power delivery to charge laptops while simultaneously passing video and data over a single cable, which cleans up desk space and streamlines your setup.

For $679, this gets you a monitor that's cheaper than many basic 1440p gaming monitors, but includes OLED quality that usually demands $1,000-plus pricing.

YMTC plots 2027 production start as Beijing sets its sights on memory sovereignty.

Yangtze Memory Technologies Co. (YMTC), China's top NAND flash manufacturer and one of the most heavily scrutinized names in the chip war, is pushing ahead with plans for a third semiconductor plant in Wuhan. The facility is expected to begin mass production in 2027, in a move that underscores Beijing's intention to double down on domestic memory capacity even as YMTC remains barred from acquiring advanced U.S. chipmaking tools.

The Wuhan expansion marks the company's most ambitious project since being placed on the U.S. Entity List in December 2022, a designation that has crippled access to EUV and advanced DUV lithography, precision etching gear, and key U.S.-origin design IP. Yet, instead of collapsing, YMTC is adapting slowly with the full backing of China's industrial policy apparatus.

YMTC's situation is unlike that of Huawei, which was forced into a radical pivot toward software and cloud services following its sanctions. YMTC, by contrast, continues to manufacture supply-constrained NAND flash chips at scale, albeit at reduced efficiency and with aging process nodes. Its most advanced product, the 232-layer Xtacking 3.0 NAND, was benchmarked in late 2022 as competitive with Micron's and Samsung's offerings. But sustaining that lead has proven impossible without access to ASML's cutting-edge tooling.

Various reports suggest that YMTC's Fab 2 has been operating with domestic workarounds and modified legacy tools, relying in part on procurement from third-party intermediaries to secure essential chemicals and maintenance components. However, these workarounds are slow and painful.

One potential candidate is SMEE's immersion lithography equipment, but this has yet to deliver consistent yields beyond 28nm logic equivalents, far from the sub-20nm half-pitch necessary for leading-edge NAND stacking. Still, YMTC's new fab suggests confidence that by 2027, domestic toolchains will be capable enough to support high-volume NAND production if not at the bleeding edge, then at commercial scale.

 




The report by Nikkei Asia suggests that the timing of this announcement also aligns with China's broader recalibration toward AI infrastructure resilience. With U.S. export restrictions locking out Chinese firms from Nvidia H100 and A100-class GPUs, Beijing has redirected its subsidies and engineering talent toward local accelerator design, sovereign foundation models, and the underlying memory and packaging stacks that make them viable.

In that context, NAND flash is arguably foundational. While DRAM remains the performance bottleneck in AI inference, NAND underpins persistent storage for massive model checkpoints, training data lakes, and parameter weights for retrieval-augmented generation. YMTC's success here is thus critical not because its chips are the fastest, but because they're Chinese.

That imperative is reflected in the composition of China's "Little Giants" initiative, which is understood to support key industrial chains and strategic emerging industries such as semiconductors and advanced manufacturing in the upstream value chain. YMTC, though technically a commercial entity under Tsinghua Unigroup, functions effectively as a state-backed lynchpin for this ecosystem.

It's also worth noting that YMTC's return to expansion mirrors Beijing's new appetite for high-risk, high-capex investment in areas where U.S. export controls bite hardest, but enforcement remains inconsistent. In that grey area, YMTC might be betting that Washington's resolve may soften over time, or that domestic tooling will catch up just enough to justify the investment.

From a business standpoint, YMTC's decision to break ground on a third fab lands during one of the tightest NAND cycles in recent memory. According to Phison CEO K.S. Pua, the price of a 1Tb TLC NAND die has more than doubled in the past six months, climbing from $4.80 to $10.70, with virtually all 2026 production capacity already sold out. NAND flash pricing is expected to remain elevated into 2027, as AI datacenter deployments and enterprise SSD demand continue to outpace wafer output across the major suppliers.

Micron, SK Hynix, and Samsung are all riding that upturn, but their responses have been measured. Micron is prioritizing DRAM and HBM3E, while SK Hynix has pivoted to premium AI NAND. Samsung, for its part, is accelerating its transition to eighth-generation 3D V-NAND while absorbing the cost pressures that come with it. What none of them are doing is flooding the market with new capacity. YMTC, by contrast, is hoping to do exactly that, not because it sees an opening to grab global share, but because its political and economic mandate is different.

Beijing's industrial planners are less concerned with global pricing cycles than with insulating domestic AI infrastructure from foreign dependency. If YMTC can bring its third fab online by 2027 — even at 128-layer or similar nodes — it can serve national storage demand across hyperscalers, surveillance systems, and edge compute. That volume won't threaten Samsung's lead, but it could give Chinese cloud providers a secure NAND supply at a time when export controls are steadily tightening and global inventories are already claimed.

There's no denying that YMTC's third fab is a geopolitical play as much as an economic one. On paper, its production timeline puts it three years away from volume output, which is an eternity in semiconductor terms. By 2027, however, the efficacy of U.S. sanctions will hinge on how well Chinese tooling ecosystems mature. YMTC bets that by then, it won't need American equipment, or at least not enough to make the fab infeasible. Whether that turns out to be true is uncertain.

 




For the world's top memory makers, YMTC's continued growth even under U.S. sanctions is more than a marginal concern. With a third fab now in planning and domestic demand accelerating, the company is on track to become the fifth-largest NAND producer globally, and could climb to fourth if its expansion proceeds on schedule. According to Nikkei Asia, industry executives estimate that YMTC could capture 10% or more of global NAND production capacity by as early as next year, potentially overtaking Micron in volume terms.

Even if YMTC remains focused on serving China's domestic market, that shift has global implications. For Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron, it may force a recalibration of pricing strategies and long-term exposure to China, especially as Beijing continues to push for procurement of domestic components.

Bitcoin wallet and lending platform Lava has come under scrutiny in the past few weeks due to a lack of clarity around a recent update. According to numerous users of the app, the rug was pulled out from under them in a way, as the update in question completely altered the wallet's trust and security model by switching from a non-custodial setup to a fully trusted and custodial model where Lava has full control over users' digital assets.

According to a report in Blockspace, the controversy started in September when Lava users were shown a screen that indicated an update was necessary to gain access to all of the latest features. Notably, the update screen did not indicate there would be a complete alteration of how custody of user funds was handled behind the scenes in the Lava app. Additionally, there was no way to access loans that had already been taken out via the app without the update.

Eventually, Lava CEO Shehzan Maredia made an X post on some changes that had been made in terms of how the financial app functions behind the scenes. The details of the changes outlined in the post are somewhat murky, but the takeaway for many was that Lava would be moving to a completely custodial model. In response, Foundation Head of Physical Design Owen Kemeys publicly asked on X for more specifics about what exactly had changed and whether those alterations had already been implemented via an update of the app.

The move to a custodial model for Lava would be particularly odd, as Maredia has a long list of posts on X regarding the problems with custodial setups. Additionally, while all this was happening, Lava had also announced a new $200 million fundraising round. Maredia allegedly told Blockspace that a post-mortem regarding this event would be provided on Wednesday, but such an update providing more clarity had not been published as of the time of this writing on Thursday.

Hold on. Lava was founded as DLC based and "non custodial"; ie local keys (for what that's worth – not 100% accurate whilst lender is also the oracle, but, baby steps).

One of the biggest criticisms of the crypto space, more generally, is the large amount of decentralization theater that takes place. This issue was on full display a few weeks ago when a large amount of crypto infrastructure went down amid an Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage. A large part of the decentralization theater that has occurred in crypto over the years has also been centered around stablecoins, and there is an increasing sense that much of the technology used in crypto is now mainly focused on regulatory arbitrage for centralized entities rather than any sort of cypherpunk philosophy.

In the aforementioned X post by Maredia, the Lava CEO said they are taking a different approach than those who use “trustless theater” in the crypto industry. However, the level of decentralization involved in Lava's app was questioned in the past, as it was originally built on the concept of Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) with Lava itself eventually acting as the relevant oracle. Additionally, the Lava app has also operated on a closed-source basis this whole time, so what exactly has been happening behind the scenes hasn't really been known.

Stablecoins are just traditional fintech that have to use the word "blockchain" for regulatory arbitrage purposes. Doesn't really make sense to build on Bitcoin. Solana is so centralized it's basically just traditional fintech. Maybe "stablechains" eventually used.

— Kyle Torpey (@kyletorpey) November 13, 2025



Users of closed-source crypto wallets are effectively using a custodial system, as they have no way of knowing whether the developers behind the app have access to users' private keys. Open source software is generally viewed as a requirement for any Bitcoin-related software, as the whole point is to operate as a decentralized financial system without trusted third parties. This is also why the Bitcoin Core node client goes the extra mile with practices such as reproducible builds and forcing users to manually opt in to software updates.

Due to the embrace of crypto by the Trump administration, there could be a continuation of this bifurcation of the space between Bitcoin's focus on decentralization and fintech-esque use cases that heavily involve centralized stablecoins.

Nintendo says it isn't on a mission to break third-party docks.

Nintendo has confirmed to Tom's Hardware that it has no intention of blocking the use of third-party docks with its Nintendo Switch 2 console, after users reported that the latest firmware version for the device rendered certain third-party docking stations inoperative. Numerous user reports have been abundant on the Switch Reddit platform, expressing their anger. Fortunately, vendors have identified a solution to this issue and are now releasing firmware updates for their docks to address it.

The big question many Switch 2 fans are wondering about is whether the issue was deliberate or just an accidental oversight on Nintendo's part. In a statement, a Nintendo representative told Tom's Hardware that "Nintendo Switch 2 outputs audiovisuals once it detects that it is docked into a Nintendo Switch 2 Dock. Nintendo Switch does the same, outputting audiovisuals once it detects that it is docked into a Nintendo Switch Dock. Nintendo does not have any intention to hinder or invalidate legal third-party dock compatibility."

Although the Switch 2 appears to use a standard USB-C docking interface, Nintendo is reportedly employing a proprietary handshake protocol. According to our sources, Nintendo may have separated the PID (Product ID) and the VID (Vendor ID), assigning one to charging and USB functionalities, and the other to HDMI output. The hypothesis is that Nintendo retained the existing PID and VID for charging and USB operations, but generated a new PID and VID specifically for HDMI output. That would explain why Switch 2 owners who have upgraded to firmware version 21.0.0 can still charge their devices on third-party docks, but there is no image output on the TV.

It is amusing to note that some user feedback indicates that the official Nintendo dock allegedly stopped working correctly after updating the Switch 2's firmware. However, a restart resolved the issue, though third-party docks did not fare as well.

The market currently offers a wide array of third-party docks and adapters for the Switch 2, supplied by brands such as Next, Antank, Siwiqu, Viture, Jemdo, Jsaux, and Hagibis. However, the firmware has not incapacitated all third-party docks; instead, only specific models have been affected. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that Nintendo did not deliberately disable third-party docks.

We reached out to Next, a manufacturer that produces a bunch of Switch 2 accessories, to inquire whether the issue affects its 4K TV Dock Kit (NX-NS2DK), which is exclusively sold at Best Buy for $59.99. The vendor confirmed that the firmware version 21.0.0 temporarily impacted the compatibility of its dock. However, Next's engineering team has successfully resolved the issue. It plans to deploy a firmware update with detailed instructions to restore the dock's functionality either today or on Saturday.

Most Switch 2 gamers will get by with the included official Nintendo dock. However, some individuals have televisions in multiple rooms and may prefer a dedicated dock for each display. Additionally, there are occasions when you want to share the Switch 2 experience with friends or family members and choose not to transport the dock frequently, seeking a more portable alternative.

Nintendo offers the Switch 2 dock separately for $124.99 on its official website. Although the company has not raised the prices of the Switch 2 due to U.S. tariffs, there has been a price increase concerning accessories and the standard Switch model. The cost of the Switch 2 dock was previously $109.99, then increased to $119.99, and subsequently settled at $124.99. It is considerably more expensive than third-party alternatives. The issue is that Nintendo sells the dock as part of a set that includes an AC adapter, a USB-C charging cable, and an HDMI cable, which naturally increases the overall cost.

If Nintendo were to offer the Switch 2 dock as a standalone product to make the price more attractive, it could persuade owners to prefer official products. Aside from design, the lower prices are what make third-party docks more appealing. If your dock is not functioning correctly, sit tight and wait for your manufacturer to release a firmware update to resolve the issue. Some have already done so.

OpenAI on Thursday introduced a group chat feature for ChatGPT. The feature, currently being tested in select regions, including Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan, lets users collaborate directly within the app.

The group chat is available to Free, Plus, and Team users on both mobile and web platforms. OpenAI says the pilot is designed to explore how people use group conversations in ChatGPT.

The announcement comes after earlier reports that OpenAI had been testing a direct-message-style tool. 

The ChatGPT maker describes this pilot as just a “small first step” toward creating a more “shared experience” in the app. Early users will be invited to provide feedback, which the company says will help shape how the feature eventually expands to more regions and offerings.

According to OpenAI, private chats and personal ChatGPT memory stay completely private. Group chats are invitation-only, and members can leave at any time. Most participants can remove others, though the group's creator can only leave voluntarily. For users under 18, content is filtered, with extra safeguards and parental controls in place.

Starting a group chat is easy. Just tap the people icon and add participants, either directly or by sharing a link. Groups can include one to 20 people. If you add someone to an existing chat, a new group is created, leaving the original conversation unchanged. Each group has a short profile, and all chats are organized in a labeled sidebar for easy access.

Group chats work just like regular ChatGPT conversations but with multiple people joining in. GPT‑5.1 Auto handles responses and comes loaded with features such as search, image generation, file uploads, and dictation. In group chats, ChatGPT's usage limits — which restrict how many AI responses users can receive per hour — only count when ChatGPT responds. Messages between human participants don't count toward these limits.

ChatGPT has learned new social skills for group chats, knowing when to jump in and when to stay quiet. You can tag “ChatGPT” to get it to respond. It can also react with emojis and use profile photos to create personalized images for the conversation.

The group chat feature represents the latest step in OpenAI's gradual transformation from a simple AI assistant into something resembling a social platform. In late September, the company launched Sora 2, a stand-alone social media app with a TikTok-style feed for sharing AI-generated videos, complete with algorithmic recommendations based on user activity and location, parental controls, and direct messaging capabilities.

Nvidia is also investing in similar optical quantum technology.

Quantum computing is still a long way from becoming a mainstream part of society; however, a Chinese firm has developed an all-new optical quantum computing chip that is closing the gap, called the world's first scalable, "industrial-grade" quantum chip. The South China Morning Post reports that the chip's developer claims it is "1,000 times faster" than Nvidia's GPUs at AI tasks and is already being used in some industries, including aerospace and finance.

The chip in question was built by the Chip Hub for Integrated Photonics Xplore (CHIPX) and is based on a brand-new co-packaging technology for photons and electronics, and it claims to be the first quantum computing platform to be widely deployable. These photonic chips house more than 1,000 optical components on a small 6-inch silicon wafer using a monolithic design, making them incredibly compact compared to traditional quantum computers.

All of these factors have reportedly allowed systems with these quantum chips to be deployed in just two weeks, compared to six months for traditional quantum computers. Its design also allows these chips to work in tandem with each other, just like AI GPUs, with deployments allegedly being "easily" scaled up to support 1 million qubits of quantum processing power.

CHIPX's optical quantum chip uses light (or photons) as the information carriers for qubits, rather than matter-based materials. Light has many advantages over raw electricity for computer processing: it takes up no physical space, generates no heat, and travels more efficiently and faster than electricity. Optical computing is attracting more and more scientists and companies as a potential replacement for electrical connections, especially now that power consumption in data centers is sky-high thanks to AI.

However, the current Achilles heel of China's new quantum chip has been the difficulty in producing these chips in large numbers, due to the delicacy of the materials used. The facilities responsible for producing these chips are reportedly producing 12,000 wafers per year, with each wafer yielding "about" 350 chips. That's a relatively low production volume compared to typical semiconductor fabs.

There are still many unknowns about this new quantum chip; we don't know which kinks need to be worked out (beyond the production issues) to make these chips truly mainstream. But, regardless, China is intent upon beating Western countries in quantum computing capabilities. If the "1,000x faster than Nvidia GPUs" statement is to be believed, it would be a marvelous feat but unsurprising in the world of quantum computers, which, by nature, can solve equations at a rate impossible to comprehend compared to classical computers.

We haven't seen quantum computers this small or as scalable from Western companies, but with companies like Nvidia pouring serious cash into the quantum computing sector, perhaps that will come soon.

Portable Bluetooth speakers solve a common problem: you want quality sound that follows you around without being tied to outlets or bulky equipment. The Anker Soundcore 2 has become one of the most popular portable speakers on Amazon, earning the number one bestseller spot in its category with over 141,000 customer ratings.

Amazon just launched early Black Friday deals exclusively for Prime members, and this speaker has dropped to an all-time low price of $29, down from its regular $44 price tag. This puts a trusted Anker speaker at the same price point as generic no-name alternatives which makes this deal really compelling.

The Soundcore 2 provides 12 watts of total audio power via dual neodymium drivers-a type of high-performance magnet usually used in much more expensive speaker systems. Neodymium drivers offer stronger magnetic fields in a compact size, enabling these speakers to produce louder, clearer sound without adding bulk or weight to the overall design.

The Bass response often suffers in portable speakers because producing low frequencies requires moving a lot of air, and that usually requires larger drivers and enclosures. Anker tackles this challenge by implementing BassUp technology-a method that uses digital signal processing to analyze and enhance low-end frequencies in real time. Patented Spiral Bass Port works in conjunction with this technology by creating a longer air path within the compact speaker body and allows bass waves to develop more fully before reaching your ears.

This speaker supports wireless stereo pairing, so you can link two Soundcore 2 units together for true left and right channel separation. It really opens up your audio when you can create a proper stereo soundstage with instruments and vocals occupying specific points in space rather than emanating from a single source. Two-speaker pairing is ideal for larger rooms or an outdoor party if you need the extra coverage, and it only takes a few seconds to set up using the Bluetooth connection.

Battery life is not an issue, especially during prolonged stays outdoors, away from power outlets. The 5,200mAh lithium-ion battery will give you up to 24 hours of continuous playback at moderate volume levels; that means you can take this speaker with you on weekend camping trips, day-long beach outings, and multi-day festivals without needing a recharge. Anker built its reputation on power management technology, and this shows in how efficiently this speaker uses its battery capacity.

With an IPX7 waterproof rating, serious protection against water damage far exceeds basic splash resistance. That means it can survive full submersion in up to one meter of water for 30 minutes, so if it accidentally fell in the pool, was caught in a rainstorm, or became splashed by waves while hanging at the beach, there's no need to panic. This also means it handles water vapor and humidity, so it's okay for steamy bathroom showers or foggy outdoor mornings. The device can be rinsed under running water as a way of cleaning off sand, dirt, or spilled drinks, which really comes in handy when trying to take care of the device after some outdoor fun.

The simple control layout puts power, volume, and playback buttons on top of the speaker where you can easily reach them without picking up the device. This straightforward design means anyone can operate the speaker without reading instructions or fumbling with complicated menus. With its cylindrical shape and a rubberized base, it sits stable on most surfaces and fits easily into backpack side pockets, car cup holders, or beach bags. Bluetooth 5 connectivity is present to offer reliable wireless range of up to about 66 feet in open spaces for freedom of movement sans constant audio cutouts.

If you're Prime, make sure you don't miss this.

Researchers at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center have developed a way to diagnose Lyme disease earlier and more accurately than traditional testing methods.

Over the past 30 years, Lyme disease has been on the rise in the United States, particularly in the Northeast region, where ticks carrying the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi are active from late spring through early fall. If left untreated, Lyme disease can cause joint, heart and nervous system complications.

While the characteristic bull's eye-like rash is an early sign of the disease, it occurs in only about 25% of patients. Many patients develop skin lesions mimicking other illnesses, complicating the clinical diagnosis. Further complicating diagnosis, antibody tests often show false negatives during the first few weeks of infection.

To address these diagnostic complications, researchers at New Hampshire's Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center have developed a new way to detect Borrelia burgdorferi, allowing for faster and more accurate diagnosis. Guohong (Grace) Huang, Ph.D., led the project and will present the work at the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) 2025 Annual Meeting & Expo, taking place Nov. 11–15 in Boston.

The project started with a case involving a 73-year-old woman who experienced progressively worsening skin hardening and inflammation as well as joint immobility over a four-year period. Doctors initially believed the patient had morphea, a condition that causes hard, thickened patches of skin. However, immunosuppressant medication used to treat morphea did not improve the patient's symptoms.

In this patient's case, antibody testing only showed evidence of prior Lyme infection, but she responded positively to the antibiotic doxycycline, a medication commonly used to treat Lyme disease.

Shaofeng Yan, M.D., Ph.D., a member of the patient's care team, requested that Huang's department develop a new molecular test to confirm the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi, leading to the larger study presented in Huang's abstract. 

The team, including Joel A. Lefferts, Ph.D., created three droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) tests-which are used to gather precise, highly sensitive measurements-to identify different types of Borrelia bacteria: one that detects all Borrelia species, one that targets those responsible for Lyme disease and one specific to Borrelia burgdorferi, the main cause of Lyme disease in the U.S. When tested on limited number of skin samples from patients with confirmed or suspected Lyme disease, the new assays showed excellent accuracy and could detect as few as five to ten bacterial cells.

Ultimately, the test for Borrelia burgdorferi developed by her team had an estimated sensitivity of 90.9% in formalin fixed, paraffin embedded samples, making it a potential new avenue for testing Lyme disease. Sensitivity is expected to increase when using fresh or frozen tissues, which typically yield DNA with higher quantity and quality.

Using the ddPCR assay, we successfully detected B. burgdorferi DNA in this patient's skin biopsy. This finding was further confirmed by DNA sequencing, supporting the diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease."

Guohong (Grace) Huang, Ph.D.

Huang noted that traditional serological tests cannot distinguish between active infection and past exposure.

"Antibody levels may remain elevated even after successful treatment. This is another clinical scenario where the ddPCR assay offers a clear advantage by detecting active bacterial presence rather than relying on indirect immune markers," Huang said.

 Although it took the patient more than four years to get a final diagnosis, the test developed by Huang and her team could save future patients from such extended waits. Early diagnosis is crucial in reducing the risk of long-term complications. With further development of the team's test, prompt treatment will be possible for more patients.

"To advance this work, the next step is to expand testing to a large number of cases and explore strategies to further enhance the assay sensitivity," Huang said.

This work was led by Guohong (Grace) Huang, Ph.D., in the Laboratory for Clinical Genomics and Advanced Technology (CGAT), Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, and will be presented during a poster session at 9:15am Eastern time on Nov. 14, at the Thomas M. Menino Convention and Exhibition Center in Boston. Huang's poster number is TT088. She will be available to discuss the work with reporters.

Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are emerging as a transformative tool in colorectal cancer (CRC) research, offering unparalleled insights into tumor biology, drug resistance, and personalized treatment approaches. These models, created by transplanting fresh human tumor tissue into immunodeficient mice, faithfully replicate the genetic, histological, and molecular features of the original tumors. As such, they serve as invaluable resources in the study of tumor heterogeneity and in the development of precision oncology.

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide and remains a leading cause of cancer mortality. Despite advances in therapeutic strategies, the genetic diversity and adaptive nature of CRC significantly hinder long-term treatment efficacy. Traditional preclinical models, like cell lines, often fail to capture the complexity of human tumors, resulting in limited predictive accuracy for clinical outcomes. In contrast, PDX models preserve the tumor microenvironment (TME), maintain clonal diversity, and reflect the biological and pathological traits of patient tumors. This level of fidelity is critical for drug discovery and biomarker identification, making PDX models essential for translational cancer research.One of the primary applications of PDX models is in drug efficacy testing. By correlating genetic profiles with drug responses, researchers can predict how a patient's cancer might respond to specific treatments. This capability enhances the precision medicine approach, allowing for more personalized and targeted therapies. PDX models also provide insights into drug resistance mechanisms, an area of growing importance as many patients develop resistance to initially effective therapies. Through long-term studies, these models have helped identify molecular pathways that enable cancer cells to evade treatment, guiding the development of next-generation therapies.However, the establishment and maintenance of PDX models present significant challenges. The process is time-consuming and labor-intensive, requiring the selection of high-quality tumor samples, careful engraftment into immunodeficient mice, and meticulous long-term monitoring. Moreover, genetic drift over multiple passages can alter the tumor's original characteristics, posing challenges for longitudinal studies. Despite these limitations, advances in humanized mouse models are helping to overcome these barriers, enhancing the model's relevance for immunotherapy research.The future of CRC research will likely see an increased reliance on PDX models, particularly in co-clinical trials that test potential treatments alongside human patients. By mimicking real-world patient responses, PDX models are driving the development of more effective cancer therapies and helping researchers understand the dynamic nature of tumor evolution. As these models continue to evolve, they hold the promise of transforming how colorectal cancer is understood and treated, offering new hope for improved patient outcomes.

Indero is proud to announce the successful completion of an internally funded study that introduces a novel approach to evaluating topical new chemical entities (NCE) in early-phase clinical research. This innovative method leverages quantitative gene expression analysis to assess drug efficacy rapidly and cost effectively.

Dr. Robert Bissonnette, Executive Chairman and Founder of Indero, who initiated and led the study, shared his excitement about the results:

"Our goal was to rethink how to study topical drugs in early phase studies. The results of this study demonstrate that microdosing for only 3 days can provide meaningful efficacy signals. Within just 24 hours, we observed alterations in gene expression after applying a microdose of mid-potency corticosteroid on the skin of patients. By 72 hours, Th2, Th22 and Th17-specific biomarkers were significantly reduced. This outcome is exactly what we hoped for and opens the door to faster, smarter drug development strategies, demonstrating the potential for this method to be used effectively in early phase 1 studies." The study highlights several advantages of this approach:

Emma Guttman, Professor and Chair of Dermatology at Mount Sinai, who performed gene expression analysis, emphasized its impact:

This strategy represents a paradigm shift in topical drug development. It allows physicians and researchers to accelerate innovation while minimizing patient exposure and resource use. The implications for both industry and patients are tremendous."

Emma Guttman-Yassky, MD, PhD, Waldman Professor and System Chair, Department of Dermatology and Director, Asness Family Center of Excellence in Eczema and Allergic Conditions, and Director, Laboratory of Inflammatory Skin Diseases, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai

This breakthrough puts Indero ahead in dermatology research, creating a faster, safer, and more affordable way to develop topical treatments.

The stereotypical image of psychotherapy shows a patient lying on a couch, exploring their deepest traumas. This leads to awareness of unconscious habits, thoughts, and drives and has long been a cornerstone of psychotherapy. However, the cognitive processes underlying the new awareness that emerges-what's actually happening in the patient's brain on that couch-remain a mystery. 

"Part of the problem with psychotherapy is that we haven't had good insights into the mechanistic problems," said Jaan Aru, an associate professor at the University of Tartu, in an interview with the Observer. "So, it's very hard to design a therapy." 

In a 2025 paper in Perspectives on Psychological Science, Aru and Nick Kabrel, Aru's graduate student at the University of Zurich, wrote that becoming aware of unrecognized psychological and behavioral challenges is the most crucial mechanism in conversation-based psychotherapy. Furthermore, they argue that becoming aware can be best framed as a process that expands one's cognitive map and changes the way one navigates through the mind. This framework also provides a testable theory about the neural correlates behind successful psychotherapy. 

Kabrel came to this theory through personal experience. He noticed how a therapist's questions could prompt him to search through his memories and beliefs, and the introspection was surprisingly powerful. He wondered what was happening in his brain in those moments and noticed something that sparked his interest. 

"When I search through memory or search in my mind, it always feels as if I am navigating in some kind of environment," he said. 

As he looked into this idea of mental navigation, he realized he was not alone. In a 2024 paper, he and Aru showed that patients and therapists used more spatial language-such as "this is unexplored territory" or "I'm going in circles"-during psychotherapy sessions than during everyday conversation. 

In the new paper, Aru and Kabrel proposed a framework based on how individuals construct their internal worlds in the form of cognitive maps: structured representations of phenomena like objects, concepts, people, and memories, and the relationships among them. Research revealing how the brain represents three-dimensional space helped inspire how this navigation may occur in the brain (O'Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971; Hafting, 2005). In the hippocampus, place cells fire when animals are in a specific location, while the entorhinal cortex's grid cells act like a coordinate map. More recent research revealed these cells also encode abstract concepts, such as time, sound, social hierarchies, and word meanings (MacDonald, 2011; Aronov, 2017; Park, 2021; Solomon, 2019; Viganò, 2021). 

"The brain is highly likely to make use of this mapping system in these other domains, too," Aru said.

This idea of mental navigation could be a very general framework to understand thinking and abstract cognition."

Jaan Aru, Associate Professor, University of Tartu

Framing introspection in this way may help people realize that changing the way they navigate through their thoughts could help them out of a pathological way of thinking. 

For example, someone suffering from depression might think they are flawed, and any interaction with someone else that ends negatively will be interpreted as their fault because of these perceived flaws. As they continue to view the world through this same negative lens, this thought pattern gets reinforced. It's analogous to hiking through a forest: The more a path is used, the wider it gets and the more likely it is to be used again. 

But a therapist helping them see a different interpretation-a different navigational route-may allow them to reframe their thoughts and not see everything as their fault. Kabrel recommends a psychotherapist say something like, "This is the place where we are stuck. We come back here every time, but we need to expand this." 

Aru thinks this idea is not just for people with mental illness, but for everyone. 

"Often the problem is that people have very narrow maps, very narrow ways of thinking. And it's a very general problem," he said. "Our goal as a society could be to expand the way people actually think." 

On a smaller scale, the goal of the paper is to encourage psychological scientists and neuroscientists to design experiments to test this new framework and the possible neural correlates involved. In the meantime, Aru knows that some scientists may be doubtful. 

"It's completely understandable if there are scientists who would say, 'Oh, you're stretching it too far. How do you know that it's really related to grid cells?'" he explained. "For me, this is the fun thing about science. You can try to make these links, and sometimes these links are actually there. Then suddenly we might be understanding something that we previously didn't, and we might be expanding our own mental maps with that."

A blocked coronary artery causing an acute heart attack must be opened immediately with a stent procedure. However, if other coronary arteries also appear to be narrowed, it is safe to wait and treat those later. This approach cuts the number of stent procedures in half, according to cardiologists from Radboud university medical center, writing in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Each year, 33,600 people are admitted to the hospital with a heart attack. In those cases, doctors must quickly open the blocked artery with angioplasty to prevent part of the heart muscle from dying. Yet during the procedure, it often becomes clear that other coronary arteries are also narrowed. Researchers from 41 hospitals, led by Radboudumc, investigated whether it is necessary to treat those narrowed vessels immediately, or if it can be done safely later, under calmer circumstances.

Their study, involving 1,146 participants, shows that waiting is safe. Only patients with an acute heart attack were included. This means that a coronary artery is completely blocked, for example by a blood clot. Half of the patients received full treatment immediately, while for the other half, additional stenting was done up to six weeks later. The researchers followed the patients for three years. Robin Nijveldt, Professor of Cardiovascular Imaging at Radboudumc, explains.

We saw no difference between the two groups in terms of death, new heart attacks, or hospital admissions due to heart failure."

One striking finding: in the later, calmer phase, cardiologists treated only half as many narrowed arteries as in the acute phase. 'That's because of how we determine whether stenting is necessary', says Professor of Cardiology Niels van Royen. 'In the acute phase, we use a catheter to measure pressure inside the blood vessel. Later, we can perform an MRI scan to map the heart's overall blood flow. If that shows the heart is getting enough oxygen, then stenting a single narrowed artery isn't required.'

Still, the cardiologists don't advise delaying additional treatment deliberately. 'For patients, it's usually more convenient to have everything done in one procedure', Van Royen explains. 'But sometimes that's not possible - for example, if the patient is in pain and exhausted, or if another person with an acute heart attack arrives and takes priority. Now we know it's safe to stop at that point. There's no need to force things, because faster is not better.'

It's also now clear that cardiologists can reassure patients a few weeks later with an MRI scan showing that no further stenting is needed. 'But patients do need to come back for the MRI', Van Royen notes. 'Some choose to skip the follow-up, even though additional treatment might still be wise.'

The cardiologists expect that current guidelines - which recommend immediate treatment of all narrowed arteries during the acute phase - will soon be revised. 'These guidelines were based on two major studies that showed a small short-term benefit to immediate treatment, but not in the long term', Nijveldt says. 'Our study provides more clarity: that benefit doesn't actually exist.'

A plant-based drink and an animal-based meal triggered similar satiety hormone responses and small appetite reductions after breakfast, yet neither changed how much participants ate at lunch, suggesting that increasing protein at breakfast may support satiety without automatically reducing total energy intake.



Study: The effect of consuming different dietary protein sources at breakfast upon self rated satiety, peptide YY, glucagon like peptide-1, and subsequent food intake in young and older adults. Image Credit: Muhammad Umair132 / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the European Journal of Nutrition, researchers at Newcastle University, UK, investigated the impact of consuming different protein sources at breakfast on adults' subsequent hunger and food consumption, as well as the regulation of associated hormones.

Their findings indicate that high-protein breakfasts, both plant-based and animal-based, elicited stronger satiety hormone responses and appetite suppression, which was significant for the plant-based drink and trending for the animal-based meal. However, neither influenced the total energy consumed during the afternoon meal.

Adequate protein intake is vital for health, but environmental and ethical concerns are driving interest in sustainable, plant-based alternatives.

The Food and Agriculture Organization promotes alternative proteins as part of its global sustainability goals, leading to growth in plant-based foods and drinks.

Protein source can influence digestive, metabolic, and appetite responses, as amino acids stimulate satiety hormones such as peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) while suppressing ghrelin.

Studies comparing protein types have yielded inconsistent results; some find that casein or pea proteins are more satiating than soy, while others report stronger effects for whey.

Plant- and animal-based meals may also differ in their ability to trigger gut hormone release, with outcomes varying by population and protein form. Liquids typically reduce appetite less than solid foods, though this difference in relation to protein source remains unclear.

In the UK, most adults meet their protein recommendations, but older adults may require more due to a reduced appetite and an increased risk of muscle loss. Since breakfast tends to be low in protein, it offers an opportunity to enhance intake.

This study aimed to compare the effects of plant-based and animal-based high-protein breakfasts with a low-protein control on appetite, satiety hormones, and energy intake in younger and older adults.

Researchers employed a randomized, within-subject, crossover design, in which 18 healthy adults, comprising 12 between 18 and 35 years old and 6 over 65, participated in three breakfast conditions: a plant-based, high-protein drink, an animal-based, high-protein breakfast, and a low-protein, high-carbohydrate breakfast.

Each meal was energy-matched, with the high-protein treatments containing 30 g of protein. However, the plant-based drink contained more fiber at 7.8 g than the animal-based meal at 4.5 g. Participants attended the laboratory in a fasted state after consuming a standardized evening meal and avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and exercise.



Schematic of study protocol 

Appetite was measured using visual analogue scales at baseline and at regular intervals for four hours after breakfast, while blood samples were collected at specific time points to measure plasma PYY and GLP-1 concentrations. After the final blood draw, participants consumed an ad libitum pasta lunch to assess energy intake.

Statistical analyses employed mixed models to evaluate the effects of treatment, time, and age group, while controlling for baseline values. Pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction were applied where significant effects were found. Associations between appetite, hormone levels, and energy intake were examined using repeated measures correlation analysis.

Both plant-based and animal-based high-protein breakfasts produced stronger satiety hormone responses than the low-protein, high-carbohydrate meal.

GLP-1 levels were significantly higher after both high-protein meals compared with the control, with no difference between the two protein types. Similar patterns were observed for PYY, which increased significantly after the high protein meals compared with the control, again showing no difference between protein sources.

Subjective appetite ratings were significantly lower following the plant-based protein drink and showed a trend toward reduction after the animal-based meal compared with the low-protein meal. However, these differences were modest and mostly below the 15 mm threshold considered necessary to influence eating behavior meaningfully. Energy intake at the ad libitum lunch did not differ between treatments, and no age-related effects were observed.

Correlation analyses showed that subjective appetite was positively associated with subsequent energy intake. Unexpectedly, GLP-1 and PYY levels showed weak, positive associations with energy intake; however, this represented only a statistical trend, with p values of 0.074 and 0.078, respectively, and was not significant at the 0.05 level.

Within participants, no associations were found between changes in hormone levels, appetite, or energy intake. Overall, both high-protein breakfasts promoted greater satiety hormone responses and appetite suppression than the low-protein meal, but did not affect later food intake.

This study found that plant- and animal-based high-protein breakfasts similarly enhanced satiety hormones GLP-1 and PYY, and reduced appetite, compared with a high-carbohydrate, low-protein meal, with no difference observed between protein sources or age groups.

Although the plant-based drink appeared to produce slightly quicker hormonal responses, a tentative observation the authors suggested might be due to faster gastric emptying of liquids, these effects did not translate into reduced energy intake at lunch.

The comparable responses indicate that plant-based proteins can effectively replace animal proteins in supporting satiety without affecting subsequent calorie intake. Strengths of this analysis include a controlled, crossover design and inclusion of older adults.

Limitations include the small size of the older adult subgroup and the absence of solid plant-based and liquid animal-based conditions, which limit the ability to isolate the effects of protein form and source. Moreover, the study was not statistically powered to detect age differences, which increases the risk of overlooking true age-related effects.

In conclusion, a plant-based, high-protein drink appears to be a practical and sustainable alternative for increasing protein intake without affecting later eating behavior. However, future studies are needed to assess the long-term acceptability of these dietary interventions and the real-world applications of these findings.

Alcohol-related diseases and injuries have the potential to cost the Australian healthcare system a staggering $68 billion over 60 years if nothing is done to stop the impact.

The new Griffith University developed The Alcohol Policy (TAP) model is an epidemiological model used to estimate the avoidable alcohol-related disease, injury and healthcare cost burden in the Australian population aged over 15 years.

Dr. Mary Wanjau from Griffith's School of Medicine and Dentistry said if we eliminated alcohol consumption over the first 25 years, we could prevent more than 25 million cases of diseases and injuries and more than 200 thousand deaths, of which the majority would be from cancers.

If we act now and eliminate alcohol consumption to zero, we could save the healthcare system $55 billion in the first 25 years. These findings can help policymakers understand the scale of the future alcohol burden which can be prevented."

Dr. Mary Wanjau from Griffith's School of Medicine and Dentistry

Excessive use of alcohol was one of the leading risks for mortality and disability globally with the evidence suggesting there is no safe level of alcohol-use for overall health.

The risk of cancers and mortality rises with increased levels of drinking.

Young adults aged 15-39 years bear most of the acute consequences due to high rates of injuries leading to death and disability.

Even minor decreases in alcohol consumption across the population could significantly reduce health burdens for individuals and the healthcare system while also lowering costs for individuals, communities, and governments.

Professor Lennert Veerman said the findings support prioritisation of investment in alcohol harm reduction.

"Policies and interventions which reduce consumption at the population level are likely to offer favourable impact as they create environments which support and allow for an increase in the number of people who abstain from drinking, a delay in the age when people start drinking, and reductions in alcohol consumption for those who drink," he said.

"The research findings underscore the consequences of inaction and reinforce the health and economic case for preventive measures, especially for Australia, where alcohol is the most widely used drug.

"Stronger alcohol control policies are needed to realise these gains in the reduction of alcohol harm and related healthcare costs."

The paper 'The avoidable health burden and healthcare costs related to alcohol consumption in Australia: multistate life table modelling' has been published in the International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction.

An international study co-led by University of Calgary researchers has found new insulin delivery technology helps control glucose levels during pregnancy for those with Type 1 diabetes, which is crucial to the health of women and their newborns.

The technology, known as automated insulin delivery (AID), mimics a healthy pancreas. The system automatically adjusts the amount of insulin given by a pump in real-time, based on current and predicted glucose levels.

"For pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes, keeping glucose within a healthy range is very important to the health of the woman and fetus," says an endocrinologist at Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary and Cumming School of Medicine researcher Dr. Lois Donovan, MD, the study co-principal investigator.

In a multicenter clinical trial, published in JAMA, researchers evaluated the impact of a hybrid closed-loop (HCL) insulin therapy treatment regime with standard insulin injections or an insulin pump that was not automated, along with continuous glucose monitoring.

Keeping blood glucose in the optimal range for pregnancy is exceptionally challenging when someone has Type 1 diabetes, despite their best efforts and the support of dedicated health care clinics."

Dr. Denice Feig, MD, study's other co-principal investigator

She is an endocrinologist and clinician scientist at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Sinai Health, and a professor of Medicine at the University of Toronto.

Risks associated with Type 1 diabetes in pregnancy can include increased chances of miscarriage, preeclampsia, which involves dangerous spike in blood pressure, and other significant health concerns. Newborns of pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes are more likely to be born excessively large or early and have low blood glucose at birth and are at higher risk of birth defects.

"The study found this AID system worked in pregnancy. It resulted in a three hours per day improvement in the time spent in the desired glucose range compared to the standard delivery with insulin injections or regular insulin pumps," says Donovan. "This is very important because we have learned from other larger studies that every 72 minute per day increase, with glucose in the desired range during pregnancy, is associated with reduction in newborn complications."

The AID system used in the study is knowns as a Tandem t:slim X2 insulin pump with Control-IQ technology.

"We've known for a while that AID systems have achieved better glucose control with less diabetes management burden in non-pregnant people with Type 1 diabetes, but its use had not been well studied in pregnancy," Donovan says. "Most AIDs were not designed to achieve the narrow glucose range desired in pregnancy or to adapt quickly enough to the changing insulin requirement of pregnancy."

The study found those using the AID spent more time in a healthy glucose level range and less time below and above the healthy range. The improvement in blood sugar control was immediate and persisted throughout the pregnancy. These results were found at all 14 sites involved in the trial.

"This finding will help inform people who are pregnant or planning pregnancy regarding the benefits of this AID system, which can help them achieve better glucose levels in pregnancy and hopefully better pregnancy outcomes" says Feig.

The University of Calgary was the lead site for the study with clinics involved in Calgary, Toronto, Vancouver, Quebec City, London (Ont.), Winnipeg, Halifax as well as Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney, Australia.

Funding for the study was provided by Diabetes Canada, MSI Foundation, the University of Calgary Clinical Research Fund, the Buckley Family Trust, the Mount Sinai Department of Medicine Research Fund. The Medical Research Future Fund of Australia funded the trial in that country. In kind, reduced cost and loan of study supplies was provided by Dexcom Canada, Tandem Diabetes Care and RxFood.

A new sociomedical perspective shows how off-label use of GLP-1 drugs for slimness is redefining what counts as a healthy, responsible body, revealing hidden moral pressures and global inequalities behind the weight loss boom.

In a recent perspective in the journal Obesity, researchers discussed recent medical developments that have not only revolutionized the treatment of diabetes and obesity, but whose popularity has also quickly spread among groups who lack clinical indication for obesity or diabetes treatment.

This off-label use, the authors argue, is exposing deeper tensions between medical innovation, weight stigma, and the social value attached to thinness, as medication becomes a means of attaining social and aesthetic goals rather than improving health.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have revolutionized the treatment of obesity and diabetes, offering significant weight loss with manageable side effects. However, their popularity has rapidly spread to individuals without obesity or metabolic disorders, who use them off-label to achieve or maintain slimness.

This phenomenon, marked by celebrity endorsements, media attention, online sales, and widespread social media discussion, reflects more than a medical trend. It reveals a growing cultural shift in which slimness is equated with moral virtue, self-discipline, and social value, as the authors describe it - a moral economy of the body.

The authors argue that this off-label use exposes deeper tensions between medical innovation, body image ideals, and the social meanings attached to thinness, and explicitly ask whether such use should be considered an abuse of medical technology or a rational adaptation to weight-stigmatizing environments.

Understanding these behaviors requires moving beyond clinical data to explore the psychological, cultural, and political contexts that shape how people use these drugs. Off-label use represents a form of pharmacological thinness, where medication becomes a means of attaining aesthetic and social goals rather than health improvement.

GLP-1 RA drugs were initially developed for individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes, but their reach has extended far beyond this population.

With the rise of online promotion and influencer marketing, these drugs are now positioned as tools of lifestyle optimization and bodily perfection. This expansion also highlights the limitations of the body mass index (BMI) in defining obesity, as many individuals with normal or mildly elevated BMIs may perceive themselves as needing intervention.

Weight loss, once a clinical outcome, has become a visible marker of personal virtue, performative achievement, and conformity to dominant beauty and health ideals, reflecting broader neoliberal healthism ideals that conflate appearance with moral responsibility. Within this moral economy, losing weight symbolizes effort and commitment, while failing to do so is seen as a moral shortcoming.

For users without obesity, these drugs may represent a means of achieving socially approved body shapes and social worth without the burden of traditional self-discipline. They help individuals navigate a culture that equates thinness with attractiveness, competence, and even employability.

Research gaps remain across multiple domains regarding the off-label use of GLP-1 RAs. One key gap concerns food and appetite, particularly how these drugs reshape users' emotional and sensory relationships with eating. While some individuals may feel liberated by reduced hunger, others may experience distress, alienation, or loss of enjoyment associated with food.

Another area of uncertainty involves side effects, as users' perceptions of symptoms such as nausea or fatigue may vary widely and may even be interpreted as markers of treatment efficacy. For some, these effects are interpreted as signs of drug efficacy or commitment to weight loss, whereas others experience them as discomforting or harmful.

Gaps also persist in understanding the impact of these drugs on body image and self-worth. While weight loss may enhance self-esteem for some, it may simultaneously heighten dissatisfaction or lead to further body modification pursuits, such as cosmetic procedures. Off-label use may alter eating behaviors, emotional regulation, and mental health, potentially leading to increased anxiety, guilt, or disordered eating.

Further research is required on access and dependency, particularly regarding how users obtain these drugs through medical or informal channels, and how cost, medical oversight, medical gatekeeping, and social privilege shape accessibility. Emotional dependence also warrants investigation, as some users may fear weight regain more intensely than adverse effects, raising concerns about long-term reliance.

Social media plays a pivotal role in normalizing GLP-1 RA use, spreading narratives that frame pharmacological weight loss as desirable and legitimate. However, the ways digital spaces shape motivations, self-image, and peer validation remain poorly understood. Users may view pharmacological weight loss as more legitimate or effective than other methods, reinforcing moral hierarchies around body management.

The authors propose a multinational research initiative, currently involving Brazil, the US, Denmark, and Japan, to examine how off-label GLP-1 RA use manifests across different societies, where cultural contexts shape distinct motivations. For example, this includes navigating racialized beauty standards in Brazil and technologies of neoliberal self-discipline in the US. This is not merely a deviation from medical norms but part of a broader cultural transformation in how the body, health, and morality are understood.

An intersectional framework is vital to understanding how factors such as gender, race, age, class, and geography shape who uses these drugs, how they are judged, and what outcomes they experience. Without such nuance, users risk being stereotyped as vain or irresponsible, while the deeper structural pressures that normalize pharmaceutical thinness remain invisible.

Ultimately, understanding off-label GLP-1 RA use requires integrating biomedical insights with sociological and cultural analysis. These drugs not only alter metabolism and appetite but also reshape identities, social hierarchies, and moral judgments.

A new study published in Nature and Science of Sleep reveals a strong connection between social media addiction and poor sleep quality among high school graduates in Bangladesh, offering fresh insights into the mental health and digital habits of young people. 

Researchers from the Marshall University Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine, CHINTA Research Bangladesh, University of South Asia, Jahangirnagar University and the Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, analyzed data from 1,139 students preparing for university admission. The study found that higher levels of social media addiction were closely associated with poorer sleep quality. Two key symptoms - "relapse" and "daytime performance disruption" - emerged as major links between excessive social media use and sleep problems. 

The study also uncovered significant gender differences. Female participants experienced poorer sleep quality when social media addiction was present, while male students exhibited a higher overall prevalence of addiction, suggesting a differential, sex-related susceptibility to the effects of social media use. 

Through network analysis, the researchers identified several "central" symptoms that bridged social media use and sleep health: "mood modification," "taking time to fall asleep" (sleep latency) and "efficiency disruption during the day." 

These findings underscore that sleep health and social media behaviors are deeply intertwined. Our results highlight the importance of targeted interventions to promote healthier digital and sleep habits among young people."

The study contributes to a growing body of evidence on the impact of social media on mental and physical well-being and emphasizes the need for awareness campaigns and preventive strategies that consider both behavioral and gender-based factors.

CHESTER, Penn.  – It's been almost seven months since Gio Reyna was last with the U.S. men's national team. What are the attacking midfielder's teammates saying about how he has looked? 

"I feel like he's more in-tune and more focused on the field than I've seen in the past, which is a great thing," defender Tim Ream told the throng of reporters at the USMNT's training session on a brisk fall Friday outside of Philadelphia.

Reyna has spent much of the past two European seasons either injured or on the bench. It's now two years removed from his standout performance in the 2024 Concacaf Nations League final, when his second-half goal sealed the Americans' third consecutive title in that event. 

The 22-year-old one-time prodigy is now working his way into the fold to be considered for manager Mauricio Pochettino's roster for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Reyna will get a chance to prove that in Saturday's friendly against Paraguay, followed by Tuesday's match against Uruguay in what should be a balmier setting in Tampa. 

"I'm looking forward to playing with Gio," U.S. striker Folarin Balogun said, who scored his first international goal on an assist by Reyna in the 2023 Nations League final win over Canada.

"I think me and him have a great connection, and he's a sort of player as a striker, you want someone like him providing creativity behind you. … As he has shown in training already, [Reyna can] make a good impact and help us in both games."

Reyna's inclusion on Pochettino's November roster last week raised eyebrows, given that the silky attacking midfielder has yet to start a game for Borussia Mönchengladbach since signing with the German Bundesliga club in August. 

All of Reyna's 142 minutes played have come in a series of short appearances as a substitute. Still, Ream has noticed a difference in Reyna this week.

"Whether it was injury or other things that were going on, I think his focus is so much greater now," Ream noted.  

Ream didn't elaborate on the "other things" he was alluding to. But it hasn't gone unnoticed that Pochettino named both Reyna and Sebastian Berhalter, son of former USMNT coach Gregg Berhalter, to this current squad. The elder Berhalter and Reyna's parents, former U.S. national teamers Claudio and Danielle, were embroiled in a well-documented public spat following the 2022 World Cup. 

Not surprisingly, Ream was asked if the presence of both players had been an "issue" behind the scenes. 

"I actually completely forgot about it until like, the third or fourth day of camp," Ream said. "And I was like, oh, wait a minute. But no, it's not really been discussed amongst the team. Their relationship has looked pretty normal to me and to everybody else. 

"What happened, happened," Ream added. "We've all kind of moved on from it, and they have as well. And I think that's a good thing. Everyone's trying to make this team. Everybody's trying to be a part of a home World Cup … it's good to see that their focus is here and now. And hopefully both of those guys can impress over the next couple months."

Right-back Sergiño Dest said Reyna has looked sharp on the practice fields through the first four sessions this week. 

"I'm happy that he's back," Dest said. "I feel like I always had a great chemistry with him, and he's doing well. So I hope he stays that way, stays physically healthy. … I hope he stays with the team."

FIFA Club World Cup

Thomas Tuchel said he would expect players not selected in his England starting lineup to be angry but stressed the importance of contributions from the bench at next summer's the World Cup.

Tuchel explained before Thursday's qualifying win over Serbia that he would not play squad members out of position for the sake of getting all of his strongest players onto the pitch at once.

Competition for places is particularly high among the forwards in the England squad, with Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden named as substitutes at Wembley, and with Cole Palmer and Anthony Gordon missing through injury.

“You can be angry at the coach, you can be angry at the situation, but if you see the nations that win, see the clubs that win the Champions League, then the bench is on their feet,” Tuchel told a press conference. “For the last eight-ten minutes there is no one sat there thinking, ‘I should be on the field, I should be on the field, why am I not there?' They are just there.

“I experienced this once in the amazing run with Chelsea and it was non-stop, everyone was pushing and fighting from the bench even if they were not picked and they were ready. I strongly, strongly believe we should arrive with a team like that. Even if they are disappointed, which is absolutely normal.”

Tuchel added the role of substitutes would be particularly important given next summer's World Cup takes place in the United States, Mexico and Canada, with extreme conditions expected.

The England head coach said players' roles in the squad would be made clear before the tournament.

“They will never be happy, they don't have to be happy, no one is used to sitting on the bench, this is the nature of a strong national team,” he added.

“You see already I normally pick only 21 of 23 (players in a squad) because I just hate this talk I had to give yesterday to Alex Scott, the message, ‘you are not in the squad'. I don't like it, I have stomach pain and even to see players on the bench, they will never like it but I strongly believe they will accept it.

“We need to have the roles clear. Once we go to a tournament — what is your role? I think in a ten day camp it is easy. Sometimes you are picked, sometimes you are not picked or you are the competition for someone. But once we go to a tournament, I think clarity in the role is very important.”

England return to action against Albania on Sunday.

⚽ Friday's World Cup qualifiers, 7.45pm GMT kick-offs
 ⚽ Live scores | Tables | Read Football Daily | Mail Luke

7 min: Kaminski darts down the Poland left and shoots low, but straight at Verbruggen.

“One element of qualification that doesn't seem to have got much attention yet is the (in my humble one) lunacy of the Nations League route to a playoff,” emails Tom.

“Sweden have had about as bad a qualifying campaign as you could imagine, yet throughout they've been all but guaranteed a playoff spot. I get that Uefa wants to make its new(ish) tournament attractive, but undermining their World Cup qualification groups seems an odd way of going about that.

“The thought also occurs that, if you were a weaker side playing smart, it might be a good idea to tank a Nations League campaign, get into a lower division then win that and sneak a route into a World Cup?”

All sounds extremely sensible Tom. Thanks for your message.

2 min: What a start for Poland! But what a miss too. Matty Cash is in space on the right, and crosses for Nicola Zalewski, who is six yards out with only the keeper to beat. The bouncing ball gets a bit big on him, and he shins a clumsy effort over the bar and wide. What a chance for Poland. And what a miss by Zalewski. Cash looks a bit miffed.

Allez!

We've had the anthems in Warsaw. Now it's time for some football. I'll be keeping an eye on goals elsewhere too.

I make no apology for also posting Zielinski's recent work of art:

Here's that Micky van de Ven belter from the other week:

I can't see the name Micky van de Ven without thinking of Peep Show and “Men with Ven”. How about you?

Poland's recent record in major tournaments is woeful. The players' relationship with the fans can be a complicated one. And much like England, they have an ageing and overrated striker leading the line.

Malta's earlier win in Finland meant that Poland's playoff place is secure.

Surely, though, Poland are too far behind on goal difference to win the group, even if they win tonight?

Stranger things have happened I suppose. Let's pretend this is a winner-takes-all clash just for a bit of fun.

Seriously, though, do send me an email. I can't do this without you.

Looking forward to seeing Zielinski for Poland. As readers of today's earlier blog will know, he scored a belting side-footed volley for Inter the other week.

I also saw him score a cracker for Napoli with my own eyes a few years back.

Which countries have qualified, and how did they do it?

This article by Andy Martin does exactly what it says on the tin:

Croatia: Livakovic, Stanisic, Vuskovic, Gvardiol, Marco Pasalic, Modric, Mario Pasalic, Perisic, Petar Sucic, Kramaric, Musa. Substitutes: Pongracic, Caleta-Car, Sutalo, Moro, Orsic, Vlasic, Jakic, Fruk, Ivanovic, Matanovic, Ivusic, Pandur.

Faroe Islands: Lamhauge, Faero, Gunnar Vatnhamar, Andrias Edmundsson, Rene Shaki Joensen, Turi, Andreasen, Davidsen, Frederiksberg, Hanus Sorensen, Meinhard Olsen. Substitutes: Dam, Svensson, Bjartalid, Oregaard, Klettskard, Mork, Martin Agnarsson, Justinussen, Joan Edmundsson, Knudsen, Benjaminsen, Reynatrod.

Referee: Aliyar Aghayev (Azerbaijan)

Slovakia: Dubravka, Gyomber, Skriniar, Obert, Hancko, Bero, Lobotka, Rigo, Duris, Strelec, Haraslin. Substitutes: Rodak, Takac, Pekarik, Vavro, Mesik, Leo Sauer, Bobcek, Bozenik, Benes, Tupta, Hrosovsky, Schranz.

Northern Ireland: Peacock-Farrell, McConville, Ballard, McNair, Hume, Bradley, Saville, Devenny, Lyons, Price, Charles. Substitutes: Hazard, Southwood, Lewis, Devlin, Marshall, Donley, Smyth, Reid, Kelly, McDonnell, Magennis, Brown.

Referee: Istvan Kovacs (Romania)

Thomas Tuchel wants his England substitutes to channel any anger they feel at not starting into making the difference when they can because the team that win the World Cup will be defined by productivity off the bench.

The head coach will prepare a heat-proof gameplan for the finals next summer when temperatures at many of the venues in the United States, Mexico and Canada are expected to be stifling and a major part will involve how best to use his substitutes.

Poland (4-4-1-1): Grabara; Kedziora, Ziolkowski, Kiwior, Cash; Szymanski, Zielinski, Skoras, Zalewski; Kaminski; Lewandowski. Substitutes: Kochalski, Szczesniak, Rozga, Swiderski, Kapustka, Grosicki, Wszolek, Buksa, Kozlowski, Bereszynski, Dragowski.

Netherlands (4-3-3): Verbruggen; Geertruida, Timber, Van Dijk, Van de Ven; Gravenberch, De Jong, Malen; Kluivert, Gakpo, Depay. Substitutes: Flekken, Valente, Quinten Timber, Lang, Reijnders, Schouten, Roefs, Van Hecke, Emegha, Simons, Ake, De Ligt.

Referee: Maurizio Mariani (Italy)

Teemu Pukki came off the bench for Finland on 78mins – plenty of the Malta players would have seen him play many times on the telly. But Malta held on for their win.

“The Maltese are celebrating, as they should, while the Finns look shell-shocked,” writes Kári Tulinius, watching events unfold in Helsinki.

“I'd say the post-match commentary on Finnish TV was funereal, but it was more like a group of people discussing whether they should stage an intervention. At one point, there was discussion whether this was rock bottom or not.”

Things can always get worse, that's my motto. Thanks for the update as always, Kári.

Malta are ranked 166th in the world, Finland are 72nd. That's a bona fide giant-killing.

Finland have just lost 1-0 at home to Malta, which is a turn-up for the books in Group G. Jake Grech's goal on 81min won it for the visitors. That's Malta's first win in seven games in this campaign, to go with two draws. Dancing in the streets of Valletta tonight?

Luxembourg: Moris, Jans, Korac, Carlson, Bohnert, Olivier Thill, Martins Pereira, Olesen, Barreiro, Sinani, Dardari. Substitutes: Djabi Embalo, Curci, Avdusinovic, Muratovic, Pereira Cardoso, Veiga, Selimovic, Dzogovic, Sebastien Thill, Martins, Fox, Moreira.

Germany: Baumann, Baku, Anton, Tah, Raum, Pavlovic, Goretzka, Sane, Wirtz, Gnabry, Woltemade. Substitutes: Thiaw, Kimmich, Leweling, Ouedraogo, Burkardt, Nubel, Nmecha, El Mala, Schlotterbeck, Schade, Brown, Dahmen.

Referee: John Brooks (England)

Gibraltar: Hankins, Jolley, Ronan, Lopes, Jessop, Torrilla, Annesley, Mauro, Pozo, Borge, James Scanlon. Substitutes: Banda, Del Rio, Morgan, Richards, Lopez, Bent, Perera, Olivero, McCafferty, Vinet, Mouelhi, Bartolo.

Montenegro: Nikic, Marusic, Tuci, Sipcic, Radunovic, Jankovic, Adzic, Bulatovic, Milan Vukotic, Osmajic, Krstovic. Substitutes: Popovic, Petkovic, Milic, Simun, Rubezic, Vesovic, Brnovic, Perovic, Djukanovic, Kostic, Loncar, Camaj.

Referee: Anastasios Papapetrou (Greece)

Can the Netherlands do it on a cold night in Warsaw? We'll be focusing mostly on the match at the top of Group G. If Poland can win, they'd draw level on points with their opponents at the top of the group, although the Dutch goal difference is vastly superior: before kick-off it's +19 to Poland's +6. On Monday Poland are away in Malta while the Netherlands host Lithuania. Barring a shock the Netherlands will win the group regardless.

Netherlands v Poland, Luxembourg v Germany, Slovakia v Northern Ireland and Croatia v Faroe Islands are just some of the top football matches occurring this evening on the road to the 2026 Fifa World Cup. Gibraltar v Montenegro is also a football match, whether it counts as top, I will leave others to decide.

Germany need to tread carefully in Group A after losing their opener to Slovakia, while the Dutch and the Poles are duking it out for top spot in Group G. Northern Ireland are also in with a shot in Group A, but an away assignment in Slovakia won't be easy.

For all your permutations, consult Ed Aarons' definitive group-by-group breakdown below. I'll also bring you some permutations musings shortly, plus team news and other stuff. You can always send me an email with your thoughts, too. Let's get it on.

Poland must topple the Netherlands at home on Friday to stand any shot of tying down an automatic qualifying spot ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

The gloves are off in Warsaw on Friday as Poland fight for their World Cup future at home to the Netherlands, with the leading pair in UEFA qualifying Group G set to square off. The Eagles currently trail the Dutch by three points in second place and need a home win this weekend to stand a realistic shot of securing first place and automatic qualification for the tournament.

De Oranje, on the other hand, know that even a draw would be enough to effectively guarantee them top spot, with the gulf in goal difference currently looking too vast for Poland to overcome in the next two games. However, Poland is also fighting for a spot in the play-offs, with third-place Finland breathing down its neck and just three points behind.

Netherlands boss Ronald Koeman has almost a fully fit squad at his disposal aside from the absence of Liverpool right-back Jeremie Frimpong. Poland, meanwhile, is missing a few potential starters in Jan Bednarek, Krzysztof Piatek, and Lukasz Skorupski.

ARLINGTON, TEXAS - MARCH 24: Christian Pulisic #10, Weston McKennie #8 and Gio Reyna #7 of the United States celebrate after the Concacaf Nations League final match between Mexico and USMNT at AT&amp;T Stadium on March 24, 2024 in Arlington, Texas.

U.S. national team star Christian Pulisic may not be in this November camp as Gio Reyna makes his return to the group, but the AC Milan star certainly has Reyna's back.

Pulisic said Reyna has been treated unfairly and sympathizes with the 23-year-old's battle with injuries over the last four years.

“He's had a really tough time, unfairly in a lot of ways,” Pulisic told CBS Sports Golazo. “I feel for him. It's difficult what we go through. Some of the injuries he's gone through, it's really hard.”

Reyna exploded as one of Europe's biggest teenage talents with Borussia Dortmund and the USMNT in the lead up to the 2022 World Cup, but controversy and injury has dimmed his light since.

Reyna was the middle of a dispute between former U.S. head coach Gregg Berhalter and his parents, Claudio and Danielle Reyna. The Reynas, frustrated by Gio's lack of playing time at the World Cup, revealed to U.S. Soccer a decades-old domestic violence incident involving Berhalter and his wife. The revelation led to an investigation, a public saga, and the breakdown of the relationship between the two families.

There was a time during the 2022 World Cup that Reyna was nearly sent home from camp due to his attitude.

On the field, things haven't been much smoother for Reyna. He has failed to feature more than 610 minutes in a single league season since 2020-21. After falling out of favor in Dortmund, Reyna went on loan to Nottingham Forest where his playing outlook didn't much improve. He was even left off the matchday roster entirely a handful of times.

This summer, Reyna made the move from Dortmund to Borussia Mönchengladbach. He has started just one game, but has appeared in six. He dealt with ramping up his fitness before his debut then was sidelined briefly with a thigh injury.

Pulisic still backs his teammate to show his top quality moving forward.

“When I have him on the field with me on the national team, I feel a lot more relaxed,” Pulisic said. “He's a really, really good player — that's not a crazy take, a lot of people see that. I just tell him to stay patient. He's a guy that's gone through a bit of a tough time, he'll admit that, but that doesn't mean he can't have really good things ahead.”

The November national team camp is the first time Reyna is involved with the national team since the 2024 Copa America, when he was selected by Berhalter.

“I do think it's been unfair, but I think he's going to come around and people are going to see that soon,” Pulisic said.

As for Pulisic, he is missing camp as he just recovered from a hamstring injury suffered on international duty in October. He missed four games for AC Milan and returned off the bench last weekend.

“I just want to make sure I have the time now to fully care for myself, to make sure my hamstring is doing well and allow other guys to take my place,” Pulisic said. “It's just the best decision for everyone right now.”

Pulisic was absent from the USMNT over the summer when he asked head coach Mauricio Pochettino not to be selected for the Gold Cup. He got some time off before returning to Milan for preseason.

The USMNT face Paraguay and Uruguay this window and won't be together again until the March international break.

Germany can effectively seal its spot at the 2026 World Cup by beating Luxembourg on the road this Friday.

The 2026 World Cup qualification trail is nearing its climax, and Germany has the opportunity to all but guarantee its place at the tournament when it visits Luxembourg on Friday. Die Mannschaft leads Slovakia on goal difference at the top of UEFA Group A and can potentially open up a gap with only a couple of games to play.

The two teams hold identical records of three wins and one defeat thus far in qualifying, with Slovakia having stunned the Germans with a 2-0 win in Bratislava back in September. Julian Nagelsmann's side have recovered to take to the top of the pool, but their future at next year's global tournament isn't quite sealed just yet.

Luxembourg, on the other hand, is already well aware it will not be featuring at the World Cup after failing to pick up a single point in four qualifiers to date. That means the best the Red Lions can do is hope to act as a speed bump this weekend and potentially aid Slovakia's cause in the process.

The Germans have won in each of their last seven encounters with Luxembourg and triumphed 4-0 when these teams faced off in Sinsheim last month. However, it's perhaps a concern for Nagelsmann that his side has looked far less capable on the road, producing just one goal in two away qualifiers thus far.

CHESTER, Pa. — Auston Trusty's first experiences with Mark McKenzie and Brenden Aaronson were as teens in a cramped youth soccer dressing room. Now 27, the defender is together with his long-time friends on the U.S. national team, all trying to earn spots on next year's World Cup roster.

“When we think about it, we kind of laugh and say, like, that's crazy,” Trusty related ahead of Saturday's friendly against Paraguay. “It's pretty cool to know that we've all kind of been in the same journey together.”

Trusty has moved from Philadelphia and Colorado in MLS to Arsenal, Birmingham, Sheffield United and now Glasgow Celtic.

“To think back when we were in Wayne, Pennsylvania, in a small locker room, 70 of us squeezing in there and showering,” McKenzie said. “We've come a long way.”

Trusty and McKenzie were a center back pairing for the Philadelphia Union's Bethlehem Steel farm team, in the third tier in 2016 and the second the following year, when Aaronson and current No. 1 American goalkeeper Matt Freese joined them.

All four are products of the Union's youth academy, which this summer moved into the lavish WSFS Bank Sportsplex, a $100 million, 170,000-square-foot complex along the Delaware River and adjacent to the senior team's Subaru Park.

Trusty's interest in soccer was sparked by watching his older sister Onnie, a defender who earned a letter for Florida State in 2006.

While Aaronson and McKenzie debuted for the U.S. against Costa Rica in 2020, and Trusty played his first international in the CONCACAF Nations League at Grenada on March 24, 2023, Freese debuted against Turkey this past June and supplanted Matt Turner as the starter.

Since Trusty's debut, his three national team appearances were all as a substitute, against Canada in June 2023, Mexico in October 2024 and Jamaica during coach Mauricio Pochettino's first camp last November.

With Chris Richards and injured Celtic teammate Cameron Carter-Vickers absent, Trusty is one of only three central defenders in camp, joined by McKenzie and Tim Ream. Pochettino has been experimenting this fall with a three center-back formation, increasing the chance Trusty will see significant minutes during the games against No. 39 Paraguay and 15th-ranked Uruguay on Tuesday in Tampa, Florida.

“He was always confident, but I think he's more confident,” said Ream, captain of the No. 16 U.S. team. “He has a better — much better — kind of understanding of the different kind of positions, the different tactical shapes and, really, he's just gained a lot more experience and as a center back that's the biggest thing.”

During his year away from the national team, Trusty had been watching its games online despite the late-night and early morning starts. He's in Britain for his fourth club season.

“It's dark and raining every day everywhere, so you kind of just get used to it,” he said.

He was a second-half substitute in Celtic's first three games, then felt pain in his right foot during a Champions League qualifier against Kazakhstan's Kairat Almaty on Aug. 20. Trusty was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis and didn't play again until Oct. 29.

“Just bad timing, really,” he said. “It's a tricky injury. It just has to heal. So at the bottom of your foot it doesn't have that much circulation and blood flow."

Trusty returned six days after Carter-Vickers injured an Achilles against Sturm Graz in the Europa League and two days after Martin O'Neill replaced Brendan Rodgers as manager. Trusty has started Celtic's last four matches.

“I know they're watching every single game,” he said of the Pochettino's staff.

Trusty assisted on Callum McGregor's go-ahead goal in extra time of a Scottish League Cup semifinal against Rangers and was selected man of the match in a Scottish Premier League game against Kilmarnock on Sunday.

“He started to play and he played really well,” Pochettino said. “We are a little bit short in that area.”

Trusty is left-footed and was paired with the right-footed Carter-Vickers at Celtic.

“Luckily for the team I can play on right side comfortably,” Trusty said. “It's not too often a lot of left footers, especially left center backs, can play on the right side comfortably. So, yeah, I've been able to step in and get some positive results.”

Trusty has a chance to play in his hometown for the first time since leaving the Union ahead of the 2020 season. The U.S. is training at the facility of the YSC Academy, the Union's education partner — Trusty has become a director. He's gotten 40 tickets for the game for family and friends.

He hopes this becomes a step to being in the U.S. squad next summer for a World Cup the Americans will co-host.

“Everything I do, everything I put myself into, it's all very, very calculated to put myself in the best chances for the national team — the national team and playing in the World Cup,” he said. “It truly is everything to me.”

Former Chelsea star Oscar is reportedly considering retirement after being hospitalised with a heart issue. The 34-year-old is said to have fallen ill during a bicycle test at current side São Paulo and since then, he has been diagnosed with vasovagal syncope, where the blood pressure drops too low, causing people to faint. Now, reports suggest the Brazilian is weighing up whether or not to end his career.

After spending eight years playing in China, Oscar rejoined São Paulo on a deal until 2027 at the end of last year. Following that move, he said: "I'm happy to be back in Brazil and to be able to play for São Paulo, which is the club where I started out, where I made my base and where I grew up. I thank you for the affection I have received on social media these past few days and I will do my best to achieve great things together."

Fast forward to the present, and the veteran may have kicked his last ball for the club after this health scare on Tuesday. 

The Brazilian team said on Thursday: "Midfielder Oscar remains hospitalized at Einstein Hospital Israelita, where he was admitted on Tuesday afternoon after presenting an intercurrence with cardiological changes during exams carried out at SuperCT. An extensive investigation carried out at the hospital confirmed the diagnosis of vasovagal syncope. Oscar remains clinically well and stable, hospitalized in a cardiology unit, and this Friday will undergo an electrophysiological study."

Following the incident, Oscar - who started his career at São Paulo way back in 2008 - posted in an Instagram story: "Everything will be alright, God willing." 

While he is seemingly staying upbeat, Brazilian publication Globo states that Oscar - who moved to Shanghai in 2017 in a £60 million ($79m) move that reportedly pocketed him around £400,000 a week - is mulling over whether or not to retire from football. They add that it may be more likely he hangs up his boots, rather than continuing.

The report states: "According to a specialist heard by Globo, the problem is not life-threatening and can be solved with medication or simple surgical intervention, where a ganglion is cauterized to avoid getting out of control. Also, according to the expert, Oscar may be able to return to football if everything goes well and he feels comfortable to do so. For now, Oscar still has no discharge forecast. At the age of 34, he evaluates with his family whether he will announce his retirement or continue in football. The biggest tendency is for him to leave professional football."

According to the NHS, vasovagal syncope is common, can affect anyone, and is often a temporary problem affecting the body's control system (autonomic nervous system). It is a common cause of fainting that occurs due to a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, leading to reduced blood flow to the brain. Certain triggers affect the nerve messages, and as a result of this issue, you can feel weak, sick, sweaty, and light-headed - and that can lead to losing consciousness. If you have this problem, people are encouraged to drink plenty of fluids, not to stand still for long periods, and to avoid overly warm environments. If you get warning symptoms, sufferers should lie down and squeezing firmly on a ball may be helpful. 

Football fans will be eagerly awaiting to hear from Oscar, who played 203 times for Chelsea and scored 38 goals between 2012-17 before joining Shanghai Port, again and whether or not he will continue his playing career. After making more than 500 appearances in club football, playing 48 times for Brazil, and winning trophies in England, China, and his home country, he may decide that for the good of his health, it is time to move on to something different. However, the Brazilian may still have another chapter to write in his footballing journey.

Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has issued a stark warning that the global appeal of football is being jeopardised by an increasing imbalance favouring international fixtures.

His comments come amid growing concerns over the impact of expanded international competitions on domestic leagues.

The strain on the domestic calendar was recently highlighted by the rearrangement of Arsenal and Crystal Palace's Carabao Cup tie and preceding league fixtures, partly due to Palace's involvement in the UEFA Conference League.

Further anxieties surround the expanded summertime Club World Cup, with leagues fearing economic and player welfare repercussions, particularly given discussions of increasing its size from 32 to 48 teams and holding it biennially.

Speaking at the World Leagues Association annual meeting in Athens, Masters underscored the urgency of the situation.

He stated: "(This meeting) is the best attended we've ever had and it's no surprise it comes at a time when the balance between national and international football is under threat from the unprecedented expansion of international competitions."

Masters continued, stressing the need for caution: "We cannot take football's global popularity, its fans and its players for granted by fracturing this balance through an overloaded international calendar. All our members are united in their belief that to restore this balance domestic leagues must be protected."

He added that "dialogue with FIFA is now crucial and it is in the best interests of football to involve the leagues in any future decisions about the international calendar."

This sentiment is echoed by European Leagues and FIFPRO, the world players' union, who have lodged a legal complaint with the European Commission against FIFA.

They allege FIFA is abusing its dominant position under EU competition law, acting as both regulator and competition organiser, thereby causing economic and sporting harm to domestic leagues and compromising player welfare.

FIFA, however, maintains it is within its rights to organise competitions like the Club World Cup within the existing international calendar.

The organisation also points to a Memorandum of Understanding with European Football Clubs, which includes 17 Premier League teams, extending to 2030, reaffirming these clubs' commitment to the international schedule.

With just a few weeks to go before he's out of office, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has a big ask of his colleagues on the City Commission: approve up to $7.5 million in city services to support FIFA-sanctioned events when the World Cup games come to town next year.

That's in addition to a $5 million cash contribution that the city previously agreed to pay to FIFA World Cup, according to a July budget memo.

If approved, the city could join Miami-Dade County in donating millions of dollars in government services when the World Cup brings seven soccer matches to Hard Rock Stadium in 2026. The city's proposal to donate services from police, fire-rescue, sanitation and more follows a request from the local World Cup host committee, which is independent of FIFA, according to the legislation.

Suarez, who is sponsoring the proposal, said in a statement to the Miami Herald that next year's events present a “once in a lifetime opportunity.”

While the World Cup games are taking place in Miami Gardens — a separate municipality — Suarez said he's expecting a flurry of related events to happen in the city of Miami. That includes FIFA Fan Festival, taking place in downtown's Bayfront Park, which Suarez said will draw “over 1 million attendees.”

“Miami will receive unprecedented global exposure, and our small businesses, restaurants, and hotels stand to benefit enormously from the influx of tourism and international media attention,” Suarez said.

Asked how the city arrived at the $7.5 million figure, the mayor said it is “based on the public safety, traffic management, sanitation, and logistical support required to safely host an event of that scale.” He did not provide further details on how the number was calculated.

“Beyond FanFest, we anticipate several FIFA sanctioned activations within city limits, all of which will generate significant economic and cultural value,” Suarez said. “Put simply: this investment ensures Miami shows the world who we are, while maximizing the economic return for our residents and businesses.”

The proposed legislation is slated to go before the Miami City Commission for a vote Thursday.

Host committee chair Rodney Barreto has been spearheading the push for government funding for the games at Hard Rock, the Herald previously reported. Neither Barreto nor Alina Hudak, who is president and CEO of the host committee, responded to requests for comment seeking more details on the amount of financial assistance the host committee requested from the city and how it anticipates using city services.

Other board members of the nonprofit host committee include Jorge Mas, the managing owner of Inter Miami and one of the developers behind the under-construction Miami Freedom Park soccer stadium, which is the mayor's marquee project, and billionaire Ken Griffin, an acquaintance of Suarez.

Griffin was on the roster at a major business conference Suarez organized last week. Speaking onstage, Griffin said: “If [Suarez] asks me to jump, the only answer is how high.” FIFA President Gianni Infantino was also a featured speaker at the event.

Like the city, the county is spending millions in tax dollars on next year's World Cup events. Miami-Dade County has agreed to spend up to $46 million in cash subsidies, donated police services and other expenses when the World Cup comes to town next year.

Carlo Ancelotti believes that England will be "dangerous" at next year's World Cup, while singing the praises of former charge Jude Bellingham. The Italian got to work with the ex-Borussia Dortmund star for two seasons at Real Madrid and has seen his quality at first hand. Not only did he talk up the 22-year-old's strengths, he also lauded his humanity.

The former Chelsea and AC Milan boss was in charge at Madrid when Bellingham was signed from Dortmund for £88 million ($115m) in 2023, and in their first season together, they won a Champions League and La Liga double. Things didn't work out quite as well last season, however, as bitter rivals Barcelona pipped Los Blancos to the league and Copa del Rey. Following news of Ancelotti's Santiago Bernabeu exit earlier this year, the England international waxed lyrical about the Italian. 

He wrote on Instagram: "Mister, thank you for everything. It was a pleasure and a great experience to learn from the most successful manager of our club and one of the greatest of all time. What you have taught me about life and football will stick with me always, and I will be forever grateful. Good luck on your next journey, I wish you, your staff, and your family nothing but happiness!"

And earlier this week, Ancelotti was equally as complimentary about the ex-Birmingham City starlet.

The former Everton manager said on the Rest is Football podcast that Bellingham was a top player and even likened him to Brazilian great Kaka. He also dismissed any notion that the attacking midfielder has attitude problems, a topic that has come to the fore after he was not selected for Thomas Tuchel's October England squads. 

Ancelotti said this week, "I think Jude is a fantastic player. If I have to compare, we were talking about Kaka. He is this kind of player, a really intelligent player, who is physically really strong, fantastic to arrive in the box at the right time. He's doing really well, and maybe he had a problem with his shoulder. He was out for two or three months, now he's back. No question mark. But why do you have to put a question mark on Bellingham?"

He added, "No, I never had a problem with Jude about his attitude. He is really professional, really serious, works hard in training, like all English players do. And no, no complaints."

And on Friday, when asked if Bellingham was one of the best midfielders in the world, Ancelotti replied, "What do you expect me to say? Yes or no? Of course. One of the best. I had a good relationship with him. He helped me to win one Champions League in 2024. So for me, I am a little bit involved in the judgement of Jude Bellingham, but he is a good guy and a great player."

Following England's 2-0 World Cup qualifying win over Serbia, in a game where Bellingham was a second-half substitute, Ancelotti stated that the Three Lions could go deep at next year's tournament in North America.

"England will be dangerous for sure,” he said. “They have fantastic quality, a fantastic manager. I saw them play last night against Serbia. They are a team with a lot of quality and of course. Maybe they will say they will not compete but I am sure they will compete and try to win the World Cup."

While Bellingham is back fit and is making an impression at Madrid once more, scoring three goals and adding an assist in 11 games for the Spanish giants, he is being kept out of the England team by Aston Villa star Morgan Rogers. While competition for places will be fierce, Tuchel says Bellingham and Rogers are on good terms.

"It is normal, but he's one of the best mates of Jude, so I don't think he feels that kind of pressure. They compete at the moment for the same position, and they're still friends," he said. "They are very respectful with each other and like each other. Morgan deserved to stay on the pitch because he had three fantastic performances with him and second of all we didn't know what was coming if our plan was right with the high press. It would be unfair for Jude to try to figure everything out because we changed our way of pressing in the last two camps. Declan [Rice], Morgan, and Harry [Kane] did it already in three to four matches together. I figured they could adapt a bit quicker. Once we see the formation, we can give clear instructions to Phil [Foden] and Jude and bring them from the bench."

Dynamic pricing sparks outrage as parking rivals premium event costs across venues

Dubai: World Cup ticket holders should brace for an unexpected expense at next year's tournament: parking. 

Prices on FIFA's official website have soared as high as $175 per car, stunning fans across the United States، a country where driving to major events is the norm and public transit options are limited.

The figures, first reported by The Athletic, have sparked widespread disbelief among American sports fans. The U.S. is one of three World Cup hosts, alongside Canada and Mexico.

According to FIFA's online listings, a general parking pass for the July 14 semifinal in Dallas costs $175, while parking for group-stage matches is priced at $75. Parking at the July 11 quarterfinal in Kansas City will cost $125, and again $75for group-stage fixtures.

The irony is striking: in the first phase of ticket sales, which used flexible, dynamic pricing, group-stage seats started at just $60, meaning fans could end up paying more to park their car than to enter the stadium.

As of this week, only a handful of the tournament's 16 host venues across the US, Canada, and Mexico have released parking passes online. Major host cities, including Mexico City, which will open the tournament, and New York-New Jersey, which will host the final, have not yet made any parking available.

Many US host cities lack the public-transport infrastructure common in Europe and other footballing regions. All 11 American stadiums set to host matches are NFL venues surrounded by vast parking lots, yet during the World Cup, much of that space will fall inside security perimeters or be repurposed for hospitality zones, making parking more scarce and more valuable.

FIFA appears poised to capitalize on that scarcity. Its official parking website, powered by the technology firm JustPark, indicates that paid parking will eventually be sold for most or all tournament venues.

Early pricing suggests a tiered structure: $75 for group-stage and round-of-32 matches, $100–$145 for the knockout rounds, and $175 for semifinals and the third-place game. In Philadelphia, group-stage parking already appears at $115.

The sticker shock comes during record demand for tickets. FIFA received more than 1.5 million ticket applicationswithin 24 hours of launching its presale draw in September.

With 48 teams, 104 matches, and millions of fans expected to travel between cities, transportation was always likely to be one of the tournament's biggest hurdles. Now, with parking prices rivaling premium event experiences, fans are left wondering: At the 2026 World Cup, how expensive will it be just to show up?

The U.S. men's national team take on Paraguay in the first of two November friendlies as 2026 FIFA World Cup preparation ramps up.

After a positive October camp with results against Ecuador and Australia, manager Mauricio Pochettino is without numerous stars. Players like Christian Pulisic, Malik Tillman, Antonee Robinson, Weston McKennie and Chris Richards were not selected for the two November friendlies. To make matters worse, veteran midfielder Tyler Adams had to pull out with an injury. 

For every player absent, however, there's fringe players looking to further make their cases for a roster spot next year. Particularly in midfield given Pochettino has yet to settle on a favored pivot. And, there's Gio Reyna to consider with him back with the USMNT for the first time since March.

Here's how the USMNT's XI could look like against Paraguay.

GK: Matt Freese—The New York City FC goalkeeper looks set to be the starting goalkeeper for 2026 barring an unforeseen drop in form. 

CB: Miles Robinson—Fresh off eliminating MLS rival Columbus Crew from the playoffs, the FC Cincinnati defender gets the nod.

CB: Mark McKenzie—McKenzie made one substitute appearance back in October, but should start with Chris Richards absent.

CB: Tim Ream—Ream should see the bulk of minutes in the left center back role during this camp. The 38-year-old has been a consistent name in Pochettino XIs. 

RWB: Alex Freeman—The MLS Young Player of the Year has been a standout performer, flying up and down the right flank.

CM: Tanner Tessmann—Pochettino has favored Tessmann in a box-to-box midfield role since taking over. The 24-year-old is in line for another opportunity given Tyler Adams had to withdraw from camp.

CM: Cristian Roldan—Roldan is fully focused on earning a 2026 World Cup roster spot after the Seattle Sounders were eliminated from the MLS Cup playoffs. 

LWB: Max Arfsten—Pochettino took credit earlier in the week for developing Arfsten in the wake of Antonee Robinson's absence. The Columbus Crew product is more effective as a wingback looking to get forward.

RW: Gio Reyna—This is a big camp for Reyna. With Tim Weah and Malik Tillman both absent, the Borussia Mönchengladbach player gets a big opportunity to endear himself to Pochettino.

ST: Folarin Balogun—Balogun recently scored his first career Champions League goal and was one of the best USMNT players last camp.

LW: Diego Luna—Another MLS product, Luna has been a fan-favorite in multiple camps this year. He should see notable playing time against Paraguay and Uruguay on the left.

Portugal were trailing 2-0 when Ronaldo clashed with Dara O'Shea, hitting his elbow into the defender's back.

Referee Glenn Nyberg spotted the incident and showed Ronaldo a yellow card, but upgraded it to a red after reviewing it.

The incident was Ronaldo's first red card for Portugal in his 226th appearance.

Portugal will be without their captain for Sunday's home match against Armenia, with a win needed to secure their spot at the tournament.

Ronaldo exchanged words with Republic of Ireland boss Heimir Hallgrimsson and sarcastically applauded the crowd after the red card

Earlier this week, Ronaldo announced next year's World Cup would be his final major tournament, but now he is likely to miss the start of it.

The red card he received automatically carries a one-match suspension, ruling him out of Sunday's crucial qualifier against Armenia.

But violent conduct almost always carries an extended suspension and the extra games would only be served in competitive fixtures. 

If Portugal get the win they need against Armenia to qualify directly, their next competitive match would be their opening group game at the World Cup.

If the unlikely happens and Portugal do drop into the play-offs, the 40-year-old would sit out the semi-final and perhaps the final.

But how many games will Ronaldo get? That is in the hands of Fifa's disciplinary committee.

Technically, Fifa could opt not to extend Ronaldo's ban at all, meaning he would not be at risk of missing the start of the tournament.

However, Fifa disciplinary code states that a red card for "assault, including elbowing, punching, kicking, biting, spitting or hitting an opponent" should carry a three-match suspension. That would see Ronaldo miss Portugal's first two World Cup group games or both play-off matches.

But it's not quite as simple as that, as Fifa judges these matters on a case-by-case basis. 

For instance, at the 2023 Women's World Cup, England forward Lauren James was given two matches for stamping on the back of Nigeria's Michelle Alozie.

So, Ronaldo should be banned for three games, but he might only receive a two-match suspension.

There is no confirmed date for the decision, but after previous international windows the Fifa disciplinary committee met at the start of the following month. 

That would mean Ronaldo would learn his fate closer to the World Cup draw on 5 December.

Cristiano Ronaldo may be ruled out of Portugal matches at the World Cup after his red card against Ireland in Dublin

That's the lot for this blog. We thank you for reading, and emailing in. I'll be back shortly for tonight's World Cup qualifying action. Get yours puns, and even your keen insight into this beautiful game of ours, ready.

In addition to the massive Haaland-buys-some-burgers story, his teammates said it was a calm half-time team talk from the forward that kept Norway on track against Estonia last night. It was 0-0 at half time, but the hosts went on to win 4-1 with the first goal coming five minutes after the break. This is from Reuters:

Haaland, leading the team in the injured Martin Ødegaard's absence, urged them to stay calm after a goalless first half in Oslo, where the frustrated home crowd booed as the players headed down the tunnel.

Norway hit four goals in 12 minutes as Alexander Sørloth scored twice in quick succession five minutes after play resumed before Haaland added a double of his own. Robi Saarma netted a consolation for Estonia in the 64th minute.

“Erling was just nice and calm, he gave us the confidence that ‘We'll fix this, boys',” Morten Thorsby said. “‘We're going to get that goal. We just have to keep going.' That's the kind of confidence we need in these games,” Thorsby told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.

The defender Torbjørn Heggem said Haaland, who extended his all-time Norway scoring record to 53 goals, also delivered a clear tactical message at the break.

“He said we had to feed him more crosses ... just hit even more into the box. Especially when they are sitting so deep and we have to play a lot around them.” Heggem told NRK. “It worked, you could see that after five minutes.”

News to emerge from Sonia Bompastor's earlier press conference is that Hannah Hampton, the England goalkeeper, will be out of action “for a few weeks” due to a quad muscle injury.

Hampton missed the 6-0 away win against St Pölten in the Champions League on Tuesday having sustained the injury in the 1-1 draw with Arsenal last Saturday.

‘She will be out for a few weeks, so we'll see,” said Bompastor. “If we can see her before the end of the year I'm not sure.”

Peter is referring to this story from last night, which I didn't see earlier:

Captain Erling Haaland helped Norway celebrate their 4-1 victory over Estonia on Thursday by picking up a huge order of dozens of cheeseburgers for the squad, British media reported.

Haaland's composed half-time talk helped spark the win, midfielder Morten Thorsby said, with the team now on the brink of qualifying for the World Cup for the first time since 1998.

The 25-year-old striker, still dressed in Norway gear, was spotted after the game lugging the cheeseburger order back to the squad. “It's a strong performance from the captain!” Norway and Fulham midfielder Sander Berge told TV2. (Reuters)

“A late-night order of 60 or 70 cheeseburgers?!” emails Peter Oh. “I hope that is all that Erling Haaland has in common with Donald Trump.”

Women's Super League fixtures this weekend are as follows:

Saturday
 Manchester City v Manchester United (1.30pm)

Sunday (12pm unless stated)
 Aston Villa v London City Lionesses
 Brighton v Leicester
 Liverpool v Chelsea
 West Ham v Everton
 Tottenham v Arsenal (2.30pm)

“It's really important to have Sam [Kerr] back,” says Sonia Bompastor, the Chelsea Women head coach, of the forward who started a game for the first time in 692 days in the 6-0 Champions League win away against St Pölten on Tuesday. “She started in the Champions League, and scored a couple of goals.

“She brings leadership, also the fact she's a goal scorer, she has a lot of experience, and is always in the right position to score goals.”

Gosh, there an awful lot of cynical football fans out there! Within seconds of the referee brandishing his red card last night, I received a message from a colleague along very similar lines, as to whether Ronaldo will face the full force of the law.

“I am fully aware that Fifa are a wonderful and fair organisation led by a wonderful and peace-loving human being,” emails Espen. “Yet there is this tiny nagging thought in the back of my head saying that I'm not entirely sure they will follow their own rules and ban Ronaldo for two World Cup games. Don't know why but there's just something …”

John Brewin has penned today's Football Daily. You guessed it, it's all about Cristiano Ronaldo and his antics in Dublin last night.

Martin McColgan has emailed to query the following stat posted below:

England have won their last six away matches in all competitions, their best run since between May 1970 and December 1971 (6).

“Only if you don't count losing to Brazil and West Germany at the Mexico World Cup finals in June 1970,” writes Martin.

An interesting shout, I suppose for statistical purposes tournament games are not considered “away” matches.

Here's the view of a friend of mine who was at Fortess Aviva: “Portugal were woeful, sideways passing, no ideas, modern football! The striker who came on for them [Gonçalo Ramos] did more in two minutes than Ronaldo did the whole game. I mean, he doesn't even run any more.”

“I was just finishing an email to you last night about how limited this Irish team right as Troy Parrott scored the first goal,” writes John.

“Even with last nights result, I stand by that comment that they are limited but there are enough decent players to form into a competent team. The big problem is that there is no midfielder who can either dominate a game or who can create chances. That's obviously a problem but there are enough decent centre-backs there to create a good defence and a top-class keeper in Kelleher as well. That should be the basis of a decent team but the big thing this Irish team has is that it has attackers who are capable of scoring goals.

“Along with Parrott last night, Evan Ferguson has scored three goals in four games in qualifying while struggling at club level. It's been unfortunate that Ferguson and Parrott have not been fit at the same times this season as there is a chance of a good partnership there. Adam Idah has his flaws & shortcomings but he has a decent record for Ireland and if a Scottish player had scored 20 goals last season for Celtic, you could be sure he would be starting up front for them.

“Point is that for all of Ireland shortcomings, there is the bones of a decent team there and at international level, if you can get your tactics, organisation and discipline right, you can go a long way. Whether Heimir Hallgrimsson is the man to do that, I don't know, but with last nights result I think he has earned a chance to build on this.”

If you didn't see this goal by Piotr Zielinski for Inter the other week, stop everything and watch this:

What can I say about that? Other than: I hit one very similar at Catford Powerleague in 2012.

Football's global popularity is being placed at risk by skewing the sport's balance towards more matches at international level, Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has warned.

The impact of Uefa's expansion of club competitions was again felt this month, with Arsenal and Crystal Palace's Carabao Cup tie and their league fixtures preceding it having to be rearranged in part due to Palace's participation in the Uefa Conference League.

Leagues are also concerned about the impact of the expanded, summertime Club World Cup on their competitions from an economic and player welfare perspective, particularly amid talk of a further expansion from 32 to 48 teams and playing it every two years instead of every four.

Masters joined other league executives at the two-day World Leagues Association annual meeting in Athens this week, where the threat to domestic leagues from international expansion was one of the major topics discussed.

“(This meeting) is the best attended we've ever had and it's no surprise it comes at a time when the balance between national and international football is under threat from the unprecedented expansion of international competitions,” Masters said.

“We cannot take football's global popularity, its fans and its players for granted by fracturing this balance through an overloaded international calendar. All our members are united in their belief that to restore this balance domestic leagues must be protected.

“Football at all levels, from international competitions to grassroots, needs strong national leagues to provide the foundations. Dialogue with Fifa is now crucial and it is in the best interests of football to involve the leagues in any future decisions about the international calendar.”

European Leagues and the European division of world players' union Fifpro have filed a legal complaint to the European Commission against Fifa over what they see as an abuse of its dominant position under EU competition law.

They argue FIFA is abusing its position as both regulator and competition organiser and in doing so, causing economic and sporting damage to domestic leagues and jeopardising player welfare.

Fifa argues it is within its rights to organise competitions such as the Club World Cup within the parameters of the international calendar.

Fifa also has a Memorandum of Understanding with European Football Clubs - which features 17 current Premier League clubs among its membership - through to 2030 which renews those clubs' commitment to the international calendar. (PA Media)

There is a parallel between Cristiano Ronaldo/Portugal and Jude Bellingham/England. If Ronaldo gets a three-match ban for violent conduct, meaning he was due to miss Portugal's first two group games in North America, surely Roberto Martínez would be sensible to drop him altogether? Judging by his behaviour last night, it is hard to believe he is a positive presence in the changing room.

Thomas Tuchel has already shown he is willing to leave Bellingham out – and while he is a less dominant presence in the England setup than Ronaldo with Portugal, it's also feasible that Tuchel feels he is not a wholly positive figure when it comes to the building an upbeat squad dynamic. You really have to feel for the Adidas marketing people, after all that money they chucked at the current Bellingham campaign.

In other news, someone on telly was just blathering on about how England's back-up options for Harry Kane aren't up to scratch. I don't really buy that. The only reason England beat the Netherlands at the last Euros is that Ollie Watkins came on, a striker who can actually run fast. Kane is obviously in extremely good form but that is under specific circumstances at Bayern and in a certain way of playing. I wouldn't be entirely surprised to see him stinking out another major international tournament come next summer.

Thank you David. Here we are again. I was lucky enough to be doing the clockwatch for Republic of Ireland v Portugal last night, plus the other games. The match in Dublin bore all the hallmarks of a frustrating 0-0, or an agonising 0-1 defeat for the hosts.

But it couldn't have turned out much better, both in terms of result for the Irish, and Cristiano Ronaldo's comically childish yet notably violent red card. I'm doing the clockwatch again for tonight's qualifiers too.

In the meantime send me an email with your thoughts on Republic of Ireland's victory, prospects for their match in Budapest on Sunday, or tonight's games which include Slovakia v Northern Ireland, Luxembourg v Germany and Poland v Netherlands. Oh, and there's always England too. Let's go!

Time to hand the blog over to Luke McLaughlin for the rest of the afternoon. Thanks for reading!

Next up for England is a trip to Albania on Sunday. Some Opta stats here to impress family and friends with:

Albania have lost all seven of their matches against England – all in World Cup qualifiers – conceding at least twice in every defeat and scoring just once, an Altin Rraklli goal in a 3-1 loss in March 2001.

Albania have not conceded a goal in a home qualifier for a major tournament (EURO/World Cup) for eight matches, since a 1-0 defeat to Poland in October 2021. They have faced 70 shots (17 on target) and an xG of 4.61 without conceding in these eight games.

England have won their last six away matches in all competitions, their best run since between May 1970 and December 1971 (6).

England have kept a clean sheet in each of their last nine competitive internationals, facing just nine shots on target in that run – five of which were against Greece in the first of those nine games last November.

England have won their last two away matches 5-0, beating Serbia in September and Latvia in October. They last hit 5+ goals in three away games in a row between May 1937 and May 1938.

Harry Kane has been directly involved in seven goals in three appearances against Albania (5 goals, 2 assists), scoring or assisting on average every 35 minutes.

A quick mention for our cricket coverage with a week to go until day one of the first Ashes Test in Perth.

Back to domestic matters now and an exclusive. The EFL is to oppose radical proposals from League one clubs to introduce a £4.7m salary cap and a luxury tax for clubs that overspend.

Eighteen League One clubs wrote to the EFL chair, Rick Parry, this month advocating a fixed squad salary allowance, which they argue is required to get spending under control in a division where the median loss among 24 clubs last season was £5.2m.

“But what about the assists charts?” I hear you cry. Yes, we have those too. Norway on top again. Slightly surprising that Declan Rice has been England's top provider in the European World Cup qualifiers.

7 Martin Ødegaard (Norway)5 Lovro Majer (Croatia)5 Sorba Thomas (Wales)4 Memphis Depay (Netherlands)4 Mateo Retegui (Italy)﻿4 Declan Rice (England)4 Julian Ryerson (Norway)4 Manor Solomon (Israel)﻿

Erling Haaland is a mile clear in the top scorers in European World Cup qualifying charts. Those 14 goals have helped the ‘cheeseburger chompers' (see 11:22) smash 33 in their seven qualifiers. To be honest, it's pretty impressive that his teammates have combined for all those other 19.

14 Erling Haaland (Norway)7 Memphis Depay (Netherlands)6 Marko Arnautović (Austria)﻿6 Kevin De Bruyne (Belgium)6 Harry Kane (England)6 Andrej Kramarić (Croatia)﻿6 Mikel Merino (Spain)

The world of football throws up no shortage of questions. Today, Graham Ruthven endeavors to answer three of them, two of those involving Pep and Messi.

After failing to reach the finals in 2018 and 2022, could we be facing a third World Cup without the presence of Italy? It's possible. With group rivals Norway in such flying form (seven wins out of seven), Italy are now destined for the play-offs. The Azzurri only just scraped past Moldova last night, goals in the 88th minute and injury-time securing an unconvincing 2-0 win against a team that Norway had blasted 11 past, Erling Haaland helping himself to a five-for.

Not surprisingly, the travelling fans weren't happy, voicing their disapproval loudly but Italy boss Gennaro Gattuso wasn't having it. “What I heard today was a disgrace. I can't accept it. There are no easy games. If you're still thinking about the 11-1 Norway did against them here, that's not my problem. I'm very happy, let's move on. You have to stay united, because the team is struggling with difficulties on the pitch - and I don't accept hearing 500 fans protesting.”

Warming to his task, Gattuso also had a go at the qualification system. “In our day, the best runners-up went straight to the World Cup.”

Quiz time! Plenty of football questions in today's test of the grey matter. Quite a tricky one today.

Can France, after West Germany and Brazil, become only the third team to reach three consecutive World Cup finals? Luke Entwistle runs the rule over the 2018 winners after their 4-0 victory over Ukraine last night, a game that was Didier Deschamps' last competitive game on French soil as manager.

Here's Troy Parrott on his double against Portugal which kept the Republic of Ireland's World Cup hopes alive. Those two goals from the AZ Alkmaar striker secured a surprise 2-0 victory which means the Irish can earn a play-off spot if winning away to Hungary on Sunday. Parrott got the nod due to the absence of injured Roma frontman Evan Ferguson.

“It means everything. I felt emotions scoring those goals that I've never felt before. I don't even have the words to describe them. It's really a special feeling. I'm over the moon.

“I know it's a bit of a cliche, but I think Sunday now is probably the biggest game. We gave ourselves a good chance to get into that second spot, so now all the focus is on Sunday.

“I've had a big night. I'm not frustrated with the past. It is still frustrating that I've had to wait a long time for a night like this, but it just goes to show I have a lot of belief in myself. To see it pay off is really special.”

Former England captain Millie Bright has been getting her chat on with Suzanne Wrack. The Chelsea defender talks Barcelona, the benefits of taking a breather and joining a campaign to tackle winter loneliness.

Thanks Alex. Excellent win there for Curaçao. Fun fact: they're 82nd in the Fifa World Rankings, nine spots above Bulgaria. Stoichkov won't be happy.

It's not just European qualifiers going on right now, naturally, results in Concacaf World Cup qualifying today include Guatemala 2-3 Panama, Haiti 1-0 Costa Rica, Nicaragua 2-0 Honduras, Bermuda 0-7 Curaçao and, vitally, Trinidad and Tobago 1-1 Jamaica – a game which pitched Dwight Yorke against Steve McClaren in a managerial showdown. Honours even!

And, on that bombshell, I'll hand you back to David Tindall.

Cristiano Ronaldo's red card and possible suspension from two World Cup games for Portugal (note: I, perhaps cynically, believe this is unlikely) has me thinking about star players suspended for the start of major tournaments.

Wayne Rooney missed England's opening two games of Euro 2012, of course, after being sent off in England's draw with Montenegro. Before that, in Euro 2008, Russia were without a suspended Andrey Arshavin for two group games, before he returned and helped his side to the semi-finals. I'm sure there are simply loads I'm missing …

Unsurprising news: Marc Guéhi has now officially withdrawn from the England squad due to his foot injury. An FA statement has trumpeted: “Crystal Palace's Marc Guéhi has left the England camp and will not travel to Albania for Sunday's 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifier.

“The defender joined up with the Three Lions at Tottenham Hotspur's training ground earlier this week but has returned to his club to continue his rehabilitation.”

Palace go to Wolves next weekend so the club will be hoping to get their captain fit for that.

Thomas Tuchel has given more feedback on his England players after the win against Serbia. The gist: stand down John Cena, because none of them require an attitude adjustment. “I'm very happy with the attitude again of the team,” said Tuchel. “I don't see any change of attitude in training because the game doesn't mean anything, or is a dead-rubber as you call it, or is a friendly.”

England go to Albania in their last qualifier aiming to make it a perfect eight wins from eight. “I'm pretty sure we will be ready and the team will have the right spirit, to do it hopefully again in Albania, with all the respect,” added Tuchel. “It will be not easy and from there we go.”

Scotland visit Greece tomorrow in a vital Group C match – Ewan Murray is in Athens, surrounded by ancient wonders, and he's supplied his preview.

“It appears you can be on the brink of reaching your holy grail without many people paying sufficient attention. Scotland's opportunity for World Cup qualification is their best since 1998, when they last performed on that scene. Theirs is also a scenario that would have been widely welcomed before a ball was kicked. On the basis Denmark will defeat Belarus, Scotland must take at least a point from Saturday's clash in Greece.”

Group G's fixtures tonight are Finland v Malta and the big one: Poland v the Netherlands. The Dutch are three points ahead of Poland with a far better goal difference, so it isn't exactly a top-spot showdown, but nothing is settled yet. Finland could still sneak into second if it all goes wrong for Poland in their last two fixtures.

Group L has Croatia v Faroe Islands (on a three-game qualification win streak!) later today. Plus Gibraltar v Montenegro. Croatia will qualify for the World Cup if they pick up a point.

World Cup qualification action tonight is brought to you by the Groups A, G and L (note: for me, Group L just sounds too far into the alphabet but there we go).

Group A features Slovakia v Northern Ireland and, while the latter are guaranteed a playoff spot after topping their Nations League group, they could do Germany a favour(!) by taking at least a point off Slovakia. Germany face Luxembourg this evening, but the final match is Germany v Slovakia in a likely playoff for top spot. A reminder that Germany lost the first fixture between those two sides, 2-0 in September.

Thanks David – on the subject of England World Cup songs: I'm obviously partial to the epic 90s duo of my youth (World in Motion/Three Lions).

However I also have a guilty soft spot for Ant and Dec's We're on the Ball and I can recite the entire passing sequence – “it's Neville to Campbell, Campbell to Rio, Rio to Scholsey” etc, etc – from start to finish off by heart. Yet I can remember next to nothing of my GCSE French. How useful.

Right, time for me to hand you over to Alex Reid while I head out in the pouring rain for supplies.

Here's Portugal coach Roberto Martinez defending Cristiano Ronaldo for the elbow on the Republic of Ireland's Dara O'Shea that could lead to the skipper missing the first two group games of the 2026 World Cup finals.

FIFA's disciplinary code states violent conduct should lead to a suspension of at least three matches, as should any offence of assault, including “elbowing, punching, kicking, biting, spitting at or hitting an opponent”. Ronaldo will definitely serve a one-match ban for his red card in the 2-0 defeat in Dublin, meaning he misses Portugal's final qualifier against Armenia on Sunday, but then it's in Fifa's hands as to whether that suspension is increased to three games.

Martinez said of Ronaldo: “The red card is just a captain that has never been sent off before in 226 games – I think that just deserves credit – and today, I thought it was a bit harsh because he cares about the team.

“He was 60 minutes or 58 minutes in the box being grabbed, being pulled, being pushed and obviously when he tries to get away from the defender. I think the action looks worse than what it actually is, I don't think it's an elbow, I think it's a full body, but from where the camera is, it looks like an elbow. But we accept it.

“The only thing that leaves a bitter taste in my mouth is at the (pre-match) press conference, (the Ireland) coach (Heimir Hallgrimsson) was talking about the aspect of the referees being influenced, and then a big centre-half falls on the floor so dramatically at the turn of Cristiano's body.”

An e-mail from Kieran McHugh. 

“We all know that the best World Cup song is This Time by the 1982 World Cup squad. Whether it's comb and paper or a kazoo may never be known, but it's a cracking song and the video demonstrates Shilts' lip syncing is up there with Milli Vanilli. However as a resident of Loughton, Essex I have further information that may be of interest. News in fact of a blue plaque in Loughton that celebrates the former home of Ron Greenwood. The house number? 22. Of course!”

A song now to hopefully inspire the Republic of Ireland to World Cup qualification. Remember this? Mick McCarthy on drums after 31 seconds. Produced by U2's Larry Mullen.

Exciting news from Norway where Erling Haaland was seen coming out of a local restaurant with a massive stash of cheeseburgers after scoring a brace in the 4-1 win over Estonia. Experts reckon the celebratory haul was significant, with claims of “60 to 70 cheeseburgers” in some outlets. Haaland, age 25, was still wearing his Norway training gear when emerging from the fast food establishment. More when we have it.

Shall we have some World Cup songs? Let's start with England. This is often forgotten and overshadowed by 1970's ‘Back Home' and 1982's ‘This Time (We'll Get It Right)‘ but I rather like 1998's ‘(How Does It Feel to Be) On Top of the World'. I mean, the Spice Girls are in the video, it was written by Ian McCulloch, Johnny Marr and the fella out of Ocean Colour Scene. Released on Juxtaposition Records. Didn't get to No.1. Good, didn't want it to. Next.

A brief departure from international musings. Then again, not quite as two England starters from last night appear in this list curated by Danel Harris.

England analysis. Five pointers from the Wembley win, courtesy of Jacob Steinberg. Nico O'Reilly and Marcus Rashford both feature.

“The dream scenario is Marcus Rashford becoming England's Son Heung-min. Kane loved dropping off and releasing Son when they were teammates at Tottenham.”

Some Thomas Tuchel quotes from England's 2-0 win. The German was delighted with the impact of his substitutes which included Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden.

“This is not about building a starting XI, it's about building a team. And that means that sometimes, they're all big players in their club, they're all used to play, they're all disappointed. This is normal, but they buy into this idea of building a team and this is what we want, this is what we need, there is no other way around it.”

You want content? How about this for content, then: Luis Rubiales having eggs flung at him during during the presentation of his new book in Madrid. Not only that, the disgraced former Spanish football federation president claimed the flinger was his uncle.

Zapruder footage here. You have to say that the disgraced former Spanish football federation president takes the second egg well. Quite the spin to catch it on his cool jacket, ensuring the egg doesn't strike his cool white t-shirt and cool light blue jeans. Would disgraced presidents from other football federations have shown such mobility in a tight area?

A reminder that Rubiales was convicted of sexual assault for a forced kiss on the player Jenni Hermoso after Spain won the Women's World Cup.

Here's Barney Ronay's take on last night's game at Wembley and the big talking point: England's No 10.

“Tuchel has been very clear. He wants a structure not a group of the coolest guys, a selection by aura. And in many ways it worked here as on 65 minutes, with England already 1-0 up, we finally got it, the shootout of the No 10s. We got energy, mood-shift, a four-man blazing squad entering the field of play: Jude, Phil, Eberechi Eze and, er, Jordan Henderson.”

The World Cup starts in 209 days. It seems quite a while yet but if you're thinking about committing to the 2026 Panini sticker album, it's probably worth putting aside some cash now. With 48 teams involved, this ain't going to be cheap.

I've asked AI to run the numbers. “It will likely cost well over £1,000 to fill the 2026 Panini World Cup sticker album, potentially reaching as high as £1,500, due to the increase in the number of teams and general inflation. While the theoretical minimum cost, assuming no duplicates, is much lower (around £120-£130), the practical cost is much higher because of the high probability of getting duplicate stickers.” Quote this to your football-mad 10-year-old nearer the time.

In related news, I had a rummage the other night and found three spare Robertos from the 1978 World Cup collection. Does anyone know if the Brazilian striker is worth much?

A World Cup qualifying quiz question. In the European section, only one other team apart from England have gone through qualifying with a perfect record so far? Don't look down if you want to try and make a guess.

A clue: they haven't played in the finals since France ‘98.

A second clue: they have a big lad up front.

Yes, the answer is Norway, who have won seven out of seven after beating Estonia 4-1 in Oslo last night. Erling Haaland helped himself to another couple and now has 14 goals in qualifying.

Technically, they haven't yet qualified as Italy, who they play away in the final game, could still join Norway on 21 points. However, check the goal difference: Norway +29, Italy +12. So just a 17-goal swing then.

Not wanting to spoil the party but it's a still a big ask for the Republic of Ireland to qualify for the finals. To secure a play-off spot they need to secure victory over Hungary in Budapest on Sunday. Hungary stayed ahead of the Irish in Group F after Barnabás Varga headed home Dominik Szoboszlai's cross to secure a 1-0 win in Armenia.

The last time Hungary took part in a World Cup play-off they lost 12-1 on aggregate to Yugoslovia in 1997. What?! 12-1!!

Which countries have qualified for the 2026 World Cup and how did they do it? Here's a very handy ‘Explainer' from Andy Martin. Twenty-nine of the 48 places have now been filled but some big names – Cameroon and Nigeria for example – will need to come through a playoff.

That red card for Ronaldo against the Republic of Ireland was his first in 226 appearances for Portugal. And the man himself certainly didn't see it coming having come out with these famous last words before the match. “I really like the fans here. The support they give to their national team is lovely. For me, it's a pleasure to come to play here again. I hope they don't boo too much to me tomorrow. I swear that I'm gonna try to be a good boy.”

There could be some serious ramifications for Ronnie after his flailing arm on Dara O'Shea. The red means he's automatically banned for Portugal's home game against Armenia on Sunday. But if judged as “serious foul play” by Fifa, that suspension would double to two matches and if classed as “violent conduct” the ban would be extend to three.

That, of course, would mean Ronaldo missing one, or even two, of Portugal's opening group games in the 2026 finals. I'm going to make a wild guess here… I don't think that will happen.

Back to England v Serbia and some player ratings. We have a ‘9' and a couple of ‘8s'. Press here to reveal Ed Aarons' scores on the doors from Wembley.

Republic of Ireland 2-0 Portugal. While England winning 2-0 generated nothing much more than a shrug around the football world, another qualifier ending in that same scoreline raised lots of eyebrows. Fantastic stuff from the Irish as two goals from Troy Parrott secured a famous win in Dublin and kept their playoff hopes alive. And just for extra craic for the home fans filing out of the Aviva, Cristiano Ronaldo was sent off! More details here on the best sporting performance from a Parrott since John beat Jimmy White 18-11 in the final of the 1991 world snooker championship.

Good morning! Before the deep dive, let's start with the bread and butter: David Hytner's match report of England 2-0 Serbia.

“Too often, the final pass was missing. But what the manager did get was another win and another clean sheet. Count seven of each from seven qualifiers. The final one is against Albania in Tirana on Sunday. And, also, two lovely goals.”

International breaks seem to go on for ages and we're not even halfway through the latest one. Still, matters are being resolved and the picture of just who will be at next summer's 2026 World Cup finals is becoming clearer.

England had already qualified ahead of last night's 2-0 win over Serbia but that didn't stop the forensic analysis of Thomas Tuchel's latest selection and England's Wembley performance.

We'll bring you all the fallout from last night's game and also a round-up of events elsewhere where it was quite the night for the Republic of Ireland. For Cristiano Ronaldo, not so much.

And beyond World Cup qualifying, there appears to have been a family feud in Spain involving eggs. More on that shortly.

Righty, let's get this thing going!

Report as England end Serbia's top-two chances in Group K of World Cup qualifying and maintain their perfect record in the group through Bukayo Saka and Eberechi Eze goals; Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden second-half subs after Morgan Rogers favoured at No 10

England maintained their perfect World Cup qualifying record with a 2-0 win over Serbia thanks to a fine Bukayo Saka volley and excellent Eberechi Eze finish, as Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden had mixed performances off the bench at Wembley.

The goals were standout moments of quality on a rain-soaked night in which already-qualified England struggled to hit the high levels they've reached in recent internationals. But Thomas Tuchel's side were markedly improved after he intervened midway through the first half after a lacklustre and sloppy start to the game from his team.

England had been 3-0 up by half-time in their past three internationals - including a 5-0 thrashing of Serbia in Belgrade - but were alarmingly slow out of the blocks here until an impromptu Tuchel team talk shook things up when Jordan Pickford went down calling for treatment on 23 minutes.

With Harry Kane dropping deeper to turn playmaker and Declan Rice more advanced, Saka and Marcus Rashford suddenly began to threaten. As well as Saka's volley, there were more good chances before half-time, with Kane heading wide and Rogers glancing off target after Rashford and Rice were unable to capitalise on a counter.

There were let-offs in the second half, though, with Dusan Vlahovic flicking wide and then clipping the roof of the net as Serbia - increasingly desperate - searched for an equaliser to save their World Cup hopes. This result, though, coupled with Albania also winning in Andorra, ends their chances of a top-two finish in Group K.

The statistics look good for England. They are still yet to concede in this campaign, with Pickford's England record run of international clean sheets stretching to 10 matches. But at the other end of the pitch there is intrigue into how Tuchel will utilise all his attacking options.

There were just a handful of Serbia supporters in the away section at Wembley. The Serbia FA opted not to sell tickets to their supporters after recent crowd problems had led to hefty fines from UEFA.

Bellingham and Foden - benched with Tuchel favouring Morgan Rogers at No 10 - finally entered the fray after an hour. Foden, as a false nine, nodded a headed chance wide but made his mark late on, chipping a wonderful pass for an Eze shot to be tipped onto the bar before assisting his team-mate for England's second.

Bellingham, meanwhile, playing off Foden, buzzed like a player with a point to prove. There were a couple of exciting combinations with Reece James but ultimately the Real Madrid man became frustrated. If anything, this was another night in which Rogers once again showed why he is liked by Tuchel despite competition at No 10 from high-profile team-mates. It is a battle which will run right up until the World Cup.

England boss Thomas Tuchel: 

"We wanted to have quality and impact and new energy from the bench which we got. We created chances, half-chances and scored.

"We had some moments to defend until the very end, to defend our clean sheet. A special compliment to Jordan and the back four today. In the second half the pressing was not always right and we let Serbia escape. There was some intense output we had to give to get the clean sheet and win the game.

"It was a difficult match, a complicated match, we had to adapt and be flexible. Maybe throughout the match we lacked a little bit of precision with the last pass, otherwise we could have created more and scored earlier to be a bit more calm.

"But I liked it, it stayed intense and a tight match. We could see their quality. I'm happy about this test. It was a test. The attitude was right."

Sky Sports' Sam Blitz at Wembley:

"So what did we learn there?

"England don't play with a striker. Harry Kane played like a deep midfielder. Phil Foden came on as a false nine. Lots of people called for a Danny Welbeck to support Kane, but do England even need that out-and-out No 9?

"Tuchel can change it mid-game. England were dire in the first 25 minutes. The England boss got the group in with a tactical time-out and suddenly the team was much, much better. Rice played higher. Rashford and Saka were more involved.

"Anderson looks the part. So many clever incisive balls from England's defensive midfielder. That No 6 role is his to lose, with Adam Wharton only given five minutes to impress.

"There's a race on at centre-back. Ezri Konsa looked good, with a couple of last-ditch challenges. Who out of him, John Stones and Marc Guehi fill the two spots?

"Nico O'Reilly looks the part too. The Man City left-back did not look out of place on England debut - he lasted the 90 minutes. Is that spot his to lose too?

"And Bellingham is still not at it. Still feeling his shoulder injury? Not up to speed? Short of confidence? Rogers looked better than him here."

England's Phil Foden to ITV:

"So happy to be back in the squad. Great players and I'm enjoying it. I thought I did well, created a few chances and unlucky not to put a couple away. Overall, I have to be happy with the impact."

On his role as striker: "I'll play wherever the manager puts me. I can play multiple positions and I was happy to come on as a false nine. I enjoyed it. Maybe it will get the best out of me, only time will tell.

"There are quality players all over the pitch. I know there is pressure on me to perform at Man City and I just have to keep my head down and earn my place. The smile is back."

The draw for the 2026 World Cup will take place in Washington on December 5.

President Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures.

Announcing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was "the biggest event in sports", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like "104 Super Bowls".

The draw will take place from 12pm local time (5pm UK time).

Northern Ireland last qualified for the World Cup in 1986

Fifa World Cup qualifier: Slovakia v Northern Ireland

Venue: Kosice, Slovakia Date: Friday, 14 November Kick-off: 19:45 GMT

Coverage: Watch live on BBC Two NI, BBC Three & BBC iPlayer; commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Radio Ulster & BBC Sounds; live text commentary and in-play clips on BBC Sport website & app

As Northern Ireland take the field against Slovakia on Friday evening, for many of Michael O'Neill's young squad it will feel like the most consequential international of their careers to date.

With their efforts to reach the World Cup in North America next summer reaching a critical juncture, there is a sense that the 90 minutes in Kosice could be defining in Group A where Northern Ireland are three points behind both Germany and Slovakia with two games remaining. 

However, needing at least a point to carry their hopes of a top-two finish into their final group game at home to Luxembourg on Monday, there is the curious scenario where Northern Ireland's players could leave the field beaten, only to discover that events elsewhere have ensured them a qualifying play-off spot regardless.

As a winner of their Nations League group, only a highly unlikely set of results would mean Northern Ireland would miss out on the play-off games in March. 

Knowing the importance of seeding come the play-offs, and what second place in the group would represent for his panel, manager O'Neill is giving little thought to the potential of a backdoor route into those crunch spring fixtures.

"We haven't paid any attention to that," he said. "We did our job in the Nations League and, if that gives us a route to a qualification play-off, great. If it doesn't, we have to take care of it here.

"This is the here and now, we have to deal with that situation which is obviously getting as many points as we can from the final two games.

"What we can get is 12 points and we have to aspire to that."

NI the 'strongest we've been' - Peacock-Farrell

Magennis praises NI 'fearlessness and athleticism'

Belief that Northern Ireland could seal second place ahead of Slovakia surged after they were comfortably the superior team when the sides met in Belfast last month, winning 2-0 with a performance that record goalscorer David Healy said was perhaps their best ever under O'Neill.

In the weeks since, however, there is a growing feeling that the tables have turned somewhat.

Slovakia were missing influential pair Stanislav Lobotka and David Hancko for the game at Windsor Park, with both expected to be back in Francesco Calzona's starting line-up at the Kosice Football Arena this time around. 

Northern Ireland, however, will be without three-quarters of the midfield that so impressed in the reverse fixture, with Shea Charles and Ali McCann injured while Ethan Galbraith is suspended.

How the manager fills such considerable holes in his line-up has been the key talking point since his squad was confirmed last week.

In Napoli's Lobotka, O'Neill believes Slovakia can again call upon one of the best defensive midfielders in Europe.

"He's an excellent player and he plays at the top level with Napoli, but we look at Slovakia as a team, we don't look at them as one player or two players," he said.

"It won't change the way Slovakia try and play. We have to deal with that as a team, it's not one individual player.

"We don't envisage any dramatic change in their strategy or how they look to play tactically, but they'll obviously be stronger."

Stanislav Lobotka missed the game between the sides in October

If O'Neill is complimentary of Lobotka, such sentiments have not been reciprocated this week with the 30-year-old quoted as saying Northern Ireland lacked creativity were "annoying".

In response to what was a not dissimilar critique of his side to the one aired by Germany manager Julian Nagelsmann earlier in the campaign, O'Neill quipped that his wife is quick to call him annoying too, but in fact feels there are similarities between his side and Slovakia in terms of style and approach. 

"We take that as a compliment and it won't upset us," he said of Lobotka's remark.

"I would say that they're quite similar to us in the way that it is their collective as a team. They play in a very structured way. They believe in the way they play. They have good individual players. They're good as a collective.

"It's always hard to play away, but we're looking forward to the game and we believe we can do it."

GUATEMALA CITY – The Final Round of the Concacaf Qualifiers to the 2026 FIFA World Cup continued with Panama defeating Guatemala, 3-2, in Group A on Thursday at Estadio El Trébol in Guatemala City, Guatemala.

Cecilio Waterman opened the scoring in the 30' as Panama pulled ahead with a powerful right-footed hit. 

Waterman secured his brace in the 44' to extend the lead for Los Canaleros, finding the back of the net with a finish from the top of the box. 

Arquímides Ordóñez headed a ball from Pedro Altán from close range in the 69' to shorten the deficit for Guatemala.

Rudy Muñoz equalized for Los Chapines in the 69', slotting the ball at the bottom right corner, capitalizing on a through ball from Olger Escobar. 

José Fajardo struck in the 78' with a first-time right-footed finish from the center of the box to restore Panama's lead.

Panama remains in second place in the group with the win, separated from the direct qualification on goal difference. Los Canaleros will host El Salvador on Tuesday. 

Guatemala is eliminated from contention for the 2026 FIFA World Cup with the loss. Los Chapines will host Suriname to conclude its campaign.

Referee Kari Seitz was also chosen along with Kevin Crow, best known for his time in indoor football.

They will be inducted on May 1 at the hall in Frisco, Texas.

O'Reilly, 40, was a forward and winger who scored 47 goals in 231 international appearances, helping the US win the 2015 World Cup and Olympic gold medals in 2004, 2008 and 2012. 

She won league titles with Sky Blue in 2009 in Women's Professional Soccer and with Kansas City in 2015 and North Carolina in 2019 in the National Women's Soccer League.

Heath, 37, was a midfielder and striker who scored 36 goals in 181 appearances, won World Cup titles with the USA in 2015 and 2019 and Olympic gold medals in 2008 and 2012.

Sanneh, 54, was a defender who scored three goals in 43 international appearances, starting all five matches for the US at the 2002 World Cup as the Americans reached the quarter-finals in their biggest progress since 1930.

The 2026 World Cup is almost upon us, especially now that the USMNT is about to play its final two games of the 2025 calendar year. The first game is set for Saturday when the Americans play Paraguay. Mauricio Pochettino's team is on a three-match unbeaten run, finally showing some promise and building some momentum ahead of the World Cup. However, they will be challenged by Paraguay, which is also preparing for next summer.

Following a concerning loss to South Korea in September, the U.S. has turned things around. A switch by Pochettino to a three-back system has yielded a win over Japan, a draw with Ecuador, and a win over Australia. However, it's not a stretch to say that the USMNT's biggest tests of the year await with the games against Paraguay and Uruguay.

Saturday's opponent, Paraguay, is coming off a successful World Cup qualification campaign. Granted, seven wins, seven draws, and four losses were only good for sixth place in CONMEBOL qualifying. But it was good enough to make it into the field of 48, getting Paraguay to the World Cup for the first time since 2010.

This will be the first time the USMNT and Paraguay have played each other since 2018. The U.S. won that March 2018 friendly 1-0. They were also victorious in a 1-0 win over Paraguay during the 2016 Copa América despite playing most of the second half with 10 players.

Time: Saturday, November 15, 5:00 PM, ET

Venue: Subaru Park, Chester, Pennsylvania

TV/streaming: TNT and HBOMax in English | Telemundo, Universo and Peacock in Spanish

While it seems like Pochettino is starting to put the pieces together for next year's World Cup, this will not be the USMNT at full strength. Injuries and circumstances at club level will leave the U.S. without the likes of Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson, Tyler Adams, Malik Tillman, Chris Richards, Tim Weah, and Weston McKennie for the November window. All seven are potential starts, leaving some uncertainty as to how the USMNT will lineup against Paraguay.

USMNT Lineup (3-4-3, right to left)

Matt Freese (GK) - Miles Robinson, Mark McKenzie, Tim Ream - Sergiño Dest, Aidan Morris, Tanner Tessmann, Max Arfsten - Brenden Aaronson, Folarin Balgoun, Gio Reyna

Paraguay Lineup (4-2–3-1, right to left)

Roberto Fernandez (GK) - Juan Caceres, Gustavo Gomez, Omar Alderete, Junior Alonso - Damian Bobadilla, Andres Cubas - Hugo Cuenca, Diego Gomez, Miguel Almiron - Antonio Sanabria

Paraguay should be a good test for the U.S., especially since Pochettino's side is missing several key figures. The South American side has just two losses in its last 14 matches, although one of those came in a friendly against South Korea last month. That stretch also includes victories over Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay in World Cup qualifying matches, so Paraguay can compete against high-level teams.

Defensively, Paraguay has been particularly strong. They have a veteran backline that's helped them to keep seven clean sheets in their last 14 matches. Only four times in those 14 matches has their opponent scored multiple goals. On the other hand, both Japan and South Korea scored two goals against them in friendlies last month.

Meanwhile, the U.S. has come on strong on both ends lately. The three-back formation has helped to solidify them defensively, while the Americans have shown some grit and determination to manufacture goals on the attacking end. Even with key players missing, the USMNT has some potential match-winners, not to mention plenty of players with a point to prove, which should help push the Americans over the top.

Prediction: USA 2, Paraguay 1

FRISCO, Texas (AP) — Women's World Cup champions and Olympic gold medalists Tobin Heath and Heather O'Reilly were elected Thursday to the U.S. National Soccer Hall of Fame along with men's players Tony Sanneh and Chris Wondolowski.

Referee Kari Seitz also was elected along with Kevin Crow, known primarily for his time in indoor soccer.

They will be inducted on May 1 at the hall in Frisco, Texas.

O'Reilly, 40, was a forward and winger who scored 47 goals in 231 international appearances, helping the U.S. win the 2015 World Cup and Olympic gold medals in 2004, 2008 and 2012. She won league titles with Sky Blue in 2009 in Women's Professional Soccer and with Kansas City in 2015 and North Carolina in 2019 in the National Women's Soccer League.

Heath, 37, was a midfielder and forward who had 36 goals in 181 appearances, winning World Cup titles with the U.S. in 2015 and 2019 and Olympic gold medals in 2008 and 2012.

Wondolowski, 42, is Major League Soccer's career scoring leader with 171 regular-season goals and two in the playoffs, playing for San Jose (2005, 2009-21) and Houston (2006-09). He scored 11 goals in 35 international appearances, playing in two games at the 2014 World Cup.

Sanneh, 54, was a defender who scored three goals in 43 international appearances, starting all five games for the U.S. at the 2002 World Cup as the Americans reached the quarterfinals in their farthest advancement since 1930. He played for D.C. (1996-98), Columbus (2004), Chicago (2005-06), Colorado (2007) and the LA Galaxy (2009) along with stints at Hertha Berlin (1991-2001) and Nuremberg (2001-04) and won MLS titles in 1996 and 1997.

O'Reilly, Heath and Wondolowski were picked from the player ballot. The top two are elected if they each receive at least 50% and a third is elected if receiving at least 75%.

O'Reilly got 47 of 48 votes for 97.9%, followed by Heath (45, 93.8%), Wondolowski (37, 77.1%), Keith Johnson (33, 68.8%), Samantha Mewis (32, 66.7%), Dwayne DeRosario (29, 60.4%), Amy Rodriguez (28, 58.3%), Kyle Beckerman (27, 56.3%), Robbie Keane (20, 41.7%), Oguchi Onyewu (19, 39.6%), Jermaine Jones (17, 35.4%), Maurice Edu (16, 33.3%), Diego Valeri (13, 27.1%), Michael Archer (12, 25%), Stephanie Lopez Cox (12, 25%), Chad Marshall (11, 22.9%), Mike Lawson (10, 20.8%), Carlos Ruiz (7, 14.6%), Matt Besler (6, 12.5%) and Geoff Cameron (5, 10.4%).

Sanneh and Crow were chosen from the veteran ballot, in which the top vote-getter is elected if receiving at least 50% and a second if receiving at least 75%. Sanneh was on 21 of 24 ballots (87.55%) and was followed by Crow (19, 79.2%), Tatu (17, 70.8%), Tiffany Roberts (16, 66.7%), David Beckham (11, 45.8%), Clint Mathis (10, 41.7%), Lorrie Fair (6, 25%), Chico Borja (5, 20.8%), Aly Wagner (5, 20.8%) and Francis Farberoff (1, 4.2%).

Seitz, 55, referred refereed nine games at the Women's World Cup in 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2011 and six at the Olympics in 2004, 2008 and 2012. She became the U.S. Soccer Federation's vice president of referees in 2024.

Seitz was on the builder ballot, which this year included only referees. The top voter-getter is picked if receiving at least 50%.

For the Builder Ballot, the 2026 rotation considered candidates from the referee category only. Election procedures call for the Builder named to the most ballots (and on at least 50% of the ballots) to be elected. Seitz got 19 of 24 votes (79.2%) and was followed by Gino D'Ippolito (10, 41.7%), Brian Hall (6, 25%) and Mark Geiger (4, 16.7%).

PHILADELPHIA — Perhaps the clearest sign of Mauricio Pochettino's background at the club level comes in his interaction with members of the U.S. men's national team when they are outside international windows.

Which is to say, there's not much interaction at all.

“I feel like in-season, he kinda lets you deal with your club and lets you focus on your coach and stuff there,” USMNT defender Alex Freeman told The Post this week. “But if you ever need him, he's always a text or a call away. He always picks up. I think he lets you be at your club. He was a club coach, so he probably knows how it is with clubs.”

That is not to imply that Pochettino isn't building the necessary relationships with his players or doing the legwork in between international windows amid the run-up to next summer's World Cup that will be the most important event for American soccer perhaps ever.

Pochettino and his staff have visited more than 50 clubs in North America and Europe and watch every game they can. 

When Freeman showed up at camp for the Gold Cup over the summer, Pochettino took him aside for a 20-minute conversation that included extensive feedback on his game.

“It's good to go to camp and have a guy who's giving you feedback and letting you know what he thinks about how you play,” Freeman said. “Just gives you confidence as a player to want to do better for him. Just having him as a coach, you can tell he's very passionate about the sport and he wants the best out of all of us.”

Pochettino has admitted he didn't know Cristian Roldan before making the midfielder a late call-up two months ago. 

But when Roldan arrived for his first camp under the Argentine, Pochettino established a relationship immediately, nevertheless.

“Giving me confidence, telling me I belong here,” Roldan told The Post. “Telling me that I can do it, that I had been gone [from the national team] for two years [but] I still have the ability to affect the game in the way they see it. To be myself with my personality. I think that those things correlate to success. And I felt like he did a great job of just bringing me in and making it seem seamless.”

That was crucial for Roldan's successful re-entry into the national team fold.

“He was very clear in what he wanted out of me,” Roldan said. “So just bringing that same energy back is really important. … Continue to form that relationship. Definitely trust is the first word I'd put to it.”

Luis Rubiales has had eggs thrown at him during the launch of his book, Matar a Rubiales (Kill Rubiales). (Getty Images: Europa Press/Francisco Guerra)

The former president of Spain's national football federation has had eggs thrown at him during a book launch.

Rubiales made international headlines after he kissed Spanish player Jenni Hermoso at the conclusion of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup final in Sydney.

Rubiales was charged with sexual assault and was convicted by Spain's High Court in February this year.

The former president of Spain's national football federation, who made headlines after his behaviour following the final of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, has had eggs thrown at him during the launch of his book.

A Foreign Correspondent investigation has detailed the decades of sexism and misogyny leading up to the infamous World Cup kiss.

Luis Rubiales resigned as president of the RFEF (Royal Spanish Football Federation) after he kissed Spanish player Jenni Hermoso, who was collecting her winner's medal following Spain's 1-0 win over England in the final at Sydney's Stadium Australia.

Rubiales was charged with sexual assault and was convicted by Spain's High Court in February this year.

The 48-year-old has written a book called Matar a Rubiales (Kill Rubiales), which he says, according to ESPN, is "for those who want to know the reality".

During a book launch event on Thursday (local time) in Madrid, someone from the audience threw eggs at Rubiales.

Footage of the incident shows Rubiales attempting to confront the egg thrower, with security keeping the pair separated.

"I didn't know what he had in his hands," Rubiales told Radio Marca.

"I thought he might have a gun … I wasn't thinking about myself."

Rubiales was fined 10,800 euros ($19,200) following his conviction in February, but was acquitted on a charge of coercion.

A Spanish court rejected Rubiales's appeal of his conviction in June.

PHILADELPHIA — Mark McKenzie was talking Thursday about the little intricacies, the things an athlete knows about his teammates through practicing together over and over and over again.

“Whether it's turning over your left shoulder, turning over your right shoulder, whether someone's a bit more aggressive stepping into midfield,” McKenzie, a center back for the USMNT, said before Thursday's training session. “Whether they're more comfortable in aerial duels, whether they're more comfortable covering space behind. I think those are all things you build through repetition.”

And that inherently represents a problem to be solved for a national team.

Between now and June 12, when it begins the World Cup on home soil in Los Angeles, the Yanks have all of a handful of training sessions together. 

There is another international window in March, with Portugal and Belgium as rumored friendly opponents, that should include something like the A-team at camp, and there will be the final, pre-World Cup training camp in the immediate lead-up to the competition itself.

Of course, there's also the remainder of the current window, which includes a friendly against Paraguay on Saturday here in Philadelphia, as well as one against Uruguay on Tuesday in Tampa. 

Due to a mix of injuries and circumstances, though, a number of players anticipated to play key roles at the World Cup, including Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Antonee Robinson, Yunus Musah and Chris Richards, were not called up this time around.

The problem is not unique to the United States; it's inherent to any national team and in any sport. 

Still, the question of how to build chemistry over a limited window of practices, dispersed over months at a time, with the stakes as high as could be, is one whose answer will help dictate how far the U.S. goes next summer.

“There's a sense of intentionality, a sense of urgency, that comes along with that,” McKenzie said. “Knowing you have a limited amount of training sessions together. Knowing that there's work to be done, areas we want to improve on and continue to grow as a group. Building the chemistry we already have. Figuring out the nuances of how we want to play, what message we want to send every time we step on the pitch, to our opponents. The biggest thing is intentionality and urgency with the sessions we do have together.”

Of course, it's not as if players show up their first time at a national team camp cold, not knowing anyone in the building. 

The world of American soccer is small and interconnected. 

McKenzie, Brendan Aaronson, Auston Trusty and Matt Freese, for example, all grew up in Philadelphia and played for Bethlehem Steel FC, the United Soccer League affiliate for the MLS Philadelphia Union.

Alex Freeman has built close bonds with fellow defenders Max Arfsten and Miles Robinson.

“I feel like the bond of this team is one of the reasons I feel like we're gonna go very far in this World Cup,” Freeman told The Post on Wednesday. “We do everything together. Not only that, it's like no egos. No one thinks they're better than everyone. I think it's nice because [coach Mauricio] Pochettino kinda created that culture. Everyone here has to work for it.”

Pochettino, in the run-up to this camp, dismissed any notion that his main group may not get enough time together before the World Cup.

“We are not going to complain,” he said. “We cannot give excuses to ourselves in case [we do] not perform. I think we have time enough. We need to be intelligent and we need to give our best to perform and it's up to us.”

Three former players who performed domestically and internationally for U.S. national teams, have been elected to the National Soccer Hall of Fame, the organization revealed on its website on Thursday.

The trio was U.S. women's national team standouts Heather O'Reilly and Tobin Heath and Major League Soccer all-time scoring leader Chris Wondolowski.

All three were voted in on the Players' Ballot.

O'Reilly played 231 full internationals between 2002 and 2016. She was a member of the 2015 Women's World Cup championship side, and Olympic gold medals in 2004, 2008 and 2012.

Heath made 181 appearances for the USWNT. She performed three Women's World Cups, lifting the trophy in 2015 and 2019. She also competed in four Olympic soccer tournaments, winning gold in 2008 and 2012 and bronze in 2021.

A forward who retired as the leading goal scorer in Major League Soccer history, Wondolowski played 17 seasons in the league between 2005-21.

They will be inducted into the NSHOF in Frisco, Texas on May 1, 2026.

There likely will be more inductees soon.

Three former players who performed domestically and internationally for U.S. national teams, have been elected to the National Soccer Hall of Fame, the organization revealed on its website on Thursday.

The trio was U.S. women's national team standouts Heather O'Reilly and Tobin Heath and Major League Soccer all-time scoring leader Chris Wondolowski.

All three were voted in on the Players' Ballot.

O'Reilly played 231 full internationals between 2002 and 2016. She was a member of the 2015 Women's World Cup championship side, and Olympic gold medals in 2004, 2008 and 2012.

Heath made 181 appearances for the USWNT. She performed three Women's World Cups, lifting the trophy in 2015 and 2019. She also competed in four Olympic soccer tournaments, winning gold in 2008 and 2012 and bronze in 2021.

A forward who retired as the leading goal scorer in Major League Soccer history, Wondolowski played 17 seasons in the league between 2005-21.

They will be inducted into the NSHOF in Frisco, Texas on May 1, 2026.

There likely will be more inductees soon.

The alleged deal to use the Kennedy Center complex comes as ticket sales are reportedly declining after Trump's takeover

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

FIFA will reportedly use large parts of the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., displacing previously scheduled performers, even as the showpiece arts complex is reportedly struggling with sharply declining ticket sales following President Donald Trump's takeover of the institution earlier this year.

The soccer governing body will occupy multiple facilities for nearly three weeks that normally rent for tens of thousands of dollars per day in the lead-up to the December 5 World Cup draw there, The Washington Post reports, citing an August venue use agreement and Kennedy Center employees. 

The operation has reportedly forced big-name performers to relocate to other venues, including the National Symphony Orchestra. 

The Independent has contacted FIFA and the Kennedy Center for comment. 

In the eight months since Trump cleaned house at the Kennedy Center and installed himself as chair of its board ticket sales have reportedly plummeted nearly 50 percent.

Using the venue for the World Cup draw caps off months of FIFA president Gianni Infantino building goodwill with President Trump. 

In July, the president was on hand at New Jersey's Metlife Stadium to present a trophy to Chelsea, the winners of the FIFA Club World Cup. 

The following month, Infantino visited Trump in the White House, where the president was seen holding the golden World Cup winner's trophy, which the FIFA boss said was privilege only given to “the FIFA President, presidents of countries, and then those who win.”

The FIFA boss has also joined the many dignitaries who've publicly supported Trump's long-running bid to win a Nobel Peace Prize, writing in October that Trump “definitely deserves” the award for his efforts toward a peace deal in Gaza. 

FIFA has said it will unveil the winner of its own newly created peace price on December 5, the same day as the World Cup draw. 

Earlier this month, when asked if Trump would win the FIFA prize, Infantino left the door open to the possibility.

“On the 5th of December, you will see,” he told reporters.

FIFA also opened an office in New York City's Trump Tower this year.

The U.S., Mexico, and Canada will jointly host the 2026 men's World Cup.

Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski offered another compelling reminder of why they believe they are the team to beat at the 2025 Nitto ATP Finals on Friday evening in Turin.

The fifth seeds completed a flawless 3-0 sweep of the John McEnroe Group with a 7-5, 6-3 victory over already-eliminated Americans Christian Harrison and Evan King. Making their team debut at the prestigious season finale, Salisbury and Skupski remain the only unbeaten pair in the field entering semi-final Saturday.

Their 72-minute win also extended Salisbury's personal streak at the Nitto ATP Finals to 13 matches, following back-to-back titles with Rajeev Ram in 2022-23. The Britons are now level with Harrison and King at 2-2 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

“Joe seems to never lose in a group-stage match,” Salisbury said with a smile. “It's going really well, we're happy to get three wins. We've been through some difficult times this week, but we've managed to keep going.”

Although Salisbury and Skupski have yet to lift a trophy this season, they have reached five finals — including at Roland Garros and the US Open — and will take plenty of confidence into Saturday's all-British semi-final against top seeds Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool. They have surrendered just one set on their way to the last four.

“I think we just give it our all in every match,” Salisbury added. “We know it's going to be tough with all the best teams here, but there's something about this place that I feel good here and enjoy playing on this court.”







Harrison and King were hoping to become the first all-American duo to earn a win at this event since Mike Bryan and Jack Sock captured the title in 2018. But they were outmatched by Salisbury and Skupski, whose sharp volleying and dominant serving prevented them from facing a single break point, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

Carlos Alcaraz accepted his ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF trophy on Friday afternoon at the Nitto ATP Finals.

The Spaniard clinched the honour on Thursday evening when he defeated Lorenzo Musetti to move to 3-0 in round-robin play at the season finale. It is the second time he has achieved the feat (also 2022).

“It is a pleasure for me [being] the No. 1,” Alcaraz said. “Being the No. 1 of the world is something that I'm working really hard for with my team every day. It is a goal. But I think it is a journey that you're not going through alone. It's with your whole team, with your family, with your close people behind you always supporting you in the tough and good moments, which I'm really, really proud about: having such a great team.”

Alcaraz pointed out that when he first earned Year-End No. 1 honours in 2022, he had the same team. They have stuck together and continued to reap the rewards.

“I'm still really proud about the team I have right now,” Alcaraz said. “Some new members in the team that I'm really happy and proud to share this moment with them as well.  For me it's a great achievement. It means the world to me and I'm just really proud and happy.”

ATP Chairman Andrea Gaudenzi and Head of Corporate Brand and Strategic Advisory at PIF Mohamed Alsayyad presented Alcaraz the trophy.

The 22-year-old is chasing his first Nitto ATP Finals title. The Spaniard has booked his semi-final spot and will take on two-time champion Alexander Zverev or Felix Auger-Aliassime on Saturday.

But before returning his focus to the task at hand in Turin, Alcaraz thanked fans around the world.

“I want to continue because the support that I'm receiving everywhere that I'm going, I can't thank enough the people,” Alcaraz said. “We're traveling since the 1st of January until the end of November — new places, new countries, new stages and the people are always the same. The great energy, the great atmosphere, I feel the love everywhere that I'm going. 

“In some tournaments, in some matches without the support of the people it wouldn't be possible to come back, to win, to lift trophies. So I really want to say thank you for all the people who are coming to every tournament, to every match, that are supporting tennis, supporting myself. I'm really grateful for everyone for the energy and the love that I am receiving. This trophy is obviously for them.”

Alex de Minaur could only feel relief after scoring a much-sought after win at the ATP Finals on Thursday, a feeling that only got better when he officially qualified for the semifinals after Carlos Alcaraz's win over Lorenzo Musetti.Read more: Carlos Alcaraz clinches 2025 year-end No. 1 ranking after victory over Musetti at ATP FinalsDe Minaur confessed to being in a "very dark place" after losing to Lorenzo Musetti on Tuesday, in a match where he held match point, to drop to 0-2 this year in Turin, and 0-5 at the ATP Finals for his career. But after a 7-6(3), 6-3 win over Taylor Fritz, de Minaur said he found the silver lining in the clouds ahead of the match by making "peace" with whatever the result was.THE MODERATOR: Alex, congrats.

It's incredible.But more than anything, regardless of the result today, I had made peace with myself. That was a big, big moment. I knew the way I wanted to play.

Later, the Aussie added that his team and fiancée Katie Boulter were key in navigating the complex emotions he was feeling.Q. When did that making peace with yourself actually click in? Was it that night? Next morning? Did you have to be on your own completely? Even when you were in that 'dark place', did you reflect back on what you actually achieved this year? You're second only at the moment now to Alcaraz for match wins, lead the tour with hard court wins. If you could, reflect on that.ALEX de MINAUR: To be honest, I'm incredibly lucky with the support system that I have, the people I've got around me, every single one in my team, even Katie. They were able to, or they tried to, talk some sense into me and get me out of a very dark place.Sometimes when you're in that dark place, you make peace. You start to care less, right? Ultimately you can focus on other elements and not the results.For the first time in a long time, I forgot about the what if's, the results, what happens if I miss this shot, what happens if I lose this match. I just committed to the way I wanted to play from the first point to the last. A couple days ago I didn't. That's what hurt so much.Today I knew that no matter what, I wanted to be proud of my decision making, my aggressive mindset, and I wanted to go out there and try to win the match.

De Minaur will have to navigate an entirely different challenge as just the third Australian man to make the year-end semifinals up next. He is 0-12 against defending champion Jannik Sinner.

F1 fitness myths busted with Alex Albon

The Cooldown Room: F2's Luke Browning takes on a charades challenge

All 10 current Formula 1 teams will continue to sponsor a livery and driver in F1 ACADEMY, while Cadillac are set to join the all-female series as a sponsor from 2027.

F1 ACADEMY and Formula 1 have announced that all 10 current F1 teams have reaffirmed their commitment to sponsor a livery and driver in the all-female series as part of a multi-year partnership.

The Cadillac Formula 1 team, who will join F1 in 2026, have also confirmed that they will join the F1 ACADEMY grid as a sponsor from 2027.

This agreement not only reiterates the sport's deep commitment to increasing female participation in motorsport, on and off the track, but also reflects the rapidly expanding and highly competitive pool of drivers competing for a seat in the all-female F4-level series.

In addition, with a focus on deeper talent development, from 2027 drivers who have competed in the two previous seasons may be granted an exemption to race in the series for a third season, in accordance with the updated 2027 regulations.

This new provision reflects a tailored approach to nurturing talent and will be granted exclusively to drivers whose performance indicates strong potential for continued growth throughout a third campaign.

The news comes at a time of continued global growth for F1 ACADEMY. The series' brand platform has grown rapidly in the three seasons since its launch in 2023, with races broadcast in over 170 global territories, the seven-part documentary series on Netflix produced by Reese Witherspoon's production company Hello Sunshine, F1: The Academy, and a cumulative social audience across Instagram, YouTube, X and TikTok of 1.38 million.

Susie Wolff, Managing Director of F1 ACADEMY, said: “The commitment of long-term support from all 10 current Formula 1 teams, and the addition of Cadillac to our grid from 2027, sends a powerful message about the future of F1 ACADEMY.

“We're not just providing a platform for the current generation of female drivers; together, we're building a pathway to support generations of talent to come.

“We continue to be impressed by the depth of female talent coming out of the world of karting and are encouraged by the growth and strength of the emerging talent pool.

“A sharpened focus on individualised talent development, including the opportunity for drivers with high potential to compete in up to three seasons, will give standout drivers the support and platform needed to fully realise their potential, while ensuring that the F1 ACADEMY grid consistently features the very best female talent.”

F1 fitness myths busted with Alex Albon

The Cooldown Room: F2's Luke Browning takes on a charades challenge

With F1 The Movie's soundtrack up for three Grammy Awards, F1 is finding itself in the global spotlight yet again – making waves on screen, on stage, and far beyond the track.

F1 The Movie has been making headlines since its release earlier this summer, but now it's racing into entirely new territory – the Grammys. The film's official soundtrack has picked up not one – but three nominations at the 2026 Grammy Awards, including Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media and two songs for individual consideration.

Featuring a mind-blowing score composed by the legendary Hans Zimmer, and original music from artists such as Ed Sheeran, Doja Cat and Tate McRae, F1 the Album was designed to capture the energy and emotion of Formula 1, from the build-up before lights out, the rhythm of a flawless pit stop, and the release of emotion at the chequered flag in music. It's the first time F1 has featured at the Grammys – a sign of just how far the sport now reaches beyond the circuit on a race weekend.

But this isn't the first time F1 has caught the attention of the awards world. From Emmys and Laureus honours to BAFTA nods and even knighthoods, the sport and its stars have rightly been recognised well beyond the track...

For a sport where finding the right rhythm is everything, tensions build to stratospheric levels, and releases of intense emotion after a race are not uncommon, it's hardly surprising that the sport translates so naturally into music.

F1 The Movie's soundtrack, titled F1 the Album – produced by Apple Studios and Atlantic Records – is the perfect accompaniment to the film featuring Brad Pitt, Javier Bardem, and Kerry Condon. Hans Zimmer's cinematic orchestration blends flawlessly with contemporary artists, so every movie moment has a perfectly matching sound. As The Independent reported, Lewis Hamilton even played a hands-on role in shaping the album's global sound, championing diversity, and helping to select tracks and artists to reflect the sport's worldwide audience.

This resulted in recognition from the members of the Recording Academy, who put forward music from the album in three different categories. Tate McRae's hit Just Keep Watching is up for Best Dance Pop Recording and already has over 400 million streams on Spotify. Chris Stapleton's Bad As I Used To Be is nominated for Best Country Solo Performance, while F1 the Album is put forward for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media.

Back in June, Billboard's Top Movie Songs chart was dominated by the album, with seven of its tracks appearing in the top 10 – a clear sign of how strongly the soundtrack resonated with F1, music, and movie fans. The album's inclusion on the list marks F1's first appearance on a major Grammys shortlist, putting the sport in the same conversation as cultural hits Barbie and Oppenheimer.

Whether or not F1 The Album takes home a trophy, it's already made an impact on the sport – turning the sound of Formula 1 into something fans can blast over race weekends, play on a long drive, or simply to score their everyday lives.

If F1 The Movie took the sport to the big screen, Netflix's Drive to Survive brought it to living rooms all over the world.

Since its debut series in 2019, the Netflix docuseries has undoubtedly transformed F1's audience, pulling in millions of new fans into its captivating world. Its unique behind-the-scenes storytelling highlights, unseen garage moments, and intricate team politics – completely reshaping how viewers can connect with the sport.

The show's critical acclaim from fans has been matched by industry recognition. Since 2021, Drive to Survive has earned Sports Emmy nominations for Outstanding Documentary Series – Serialised every single year since its launch. With wins in 2022 and 2025, the show has certainly made a significant impact in the sports documentary industry.

It's no exaggeration to say the series helped shift the global image of motorsport too – and its countless Emmy wins and nominations simply confirmed what fans already knew: the drama of F1 never stops...

But it's not just Drive to Survive that has been recognised for its enthralling storytelling in the world of F1. Brawn: The Impossible Formula 1 Story on Disney+, another F1 documentary and narrated by Keanu Reeves, captured the imagination of fans and critics alike. Its vibrant retelling of Jenson Button's title winning 2009 season – when Ross Brawn's underdog team shocked the world in a fairytale season – earned an International Emmy for Best Sports Documentary.

Ron Howard's 2013 film Rush, which dramatised James Hunt's epic rivalry with Niki Lauda, was nominated for Best Film (Drama) at the Golden Globes and received BAFTA nods for its editing and sound design. The film, featuring Chris Hemsworth, Daniel Bruhl, and Olivia Wilde, remains one of the most critically acclaimed sports biopics of the modern era – and is still an entertaining watch over a decade later.

And in 2023, Villeneuve Pironi: Racing's Untold Tragedy, a feature documentary exploring the complex friendship turned rivalry between Ferrari drivers Gilles Villeneuve and Didier Pironi, won Best Feature Documentary at the International Motor Film Awards. The film was praised for its sensitivity, historical insight, and cinematic craft, highlighting how the real life drama of F1 can rival anything scripted when it comes to Hollywood thrills.

The 2010 documentary movie Senna which charted the life and career of F1 legend Ayrton Senna, also received plenty of accolades, as it won two BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) awards for Best Documentary and Best Editing.

And the Senna mini-series on Netflix was nominated for the highly prestigious Critics Choice Award in 2025 for the Best Foreign Language Series.

When it comes to sporting prestige, few honours carry the weight of the Laureus World Sports Awards – and F1 has featured prominently amongst its winners.

In 2022, Max Verstappen took home the coveted World Sportsman of the Year award after clinching his first World Championship title. Accepting the award, the now four-time champion said it topped off his whirlwind year.

“A big thank you to everyone voting for me from the Laureus Academy. It's been a very special year – a very hectic year because the pressure was always on. I couldn't do this without the team behind me and the people back at the factory,” he said at the time.

Just two years earlier, Hamilton shared the same title with football icon Lionel Messi – the first time in Laureus history that the award was jointly given.

It was a recognition of not only Hamilton's sixth world title at the time, but also of his influence beyond the track with his tireless work in diversity and environmental advocacy. The Brit also won the Laureus Breakthrough of the Year award in 2008 for his stellar 2007 rookie season where he finished runner-up in the Drivers' Championship.

Daniel Ricciardo followed Hamilton's footsteps, earning the Breakthrough in 2015 after his remarkable debut season with Red Bull. The late Niki Lauda was recognised a year later with the Laureus Lifetime Achievement Award, celebrating a career defined not just by his exceptional three World Championship titles, but by his infamous resilience, leadership, and extraordinary contribution to F1 on and off the track.

Teams have also shared the spotlight, with Mercedes winning Team of the Year in 2018 after a fourth-consecutive Constructors and Drivers' Championship double, while Brawn GP and Button were honoured in 2010 for their unlikely Championship wins.

The star power of Formula 1 has never burned brighter. From the latest Grammys nominations and Emmy wins to numerous red-carpet appearances and chart-topping soundtracks – the sport's reach is undeniably growing.

And as F1 continues to break new ground and extend into new fields and arenas, who knows what could be next. One thing's for sure: whether it's on the podium, a playlist, or the big screen, F1 isn't done collecting trophies just yet...

How do you best tell a tragic story that everyone already seems to know? For “Murdaugh: Death in the Family” star and executive producer Jason Clarke, you have a little fun with it. Well, with an asterisk. 

“I'll give it to you straight up: it's enjoyable being a narcissist,” Clarke said during a recent chat with IndieWire as part of our Pass the Remote panel series, presented in partnership with Disney, to celebrate the art and craft of TV. “It's enjoyable being a good ol' boy, you know what I mean? It's good to be the king! There's that whole side of it. Narcissism? I looked and thought about that a lot. A lack of empathy as well, ultimately. Which is where he truly ends up, with a lack of empathy. The man stands by his decision, I guess, in still not coming clean.”

In the miniseries, Clarke stars as convicted murderer Alex Murdaugh (complete with Southern accent and rusty red hair), infamous for killing his wife Maggie (Patricia Arquette) and son Paul (Johnny Berchtold) in 2021 following years of interfamily drama, trauma, and oops, yes, other mysterious deaths. For Clarke, tapping into Alex's most basic (and base) desires was key to unlocking his character.

 










During the panel, hosted by IndieWire's own Editor in Chief & Senior Vice President Dana Harris-Bridson, some of the limited series' cast and crew joined Pass the Remote to talk about their meticulously researched show and what they hope viewers get out of it. Clarke was joined by co-creator and executive producer Erin Lee Carr; co-creator, showrunner, and executive producer Michael D. Fuller; hair department head Katie Ballard; casting director John Papsidera; and makeup department head Addison Foreman.

And while Clarke was joking a bit about enjoying the process, Clarke clearly relished tapping into whatever it is that makes Alex tick and applying it to his performance. He also credited Ballard and Foreman for assisting that transformation, not just through their own craft work, but by similarly diving head-long into a journey through “absurdity and vulgarity.” And Will Ferrell outtakes?

“There's the mechanical way of going through that and processing it, and then there's the subconscious way of just doing it,” Clarke said. “I'll say, with Addison and Katie, we used to listen to what you could term narcissistic music and dance. … You have to stay happy! It's not easy being a full-time narcissist, it's a full-time job. Katie and Addison, who were in my space so much and were probably two of the only people I let into my space to see my absurdity and my vulgarity at times and my bad temper. … We'd do a lot of things, watch Will Ferrell to laugh, to get into, ‘fuckin' the plums, just drippin' down my chin!' You have to have the big thing, to go out and just think, ‘Fuck it! I'm just concerned about me!'”

“Murdaugh: Death in the Family” is now streaming on Hulu, with new episodes rolling out through Wednesday, November 19, when the series finale will start streaming.

The IndieWire Pass the Remote Winter Edition, presented in partnership with Disney, will celebrate the art and craft of TV through a series of panels rolling out through early December 2025. Check back here for more.

EXCLUSIVE: After breathing new life into high-profile IP like the Spider-Man franchise and Dungeons & Dragons, Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley are looking to boldly go where no directors have gone before with a very popular franchise. Sources tell Deadline, the duo are coming on to write, produce and are attached to direct a new original Star Trek film for Paramount. They will produce under their GoldDay banner.


	Plot details are being kept under wraps for now, but sources say Goldstein and Daley's film is a completely new take on the Star Trek universe and not connected to any previous or current television series, movie or prior movie development projects. That pitch falls in line with Skydance founder David Ellison's recent comments on an earnings call where he said the next Star Trek film would not be a sequel in the Chris Pine-led series but something different with new actors. While not confirmed, sources also add it's likely you also also see new characters being featured in this version.

	











	As for Goldstein and Daley, the two have shown a knack for not only delivering scripts with new and fresh takes on existing IP but adding a fun and lightness that differentiated them from other films in the franchise. Films like Spider-Man: Homecoming, which the two wrote, and the recent Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, which they also directed, earned strong marks from fans and critics alike for not only having strong stories but fun, witty humor that consistently is seen in their work and will be fresh for the Star Trek franchise.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Goldstein and Daley also have strong ties to both Paramount and Skydance on recent projects. Dungeons & Dragons was one of Paramounts best scored films from 2023 with a 91% from critics and 92% from audience members. As for Skydance, Goldstein and Daley recently wrote, produced and directed the original Cold War action comedy Mayday starring Ryan Reynolds. Sources say it has tested through the roof in early screenings for Skydance and Apple, with plans to release next year.


	Goldstein and Daley are repped by CAA, Fourth Wall Management and Hansen Jacobson Teller.

Great get for Paramount, and great get for Star Trek. If the movie's bad, something will have gone terribly wrong here.

Good luck. Original story, original characters, no existing fanbase? That's a tall order but it's better than yet another remake of Kirk and Spock. They're tired, let them rest!

Didn't they already do ‘light and goofy' with that first Abrams reboot?

All ahead at Full impulse! I hope this is a real attempt along with the GoldDay team understanding what Trek is and appreciation for what Trek means. Good Luck!

Now, these guys? These are guys that I trust to make Star Trek!

Jelly Roll is embracing a whole new chapter — and a whole new look — as he continues celebrating his incredible 200-plus–pound weight loss.

According to Jelly Roll's wife, Bunnie Xo, the “Son of a Sinner” artist has not had a clean-shaven face in more than a decade. What better time than now?

“I have been with my husband for going on 10 years now, and I have never seen this man without his facial hair,” Bunnie said in a video shared via Instagram on Thursday, November 13. “You guys know as women we get catfished, because we don't know what the hell's under there.”

Jelly, 40, joked that he might need plastic surgery for the loose skin left behind after losing weight.  

“We know we're gonna have to get some skin cut here, but we're trying to see if a face lift might be in order,” he said, tugging at his neck. 

Bunnie's reaction to her freshly-shaved husband was positive…mostly.

“Oh my god! Baby, it looks really good,” she said as he paused his shave halfway through to show her what he'd look like with a goatee. “Oh my god, the cop ‘stash is fire.”

Shortly after, however, Jelly — real name Jason DeFord — shaved it completely. 

“The total naked face…it's not terrible,” Bunnie said before bursting out laughing.

The country singer has lost more than 200 pounds through his journey, weighing in at under 300 pounds for the first time in his adult life. 

“I got fat, like, really, really young. I was over 300 pounds coming out of middle school. I'm gonna be under 300 pounds for the first time since middle school the night I walk to that ring at SummerSlam,” he told Stephanie McMahon on her “What's Your Story?” podcast earlier this year.

Bunnie wasn't the only one raving about her man's new look as fans took to the comment section to gush over the slimmed-down star. 

“You are THE most supportive woman on the planet. Everyone should take a note from you,” one follower praised the “Dumb Blonde” podcast host.

“Dudeeee he looks amazing, respectfully!!!” a second fan wrote. 

“Handsome no matter what (beautiful couple) but a goatee is a happy middle area,” another shared. 

“Unrecognizable in the best way omg!” a third follower responded. 

“Omg! He's looking so good! I'm so happy for you and him,” yet another reacted.

UPDATED: Donald Trump went after what he called “weak Republicans” for backing an effort to compel the Justice Department to release files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.


	Later, he said that he would be asking Attorney General Pam Bondi “to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him.”


	Trump posted on Truth Social on Friday, “The Democrats are doing everything in their withering power to push the Epstein Hoax again, despite the DOJ releasing 50,000 pages of documents, in order to deflect from all of their bad policies and losses, especially the SHUTDOWN EMBARRASSMENT, where their party is in total disarray, and has no idea what to do. Some Weak Republicans have fallen into their clutches because they are soft and foolish.”

	











	In asking for an investigation of Clinton, Summers and Hoffman, Trump wrote, “This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats. Records show that these men, and many others, spent large portions of their life with Epstein, and on his ‘Island.'”

	Earlier this week, backers of the effort to release the files secured the 218 votes needed to force a House vote. The petition has the support of four Republicans and all Democrats, with the House expected to take it up next week. That will put pressure on other House Republicans to vote in favor of the files release, with the expectation that there will be a number of defections.

	











	Trump has labeled the focus on the Epstein files a hoax orchestrated by the Democrats, while the White House has maintained that the president did nothing wrong. But Trump advocated for the release of the files during his presidential campaign last year.


	Earlier this week, Democrats released a series of emails from Epstein's estate that were obtained by the House Oversight Committee. The emails included one that Epstein wrote to Ghislaine Maxwell on April 2, 2011: “I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is trump.. [Victim] spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned.  Police chief. etc.     im 75 % there.”


	In another email, from Jan. 31, 2019, Epstein wrote to journalist Michael Wolff: “[Victim] mara lago. [identifier]. Trump said he asked me to resign, never a member ever. Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.”


	The punctuation appears as it as in the email documents released by the Oversight Committee.


	Republicans on the Oversight Committee responded by releasing 20,000 emails from the Epstein estate. They pointed to the redaction of the victim's name from the April 2, 2011 email. “Why did Democrats cover up the name when the Estate didn't redact it in the redacted documents provided to the committee? It's because this victim, Virginia Giuffre, publicly said that she never witnessed wrongdoing by President Trump.”


	In one of the emails that was released, Epstein wrote in 2015 that Clinton was “never ever” on the island, contradicting one victim's claim.


	Since the email release, Trump has avoided answering reporters' questions about Epstein. In his Truth Social post, Trump tried to shift attention to Democrats who have been associated with Epstein and said he was “not the Republicans' problem!”

He might as well release em even his cult members know what's up at this point.

Naturally being such a big hoax you would do everything in your power to block the release of the Epstein files.

If the Epstein files are released, it may have Trump, but it will also have Clinton and other powerful leaders and personalities from both sides. Clinton was best friends with Epstein.

Nobody is saying “Don't release them! We must protect Bill Clinton!” Nobody. Dems and a handful of Republicans alike want all the files released. Trump's defiance speaks volumes  And NOW he's calling on an investigation into others? Uhh, release the files. Or is that his way of preventing the files' release. Meaning, the DOJ won'tbe able to release them if there are active investigations going on.  

Oh amd Speaker Johnson saying that the Dems refused to vote is absurd. What they refused to vote on was anonymous voting. They want transparency on both the Epstein files release as well as the votes to release them. Why are the Republicans against being transparent?

How many time do we have to tell you we do not give an F. A everyone that was involved with Epstein needs to be investigated, period.

Reverse psychology.

“I'm not guilty, no not at all! Stop looking at Trump, Trump wasn't involved!”

Sure, Don.

Pop quiz, hot shot: What do “Cruel Intentions,” “A Colt Is My Passport,” “Night of the Hunter,” “Possession,” “The Faculty,” and “Vertigo” all have in common? Now that I think of it, at least two different things come to mind. The first is that they all should have spawned gratuitously sleazed out direct-to-video sequels that recast Amy Adams in the lead role and aired on Cinemax every other night for the entirety of my high school years (shout out to Roger Kumble, the James Mangold of Adrian Lynes). The second — and perhaps more broadly relevant — aspect that binds those movies together is that Hollywood is currently in the process of remaking each and every one of them.

Some, like Gareth Evans' “A Colt Is My Passport,” are already in the can. Others, like Robert Downey Jr.'s “Vertigo,” are still in the “ominous threat” stage of development. But regardless as to whether they're right over the horizon or still just percolating in a series of cursed email chains, each of these remakes is misbegotten for the same reason: They're all based on objective masterpieces. “But David,” you might say, “isn't one's response to art an inherently subjective experience?” To which I would simply reply: “You are in no way entitled to your own wrong opinion about a movie where Josh Hartnett, Clea DuVall, and Elijah Wood save their high school from salt-phobic aliens while swagged out in late '90s Tommy Hilfiger.” 

 










So I guess that's three things these films all have in common? Whatever, I'm not here to count — I'm here to lend my support to the ongoing argument that Hollywood needs to flip the script on its approach to remakes. In short: Leave good movies alone and devote the same attention to remaking bad ones instead. 

In slightly less short: Forget the IP that people love with all their might, and focus instead on the IP that people recognize against their will. Forego the classics that audiences feel protective towards, and target the short-fallers that are best remembered for their title. In an age where content is king and studios only exist to create shareholder value for their corporate overlords, executives have become so fixated on brand recognition that Disney would sooner bet $200 million — or more! — on another crack at “Tron” than give someone a fraction of that budget to try their hand at something new. The “Jurassic World” franchise notwithstanding, diminishing returns beget diminishing returns, and there's only so many times you can charge people top dollar for reheated leftovers of their favorite childhood meals before they lose their appetite altogether.

But. But! What if you served those same people fresh and completely reformulated versions of the processed garbage they slopped up as kids (or even as grown adults who'd been conditioned not to expect any better)? What if you took the scraps of processed nostalgia, the kind of food that people fondly recall but would never eat again by choice, and challenged today's most inventive chefs to reimagine them for an audience whose palette has been starved of flavor for so long that they've forgotten the taste of a hot meal? If the faint whiff of a memory is all that's motivating people to pay for these movies (as producers and consumers), wouldn't it be more prudent to improve upon the past rather than risk constantly reinforcing the idea that the present is so much worse? 

 










See: Edgar Wright's “The Running Man,” for example. Really, see it! It's not bad! Nor, um, is it a remake. Let's ignore that for a second. The movie — faithfully adapted from the Stephen King novel of the same name, and sharing almost nothing in common with the rancid Arnold Schwarzenegger version that first immortalized the book on film — is 100 percent a mulligan, in that I find it impossible to believe that Paramount would have spent nine figures on adapting this IP if not for the name recognition seeded by the previous take. It doesn't matter that “The Running Man” 1.0 isn't streaming anywhere, or that its limp TV satire of Reagan-era consumerism feels like ancient history, or even that our last remaining scientists are still trying to figure out how a movie featuring Yaphet Kotto, Jesse “the Body” Ventura, and homicidal ice hockey could still be so bland — the only thing that matters is that “The Running Man” as a three-word phrase has retained some vague and unquantifiable purchase over the last several decades. The casual pop consumer's brain recognizes it as “a real thing” in much the same way as the average executive's brain does, even if only by osmosis; for better or worse, it comes to both of them pre-installed with a credibility that original content has to earn on its own terms.

 










A credibility that endures without being hamstrung by any real association to quality. “The Running Man” faces strong headwinds thanks to mediocre reviews and stiff competition at the box office, but — unlike “The Roses,” “The Hand that Rocks the Cradle,” “Road House,” or any number of the actual remakes that have been foisted upon us in recent months —the film will at least be spared the indignity of being judged against the impossible standards of its predecessor. Even the people who love Schwarzenegger's “The Running Man” don't really like Schwarzenegger's “The Running Man,” which is what gave Wright license to stick closer to the source material while also cheating it forward to be more relevant to the modern world. 

In stark contrast to Hollywood's updated versions of “Robocop,” “Point Break,” and “The Day the Earth Stood Still” (to pick literally the first three movies that jumped to mind, all of them built on the reputations of unassailable classics), it's clear that Wright was committed to preserving the raw edges of his film's story rather than sanding them down, and even the least successful elements of his “Running Man” are strengthened by a sociopolitical anger that's rare to find in modern studio films of its size. Had the previous film made from King's book not been such an ineffective piece of satire, it's possible that a corporation as odious as Paramount Skynet — whose allegiance to The Network grows clearer every day — would never have rubber-stamped such an unambiguous “fuck you” to David Ellison's friends in our government. 

 










Of course, there are only so many bad movies that are ripe to be remade; only so many movies that are famous enough to feel like safe investments, but also flawed enough to guarantee that Hollywood executives will feel like creative geniuses for improving upon them. Hollywood has acted upon very few of them. David Lowery's “Pete's Dragon” is one obvious choice; Steven Soderbergh's “Ocean's Eleven” perhaps a slightly more contentious pick. 

Again, there's a reason why the movie that felt best-suited as a peg for this article isn't actually a remake, although I suppose I could have waited a few weeks for Sony Pictures' new “Anaconda,” which sounds like a perfect test for what I'm talking about despite being framed as more of a meta reboot; no one has any particular attachment to the original (much as I'd argue that no movie where Jon Voight gets swallowed alive by a giant snake could ever be considered truly bad), but its title carries an ineffable weight of some kind, and the comforting familiarity it triggers is deepened by the sense that a new “Anaconda” is more likely to build on our collective memory of the old one than to tarnish it. Typically, however, remakes have only been made as backhanded compliments by directors who've seen room for improvement in their own work: Think Alfred Hitchcock revisiting “The Man Who Knew Too Much,” or Michael Mann evolving “L.A. Takedown” into “Heat,” or Yasujiro Ozu turning “A Story of Floating Weeds” into just “Floating Weeds” (it's cleaner). 

 










More often, successful remakes have been created from beloved source material by people who had no previous relationship to it, but even these are few and far between. “Cape Fear.” “The Thing.” “Dawn of the Dead.” Many interesting attempts (“Nightmare Alley”) and most abominations (Rupert Wainright's “The Fog,” Len Wiseman's “Total Recall”) fall under this category. And then of course — with perhaps the highest hit-rate — there are those instances when people have seen the opportunity to rejigger a foreign-language film for an English-speaking audience (“The Departed,” “Sorcerer,” and Luca Guadagnino's “Suspiria,” which is not bad, as you might have mistakenly been led to believe, but in fact very good). At a time when most young people refuse to watch a video clip of Theo Von's podcast without having subtitles on, however, the transliteration model may not have the same currency that it once did (though widespread exposure to “Save the Green Planet!” is sadly not to blame for the underwhelming box office of “Bugonia”). 

Bad remakes of good movies are constant, bad remakes of bad movies are statistically non-existent, good remakes of good movies are almost impossible, and so — by process of elimination in an industry that only considers making original shit under extreme duress — good remakes of bad movies are Hollywood's greatest fount of untapped potential this side of video game adaptations and seeing what might happen if you gave Ridley Scott a kilo of cocaine. 

 










And the sooner the powers that be make this seachange in their thinking, the better. I mean, we simply cannot afford to do another “Starship Troopers” while millions of people on Twitter are still failing to grasp the point of the original. But a new “Hackers” where Jenna Ortega or whatever leads a team of roller-blading computer nerds who steal billions in ill-gotten crypto from the president's large adult sons? That's a hit. “Conspiracy Theory” for the era of virulent rightwing message boards? You wouldn't even have to recast Mel Gibson. “Romeo Must Die” with Andrew Koji and Junglepussy? I'm just saying things now. “Tango & Cash” but it's the Apple Dance and Tap-to-Pay? Amazing. Everyone knows the future is going to be bad. But given the most plausible options left available to us, perhaps it's possible that bad might be our best hope for something better.

Michael Duarte, who is known to his followers as ‘FoodWithBearHands,' tragically passed away, and his wife, Jessica, has now broken her silence. 

The news was initially announced on a GoFundMe created after Duarte's passing.

“It is with a heavy heart that we share the sad news that Michael Duarte passed away in a horrible incident on Saturday, November 8th during his travel in Texas. Michael's death occurred just 3 short days after he and his wife celebrated their 9 year wedding anniversary,” the page said.

Jessica posted a long message on her husband's social media page, paying tribute to the food influencer, while also sharing a photo of their family, as the two share a 6-year-old daughter named Oakley.

“l've struggled with what to do since his passing so I'm doing what feels right and that's sharing his stories. Whether they be about his content or Mike as my husband, daddy and friend to all,” she wrote. “I feel so touched and proud to know so many people that he has inspired over his time here on earth. I plan to keep his legacy going not only for him but his family.He gave everyone every bit of him so it's my turn to give it back. I'm not quite sure what that looks like yet but hopefully he will lead me on that path.

“Thank you to everyone who has reached out. The outpouring love has really given me strength. I can feel him moving mountains❤️ a big thank you to my tribe & Mike's BBQ community for making me feel like I have an army behind me. I'm still struggling with the fact that he is no longer with us but l'm starting to see his purpose was SO much bigger. I'm starting to see God work in mysterious ways that l've never experienced before and hoping that will bring our family some peace,” she continued. “We are working on arrangements for service and will provide more details when we have them.

“As for the media coverage surrounding his death, the false narratives are disheartening and disrespectful to the legacy of a wonderful man. This is an active investigation and I ask that all media and the public refrain from sharing unverified information,” she concluded. “Mike, I'm proud to be your wife and I will carry that title with honor for the rest of my life. See you on the other side, Daddy ❤️.”

Under the post shared by Jessica, many people left sweet comments, showing their support. 

“Love this! Great wifey to a great man ❤️,” o️ne person wrote.

“Powerful words ❤️,” another person commented. 

“Thinking of you all ❤️ beautifully said,” someone else said.

					By Mike Fleming Jr 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, Film


EXCLUSIVE: Atlas Entertainment and Ghost Machine have made a deal for a feature film adaptation of Redcoat,  the comic series written by Geoff Johns (Aquaman, The Flash). Redcoat's debut issue in April 2024 was an instant sellout, and the ongoing series has since been a bestseller for Ghost Machine and publishing partner Image Comics.  The film will be scripted by Johns, based on a story by Johns and Hitch.


	Producing are Charles Roven and Alex Gartner for Atlas Entertainment. 


	After a British deserter mistakenly gains immortality during the American Revolution, he is forced to face his cowardly past and fight against a sinister plot to destroy America. Reminiscent of the bombastic historical action in Pirates of the Caribbean and Indiana Jones, Redcoat pulls back the curtain of American History to tell the legend of the unknown hero. The comics are illustrated by Bryan Hitch (The Ultimates), colored by Brad Anderson, and lettered by Rob Leigh.

	“All great franchises are built on great characters and Redcoat's Simon Pure is one of them,” Gartner said. “Funny, charismatic, and lovably roguish, he anchors the IP fantastically.”

	Said Roven: “I have known Geoff Johns for many years and in some cases had a front row seat to his excellent work in the DC world. Johns and Hitch have formed a brilliant collaboration as writer and illustrator of the Redcoat comics, which have become a top-selling fan favorite. Redcoat is innovative comic material and ripe to become a tentpole.”

	











	Founded in October 2023, Ghost Machine is the first-of-its-kind creator-owned and operated media company which generates, adapts, and controls its fully owned universes of original characters and stories. Beyond Johns' Redcoat, his comic work for Ghost Machine includes the post-apocalyptic western Geiger and the sci-fi Rook: Exodus.


	Roven won the Best Picture Oscar for Oppenheimer, and he and Gartner are producing the Amazon MGM Studios films Mercy, starring Chris Pratt, Rebecca Ferguson, Kali Reis and Annabelle Wallis for early 2026, and are in production on the Michael B. Jordan-directed reimagining of The Thomas Crown Affair for 2027 and the sequel to the Road House reboot with Jake Gyllenhaal reprising for an Amazon Prime Video release.

EXCLUSIVE: The first image from Danny Boyle‘s next film Ink has been unveiled featuring Jack O'Connell in his role as Larry Lamb, former editor of The Sun. The film is a co-production between Studiocanal, Media Res and House Productions and also stars Guy Pearce as Rupert Murdoch as well as Claire Foy. Studiocanal set to launch worldwide sales at AFM this week and will co-represent domestic sales with WME Independent.


	The film is based on the Tony-nominated play by multi-Olivier award-winning playwright and screenwriter James Graham. Graham has written the screenplay with production now underway. The film is an explosive cinematic rollercoaster about a group of visionaries and misfits who had an idea for a new kind of news — one that would give the people what they want and would change the face of the world we live in today. James Graham, who penned the original play, has adapted the screenplay with plans to shoot this October.

Shakira and her sons made a rare red carpet appearance together on Thursday, attending the “Zootopia 2” premiere in Los Angeles. 

The trio made a colorful statement in coordinated lavender outfits. Milan, 12, and Sasha Piqué Mebarak, 10, twinned in custom purple tuxedos with matching bow ties and bright white sneakers while mom, Shakira, wore a high-neck, long-sleeve dress in the same hue, featuring an asymmetric hemline with a high left leg line that revealed strappy purple satin heels below.

Her long hair was in a high ponytail with two strands framing her face.

The singer is finishing up her “Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran” tour, which began last February and ends on Dec. 11.

Shakira doesn't frequent red carpet events, so it's particularly sweet that she not only brought her sons but also coordinated all their high-fashion looks for the family-friendly screening.

Last year, she shared that taking her sons to “Barbie” was a bust, saying that they “absolutely hated” it. 

Hopefully, “Zootopia 2” was more of a hit.

Heather Gay is pulling back the curtain on every cosmetic procedure, beauty treatment, and glow-up moment she's invested in — and she's not holding anything back. As “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” continues airing season 6, the 51-year-old reality star is opening up about her long journey with injectables, surgery, weight loss medication, and the costs behind her transformation.

In a new article published by Bustle on Wednesday, Nov. 13, Gay shared the full number she estimates she's spent on her appearance: at least $200,000. And as she put it, it was “worth every penny.”

The RHOSLC star told Bustle that investing in her appearance became part of her job once she joined reality TV, and she approached it with full honesty. “As soon as I had the money and the time, I thought: ‘I am going to try to profit from every single thing that's available to me. I can afford it, and it's part of my job now to look good,'” Gay said. “I always said that I'd be so much cuter if I were richer. I'm richer now — and I'm so much cuter because of it.”

Gay, who co-owns Beauty Lab + Laser, shared that she has been getting Botox quarterly since her 30s. She also regularly maintains fillers, facials, and twice-a-year laser hair removal. Her lip filler routine has remained consistent for around seven years, and she has also incorporated Sculptra — a collagen stimulator — into her regimen.

“Another treatment I get is Sculptra, which is a collagen stimulator, with big long needles on your face. It's pretty intense, but it's not an actual filler; it's just a filler stimulant,” Gay told Bustle. “Sculptra is $800 to $1,000 for a vial, and some people get four to six vials. It can cost around $4,000 per treatment.”

Gay also revealed she underwent two nose jobs before joining “The Real Housewives” in 2020, along with a blepharoplasty. “I got both of these surgeries for free, from the same surgeon, but I think the nose job was around $12,000, and a blepharoplasty was $2,500,” she shared.

She added that her then-husband, Frank William “Billy” Gay III, paid for a “mommy makeover” — a tummy tuck and breast augmentation — before their 2014 divorce.

Gay explained that over the past three years she has lost 30 pounds using weight-loss medication and continues to use GLP-1s as needed. She estimates the treatment costs at least $500 a month. To finish her “fourth season glow-up,” the RHOSLC star invested around $30,000 in veneers, explaining that looking “perfect” is seen as part of the job in reality television.

“I think there should be no shame in people wanting to change the way they look, but I also see that the standard of beauty has become more and more artificial for women,” Gay told Bustle. “Being on TV, it's really, really hard to see yourself constantly and to be amongst women who are physically flawless in every way.”

“Everyone has perfect teeth, lashes, and hair,” she said. “It's what I call the required uniform of a Housewife — and as you become more of a Housewife, it becomes more entrenched.”

New episodes of “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” air Tuesday nights on Bravo.

All three episodes of season 1 of “Surviving Mormonism with Heather Gay” are now streaming on Peacock.

When filmmaker Alex Bush received their acceptance to Ari Aster and Lars Knudsen's Square Peg Social (SPS), something shifted. “Just being accepted felt like a huge weight of confidence,” said Bush, whose short film “Thaw” premiered at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival. “It was really affirming to be spoken to by these people in this way of, ‘Yeah, so you as someone who's going to be doing this and who's already doing this.'” You're already doing this is the shift from feeling adjacent to the industry to being recognized as part of it. That can make SPS sound like ruby slippers — You've always had the power, my dear!  To the naked eye, they did and do; the 35 selected SPS filmmakers are uncommonly accomplished. Eli Raskin produced Doechii's Grammy-winning world tour. Haley Johnson recently produced “Obsession,” the horror pic that premiered at TIFF and was acquired by Focus Features. Sally Oh won a Grammy for her work on Beyoncé's “Black Is King.” Alexandre Singh & Natalie Musteata just won AFI Fest's Grand Jury Prize for “Two People Exchanging Saliva,” a short they're now adapting as their debut feature. Nigerian-American filmmaker Boma Iluma is a director for “The Chi.” Hawaiian filmmaker Oz Go founded Narrative Lost, a nonprofit studio making socially engaged films; his short “Antyesti” made the rounds with SPS mentors as each asked the other, “Have you seen this?!” “Roofman” producer and SPS mentor Alex Orlovsky said the filmmakers' accomplishments were startling. “There's [Jamie Hawkesworth]. He's like, “I made a short film.' Oh, who shot it? ‘Robbie Ryan.' I was like, ‘Oh. How'd you do that?' ‘He liked my book of photography.'” Orlovsky chuckled. “I said, ‘Yes, you must be a good photographer.' And there's [Wesley Wang], who was a senior at Harvard who had made a viral short (“nothing, except everything.”) and then had a script, and he's like, ‘I got to go back to school.' Whoa. That's crazy. But awesome. And I'm super curious to read the guy's script.” (Take a look at the full list of participants below.) However, all of that goes to show at least two things: A significant degree of the event's success stemmed from Lars and Amy Knudsen's calibration of who should attend, as filmmakers and mentors, to ensure it held value for everyone. And, impostor syndrome is as universal to the human experience as oxygen. Recognizing that and learning how to move beyond it is essential because, as Lars noted in his opening remarks, confidence creates momentum. And momentum makes films.

SPS brought 26 writer-directors and 9 producers to Austin in late October for four days with 27 industry mentors. (Mentor list, here.) Co-hosted by Square Peg partner Ari Aster and the Knudsens, the event deliberately avoided conventional outcomes: no pitch meetings, no development sessions, no financing goals. The gathering challenged what Grant Conversano identified as “the Sundance myth of ‘You're going to submit, then you're going to get in, and it's like everything's on wheels after that,'” a mythology that creates “a certain selfishness.”  Instead, SPS emphasized community over competition. It operated on the theory that bringing together excellent mentors and impressive filmmakers to share the unvarnished good and bad of their experiences would produce its own value. The mentors' candor about failures, mistakes, and “very bad experiences” created what participants described as uniquely productive conversations. But what did the filmmakers themselves take away? What was worth the application fee and four days in Austin?

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






The application fee was $150, although some paid less if they applied earlier. For Joshua Locy, whose his first feature “Hunter Gatherer” debuted at SXSW in 2016, the cost felt substantial. “So many of my shorts, all these things, and they're all like fucking 70, 80 bucks,” he said. “I've spent thousands of dollars on submissions with a 10% success rate, something like that.”

 










He nearly didn't apply, but when he saw an extended deadline he thought there was lower interest and he stood a better shot. “I was like, fuck it, I'm going to do it.” (Later, he learned deadline extensions are standard practice.) The application itself asked for passion over polish. “They said, write a cover letter, be passionate. We're not looking for perfection. And I just fucking unloaded. I didn't even reread it. I just sent it. It took five minutes to write the letter.” Nearly 1,800 people applied. Thirty-five were selected.

The advice that landed hardest was often the simplest. “Trust your gut. It's incredible how often that comes up,” Bush said. “That's how a lot of these people who've had lasting careers, it seems, operate.” Bush described watching their own past work validate this principle: “When we look at even the careers we've had so far, that's true. It's that innate feeling when you're working on something you're like, ‘Oh, there it is.' Those are the ones that work out. The ones that you kind of force and maybe don't listen to the gut tension, tend to lead you astray.” Bush also emphasized the importance of ensuring everyone involved is “talking about the same thing” from the beginning, particularly “when you're really getting into the nitty gritty with the more complicated people who are not just in it for the spirit.” Translation: Your financier might love your project. They also might also think it's a completely different movie than the one you're making. Better to find that out early.

For Locy, who has worked in film for 20 years as a commercial production designer, Square Peg Social functioned differently. “For me, it's been like a chiropractic realignment,” he said. “It's just like, ‘Wait, the things you're doing are worthy and they're looking for unique projects.'” After years of pitching on IP-based projects that never happened, hearing Searchlight president Matthew Greenfield discuss how decisions actually get made proved revelatory. “I take a project to a studio or to my manager, whatever, and I hear things like, ‘There's no foreign sales' or ‘There's no value in the actor,' whatever. So then I think my problem is foreign sales.” But Greenfield reframed it entirely: “We think that their brains are operating on spreadsheets, but they're reacting humanly and viscerally to what they're hearing. And maybe at some point that gets trickled down to us as foreign sales but he's saying, ‘No, it's not about that.'” The insight shifted Locy's entire approach. “I don't need to worry about fucking foreign sales. I don't need to worry about algorithms that decide what a value of a project is. I need to worry about my voice and the story I'm trying to tell. That's what's important.” Which is both liberating and terrifying. Because it means the work is actually about the work.

 










Brothers Grant and Adam Conversano arrived feeling the uncertainty many emerging filmmakers share about traditional paths. “I think people are collectively feeling like that old path is disappearing,” Grant said. “And I think what's been great about this weekend is it's presenting a road forward for people in our generation. We're just forging ahead and doing it.”

 










They brought with them advice from filmmaker Ira Sachs, who had seen their short film: “You don't need to get into another lab, you need to find a producer. You get a budget, you get an actor. Do not waste your time for a year applying to applications and waiting around. You need a producer, an actor, and some money. And if it's not a lot of money, do that. But don't sit around waiting.” That urgency — just make the thing! — came with crucial caveats about sustainable budgets. As Grant noted, “The story and the scope of the project has to match the resources. I've worked on features where they may be trying to do too much for too little and just driving people into the ground. And that's not great for anyone. I think that people don't want to do that anymore.” The Conversanos also valued what Adam called “mentorship and face-to-face passing of experience and information that's only possible. Mentorship is just another layer of encouragement and belief that you can do this: ‘I've done this and I'll support you through that.'” Keep Writing (Even When Nothing's Getting Made) Grant Conversano took away the importance of “just keep writing and not get too concerned with when any particular script is getting made. Hearing Ari say ‘I had four or five scripts I've been working on for years before he even got Hereditary made' was big.” He also emphasized starting wherever possible: “If you don't know a lot of people and you feel like the industry's really far away, just start somewhere. I started as an extra, then worked as a PA. You have to be useful to other people for some amount of time and put in the time. We've been working for 10 years, just to be clear.”

Perhaps most telling was Locy's observation about finding common ground across experience levels: “You kind of always have to start over. You always have to reinvent yourself. I made — for the first time in my life, really — a short film last year where I was like, I have to make something. I have to pierce through this diaphragm somehow.” He continued: “I may have more contacts and networks and this or that, but at the end of the day, we're all just trying to make our movie and it's impossible until it's not.” That impossibility fuels what Locy described as essential: “There's a certain mental severity, I guess. This clarity and severity and focus that wanes and waxes as good news, bad news happens, or money is here, money is gone. It is just like life happens that hope and faith that comes and goes.” When asked if he'd ever reached a point where he'd consider giving up on features, Locy was definitive: “I don't know what that means. There's no way I could live my life without the hope of making something.” Locy also described what drove him to make his first film over a decade ago: “‘No one's ever done this movie before. This has never existed before and it's going to exist.' That was enough.” It's still enough.

 










What Square Peg Social offered wasn't formulas or shortcuts, but something more fundamental: confirmation that the struggle is shared, that intuition matters, that starting over is normal, and that the community exists if you can find it.  As Bush put it, the goal was understanding “how development is really working and how relationships are really built that lead to that type of work” and “to feel like we're in this together and we can keep helping each other and really set those relationships.” The $150 bought entry to that conversation. What filmmakers took away was permission to trust themselves within it. And in an industry that often runs on desperation, that shift from fear to momentum might be the most practical tool there is.

	With her nose ring, blue hair streaks, and tattoos that extend from her shoulders to her fingertips, DJ Tori is, in the words of her boss, “every guy's fantasy of what a rock chick would look like.” In that regard, she's the logical personality to crank Pearl Jam, Shinedown, or Stabbing Westward songs during her overnight and weekend shifts at a hard-rock radio station in Hiawatha, Iowa.


	Every so often, Tori will mispronounce the name of the vintage alt-rock band Live — so that it rhymes with “give” — or talk about a pairing of artists and say “feat” instead of “featuring.” But her listeners and her station, KFMW Rock 108, just roll with it, since DJ Tori isn't likely to get fired anytime soon. From her image to her voice, she's an entirely AI creation.


	AI continues to infiltrate the music business: Fake photos of aging rockers in hospitals flood Facebook, artificial bands like Velvet Sundown are streaming on Spotify, and a computer-generated R&B artist, Xania Monet, has a song that's charting. Radio — especially nonsatellite terrestrial stations in whatever city or town you live — is now becoming the next artificial frontier. And depending on whom you ask, AI radio will either ramp up the wattage in a struggling medium or imperil jobs, livelihoods, and the long-standing rapport between listeners and DJs. “The one thing they haven't straightened out is the cadence and how we speak,” says Frankie Ross, a longtime DJ currently at the Wave in Los Angeles. “But AI is learning every day, and once they get that worked out, there will be a lot of people out of work long term. It may come down to all the DJs on the air will be AI jocks.”

	











	DJ Tori, which launched last year, is just one of many examples of the way AI has begun creeping into radio or radio-like sites. On Spotify, DJ X roams your queue and compiles playlists and patter aimed at your listening habits. Last year, Will.i.am launched RAiDiO.FYI, an interactive app with 10 music channels and AI hosts who can “converse” with listeners on a variety of topics. “I don't want to render radio obsolete, because you still need traditional radio,” Will.i.am tells Rolling Stone. “We still need humans telling human stories. We still need improv and human banter on what's happening in a city. But you also need the new. On traditional radio, one person could talk to the host at a time. With our radio, you can have 1,000 conversations at the same time about one segment.”

	Last month, radio industry veterans announced the startup of SonicTrek.ai, where AI versions of genre experts will play and talk about classic rock, country, alternative rock, or current hits, with geographically oriented playlists to boot. Those hosts' voices will also chat about local weather and businesses. “We're not trying to pull the wool over anybody's eyes,” says SonicTrek.ai co-founder Mike Agovino. “We wear AI on the sleeve from the get-go. We will deliver talent and content that can interact with listeners on a one-to-one basis, and do it 24/7, 365 days a year, with unlimited endurance. You could never do that with live air talent. You could never have the audience interacting all day long, talking about artists, eras of music, best albums ever, whatever the topic or format might be. That's an element radio has really lost.”


	In the past few decades, the once-mighty radio world has increasingly had to deal with declining revenue, layoffs (at leading companies like iHeartRadio and Audacy), and the advent of voice tracking, in which DJs in one city pretape segments in another, thus saving the companies dollars. The advent of AI has rattled the radio community even further. In a document shared with Rolling Stone, Audacy — which owns more than 200 stations around the country — asked an undetermined number of on-air employees to sign a contract that would give the company the rights, “in perpetuity,” to create “a computer-generated electronic representation or digital replica that is readily identifiable as the voice or visual likeness of Employee,” among other things. Audacy declined to comment, but according to a source close to the situation, it is “not the company's policy to clone or replicate a talent's voice without their permission, and the company has no plans to do so without their specific permission.” (SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents disc jockeys as well as actors, singers, dancers, and other performing professionals, declined comment on the matter.)

	AI is “gimmicky right now, but it's on its way to becoming a threat,” says one veteran DJ who, like many contacted by Rolling Stone, would only speak anonymously for fear of reprisals. “Until people start legitimately losing jobs, they're just putting it in the background of their minds. But when you focus on it, it's really scary.”


	SEVERAL YEARS AGO, HUDSON HOTT, then a leading DJ at the L.A. rock station Alt 98.7, received an unsolicited letter offering to turn her personality and traits into AI versions. She never followed up, but others saw the potential. The generally acknowledged first AI DJ launched two years ago, when Ashley Elzinga, a jock at a station in Traverse City, Michigan, was approached about replicating her voice with AI for KBFF in Portland, Oregon. After being reassured that the technology wasn't meant to replace her — “it was just meant to enhance what we were doing,” she says — Elzinga signed on.

	











	With the help of RadioGPT from Futuri, a leading AI content company, Elzinga began reading prompts and was asked questions by the company's software. “It was kind of intense,” she says. “It wanted to hear the inflection of my voice and my personality, and it started to generate who I was. From there, it was about fine-tuning each inflection and how I say words. My first reaction was, ‘Why does it sound like that?' And they had to tell me, ‘You have a Michigan accent.' It was a bit of a shock.”


	When AI Ashley debuted in the summer of 2023  — during a midday show, with both the real and AI Elzinga sometimes on the air at the same time — Elzinga says she knew she might get “bloodied up” as the first pioneer, and she wasn't wrong. “You can't replicate the human touch and spontaneity,” says Hott. “When I was doing my show in Los Angeles and we had an earthquake, I was live on the air, and the building was shaking and I'm screaming. For anyone driving in their car, we were all experiencing that together. AI Ashley is going to keep talking.” But when AI Ashley gave away tickets to a Portland concert, those tuning in didn't seem to mind. “They were excited, like they were talking to a radio personality,” says Elzinga. “They were like, ‘I got through and won something.' They thought it was cool.”


	The same company that worked on AI Ashley also reached out to Russ Mottla, program director at Iowa's KFMW Rock 108, who was intrigued and heard a sample of how a female AI jock could sound. “The first attempts were awful,” he says. “She was very robotic.”


	But after some tweaks, DJ Tori — name courtesy of Mottla — improved and premiered last year, spewing factoids about bands and records and spouting saucy banter. “I wasn't delusional about it,” Mottla says. “Is it ready to be prime time? It's not. But it gave us the opportunity to talk about something everybody's talking about — ‘We have an AI DJ too' — and make promos making fun of her. As far as our audience is concerned, we're on a new trend. Some people like it. Some people don't. But we're claiming the position, as they say.” A local gun shop, Midwest Shooting, became an on-air sponsor and even hosted an appearance by DJ Tori in the store — a photo of “her” attached to a mannequin. As Mottla insists, “We're not hiding anything from the audience. We're having fun with it.”


	In their defense, those who've turned to AI or are experimenting with it on radio argue that it's a remedy for companies and stations that use pretaped or syndicated shows during off hours or can't afford overnight DJs. Before DJ Tori took over “her” slot, that time period on Rock 108 featured music and commercials but no DJ. “There are fewer and fewer shifts done live,” says veteran New York-area DJ Dennis Elsas, who hosts shows on SiriusXM and WFUV, a noncommercial public station. “More often than not, the overnight time after midnight is pretaped.”

	











	SonicTrek.ai's Agovino insist his fledgling company's goal, once it gets up and running, isn't to “replace the successful midday jock” but to instead focus on local stations in smaller markets that use satellite feeds or voice tracking to fill up their airtime. “We built this as a strategy for radio stations that have, for whatever their rationale was at the time, drifted away from live and local,” he says. But says another longtime DJ who spoke anonymously in response to SonicTrek's plans, “Smaller cities do use syndicated programs or don't have anyone new to do [shifts], so that's not new. But as the technology improves and as the standards lower over time, we're not far away from something like that being on major stations. It's very upsetting.”


	“They should be freaked out,” Will.i.am says of those in radio who fear the coming of AI. “Because if AI is doing something that a human can do, then why does that have to exist? Only use AI with traditional radio if you cannot execute it with humans.”


	At the same time, others in the industry feel that concerns about the death of the traditional human DJ are premature. “The audience is way more perceptive about subtle changes in personality than you might think,” says talent agent Paul Anderson of Workhouse Media, which represents numerous podcast and radio hosts. “People develop real relationships with their favorite personalities. And when you spend multiple hours a day listening to them while stuck in traffic, you can pick up on all those subtle intonations. If people find out that the storytelling is being done by an AI bot trying to replicate a known personality, the whole thing will fall apart.” Even Mottla, DJ Tori's human boss, acknowledges that: “I can see the guys in the corner offices drooling over this, but people bond with DJs. You can't create that with AI.”

	Some in the radio world took comfort when AI Ashley was yanked from the air earlier this year. According to Dylan Salisbury, the Portland program director overseeing the project at the time, AI Ashley didn't result in “any dramatic lifts or decreases” in ratings. But he felt the time had come to wrap it up after two years. “I think the experiment ran its course,” says Salisbury. “We put it on the air, we were called every name under the sun and stood by what we did, and we got our peers [other stations] to buy into it, at least in some form. I'm glad we tried it. But I don't know if, moving forward, an AI DJ is going to have a place on radio. As a society, we like AI but not when it comes to human connection.”

	











	Then again, no one denies how fast the technology is moving, and how “much more likelife,” in Agovino's words, AI voices now sound. That applies to DJ Tori too. “She sounds so much better now than when she first started,” Mottla says. “If they can make this kind of progress in 24 months, I can't imagine what it's going to be like in another two years.”

Simone Biles is speaking out about why she's choosing to share her plastic surgery journey with so much transparency. The seven-time Olympic gold medalist, who made it to the semi-finals and placed fourth with Sasha Farber on season 24 of “Dancing With the Stars,” revealed in a People exclusive published November 13, 2025 that she has “no shame” about her procedures.

Back in October, the superstar gymnast shared a TikTok video where she listed the alterations she's made to her appearance so far: a breast augmentation, a lower blepharoplasty to smooth her under eyes, and an earlobe surgery to fix the damage caused by an earring being “ripped out” in the past.

Now, she's opening up about the importance she places on sharing openly about her journey. Read on for details.

The 28-year-old told People in the new interview, “Social media is not real, so that's why I try to be as transparent as possible. She said her decision was inspired by the tendency to open social media and question how everyone looks so good, and that she places importance on sharing both the good and the bad parts of her cosmetic journey. She revealed getting Botox on her 27th birthday was something she didn't love, saying, “I had a floating eyebrow and everyone was asking what that was.”

Simone also talked about the value she places on being relatable. “Seeing me win medals at the Olympics, that's not relatable. But what is relatable is how we feel about ourselves, what we talk about, what we go through and how we share openly, honestly,” she told the mag, adding its the reason she opted to get so candid in the revealing TikTok post.

She also emphasized that the surgeries weren't a result of disliking the way she looked or felt. “It's just something that I notice obviously a little bit more because I live in this body, I'm just so used to it,” she said.

take your guesses 👀

Following in Simone's footsteps on the dance floor is her Olympic teammate, 24-year-old Jordan Chiles. Chiles was at Simone's side as the team took the silver medal at the Tokyo 2020 games (which were held in the Summer of 2021), and the friends shared the worldwide stage once again at Paris 2024.

While being interviewed after her week 2 jive to the song “Maniac” with her partner Ezra Sosa on One-Hit-Wonders night, Chiles told E! News, “One of my teammates Simone, she texted me and was like, ‘Girl, you killed it.' I was like, ‘Period. Oh, thank you.' I love being able to understand they are supporting me the same way I support them.”

Chiles and Sosa will dance in the semifinals of “Dancing With the Stars” season 34 on Tuesday, November 18 at 8 p.m. E.T. on ABC. The show also airs live on Disney+. 

Competing against Chiles and Sosa in the semifinals will be Alix Earle and Val Chmerkovskiy, Whitney Leavitt and Mark Ballas, Steve Irwin and Witney Carson, Dylan Efron and Daniella Karagach, and Elaine Hendrix and Alan Bersten.

	There's an old internet adage often incorrectly attributed to Nintendo guru Shigeru Miyamoto that goes, “A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad.” Although it's not a genuine quote, the oft-used meme does mostly align with what fans perceive to be the Mario creator's sensibilities — do it right, even if it takes a while.


	What's funny is that Nintendo isn't really known for substantial delays. Famously, the company's creatives have been blunt when it comes to explaining why beloved series like Star Fox and F-Zero have remained on ice for decades at a time: They just don't know what to do with them. Compared to Rockstar or  Ubisoft — hell, most of the industry — it paints a clear picture that if you've even heard of a Nintendo game's existence, it's probably pretty far along in its development cycle.


	Then came Metroid Prime 4. Initially announced way back in 2017 — the same year that the Nintendo Switch launched — the long-awaited sequel to 2007's trilogy capper made a big splash as one of the then-new console's most anticipated titles. But afterward, there was nothing. Two years later, after the internet worked itself into a tizzy, Nintendo officially confirmed that development on the game wasn't up to their standards.

	











	In a shocking twist, the work was going to be restarted from scratch under the eye of Retro Studios, creators of the first three Prime games who had previously handed over the reins to Bandai Namco. The whole thing felt decidedly un-Nintendo-like.

	











	Now, another six years later, the game is nearing completion and is set to launch on Dec. 4 for both Switch and its successor, Switch 2. But after all this time, could it ever live up to the impossible expectations the prolonged delay set in motion? Rolling Stone recently attended a preview event in New York City to go hands-on with Metroid Prime 4's early areas, and the most realistic answer is “maybe?”


	Based on the roughly one-hour demo, here's what we know.

	First released for the GameCube in 2002, and recently remastered in 2023, Metroid Prime reimagined the previously 2D-designed series (that itself kickstarted a whole subgenre) as a fully 3D first-person shooter with a heavy emphasis on exploration. Metroid Prime 4 is technically the sixth installment of the sub-series, which now has as many entries as the mainline games.


	The Prime series are interquels wedged neatly between the original 1986 NES game and 1991's Metroid II for Game Boy. They follow the legendary bounty hunter Samus Aran (who, honestly, doesn't pick up that many bounties) on her continuous missions to aid the Galactic Federation in their ongoing conflict with the Space Pirates. Prime 4 picks up after the trilogy and its handheld spin-offs Hunters (2006) and Federation Force (2016), with the latter two mostly chalking up to footnotes except for the inclusion of the new game's main antagonist, Sylux.


	The demo starts at the very beginning of the game, and is the same content previously shown at the Switch 2 reveal event and other previews. This section sees Samus arriving at a Galactic Federation station to help combat an invasion of pirates led by Sylux, who is seeking a mysterious relic.


	This introductory portion is entirely on-rails, ushering Samus room to room for small incursions while serving as a basic tutorial for her combat abilities and Morph Ball rolling. In most Metroid games, Samus is a loner; the series itself was inspired by Ridley Scott's Alien (1979), meaning that the bounty hunter generally sees herself stranded on an alien planet to survive. Occasionally, certain games will give her support from NPCs via comms, but rarely is she engaging in squad-based warfare.

	That expectation is immediately upended by Prime 4, which similarly to 2007's Prime 3, throws Samus into action alongside space marines for all-out battle. But being a superpowered Amazonian type, towering over the solders in height and physical prowess, she's seen more as a messianic savior than just another grunt.

	











	After this brief sequence that ends in a relatively easy boss fight, the demo jumps ahead past a bunch of exposition and story set up (all of which are under wraps at Nintendo's request). The bulk of the preview takes place on another planet in a region called Fury Green. This lush jungle environment is pretty different from anything seen in other Metroid games, which may have had biomes with vegetation and foliage, but never to this degree.


	It's here where the first genuine look at Metroid Prime 4's gameplay can be gleaned — and it's very familiar. As is the case with all Metroid titles, Samus loses all her high-end abilities from the opening section somewhere between the start and Fury Green. Left with just a base skillset, players will need to explore the labyrinthine world looking for upgrades and tools to use. In Metroid Prime 4, they're mostly based on new psychic powers.


	Like in Prime games past, the first-person perspective allows players to comb the world using a scanning visor, which highlights pertinent information and clues on where to go next. In Prime 4, this is augmented by a Psychic Visor which, paired with the Psychic Glove, lets Samus see invisible trails and objects and manipulate them with a form of telekinesis.


	It mostly works for puzzles; simple ones include unlocking doors with specific sliding nodes, with more complexity coming later as Samus can guide a Control Beam blast through the air like a remote drone. The preview culminates in a big boss fight wherein Samus must whittle away at the plant-like foe's armor then guide her psychic shots into its weak points.


	It's a cool gimmick but doesn't entirely feel revolutionary. In fact, that's an issue that pervades the entirety of the demo.


	In the years since Metroid Prime 4 was originally announced, a lot has changed in gaming. Not only did the entire life cycle of the Switch (its intended home platform) pass by, but first-person shooters and exploration games have evolved. Open world titles like Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018) and a wave of action-RPGs have broadened the horizons on what exploration looks like in modern gaming. In that regard, Prime 4 feels simplistic — though to be fair, the demo only encompasses an early slice of the whole experience. But even by Metroid standards, the areas in Fury Green are extremely linear.

	











	In the series' best entries, like Super Metroid (1994) and the first Prime, players are dropped into sprawling worlds that are mazelike in their design. Filled with competing routes, dead ends, and challenges to return to later, there's a sense that every step is filled with discovery. You'll need to remember the important details to mentally recall and solve the puzzle of the environments themselves.


	Here, most areas barely have more than two or three doors on the high end, and the path is obvious. Had I not stopped to take notes or comb every room for secrets, the demo would've been quick to breeze through, even without any prior experience playing Metroid.


	It's not a new issue; Metroid Prime 3 heavily dumbed down much of the series' complexity to make the game function on the Wii's motion controller, and even 2D titles like Fusion (2002) and Zero Mission (2004) streamlined the exploration with straightforward guidance to fit their handheld platforms.


	In 2021, Metroid Dread brought the franchise back to 2D on Switch, and it felt like a course correction for how easy the games had become post-Prime 2. While not quite the brain buster the early entries were, Dread leaned into its roots as an explorable puzzle in ways that could leave newer players scratching their heads, and its combat was tough as nails.


	Although the full scope of what Prime 4 has to offer remains unknown, what's shown in the preview feels like Nintendo and Retro Studios are playing it safely with a light take on the series' hallmarks. Its pathways are narrow, funneling players between relatively easy enemy encounters and puzzles with obvious solutions.


	Another reversion that, for now, seems ill-advised is pairing Samus up with other characters. A third of the way through the demo, players meet an NPC named Mackenzie, a Galactic Federation technician. Putting it simply, Mackenzie's a dork; a sheepish science guy whose awe of Samus and bumbling demeanor set the duo up as a typical odd couple.


	The first scene with Mackenzie has Samus rescuing him from a horde of aliens, followed quickly by an escort mission — one of the most agonizing cliches in gaming. Their dialogue (or lack thereof on Samus' part) has funny moments. Nintendo has learned that the bounty hunter's most affecting personality trait is remaining a mute goliath who handles nuisances — from chatty scientists to roaring monsters — with annoyed nonchalance. The recurring joke here is that Mackenzie talks a lot and Samus doesn't.

	











	It's hard to say how much of a presence characters like Mackenzie will have in the larger story, but Nintendo learned firsthand how detrimental poorly written NPCs and forced interactions can be with 2010's abysmal Metroid: Other M. That game, which fans would kill to forget, turned the series into a Ninja Gaiden-like third-person action title, but its worst crimes were in the painful dialogue and dumb-as-rocks story. Samus works best when other people are at a distance, and giving her a sidekick, even temporarily, raises some red flags.


	Visually, the game looks nice — with sprawling vistas in the distance when looking beyond the edge of the cliffs and little particle effects filling the air. There's some great lighting, too, with bloom effects and glints of sunbeams peering through Samus' visor, as well as the return of the occasional reflection of her face in the helmet's glass (a detail that blew fans' collective minds back in 2002).


	But despite the pleasantness, there are still some areas where the graphics are lacking. Waterfalls lack complex physics, mostly appearing as flat sheets with some misting to cover up the seams. There's some solid texture mapping across the ground and objects to give the appearance of depth, but it mostly looks like wallpaper. 


	The game runs very smoothly — even hitting up to 120 frames per second in performance mode — but it doesn't feel like much of a leap forward. It's a game that was clearly designed to run on the now-geriatric Nintendo Switch, which results in a game that aesthetically lags behind its Switch 2-exclusive peers like Donkey Kong Bananza.

	Nitpicking aside, it's a small miracle that Metroid Prime 4 exists at all. Arriving after one of the few instances of publicly known developmental hell for Nintendo, the game could've been cancelled outright. Metroid has never been one of the company's best-sellers; it's an IP that they've invested in to keep their hardcore fans happy in between higher grossing fare. But, after all this effort, here's hoping that the full version of Metroid Prime 4 is worth the wait.


Metroid Prime 4: Beyond launches on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 on Dec. 4.

	The man who rushed at and grabbed Ariana Grande during a Wicked: For Good event in Singapore has been charged with being a public nuisance.


	According to The Straits Times (one of Singapore's leading newspapers) Johnson Wen, a 26-year-old Australian, appeared in a district court Friday, Nov. 14, via video. Wen reportedly appeared unrepentant about the incident, but still said that he planned to plead guilty to the charge. His next court date is scheduled for Nov. 17. 


	Wen could face up to three months in jail, a S$2,000 fine (about $1,500 U.S. dollars), or both.

	Wen is a self-proclaimed “stage invader” who goes by the handle @Pyjamamann on social media and calls himself “troll most hated” in his bio. He's garnered some infamy for getting past security at live music and sporting events, including concerts by Katy Perry, the Weeknd, and the Chainsmokers. He also stormed the field at the 2023 Women's World Cup Final, while his Instagram includes videos of public disruptions at libraries, food courts, and on public transit. 

	











	At the Nov. 13 Wicked: For Good premiere in Singapore, Wen was captured on video jumping the security barricades while Grande and her costars were walking the carpet. He appeared to aggressively grab Grande and pull her into an embrace. Cynthia Erivo could be seen shoving Wen away from Grande and checking that she wasn't hurt.

	In the video Wen shared of the incident, he wrote, “Dear Ariana Grande Thank You for letting me Jump on the Yellow Carpet with You ❤️.” His bio also includes the short line: “Ariana Grande is the Queen.” 

	











	The incident will likely make security even more of a concern at the last remaining Wicked: For Good events ahead of its Nov. 21 release. Prior to Singapore, Grande told fans she would have to miss the Brazil premiere due to flight delays beyond her control, prompting a wave of over-the-top reactions from some disappointed fans. Grande was forced to respond in a now-expired Instagram Story statement: “Please don't wish danger on us. We did everything we could and I promise you no one is more upset than I am, I promise. No matter how upset or disappointed you are, please please do not wish danger on us or assume that we didn't try.”

The second installment of Victor Kossakovsky's "empathy trilogy," which started with 'Gunda,' premieres at Amsterdam's IDFA. Danny Glover and Maya Rudolph also get thanks in the closing credits.


							By

	A woman walks barefoot over jagged rocks by the sea in a location we can't quite place immediately. Wearing a white dress, her face is hidden beneath the brim of a floppy hat. She walks and walks, sometimes carrying a large jute bag over her shoulder. In his new feature, the black-and-white Trillion, filmmaker Victor Kossakovsky tells a minimalist story, but he is hoping for maximum impact. 


	Described as “a cinematic and wordless interpretation of the Myth of Sisyphus” in collaboration with an artist using the name K49814, Trillion world premieres Sunday in the Envision Competition of this year's International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA). Its executive producers include none other than Joaquin Phoenix, along with Susan Rockefeller, Frank Lehmann, Fridrik Mar and Kaja Bjelke.

	What unfolds in Trillion over 80 wordless minutes feels like a mystery and an experience, enticing viewers to try and piece together what is happening and why, based on visual clues, including the images and the play of light, and audio clues, both natural and atmospheric.

	Given Kossakovsky's past work, though, you know that he will want to make us aware of something profound and make us think about it. An official description of Trillion confirms as much, noting that the movie is “the second installment of his 'empathy trilogy.'” And it explains the filmmaker's hope for the impact of Trillion this way: “Provoking deeply relevant questions about the meaning and purpose of life in a time when all sentient beings face existential threat.”

	











	Kossakovsky has made a splash with such recent works as Gunda (2020), about a pig and her piglets that was the first film in his “empathy trilogy,” which Phoenix also executive produced. And in Architekton (2024), the director explored creation and destruction. 


	“Trillion is also a call to action: a journey of discovery that prompts reflection on the possibilities of realizing a different future,” the IDFA website says mysteriously. 


	As with Gunda, Phoenix is listed as an executive producer on Trillion. And when the closing credits roll, Danny Glover and Maya Rudolph are among the other big Hollywood names mentioned in a “thank you” section. “They were involved in the production in one way or another,” Kossakovsky tells THR. Anonymous Content is handling North American sales for the film from Anita Rehoff Larsen and Tone Grottjord-Glenne for Sant & Usant, and Joslyn Barnes for Louverture Films.


	So, what exactly is this woman in Trillion doing? And why? That only becomes clear very, very gradually. “Only at the last second, you understand,” says the Russian director. “In the last frame, you know why it's called Trillion and what it is about.” (THR will for now not spoil further details.)


	He feels doc festival IDFA is a great fit for his kind of doc work. “When you go to a fiction festival like Berlin or Venice, you are secondary,” he says. “People waiting on the red carpet for George Clooney.” 


	Kossakovsky says that “every film I make, I'm trying to make differently in form.” But he has earned a reputation for using narrative images more than dialogue. “I'm not using many words in my movies,” he acknowledges. “I'm trying to use cinema language. I'm trying to use pictures. A picture alone talks most of the time. Our eyes are unbelievable computers. We are able to look at someone and read that other person. This is why I don't understand why cinema, specifically documentary cinema, doesn't use this factor.”

	











	He adds: “We understand the world not through voiceovers and talking heads. It's not through words. We understand the world around us through looking.”


	Watching Trillion, audiences will see images and movement, but “in a way, nothing much is happening,”  Kossakovsky offers. “The idea is to watch to the last frame. My duty was [to make sure] that you sit and watch until the end.” And he quips: “That's why I trick people. I use this dramatic music” in parts of the film.


	The director shares that his distinct approach to documentary filmmaking means he also tends to be notably affected by his projects. “Some people make documentaries in order to teach someone something,” Kossakovsky explains. “And that's why they use a voiceover to tell you something. I'm making films in order to become a different person.”


	He means that literally. “I'm doing a film, and after that film, I cannot live in the same way I lived before,” the director shares. 


	Asked about his empathy trilogy, Kossakovsky tells THR: “I decided to to make three films about something we don't pay attention to.” In Gunda, he tackled that in this way: “We don't pay attention to pigs. We just eat them.”


	How did Phoenix get involved in that film? “He watched Gunda, and he immediately called me and said, ‘Finally, someone made a film about pigs, not about us humans,'” Kossakovsky recalls. “He watched it and said, ‘I want to support such movies.'” Now, the actor is back on board for Trillions.


	But the filmmaker is already thinking about the third film in the trilogy. “I cannot say anything about it, because it's  still secret, but I will start soon,” Kossakovsky shares. “And I hope Joaquin Phoenix will be part of it as well.”

Miles Teller has opened up a bit about one of the more distressing moments of his entire career: The way his efforts, post-Whiplash, to fully embrace the Hollywood leading man stereotype (i.e., by getting himself his own superhero franchise) collided full-on with the disaster surrounding 2015's Fantastic Four. Specifically (per Variety), Teller talked to Andy Cohen on Sirius XM this week about the flop, saying that, “Honestly, maybe there was one really important person who kind of fucked it all up.”

Teller declined to name names for this particular RIP(WKOFIAU), although internet detectives have not had to look super hard to find a likely subject for the Eternity star's comments. Fantastic Four was, after all, dogged for months by rumors of conflict between director Josh Trank and pretty much everybody else on set—including Teller, who supposedly nearly got into a full-on fist fight with his director over clashing personalities. Everybody tried to make nice in public as the film's August 2015 premiere approached, with Trank notably doing damage control with producer and writer Simon Kinberg, hoping to dispel rumors he'd been fired from his own movie in all but name.

But then, on the literal night before the movie came out, Trank sent out a since-deleted Tweet bemoaning that audiences would “probably never get to see” the “fantastic version of this” he'd had “a year ago.” (The implication being that studio meddling, reshoots, and seized control of the movie's final edit had already ruined the film.) The rest was history: A critical drubbing, a box office return that just barely cleared the movie's budget, and Trank's vanishing from the list of up-and-coming genre filmmakers he'd been slotted onto in the wake of his 2012 found-footage superhero movie Chronicle. (He probably would have lost the Star Wars movie he'd been working on at that point, too, except he'd already lost it four months earlier; Disney was reportedly unhappy when it heard about how he'd been comporting himself on his first big-budget film set.)

And, again, Teller himself was classy enough not to get into any of this well-known superhero movie lore, beyond pointing out the singular nature of the culprit for his movie's famed fucking up. (He does note that “When I first saw the movie, I remember talking to one of the studio heads and said, ‘I think we're in trouble,'” which suggests that he was not as enamored with Trank's initial, reportedly much more somber, cut of the film than the director himself was.) The actor mostly just sounds kind of wistful at the missed opportunity, saying of his co-stars (which included Kate Mara, Toby Kebbell, Jamie Bell and Michael B. Jordan) that “The casting, I thought, was spectacular. I love all those actors… It's unfortunate…because so many people worked so hard on that movie.”

Bad Bunny gana Album del año. La brasileña Liniker gana tres premios; Fito Páez y Edgar Barrera dos.

Bad Bunny y el dúo argentino Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso — dos artistas revolucionarios de lugares muy diferentes del mundo, haciendo música muy distinta y viviendo momentos totalmente diferentes en sus respectivas carreras — fueron los grandes ganadores de los Latin Grammy 2025, llevándose cinco premios cada uno y compitiendo en las mismas categorías varias veces.

	Bad Bunny, el gran favorito de la noche, se llevó el importantísimo premio al álbum del año por su aclamado disco DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS, un proyecto que lo llevó de regreso a sus raíces puertorriqueñas, celebró el amor por su isla y sus tradiciones, inspiró su histórica residencia de conciertos y, finalmente, marcó el camino hacia su próxima presentación en el show de medio tiempo del Super Bowl.


	“Este premio se lo quiero dedicar a todos los niños y jóvenes de Latinoamérica, especialmente los de Puerto Rico”, dijo al recoger su premio. “Nunca dejen de soñar y de ser ustedes. Nunca olviden de dónde vienen sin olvidar a donde van. Hay muchas maneras de hacer patria y defender nuestra tierra. Nosotros escogimos la música”, puntualizó.


	Bad Bunny también ganó mejor interpretación urbana/fusión urbana y mejor canción urbana por “DtMF”, así como mejor interpretación de reggaetón por “Voy a llevarte pa PR”. DeBí TiRAR MáS FOToS obtuvo además el premio al mejor álbum de música urbana.

	











	Si Bad Bunny era el gran favorito, Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso fueron la sorpresa. Aclamados por la crítica, desde temprano en la noche parecían listos para darle pelea a Bunny. El dúo argentino, que fusiona con acierto el hip-hop con el soul, la electrónica y el pop estilizado para crear una mezcla de sonidos que desafía los géneros y letras irreverentes, ganaron cinco estatuillas: mejor video musical versión corta por “#tetas”, mejor video musical versión larga por “Papota”, mejor álbum de música alternativa por Papota, mejor canción alternativa por “#tetas” y mejor canción pop por “El día del amigo”.


	Además, los productores de su galardonado álbum, Rafa Arcaute y Federico Vindver, se alzaron con el premio al productor del año, compartiendo el galardón con Nico Cotton en un empate.


	En la extravagante presentación de Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso, un grupo de tipos musculosos, usando solo diminutos speedos negros, lanzaron rosas a los pies de una banda de soul/funk súper bien sincronizada, mientras el dúo, vestido con ropa estampada de Versace, rapeaba y tocaba riffs de guitarra excelentes y de gran calidad técnica. No se confundan por lo loco del show; este dúo tiene talento y capacidad de sobra y sabe perfectamente qué hacer con su música, su estilo y su ironía, tanto dentro como fuera del escenario.


	Más temprano, en la Premiere del Latin Grammy, Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso (cuyos nombres reales son Catriel Guerreiro y Ulises Guerriero, sin parentesco entre ellos) recogieron premios vestidos con conjuntos de seda estampados, los mismos que usaron para su presentación.


	“Hemos hecho un esfuerzo sobrehumano para ganar este hermoso objeto. Tan sobrehumano que ya no nos percibimos humanos, nos percibimos empresa”, dijo Ca7riel con total seriedad, fiel al estilo irónico que caracteriza la música y la imagen del dúo.

	











	Conforme avanzaba la noche y se sumaban los premios, el dúo se fue emocionando. Al recibir su premio a la mejor canción alternativa, Ca7riel cedió. “A nuestras madres, Estrella y Andrea, que son las culpables de todo esto”, dijo.


	“La verdad es que estamos sorprendidos de que nos den premios, que nos den cosas”, añadió Paco Amoroso. “Gracias al equipo que nos ha permitido hacer cosas. Estamos felices. Gracias a la gente de Argentina”.


	Irónicamente, ni Bad Bunny ni Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso ganaron grabación o canción del Año, dos categorías en las que los Latin Grammys, inexplicablemente, los hicieron competir contra sí mismos con dos canciones de un mismo álbum, prácticamente asegurando que se anularan entre ellos.


	En su lugar, Karol G se llevó el premio a la canción del año por su exitosísima (y maravillosa) “Si antes te hubiera conocido”, coescrita con Edgar Barrera, quien ganó compositor del año por tercer año consecutivo.


	Por otro lado, el superastro español Alejandro Sanz ganó grabación del año por su hermosa “Palmeras en el jardín”. Aunque es un gran tema, incluso Sanz expresó su sorpresa: “Benito, te lo he robado, perdóname”, dijo mientras recogía su premio.


	El premio al Mejor nuevo artista fue para la mexicana Paloma Morphy. 


	En cuanto a número de victorias, Brasil también brilló con Liniker, quien se llevó tres premios: mejor álbum de pop contemporáneo en lengua portuguesa por Caju, mejor Interpretación urbana en lengua portuguesa por la canción del mismo título, y mejor canción en lengua portuguesa por “Veludo Marrom”. Edgar Barrera también se alzó con tres galardones, al igual que Natalia Lafourcade, quien ganó mejor álbum cantautor por Cancionera.

	











	La transmisión en vivo arrancó con un confuso popurrí con el legendario Santana en la guitarra y varios nominados, como Maluma y Grupo Frontera, interpretando fragmentos de canciones junto a un grupo de bailarines cuyo estilo de principios de los 2000 se sintió un poco fuera de lugar con la música. Pero, conforme avanzaba la noche, avanzaron las actuaciones, empezando por Rauw Alejandro, quien presentó un medley de canciones respaldado por sus propios bailarines y banda, con una deslumbrante producción escénica y una interpretación vocal sobresaliente.


	Otros momentos destacados incluyeron a los ya mencionados Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso y a Bad Bunny, quien actuó junto al grupo puertorriqueño Chuwi. Hubo grandes sorpresas, como la presentación de Raphael, el homenajeado como Persona del Año, quien, a sus 82 años y tras problemas de salud, aún conserva la poderosa voz que lo ha convertido en uno de los baladistas más icónicos de la música latina. 


	Elena Rose y Morat también sorprendieron, mostrando una autenticidad y entrega que les ha permitido conectar profundamente con su público. Por su parte, Los Tigres del Norte ofrecieron un mensaje de conciencia social con su éxito “La lotería”.


	Los anfitriones de la transmisión por TelevisaUnivision fueron la veterana actriz y cantante Roselyn Sánchez, quien ya ha conducido este premio en múltiples ocasiones y demostró su carisma y experiencia; y Maluma, quien debutó como presentador con una actitud relajada y convincente. Me le quito el sombrero.


	Si hubo un tema central en la noche, fue la autenticidad y el regreso a lo real. En su emotivo discurso tras ganar el premio a canción del año, Karol G pidió “por favor no me corten” porque tenía algo importante que decir. La cantante colombiana reflexionó sobre los peligros de la fama y el riesgo de escuchar las voces externas que siembran dudas y críticas.

	











	“Lo único que me quedó de eso fue volver a la raíz y volver al propósito”, dijo. “No lo digo por mí, porque hay un montón de personas en la casa que piensan que no son suficientemente buenas. Cuando uno se olvida del otro, lo único que queda es la pasión”.

Miley Cyrus has released “Dream as One,” a new song that she made for the new movie Avatar: Fire and Ash. Cyrus co-wrote and co-produced the track with Andrew Wyatt and Mark Ronson, and it has additional contributions from Jonathan Wilson, Simon Franglen, Brandon Bost, and others. Listen to “Dream as One (From Avatar: Fire and Ash)” below.

Avatar: Fire and Ash is the third installment in director James Cameron's Avatar franchise. It hits U.S. theaters on December 19. The original soundtrack album, featuring composer Simon Franglen's score, is out the week before, on December 12.

The second Avatar movie, Avatar: The Way of Water, came out in 2022. The Weeknd made an original song, “Nothing Is Lost (You Give Me Strength),” for that film. The original Avatar, from 2009, featured Leona Lewis' “I See You (Theme From Avatar).”

Cyrus released her latest studio album, Something Beautiful, in May. She worked on the full-length with Andrew Wyatt, Jonathan Rado, Brittany Howard, Adam Granduciel, BJ Burton, Shawn Everett, Tobias Jesso Jr., Bibi Bourelly, and others.

	Charisma Madarang



Pebe Sebert — mother of Kesha and a singer-songwriter who's collaborated with Dolly Parton, Miley Cyrus, and more — has announced her self-titled debut album, scheduled to arrive Dec. 12.


	The artist revealed the news Thursday on social media with the simple caption, “Pebe Sebert. My one and only album,” alongside a pre-save link to streaming services. Hours before the announcement, Sebert dropped “City's Burning,” the third single from the upcoming project, following previously released tracks “Vampire” (2021) and “Hard Times Ahead” (2022).


	The record is set to span 11 songs and showcases Sebert's original recordings from the Eighties. Kesha will release her mother's debut LP under her own eponymous label Kesha Records, which dropped the “Joyride” singer's sixth album, (Period.), in July.


	“I grew up in the studio, watching my mom turn her life into songs. These moments became stories. these stories are her life,” penned Kesha, who's regularly worked with her mother throughout her career, on X. “She wrote an album before I was born. This was the only album she made as an independent artist before focusing her life on raising her children and writing songs for other people.”

	Kesha continued, “I grew up watching this alchemy, and I only became who I am because of the road she paved before me. I'm so proud to finally release my mom's debut album on KESHA RECORDS, and I'm so proud of her release today !”

	











	During the release of “Vampire” in 2021, Sebert opened up about her struggles with substance abuse and how it affected her work. “I felt like this song had died along with my career as a recording artist when my life fell off the tracks due to drug and alcohol abuse in the middle of recording my debut album, I grieved the loss of my recording career and this music I was so proud of,” Sebert said in a statement at the time. “Last year I found these tapes in a dusty box in my basement and Guy [Roche] was nice enough to help me bring them back to life and it's very fulfilling to finally release this.”

There's a little game you can play with Hideo Kojima's Death Stranding video game series, and all that it requires, in terms of materials, is a handful of basic facts about the franchise, and a normie to relate them to. You win when they call you a liar, and it usually doesn't take that long: After all, we're talking about a post-apocalyptic walking simulator where Norman Reedus plays the world's most badass mailman, hogtying obsessive package thieves and launching himself out of cannons. Where major characters are played by motion-captured copies of Guillermo Del Toro and Nicolas Winding Refn. Where you fend off ghosts by throwing grenades filled with your main character's magical pee, while he carries a canteen that automatically fills itself back up with Monster brand energy drink. Wait, don't go! We haven't even gotten to the part where the Norman Reedus character talks glowingly about how riding a motorcycle is just like watching AMC's Ride With Norman Reedus!

What we're trying to establish here is that these are weird games, and now they're apparently going to be a weird animated TV show, too. This is per THR, which reports that Kojima has apparently signed with Disney to make a Disney+ animated series, Death Stranding Isolations, set in the world of the show, and which we can only assume will also be suitably bonkers. Featuring 2D animation (courtesy of Japanese studio E&H Production), the show will apparently center on a man and a woman going on a journey in the world of Kojima's games, where humanity screwed everything up for itself by reaching out to the realm of death, opening a door that's caused deadly time-accelerating rain called timefall to blanket the earth. and lethal ghosts to prowl the vast stretches of countryside now abandoned by humanity.

Kojima Productions has released two Death Stranding games so far, with the sequel, subtitled On The Beach, arriving earlier this year. In announcing the show, Metal Gear creator Kojima—who's also working on a film adaptation of the series with A24, and has long held ludicrously unsubtle desires to break into his beloved worlds of TV and film—stated that his goal was to bring the story of his games to people who don't play video games.

"I'd brave any weather 'cause nothing is better than being together again," the rivals-turned-friends sing to each other in the festive new song.


													By
												

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	From the fiery summer release of ZOMBIES 4: Dawn of the Vampires to the icy winter melody of “Snow Angels,” Freya Skye and Malachi Barton are back together again.


	Skye's Nova and Barton's Victor started out on opposite sides of an ancient fight as members of the rival Daywalkers and Vampires, respectively, in the fourth ZOMBIES installment that came out in July, but in the snow-dusted music video for “Snow Angels” — premiering exclusively on Billboard Family below — they're realizing the holidays are so much better when they're together.

	











	“Oh the choir sings and the bells all chime/ When your sno-oh-ow angel's next to mine,” Skye sings to Barton to start the song, as they lie down in the fresh snow and make head-to-head snow angels. Later in the tune, they sing in harmony: “I'd brave any weather 'cause nothing is better than being together again.” In the visual, they both harness their powers — Nova's solar flares and Victor's night winds — to conjure a flurry of snow.


	The “Snow Angels” song will be available across all digital music platforms first thing Friday (Nov. 14) at midnight ET, while the music video hits Disney+ and DisneyMusicVevo at 3 a.m. ET. The video will also premiere on Disney Channel after the ZOMBIES 4 sing-along encore event airing Nov. 28 at 7 p.m. ET, which will help kick off the network's “Fa-La-La-Lidays” holiday programming.

The past year has been full of wonderful surprises for country music legend and “The Voice” coach Reba McEntire, from her NBC sitcom being renewed for a second season to getting engaged to longtime love (and “Happy's Place” co-star) Rex Linn. 

On November 11, 2025, McEntire, 70, got another surprise. Reps from her record label, MCA, and “Happy's Place” cast members threw the queen of country an unexpected party on the set of her sitcom. The celebration marked 50 years since she signed her first record deal, with Mercury Records, back on November 11, 1975. 

To mark 50 years of memories in showbiz, McEntire was surprised in front of a studio audience with a giant cake emblazoned with her name, a huge plaque honoring 50 years of accomplishments, tons of balloons, and many of her colleagues wearing t-shirts featuring one of her 32 album covers. 

“Reba's impact on country music is immeasurable,” MCA CEO Mike Harris said in a statement. “For 50 years, she's set the standard for artistry, authenticity, and work ethic — inspiring generations of artists and fans alike. It's an incredible honor for all of us at MCA to celebrate this milestone with her and continue the journey with one of the most defining voices in our genre.”

According to MCA, McEntire has sold over 58 million records worldwide, with hits including “Fancy,” “Survivor,” and “Whoever's in New England.” She is the only female country solo artist to have scored a number one hit in four consecutive decades (1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s).

McEntire has shelves full of awards, too. Over her career, she's won 16 ACM Awards, 15 American Music Awards, nine People's Choice Awards, six CMA Awards, and three Grammys. And in February, she could win her fourth Grammy, since she just received her 18th nomination. McEntire is up for the Best Country Duo/Group Performance for her collaboration on “Trailblazer” with Miranda Lambert and Lainey Wilson.

The last year hasn't been all sunshine for McEntire. In early August, she lost her cherished stepson, Brandon Blackstock, whom she helped raise with her ex-husband Narvel Blackstock. Brandon, who was also married for several years to “The Voice” coach Kelly Clarkson, died at age 48 following a two-year battle with melanoma. 

But his passing has made it all the more clear to McEntire that now is a time to reflect on where she's been, enjoy the present moment, and be grateful for the gifts in her life. 

“I think I'm happier now than I've ever been in my life,” she told People in late October. “It's amazing. It's wonderful being 70 and getting to do what I get to do at the level I want to do it.”

McEntire stars on NBC's “Happy Place” on Friday nights and on season 28 of “The Voice” on Monday nights.

Kacey Musgraves and Carín León brought a touch of Nashville to the Latin Grammys in Las Vegas. During Thursday night's ceremony at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, the música mexicana star was joined by the Nashville queen for a performance of their bilingual collaboration, “Lost in Translation.”


	Dressed in his classic tall sombrero, León opened his performance solo with his sweet ballad “Ahí Estabas Tú” from Palabra de To's, backed by the strums of the requinto. Then, Musgraves emerged on a second stage in a sparkly black dress as they transitioned into “Lost in Translation” and sang the love song to each other, trading verses in Spanglish.

	The Latin-country duo released “Lost in Translation” on Aug. 29 about a love that defeats language barriers. Musgraves and León co-wrote the song alongside Amy Allen and Shane McAnally, with Julian Bunetta and Matt Zara serving as producers.


	Musgraves previously said of their collab, “Growing up singing traditional country and western music, I've always loved exploring the borders of Country and where it blends with other styles like norteño and some regional Mexican sounds that I heard a lot of in Texas.”

	Musgraves and León first met in Nashville, and got to duet to Juan Gabriel and Rocío Dúrcal's “Fue Un Placer Conocerte.”

Morgan Freeman's distinctive voice has been the bane of everybody who has a “funny co-worker” for the last 20 years and counting—and now it's apparently the bane of his lawyers' workloads, too. This is per a new interview that Freeman gave to The Guardian this week, in which the veteran actor talked briefly about his reaction to the inescapable fact that his distinctive, warm tones were one of the first targets for AI voice copying—in many ways, now the irritating “office clown” to humanity as a whole.

To put it in Freeman's (apparently congenitally folksy) terms, “I'm a little PO'd, you know,” he said of the way his specific voice and cadences get copied by every huckster trying to peddle new AI tech. “I'm like any other actor: don't mimic me with falseness. I don't appreciate it and I get paid for doing stuff like that, so if you're gonna do it without me, you're robbing me.” When asked about whether he pursues legal remedies when he finds out that his voice is being copied, Freeman makes it plain: “I tell you, my lawyers have been very, very busy.”

(Freeman was also, of course, asked about the whole “Tilly Norwood” thing, to similarly hardline results: “Nobody likes her because she's not real, and that takes the part of a real person, so it's not going to work out very well in the movies or in television … The union's job is to keep actors acting, so there's going to be that conflict.”)

AI being used to imitate well-known actors has been one of the many prongs making up the gnarly, multi-tined sticking point that's been Hollywood's response to artificial intelligence in recent years, especially after the estates of certain actors with highly distinctive voices—notably James Earl Jones—signed off on official copies. The topic was a major area of contention in the strikes that happened back in 2023—and apparently a big talking point for the Now You Seem Me actor and his reportedly tireless legal team.

Amy Robach's new engagement ring from fiancé T.J. Holmes is a show-stopper.

The newly engaged couple was snapped walking in New York City on Wednesday, and Robach's massive new hardware was on display. Robach smirked as she wore the ring — which features a very large gold gem — on her left ring finger.

The former “Good Morning America” hosts held hands and bundled up for the cold. Robach wore a long black coat, boots and a heavy pink scarf, while Holmes was more casual in gray sweatpants, a hoodie and a Nike jacket.

It appears the two stepped out to grab a bite to eat, as they were holding paper bags from bakery-restaurant chain Le Pain Quotidien.

The couple announced they were engaged on their “Amy & TJ” podcast in October, a month after he popped the question.

Holmes, 48, shared that Robach, 52, has been publicly wearing her engagement ring in front of crowds of thousands of people in plain sight but nobody had said anything.

Robach added, “I was in three massive football stadiums three weekends in a row, wearing my engagement ring very proudly, very excitedly, and kept waiting for somebody to point it out or ask me, ‘Hey, what's that?' And it never happened.”

But a source told Page Six that Robach's pals weren't fully on board with her wedding plans.

“I don't know many people who like T.J. She still has her besties and anyone who truly cares wants her [to be] happy,” the source said.

Holmes and Robach's engagement came three years after they were fired from “Good Morning America” for having an affair while they were still married to their previous partners.

In a stunning twist, Holmes and Robach's ex-spouses — Marilee Fiebig and Andrew Shue, respectively — are now dating and reportedly moved in together in February.

An insider told Us Weekly in June that Holmes and Robach are planning to invite their ex-spouses to their wedding.

Both Robach and Holmes have been married twice before. Robach was married to Tim McIntosh from 1996-2009, then Shue from 2010-2023. She shares two daughters with McIntosh: Ava, 22, and Annalise, 19.

Holmes' first wife was Amy Ferson, whom he divorced in 2007. He married Fiebig in 2010 before their split in 2022. He and Fiebig share daughter Sabine, 12.

Cardi shared the news ("A new baby into my world") in the caption of an Instagram video soundtracked by her song "Hello."

Cardi B has welcomed her new baby boy with boyfriend Stefon Diggs, the rap superstar announced Thursday (Nov. 13) on Instagram.


	This is Cardi's fourth child, following her trio of kids with ex-husband Offset: 7-year-old daughter Kulture, 4-year-old son Wave, and 1-year-old daughter Blossom.


	Cardi shared the news in the caption of an Instagram video soundtracked by her song “Hello,” from her Billboard 200-topping sophomore album Am I the Drama?, which arrived in September.


	“My life has always been a combination of different chapters and different seasons,” she wrote in part in the lengthy caption. “My last chapter was the beginning of a new season. Starting over is never easy but it's been so worth it! I brought new music and a new album to the world! A new baby into my world, and one more reason to be the best version of me, one more reason to love me more than anything else or anyone else so I can continue giving my babies the love and life they deserve. This next chapter is Me vs. Me!”


	In a video posted to her Instagram Story, Cardi confirmed the sex of the baby, fawning over a girly, flower-covered stroller and lamenting, “I just had a boy … why didn't I know about this [stroller] last year?”

	











	While whispers of their relationship started in the fall of last year, Cardi and New England Patriots player Stefon Diggs made their first public outing as a couple in May, cuddling up courtside at the New York Knicks vs. Boston Celtics game during the 2025 NBA Playoffs. Cardi announced their pregnancy news in September, telling CBS Mornings: “I feel very powerful that I'm doing all this work. But I'm doing all this work while I'm creating a baby, and me and my man, we're very supportive of each other.”




	In the Instagram caption, Cardi referenced her 2026 Little Miss Drama tour, which kicks off Feb. 11 in Palm Desert, California. “I've started prepping for tour getting my body right getting my mind right,” she wrote. “There's nothing thats gonna stop me from giving you guys the performance of a life time! I've learned i've healed, and im loving the woman i've become! Thats what this next era means to me and i'm stepping into it better than ever.”

James Van Der Beek will soon be auctioning off memorabilia from throughout his long film and television career, People reports. Van Der Beek revealed earlier this week that he intends to sell off his collection—including pieces from fan favorites like Dawson's Creek and Varsity Blues—in order to help pay medical costs. The actor revealed last November that he'd been diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer.

Per People, Van Der Beek will be selling the items—which include hats and cleats worn during Varsity Blues, the clothes he wore in the first episode of Dawson's Creek, and, in what's expected to be the highest-ticket item, the necklace that his character gave Katie Holmes' Joey during the show's prom episode—through Propstore's Winter Entertainment Memorabilia Live Auction in December.

Here's Van Der Beek:

I've been storing these treasures for years, waiting for the right time to do something with them, and with all of the recent unexpected twists and turns life has presented recently, it's clear that the time is now. While I have some nostalgia tugging at me as I part with these items, it feels good to be able to offer them through Propstore's auction to share with those who have supported my work over the years.

All proceeds from the sales will reportedly go toward covering Van Der Beek's medical expenses. A father of six, the actor has continued to work after revealing his diagnosis, including making recent appearances in Prime Video's Overcompensating.

The memorabilia auction is scheduled to begin with live bidding on December 5 in London, with the sale being opened up to global collectors the following day. You can see the full collection—which also includes some pretty choice non-Van-Der-Beek memorabilia, including Will Ferrell's Elf costume, one of the stunt axes from The Shining, and the usual array of Star Wars and Indiana Jones collectibles that often pop up in these kinds of sales—right here.

Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner have hit back at Ray J's new bombshell lawsuit against them, which came on the heels of them filing a defamation lawsuit against him.

Alex Spiro — the lawyer for Kardashian and Jenner — called the “One Wish” singer's lawsuit “frivolous” in a statement to Page Six on Thursday.

“After realizing he is losing the case and losing his way, this disjointed rambling distraction is not intimidating anyone,” Spiro said. “Ray J will lose this frivolous case too.”

Ray J's new lawsuit doubles down on his claims that Kardashian and Jenner have been lying about the infamous 2007 sex tape leak for two decades. The singer alleges the mother-daughter duo were behind his and Kardashian's sex tape — which he claims was filmed consensually in 2003 when they were dating — getting leaked.

Ray J, 44, claimed in the filing obtained by Page Six that he and Kardashian, 45, discussed releasing the tape in 2006, and that she allegedly told him that her mother should be in charge of releasing it.

He claimed that Jenner and Kardashian are now “furious” that he “no longer wants to play along with their tall tale.”

Ray J, whose real name is William Ray Norwood Jr., also hit back at Kardashian and Jenner's lawsuit against him for defamation, which they filed in October.

“Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner's lawsuit is not about defamation — it's about publicity, power, and punishment,” he claimed in the court docs.

Kardashian and Jenner filed the defamation lawsuit shortly after Ray J made the shocking claim that he's working with the feds to build a RICO case against them.

“The federal RICO I'm about to drop on Kris and Kim is about to be crazy,” the singer told Chrisean Rock during a livestream that circulated on X.

“I'm talking about, I'm on the news every day. I'm gonna say a lot of s–t. Anybody that is cool with Kim, they need to tell her now, the feds is coming. There's nothing I can do about it.”

He added, “It's worse than Diddy.”

But in Kardashian and Jenner's lawsuit against Ray J, they stated that “no such federal investigation exists.”

“No law enforcement agency has initiated any criminal proceedings or investigations related to racketeering charged against Ms. Kardashian or Ms. Jenner and no credible evidence whatsoever supports these inflammatory allegations,” their lawsuit reads, which was obtained by Page Six.

“Unable to accept the end of his fleeting relationship with Ms. Kardashian over 20 years ago, Ray J has repeatedly sought to attach himself to Plaintiffs' names and exploit their prominence for personal gain,” the lawsuit also states.

Justin Baldoni claimed in a new legal filing that Blake Lively improvised an off-script kissing scene during the filming of “It Ends With Us.”

An exhibit filed by Wayfarer and others on Nov. 13 included a brief clip in which Lively and Baldoni — who co-starred in the movie — share a light kiss while passing in a hallway in a hospital.

Per People, attorneys for Baldoni alleged in documents that the “Gossip Girl” alum, 38, “added [the scene] to the script, in which her character kissed Baldoni's character in every take, although there was no kiss in the script.”

The footage from May 2023 — which is just over one minute long — shows Lively, who plays Lily, come across Baldoni, who plays neurosurgeon Ryle, as he works at the hospital.

Lily approaches a confused Ryle in the hallway, apologizing for interrupting his day and planting a quick kiss on his lips. 

She then leaves Ryle, telling him she “happen[s] to love him too” on the way out. 

Baldoni's character watches her exit with a bemused expression, tossing his phone before saying, “Alright, cut.”

A rep for Lively did not immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment on the deleted scene.

Lively, 38, sued the film's director Baldoni, 41, for alleged sexual harassment and retaliation in December 2024. 

Baldoni denied wrongdoing and hit back with a $400 million countersuit against Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds, as well as others, in January, though it was later dismissed by the judge.

Lively's original complaint accused the director of alleged “improvised physical intimacy that had not been rehearsed, choreographed or discussed with Ms. Lively.” 

After a January 2024 meeting between Lively and Reynolds, as well as producers, Wayfarer agreed to employ an intimacy coordinator and stated that there would be “no more improvising of kissing,” per Lively's complaint.

Baldoni's legal team had previously claimed only scripted kissing scenes were filmed before the Hollywood strikes. 

However, they also claimed the alleged new unscripted kissing scene was filmed prior to the industry strikes on May 13, 2023.

“Lively also complains that there was inappropriate and improvised kissing during the first period of filming, before the strike break,” Baldoni's since-dismissed complaint read, per People. 

Advertisement

“But in fact, the only two kissing scenes filmed during the initial filming period were both scenes that included kisses as written in the script. These kissing scenes were not improvised.” 

On Wednesday, alleged texts between Baldoni and the film's source material author, Colleen Hoover, emerged as well. 

The “It Ends With Us” author allegedly wrote that she “felt forced to choose” between Lively and Baldoni amid their feud and that she was “disappointed” in the director, in alleged communications from 2024. 

The alleged texts were filed by Wayfarer on Nov. 10.

“I'm like any other actor: don't mimic me with falseness," the Oscar winner said. 


							By

Morgan Freeman is speaking out again on AI. 


	Freeman recently spoke with The Guardian about his thoughts on AI and how its trying to use his voice with permission. “I'm a little PO'd, you know,” he said. “I'm like any other actor: don't mimic me with falseness. I don't appreciate it and I get paid for doing stuff like that, so if you're gonna do it without me, you're robbing me.”




	The Now You See Me: Now You Don't star claims, “my lawyers have been very, very busy,” to remove AI being used without his knowledge, and added that there's been “quite a few” cases his lawyers have found.

	And this wasn't the first time the Oscar winner has been vocal about the issue. In June 2024, he took to X to share his appreciation for fans noticing that AI-generated imitations of his voice had been created. “Thank you to my incredible fans for your vigilance and support in calling out the unauthorized use of an A.I. voice imitating me,” Freeman wrote. “Your dedication helps authenticity and integrity remain paramount. Grateful.” He also used hashtags “scam” and “IdentityProtection.” 


	AI has been a hot topic in Hollywood as of late, with SAG-AFTRA addressing the creation of a computer-generated actress, Tilly Norwood, in September.


	“To be clear, ‘Tilly Norwood' is not an actor, it's a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers — without permission or compensation,” said SAG-AFTRA. “It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we've seen, audiences aren't interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience. It doesn't solve any ‘problem' — it creates the problem of using stolen performances to put actors out of work, jeopardizing performer livelihoods and devaluing human artistry.”

President Donald Trump likes his news apologetic, but more than that, he likes news organizations to show conciliation through cash payments. Earlier this year, he shook down CBS and ABC for roughly $15 million over various defamation allegations. However, while ABC settled with the billionaire co-founder of Truth Social for $15 million and apologized, CBS paid him $16 million and did not. The BBC did the opposite, offering Trump an apology but refusing to pay. In a report published today, the BBC stated that it has apologized for splicing parts of Trump's January 6, 2021, speech together but “rejected his demands for compensation.” As they have done to other news organizations, Trump's lawyers threated to sue the BBC for $1 billion over the edit.

“BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president's speech on 6 January 2021,” a BBC spokesperson said. “While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.”

Over the weekend, The Daily Telegraph published a note from a whistleblower stating that a 2024 episode of the docuseries Panorama spliced together parts of Trump's January 6 speech that were 50 minutes apart, giving, as the BBC puts it, “the mistaken impression that President Trump made a call for violent action.” The news caused an upheaval at the BBC, leading to the resignations of two executives: Tim Davie, the network's director general, and Deborah Turness, its head of news. Unfortunately for the BBC, this wasn't the first time they've done this. Today, The Daily Telegraph found another instance of the BBC making a similar edit to the same speech nearly two years earlier for a 2022 episode of Newsnight.

President Trump has a long history of threatening to sue media organizations. Over the summer, he threatened The Wall Street Journal with a $10 billion lawsuit over its publishing a news story alleging that Trump had written the infamous “enigmas never age” letter in Jeffrey Epstein's extremely disgusting 2003 birthday book.

	Weeks after it was revealed that the Walt Disney Company had squashed the idea of a Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker spinoff centered on Ben Solo, the son of Han Solo played by Adam Driver, the idea refuses to die amongst fans of the galaxy far far away.




	A plane with the banner “Shareholders Want The Hunt for Ben Solo,” the latter part being the hoped-for movie's title, flew over Disney's Burbank-based headquarters in the 11 a.m. hour Thursday, just hours after the company had its earnings call.

	It's the latest banner-flying move (fans hired a plane with a banner reading “Save the Hunt for Ben Solo” in late October) and comes the same week as flyers showed up in Los Angeles' mid-Wilshire area on lampposts and street signs, taking the form of missing persons posters.


	“Missing” and “Have You Seen This Man?” flank a photo of Driver as Ben Solo, also known as Kylo Ren. On top of personal information, it notes that the person was last seen five years and 10 months ago, referring to the release date of The Rise of Skywalker, which occurred in December 2019.


	All this hullaballoo comes after Driver, in an October interview with the Associated Press, revealed he and acclaimed filmmaker Steven Soderbergh came up with an idea and how a script was written by Scott Z. Burns. It was even given the thumbs up by Lucasfilm head Kathleen Kennedy.     


	“We took it to Bob Iger and Alan Bergman and they said no,” Driver said. “They didn't see how Ben Solo was alive. And that was that.”

	











	Soderbergh confirmed the project and its being blown up, Alderaan style.


	The irony here, however, is that Rise of Skywalker has such a poor reputation amongst fans and audiences in general that it killed Star Wars movies for years. Next summers The Mandalorian and Grogu will be the first movie since 2019.


	On top of that, the character was killed at the end of the movie in a redemptive act. The idea of resurrecting him would go against his sacrifice and lend more incredulity to the Star Wars franchise' very loose concept of death, as it has brought back such characters as Emperor Palpatine, Death Maul, and even Boba Fett.


	Still, as any decent Star Wars fan could tell you, rebellions are built on hope. And right now there is a hope amongst a faction that their actions can change Jedi minds.

The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, has opened ‘Dead Sea Scrolls: The Exhibition,' featuring a collection of ancient Jewish manuscripts along with 200 other artifacts.

Rumors and stories of special appearances made by Jesus Christ in the town of Dozulé, France, have been declared not true.

In the 1970s, a Catholic mother, Madeleine Aumont, reported seeing Jesus 49 times, sharing that the Lord told her to build an enormous cross in the French town.

The "Glorious Cross of Dozulé" was to be built to a height of over 2,000 feet; it also needed to be illuminated, according to claims.

There is a similar and smaller cross on display in the town. 

"The phenomenon of the alleged apparitions ... is to be regarded, definitively, as not supernatural in origin, with all the consequences that flow from this determination," text from the doctrinal office approved by Pope Leo XIV said.

Father Patrick Mary Briscoe, a Dominican friar based in Rome, Italy, told Fox News Digital the Dozulé messages inspired curiosity in some circles.

"[The message was] never embraced by the wider Church," he said. "Perhaps that is because the Church plainly teaches that the cross of Christ is the summit of revelation.

"Pope Leo is keeping the focus where it belongs — on Christ."

"The Church's decision is a reminder that our hope isn't in private revelations or sensational claims, but in the power of the sacraments and the truth of the Gospel."

Father Briscoe said Pope Leo's approval of this declaration shows how seriously the church takes discernment in spiritual matters — "not to suppress faith, but to purify it" — and to ensure that faith is not anchored by emotion or speculation, but truth.

"It's clear that Pope Leo intends to speak directly to our scientific age," Father Briscoe also said. "His recent comments on compulsive gambling and internet addiction, for example, show that he's thinking about pressing issues."

He shared that doctrinal clarity helps protect Christian teaching from superstition and excess.

"The Vatican's discernment here safeguards authentic devotion. This is about protecting believers from confusion," said Briscoe. "The Vatican isn't closing the door on devotion. Instead, Pope Leo is keeping the focus where it belongs — on Christ."

Before extraterrestrial rovers are sent to outer space, they undergo rigorous mechanical and mobility testing to ensure they can handle the new terrain. These tests aim to simulate the sand, rocks and slopes of planets, to ensure the rovers can be remotely controlled successfully. 

The gravitational pull is six times weaker on the moon than on Earth. Engineers have traditionally accounted for this difference in gravity by creating prototypes that are one-sixth the mass of an actual rover.  

Dan Negrut, a professor of mechanical engineering at UW–Madison, and his collaborators have discovered that these past tests have missed one key terrain detail, which impacts a rover's success – the impact of the Earth's gravity on sand.

Their findings, first publicized in July 2025 and published in the Journal of Field Robotics, have drawn national attention in the past few months. News outlets like NBC News and ScienceDaily have praised the team for drawing attention to a long-overlooked issue in rover design and testing.

“In retrospect, the idea is simple: We need to consider not only the gravitational pull on the rover but also the effect of gravity on the sand to get a better picture of how the rover will perform on the moon,” Negrut says. “Our findings underscore the value of using physics-based simulation to analyze rover mobility on granular soil.”

Using computer simulation, Negrut and his team have proven that the Earth's gravity pushes down on the sand beneath a rover much more than previously thought. 

The sand on the Earth's surface is rigid, holding firm underneath the treads of a moving rover. However, on the moon, the weaker gravity leads to a less firm or “squishy” surface of sand, which can cause rovers to lose traction or get stuck. 

The study, titled “A Study Demonstrating That Using Gravitational Offset to Prepare Extraterrestrial Mobility Missions Is Misleading,” confirms that decades of rover testing on Earth may have led to overly optimistic performance predictions.

The team's discovery came from combining two tools. 

Negrut and his team used a simulation of the NASA-funded VIPER Rover and a physics-based engine called ProjectChrono. Chrono, developed at UW-Madison in collaboration with scientists from Italy, helped researchers to model the complex situation of a rover moving on an unstable surface like the terrain of the moon. 

This discovery has implications beyond improving extraterrestrial rovers, said Negrut. 

ProjectChrono, the modeling engine used to simulate the rover on the surface of the moon, has applications in robotics and mechatronic systems, and can even be used to simulate three-dimensional shapes for collision detection. 

More importantly, Chrono is free and available to the public, leading to the possibility of more users putting its simulation abilities to good use.

While no official changes to NASA's rover-testing protocols have been announced, Negrut and his team are committed to improving the software to stay applicable for future challenges.

“It's very unusual in academia to produce a software product at this level,” Negrut says. “There are certain types of applications relevant to NASA and planetary exploration where our simulator can solve problems that no other tool can solve, including simulators from huge tech companies, and that's exciting.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has made the shocking revelation that rogue government elements have been hiding the truth about contact with aliens for decades — even keeping U.S. presidents in the dark about the threat.

The nation's top diplomat, 54, reveals the mind-blowing cover-up in a new documentary, The Age of Disclosure, that will stream on Prime Video beginning Nov. 21.

“We've had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities — and it's not ours,” Rubio says.

At one point in the film, he reveals that even the White House has been kept uninformed for decades about secret government projects to reverse-engineer UFOs!

“This was pretty shocking to hear someone of Rubio's level making that allegation,” Dan Farah, The Age of Disclosure's producer and director, said on Real Time with Bill Mahr.

“For someone of Rubio's level to make that accusation in public with such certainty says a lot about what's been kept secret for decades from everyone — and, apparently, even the president,” says Dr. Bill Birnes, the New York Times best-selling author of UFOs and the White House.

“It also tells me the veil of secrecy and shadows that has kept the public in the dark so long is finally beginning to lift,” the ufologist adds.

As readers know, the U.S. government finally began opening up about UFOs in recent years, a 180 from the secrecy and cover-ups of generations past.

The Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office has logged more than 1,600 sightings of UAPs — unidentified anomalous phenomena, as UFOs are now known — over the last four years.

Since 2022, Congress has held three public hearings featuring startling testimony from retired and active military whistleblowers detailing unsettling encounters with UFOs.

Many UFOs seem to defy the laws of physics, some demonstrate instantaneous acceleration, while others were able to switch our nuclear weapons on and off, military sources told Farah.

Jay Stratton, onetime director of the government's UAP Task Force, admits in the film, “I have seen, with my own eyes, non-human craft and non-human beings,” per Variety.

Farah, meanwhile, attributes the skyrocketing number of sightings in recent decades to increasing alien curiosity about us! “We've evolved technologically very rapidly over the last 80 years, but our morals have not really [kept pace],” he says. “We're [still] a violent species, threatening war on sovereign nations … and we can [thus] be perceived as a potential threat.”

In the five years since Supernatural went silent after a staggering 15-season run, Jared Padalecki has poured himself into his fair share of other roles. First, it was bringing an iconic ‘90s series back with a twist in The CW's Walker, a job he followed up as an executive producer on a prequel series titled Walker: Independence. After his time as a gritty man of the law was given the axe by the network, the Gilmore Girls alum moved onto a guest spot in CBS' smash hit series, Fire Country, in a role that audiences had hoped would turn into a spin-off of its own. And, although there may not be a Camden Casey-centered offshoot anytime soon, CBS isn't quite done with Padalecki just yet, as a recent report reveals the writers' room has officially opened on a new medical drama that would feature the star in a leading role. 

So far, we know that the series will see Padalecki return to his recent rootin' tootin' Texan roots where he'll play a doctor who doesn't always play by the book. Loved by the community, Padalecki's medical professional runs a mobile clinic to better reach those who have been turned away by regular care providers. Accompanying him on his quest for good health for all is a young doctor who, according to the official logline, is “escaping her past.”

In addition to starring, Padalecki will also serve the untitled project, which was announced as a possibility for the network earlier this year, as an executive producer alongside its writer, Anna Fricke. The title falls under Padalecki's first-look producing deal with the studio, while Fricke holds an overall deal as well. Fricke's Pursued by a Bear banner backs the production, with the company's Laura Terry executive producing and CBS Studios producing. The procedural serves as a reunion between the Supernatural alum and Fricke, as they previously worked alongside one another during Walker's four-season run.

Padalecki seems to be following in the footsteps of his Supernatural co-star, Jensen Ackles, when it comes to the roles he's going after. Ackles, who appeared as the older brother to Padalecki's character in the demon hunting TV show, recently appeared in Prime Video's Countdown, a fast-paced drama overflowing with explosive action. Sadly, the project was canned after just one season, but Ackles has stayed busy working alongside Justin Hartley on the set of the third season of Hartley's CBS series, Tracker. With Padalecki's medical production on the same network, maybe a crossover will be in store for the characters down the line. In the meantime, fans can expect to see the duo reunite with their fellow Supernatural pal, Misha Collins, on the upcoming final season of Prime Video's The Boys.

Stay tuned to Collider for more about Padalecki's newest project.

This year marks the 20th anniversary of the CW show Supernatural, and the 5th year since the last episode aired. Naturally, Funko is marking the occasion with new Pops. The first one on the list comes from season 14 of the show, when Dean Winchester was taken and possessed as the vessel for the archangel Michael. Lucky fans will get a Chase featuring Dean/Michael in a butcher's apron. The drop also includes Death (complete with Scythe), Bobby Singer, and Crowley on his King of Hell throne.

For longtime fans of the longtime series, these new Funko drops keep the fandom flame burning until the inevitable reunion happens. Pre-orders are now available here at Entertainment Earth but not on Amazon at the time of writing. Keep tabs on this Amazon page just in case they show up. Direct links and a gallery of images can be found below, and look for them to arrive on your doorstep in January 2026. 

If you were hoping for more Supernatural adventures, you're in luck. Just in time for the 20th anniversary, Dynamite Entertainment announced back in July that the adventures of Sam and Dean Winchester  will continue in a new comic book series that launched in October 2025. 

Interestingly enough, the new comic series is supposed to take place between season 1 and season 2 and considering that those Supernatural seasons were bridged by a cliffhanger, and Season 2 Episode 1 picked up directly where the events of the finale left off, it's going to be interesting to see where they fit in a new story. But comic books tend to have different ways of tackling the canon, so all that logic could be thrown right out the window. We'll just have to see what they're cooking up for Dean and Sam.

An early chunk of Prime 4 gameplay showcases exciting new psychic abilities that feel right at home in Samus's suite of powers.

By 
    Steve Watts
   on November 14, 2025 at 6:33AM PST

It has been 18 long years since the last Metroid Prime. Nintendo has not produced one since Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, so the question lingering over the announcement of Prime 4 has been: Does anyone still know how to make one of these? A lengthy hands-on ahead of its release in December reassured me that Retro Studios has the look and feel of Metroid Prime well in-hand, but more importantly, has its objective marker set on expanding the world with new psychic powers that feel just as natural as Samus's other abilities.

Our first taste of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, playable at the debut event for the Switch 2 itself, was composed of an initial tutorial section--an action spectacle as Samus comes to the aid of Federation forces under assault. That initial mission was meant to be a showpiece for both the game and the new hardware, and I walked away suitably impressed. This second hands-on event took place shortly after that slice of the game, still early enough to walk me through some of the core pillars of Prime 4, but more open-ended and familiar to Metroid fans.

In the midst of Samus lending aid to the Federation, she gets transported to a strange planet, cut off from communications and not entirely sure where she is--and of course, missing some key pieces of her equipment. At that point she discovers a psychic crystal, which fuses itself to her helmet and imbues her with the ability to interface with the planet's technology. The Lamorn, an ancient race native to the planet, believes Samus is their people's Chosen One, as the crystal chose to fuse itself to her. So in a way similar to how Samus has traditionally found Chozo artifacts that augment her suit, now she's finding psychically imbued Lamorn power-ups. It's familiar territory for Metroid Prime.

Samus isn't quite starting from zero this time. With the crystal comes a Psychic Beam, Psychic Hyper Beam, and Morph Ball abilities, but she's lost everything else. Most importantly, she's gained a new Psychic Visor, which pulls double-duty as both the scanning visor from the old Metroid Prime games, as well as the interface for many of her snappy new psychic abilities. This makes sense thematically, as it gives the feeling that you're moving objects with your "mind"--aka, your line of sight--instead of your arm cannon. You even see her raising her left hand to her temple in a classic Professor X gesture. And this sense of psychic power is accented by the only other speaking character in the demo commenting on how objects seem, from his perspective, to be moving by themselves as you manipulate them through telekinesis. More on him in a bit.

You quickly learn that to get off-planet you need to gather five master teleporter keys, and so the adventure begins in earnest. This is where Prime 4 opens up into more expansive exploration, but I could still feel the presence of training wheels. It's an early part of the game, so this is the first taste of exploration, with some limitations. It was still relatively linear and easy to tell where exactly you had to go, so I didn't feel overwhelmed by the alien landscape. I trust that feeling will fade as more areas open and get more complex, but I couldn't tell from this limited demo if the five sections will have interlocking exploration or if they're more segmented. The first one, at least, was almost entirely standalone, but I did see clues of things to come back to once I received other powers.

This section took place in an overgrown jungle in the shadow of a massive tree that's sacred to the Lamorn. And on a visual level, I had mixed feelings about this area. Nintendo excels at art direction and makes the most of its comparatively low hardware power, especially when it comes to the rubbery, cartoonish styles of Mario and his pals. When it comes to a more realistic style with lots of organic elements, the Switch 2 limitations, or perhaps Nintendo and Retro's inexperience with realism, are more apparent. The jungle looked merely fine, with overgrown brush mostly along the edges of flat dirt paths. There are moments that it looks surprisingly great, though, like when you navigate through vines as a morph ball and get to see the organic elements in a tightly controlled space, or viewing the sheen of calcified resin that blocks certain doors. It's not a bad-looking game by any means, but attempting a realistic art style for a familiar biome like "jungle" invites unflattering comparisons to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S games.

In this initial section, enemies were mostly minor nuisances and the emphasis was on exploring, learning about your powers, and acquiring a few new ones. Finding a missile power-up lets you crack through the resin. But you also get psychic twists on both new and old powers. You can grasp a psychic mote of light with your mind and then toss it into a receptacle to power up a door, or move elements with your mind to activate them, for example. That element adds a twist to your usual suite of powers, and gives you that much more reason to flip into your visor mode and see what you can interact with. One power, the Control Beam, lets you steer a projectile in slow-mo to aim it towards control switches or enemies.

As you explore, you run into Myles MacKenzie, a Federation engineer who has been marooned on this planet with you. Samus Aran is a bona fide legend, so Myles is obviously impressed, giving the relationship echoes of classic Halo games when ordinary people would come face-to-face with Master Chief. Myles is obviously in way over his head on a hostile planet where everything is trying to kill him, but he knows his way around machinery, so he's an asset. Your mileage may vary, but I found his hapless dorky chatterbox persona endearing, especially contrasted against Samus's quiet stoicism. Myles even comments on it at one point, which makes me think the relationship is intended to be comedic. After briefly escorting Myles to safety--and thankfully, without feeling like he was a burden--he mostly stuck to a control room and I was back to exploring the alien planet on my own.

The demo culminated in a boss battle against Carvex, an aggressive, sentient plant. The fight started by using your weapon to cut through weak points in the vines, but as more appeared, you had to use the Control Beam to cut through several sections of its vines near-simultaneously, which couldn't be done through normal fire, all while dodging its swinging and swaying tendrils. It was an exciting combat puzzle in the way the Prime games have excelled. And I was pleased to see that scanning it treated me to a little bit of extra story context, informing me that it had been rendered unable to communicate by fusing with a Metroid.

The prize for defeating Carvex was another new power, the Psychic Bomb, which ordinarily operates like a standard Metroid Prime bomb but can be charged to create a floating version that can be grabbed with your mind-powers just like the psychic motes. That lets you activate switches remotely, which then allowed me to open a transport pod.

What lies beyond that point is a mystery, and will be until the game releases on December 4. What I've seen so far, though, feels promising enough to fuel my anticipation. Nintendo and Retro Studios appear to understand the fundamental core of what makes a Metroid Prime game, with satisfying exploration, tense combat puzzles, and meaningful new abilities that change how you look at the world. The long wait is finally almost over, and Nintendo and Retro have shown themselves up to the task of matching a classic Metroid Prime--the final game, in its entirety, will let us know if the decades have helped Beyond exceed them.

Andrew Daniels and John Gilpatrick discuss how scientists saw a man move a magnetic field with his mind—then the government classified it.



What if your mind could do more than just think? What if it could manipulate the world around you?



That's the idea behind one of Pop Mech's most compelling recent stories, “The CIA Watched Him Bend Reality With Just His Mind—Then Tried to Turn His Consciousness Into a Weapon.” 

In 1972, an artist named Ingo Swann allegedly altered the magnetic field in a sealed vacuum chamber just by thinking about it. That event led to one of the most surreal programs in U.S. government history: Project Stargate.

Watch Pop Mech's Andrew Daniels and John Gilpatrick unpack the strange origins of Stargate, the Cold War paranoia that fueled it, and the CIA's mission to train “psychic spies” who could see across time and space through a technique called remote viewing. 

Andrew and John break down how the tests were run under ultra-secret conditions, and how the government tried—and maybe succeeded?—at unlocking human consciousness as a tool for intelligence gathering.

Some speculated that Disney chiefs were electing a new mouse 

VIRAL footage shows a black ring hovering above Disneyland, sparking a range of bizarre theories. 

It has prompted some to claim that aliens know where the so-called Happiest Place on Earth is located.

The video captured by a driver in Anaheim, California, has created quite a stir online.

Footage, seen by the CW affiliate KTLA-TV, shows the ring moving. 

And, Lori Nayahalski, who captured the video, said the black ring wasn't disappearing. 

“Real-life Matrix or just an orchestrated spoof,” she said.

Another joked it was Walt Disney “signalling” from beyond the grave.

Users suggested that the park was under an alien invasion.

“Even alien knows where the happiest place on earth is,” one chimed.

Disney fans have revealed they've seen the black ring in previous years.

“We were there one year and I thought for sure when I seen it we were under alien invasion attack!!” a Facebook user said. 

Disneyland officials have since confirmed what the black ring was. 

Pyrotechnics were tested before the park opened.


						FOR decades, UFOs and aliens were considered to be make belief things created by people in tinfoil hats but they are now considered a threat to national security.					

Long gone are those who claim conspiracy theories are all false as many are now discussed at the highest levels of government with US officials even admitting their existence.

As more and more credible witnesses continue to come forward to tell their extraordinary stories publicly.

The 2010s saw decades of stigmas around extraterrestrial life start to break down as politicians made UFO sightings a matter of national security.

Across the world, governments have also unveiled some spooky truths with some even showcasing “dead alien corpses” on display for Congress.

Researchers verified the legitimacy of a set of three-fingered mummies as potential evidence of “non-human” life forms.

The Pentagon also released a blockbuster 1,574 pages of real-life X-Files in 2022, related to its secretive UFO programme.

The haul includes reports into research on the biological effects of UFO sightings on humans, sets out categorisations for paranormal experiences, and studies into sci-fi-style tech.

Top UFO chief Sean Kirkpatrick told the world last year that he is set to step down from his job following his stern warning of concerning activity “in our backyard.”

The Pentagon‘s UFO analysis office launched a UFO reporting service to the public after admitting to uncovering “some things” and calling the high number of suspicious activity either a foreign power or aliens.

Navy jet footage has revealed the intriguing images of a government-confirmed UFO baffling the internet.

The United States Government launched the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in 2022 to investigate reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

Marnik light the torch for their next musical chapter with ‘The Ritual', a wrecking ball of energy that brings their epic techno sound even further to the forefront. Set for release on Zeitgeist, – sublabel of Intercord Records, the newly revitalized Virgin Records Germany and home of harder dance genres –, the single sees Marnik continue to stake their claim as one of the most fearless and in-demand acts on the current techno circuit. Out now, ‘The Ritual' has officially begun, all that's left is to answer the call.

From its opening bars, ‘The Ritual' locks into a ceremonial chant and entrancing beat, highlighting the larger than life nature of Marnik's epic techno sound. The speedometer clocks in at a scolding 150BPM, with the track pushed to even bolder heights with ripping synths and a kinetic low-end that insists on walking the edge of insanity. In all, it makes for a perfect debut with Zeitgeist as part of Intercord Records (the newly renamed Virgin Records Germany), as both the duo and the label set their creative sights on the harder side of the electronic spectrum.

The release arrives as Marnik extend a decade-long run that's surpassed one billion streams and taken them to some of the world's biggest stages, from Tomorrowland in Belgium to Ushuaïa in Ibiza. Their upward trajectory shows no signs of slowing, with ‘The Ritual' acting as a guiding light as they continue to climb the stairs of success. This month, they take that momentum eastward, bringing their explosive sound to Sri Lanka and Indonesia for a duo of shows that promise to turn ‘The Ritual' into reality.



Italian duo Marnik are one of the most prominent and influential names in electronic music today. Over the course of their decade-long career, Alex and Lele have surpassed 1 billion streams, blending a relentless touring schedule with cutting-edge studio work to stay at the forefront of the global electronic scene. Manrik's unique approach sees Alex commanding the stage at premier festivals and clubs including Tomorrowland, Sunburn, Creamfields, Ushuaïa, Story Miami, as well as headlining tours across Europe and Asia.

Meanwhile, Lele focuses on crafting their sound in the studio, creating a seamless synergy between high-energy live performances and a steady stream of fresh releases. From global radio hits such as “Boyz In Paris” and “Gam Gam”, to genre-defining anthems like “Bazaar” and “Mandala,” Marnik's discography continues to resonate with fans worldwide. In 2025, Marnik achieved a career milestone, climbing to #80 in DJ Mag's Top 100, up 10 positions from the 2024 chart. The same year, the duo also launched their own label and imprint, ARENA, which is poised to make waves in the Electronic scene. Celebrating 10 years of innovation, Marnik are proving there's no limit to what's next.

 The enigmatic interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has captivated astronomers worldwide, and fresh observations have led some experts to speculate it may actually be an extraterrestrial spacecraft. 

The enigmatic interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has captivated astronomers worldwide, and fresh observations have led some experts to speculate it may actually be an extraterrestrial spacecraft.

Researchers noted a series of puzzling irregularities, including its survival of a close encounter with the Sun, enormous unexplained jets, and a peculiar “anti-tail,” News.Az reports, citing The Mirror.

Unlike typical comets, 3I/ATLAS remained intact and luminous after passing near the Sun, defying expectations.

Astronomers also detected an unusual radio signal emanating from the object, sparking speculation that it could be an alien vessel. Harvard professor Avi Loeb has suggested that the comet's strange behaviors—such as its anti-tail and twin jets—could be the result of “technological thrusters,” implying it might be a mothership from another planet.

Fresh images from the Nordic Optical Telescope, a 2.56-meter research telescope situated at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on the island of La Palma, Spain's Canary Islands showed that 3I/ATLAS continues to display a confounding "anti-tail".

The "anti-tail" was spotted as a streak of debris strangely pointing toward the Sun, even as the object races away from it.

Typically, a comet's tail streams behind, pushed by solar winds, but this weird reversal has left experts puzzled, with some proposing it's just an optical illusion, the Daily Mail reported.

Additionally, the newest images also reveal two massive jets shooting from 3I/ATLAS, one aimed directly at the Sun and the other, nearly three times longer, firing in the opposite direction.

Considering the object's small size, roughly 3.5 miles wide, Professor Loeb has argued there's simply not enough ice to account for such intense eruptions, rejecting the notion that they're merely water vapor.

Instead he has supported a disputed theory that these could be "technological thrusters", suggesting a potential alien spacecraft, a assertion that's triggered heated debate among scientists worldwide.

The professor posted on his Medium blog: "This post-perihelion manoeuvre might be employed by a spacecraft that aims to gain speed rather than slow down through the gravitational assist from the sun."

Loeb had previously issued warnings the massive space rock could be an "extraterrestrial artefact" preparing to make first contact. But most scientists believe it's a comet that has been journeying for billions of years.

It's also thought that the recently detected radio waves are evidence of its natural origins, resulting from specific wavelength absorption related to the presence of hydroxyl radicals, or OH molecules, in the comet's coma, according to Livescience.

The publication explains: "These radicals are formed by the breakdown of water molecules as they are ejected from the comet via a natural process known as outgassing, which is a clear sign of cometary activity, according to a 2016 study."

3I/ATLAS is the enigmatic 'comet' that has captivated the globe in recent weeks.

Fresh observations now suggest it might actually be an extraterrestrial spacecraft. This speculation comes after researchers examined a string of puzzling irregularities, including its ability to survive a close encounter with the Sun, enormous unexplained jets, and a peculiar "anti-tail".

Just days ago, astronomers detected a strange radio signal from the mysterious interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS as it raced through our solar system, sparking wild theories that it could be an alien vessel. The so-called "anomaly" has left scientists stunned by enduring a scorching encounter with the Sun without falling apart - something no typical comet could achieve, reports the Daily Star.

Rather than breaking up, 3I/ATLAS appeared as one solid, luminous object, featuring a strange "anti-tail" and two massive jets shooting material in opposing directions - occurrences that experts claim violate the laws of physics.

Consequently, Harvard professor Avi Loeb has recently suggested these strange behaviors could be the result of "technological thrusters", implying the object might be a mothership from another planet.

Fresh images from the Nordic Optical Telescope, a 2.56-meter research telescope situated at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on the island of La Palma, Spain's Canary Islands showed that 3I/ATLAS continues to display a confounding "anti-tail".

The "anti-tail" was spotted as a streak of debris strangely pointing toward the Sun, even as the object races away from it.

By Vatican News

The Dicastery of the Doctrine of the Faith has determined that “the phenomenon of the alleged apparitions said to take place in Dozulé” linked to the creation of an enormous cross that would guarantee remission of sins and salvation to those who approached it, “is to be considered, definitively, as not supernatural in origin.”

The Dicastery's decision was communicated in a letter in a letter signed by the Prefect, Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernández, authorizing Bishop Jacques Habert of Bayeux-Lisieux to issue the relevant decree. The decision was approved by Pope Leo XIV on November 3.

In the French town of Dozulé, Jesus is said to have appeared 49 times between 1972 and 1978 to Madeleine Aumont, a mother, asking for the construction of the so-called “Glorious Cross of Dozulé,” which was never built. The cross was to be fully illuminated and reach a height of 738 meters, with arms measuring 123 meters, thus visible from far away as a sign of universal redemption. In recent decades, “Crosses of Love” have been erected in various countries around the world, scaled down to one hundredth of the size of the “Glorious” cross.

As early as April 1983, the then-diocesan bishop, Jean-Marie-Clément Badré, stated that “in no case can the construction of a monumental cross undertaken in Dozulé (...) be an authentic sign of the manifestation of the Spirit of God.” On December 8, 1985, the same bishop declared: “Regarding what is taking place at Dozulé—the activity and the agitation, the collection of funds by people acting on their own initiative, without a mandate and without respect for the authority of the Bishop; […] the fanatical propaganda in favor of the ‘message'; […] the categorical condemnation of those who do not adhere to it—I am led, in conscience, to judge that, beyond all this ferment, I do not discern the signs that would authorize me to declare the alleged ‘apparitions' to be authentic, nor to recognize a mission given to the Church to spread this ‘message.'”

On the basis of recent guidelines for discerning alleged supernatural phenomena, the current bishop, Bishop Habert, has requested authorization from the Dicastery to issue a declaratio de non supernaturalitate, that is that “the phenomenon of the alleged apparitions of Dozulé is not of supernatural origin.”

Cardinal Fernández's letter accepts the Bishop's proposal: “This Dicastery authorizes Your Excellency to draw up the corresponding Decree and to declare that the phenomenon of the alleged apparitions said to have taken place in Dozulé is to be regarded, definitively, as not supernatural in origin, with all the consequences that flow from this determination.”

The letter highlights a number of problematic elements in the messages associated with the phenomenon, including the comparison of “the cross requested in Dozulé with the Cross of Jerusalem,” which “risks confusing the sign with the mystery, and risks giving the impression that what Christ has accomplished once and for all could be “reproduced” or “renewed” in a physical sense.”

It is also notes that “some formulations contained in the alleged messages of Dozulé insist upon the construction of ‘the Glorious Cross' as a new sign, necessary for the salvation of the world, or as a privileged means of obtaining universal forgiveness and peace. At times, there is a mention of ‘multiplying the sign,' as if such diffusion were a mission given by Christ Himself.”

“The Cross does not need 738 meters of steel or concrete to be recognized,” the Dicastery declares. Rather, the Cross “is raised every time a heart, moved by grace, opens itself to forgiveness; every time a soul converts; every time hope is rekindled where the situation seemed impossible; and even when, by kissing a small cross, believers entrust themselves to Christ.”

It goes on to reiterate that “no private revelation may be considered a universal obligation or a sign binding the conscience of the faithful, even if spiritual fruits may accompany such phenomena. The Church encourages expressions of faith that lead to conversion and charity, but warns against every form of ‘sacralization of the sign' that leads people to consider a material object as a guarantee of salvation.”

The messages of Dozulé say that “all those who will have come to repent at the foot of ‘the Glorious Cross' will be saved,” that “‘the Glorious Cross' will take away all sin,” and that all those who “come there with faith to repent will be saved in this life and for eternity.” The Dicastery states emphatically that “such expressions are incompatible with the Catholic doctrine on salvation, grace, and the sacraments.”

The letter then points out other messages that have been disproven by events. One such message, for example, asked for the “Glorious Cross” and Shrine to be built before the end of the 1975 Holy Year, “for it will be the last Holy Year.” “Clearly, this purported prophecy was not fulfilled,” the Dicastery notes, as two other ordinary Holy Years (2000 and 2025) and two extraordinary Holy Years (1983 and 2016) have subsequently been celebrated.

The Dicastery also notes various apocalyptic statements which suggest the Lord's proximate or even imminent return, such as the one in which it is claimed that Jesus said: “If the cross is not erected, I will cause it to appear—but there will be no more time.”

“Although the theme of the Lord's return is an integral part of the Christian Faith,” the Dicastery says, “the Church—while recalling that Christ's return is a truth of the faith, even though no one can know or predict the precise date or its signs—remains alert against millenarian or chronological interpretations, which risk setting the time or determining the modalities for the Final Judgment.”

Concluding the letter, the Dicastery explains, “The cross, as a sign of devotion, is never mere exteriority. When Christians venerate the cross, they do not adore the wood or metal, nor do they think that a material cross can replace the saving work already accomplished in Christ's Paschal Mystery. Instead, they adore the One who offered His life upon it…The veneration of the Cross thus forms us in a tangible spirituality and an incarnate faith: not an abstraction, but a way of facing life with our gaze fixed upon the Crucified, recognizing in every trial the possibility of a redemptive encounter.”

Nightcrawler Research, a data-focused UFO investigation team, reports capturing footage of three unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in New York. In each case, the citizen journalists say the objects disrupted camera performance during recording. They further disclosed that their efforts have drawn attention from the FBI and other federal agencies.

During an interview with host Ross Coulthart on NewsNation's “Reality Check,” Nightcrawler Research's John Tedesco revealed that one of the UFO sightings they captured on video in New York took place July 5. (RELATED: Mysterious ‘Crop Doodle' Spotted In Argentine Wheat Field)

“This was an object that presented over the water. Initially, what we saw was something that, roughly about 600 feet from the surface off the Atlantic Ocean, we saw an object that was not very luminous, very, very low, low light, not really in the IR, some visible light was present, and we noticed that the light presented in the same basic area, the same area of the sky,” said Coulthart.

“Within a short period of time, that object disappeared, and we saw this, what looked like a sphere on the water, an extremely bright, luminous sphere.”



Later in the conversation, the research team described additional UFO encounters. In one instance, they captured footage of an object seemingly entering and exiting the water. They also detailed another sighting involving a number of black triangular crafts, which they detected inside a cloud and recorded using radar.

Coulthart questioned the team whether or not federal agencies, such as the FBI, have been treating their reported UFO sightings seriously, with Tedesco responding, “Absolutely. It's an ongoing thing with them. They're certainly very concerned about it. And, you know, our communication, it's been ongoing.”

In Montana's ancient rocks, scientists uncovered the tiny remains of a land-dwelling crocodyliform that challenges what we thought we knew about crocodile evolution.

Around 95 million years ago, a small crocodyliform affectionately called Elton roamed what is now southwest Montana, near the ancient shoreline of the Western Interior Seaway.

According to Montana State University paleontology professor David Varricchio, the juvenile measured less than 2 feet long from snout to tail—roughly the size of a large lizard. Even as an adult, it would have reached only about 3 feet in length, making it much smaller than most members of the Neosuchia clade, which includes modern crocodiles and their extinct relatives. Most of these species were aquatic or semi-aquatic predators equipped with simple, conical teeth suited for catching prey in the water.

Elton, however, was different. It lived on land and likely fed on plants, insects, or small animals, using its varied and specialized teeth to process a wider range of food. Its distinctive features revealed that it belonged to a newly identified family of crocodyliforms native to Cretaceous-era North America.

This remarkable discovery might never have happened without the keen observation of Harrison Allen, a 2023 graduate of MSU's Department of Earth Sciences in the College of Letters and Science. During a 2021 field excavation in the Blackleaf Formation near Dillon, Montana, Allen—then a student in Varricchio's paleontology course—spotted a tiny fossil, no larger than his pinkie tip, with a “weird texture on it.”

“I brought it to Dr. Varricchio and knew it must be something good, because he said, ‘Take me to where you found this,'” said Allen, who is now studying croc paleontology as a doctoral student at Stony Brook University in New York.

It was an exciting moment for Allen, originally from Kentucky, who chose MSU because it offers a paleontology track for undergraduates majoring in earth sciences. Four years and hundreds of hours of study later, he is the lead author of a paper published this week in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology that describes the morphology and scientific significance of the creature whose remains he found in the Blackleaf Formation.

“After the dig, Dr. Varricchio told me why he was so excited the day I found the initial specimen. It had so much visible anatomy to explore, and he could see it was a tiny, tiny croc skull, fully articulated and preserved – it was a special thing,” Allen said. “We have found dinosaurs (in the Blackleaf) before, but this was the second known vertebrate animal we'd ever found in this formation.”

The extinct animal, which Allen and the paper's co-authors later named Thikarisuchus xenodentes for its strange, sheathed teeth, has provided new information about the paleoecology of the Blackleaf ecosystem and about patterns of evolution in the croc family tree.

It also provided the ultimate undergraduate research project for Allen, who delved into the painstaking process of excavating, sifting, and reconstructing the Thikarisuchus remains with the help of some fellow students.

“As an undergraduate student new to research, I nervously went up to Dr. Varricchio and asked if I could study this specimen,” Allen said. “It led me down the rabbit hole into this amazing world of prehistoric, extinct crocs and their evolutionary niches.”

The day after Allen recovered the first piece of skeleton, he and his classmates scooped up several bags of sediment from the mound where it was found. Back in Bozeman, Allen and his friend Dane Johnson, who graduated in 2022 and is now a paleontology lab and field specialist at MSU's Museum of the Rockies, spent between 10 and 20 hours sifting out fine particulate matter and dirt, eventually recovering dozens of tiny pieces of the Thikarisuchus skeleton that collectively fit into the palm of Allen's hand. As they worked, they listened to music, including Elton John's 1970s hit “Crocodile Rock.” The nickname “Elton” stuck, long before the specimen was assigned the scientific name that reflects its physical traits.

Allen and Johnson recovered bits of bone from almost all areas of the animal's body, including its limbs, vertebrae, jaw and 50-millimeter-long skull. Because the fragments were tiny and exceptionally fragile, the students didn't attempt to physically reassemble them. Instead, they took them for a series of CT scans, including some at MSU's Subzero Research Laboratory. Allen estimates that he spent well over 100 hours coloring the digital, 2D segment slices that the scans produced, a process necessary to visually distinguish the bones from the rocks they were embedded in.

“Harrison worked super hard to digitally reconstruct the animal, and it came out beautifully,” said Varricchio.

During the process, Allen discovered that the bones of Thikarisuchus were densely concentrated and organized in a manner consistent with fossils of organisms found in burrows in the Blackleaf Formation and the nearby Wayan Formation in Idaho. He said this suggests that Thikarisuchus was likewise preserved within a burrow, further supporting the notion that fossils recovered from these formations are biased toward those that were preserved in burrows.

The specimen also presented clues about Thikarisuchus' newly named family group Wannchampsidae and a similar group found in Eurasia known as Atopasauridae. Both groups were tiny and terrestrially adapted, and they shared certain cranial and dental features found in another more distantly related group from the Cretaceous of Africa and South America.

“It suggests that during the same time period, we're seeing convergent evolution between two distantly related groups due to similar environmental conditions, prey availability, and who-knows-what that prompted crocs on opposite sides of the planet to develop similar features,” Allen said.

As he works toward his Ph.D. and a career as a paleontology professor, Allen said his experiences with Elton cemented his research interest, which has since broadened to include extinct crocs from all over the world.

“The majority of diversity of crocodyliforms is in the past. There were fully marine crocs, fully terrestrial crocs, herbivorous crocs, omnivores, and some that cracked shells,” he said. “That amazed me and made me want to get into this more specific realm of paleontology.”

Varricchio said he feels fortunate that students like Allen choose to study at MSU.

“It was a true pleasure to have Harrison as a student here – so much positive enthusiasm, followed up with great research,” he said.

Production photos have been released from Center Theatre Group's presentation of Paranormal Activity, the new stage production with an original story inspired by Paramount Pictures' film franchise. 

Center Theatre Group will present Paranormal Activity with an original story based on Paramount Pictures' terrifying film franchise—now live on stage from November 13 to December 7 at the Ahmanson Theatre, the third attraction of the 2025–2026 season. The press opening is November 14. Tickets are available at CenterTheatreGroup.org.

Paranormal Activity, in its North American premiere production, is from Levi Holloway, who chilled Broadway audiences with his Tony Award-nominated Grey House in 2023, and Felix Barrett, pioneering founder and artistic director of the acclaimed Punchdrunk, whose immersive Sleep No More played more than 5,000 performances in a record-breaking 14-year run in New York at The McKittrick Hotel. Barrett and Punchdrunk are currently represented in New York by Viola's Room at The Shed through October 19.

Paranormal Activity features illusions by Tony Award-winner Chris Fisher, whose work includes the West End and Broadway productions of Stranger Things: The First Shadow, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, and Back to the Future, along with the West End and Center Theatre Group productions of 2:22.

The North American premiere began at Chicago Shakespeare Theater from October 8 to November 2 before moving to the Ahmanson Theatre. Following Los Angeles, the production will be presented by Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, D.C. from January 28 to February 7, and American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco from February 19 to March 15.

The story follows James and Lou, who move from Chicago to London to escape the past but soon discover that places aren't haunted—people are. The cast includes Cher Álvarez, Patrick Heusinger, Shannon Cochran and Kate Fry.

Levi Holloway said, “Writing Paranormal Activity for the stage, collaborating with Felix Barrett in London—working to create an actual nightmare—has been a dream. We strived to create something impossible, mixing the familiar with the uncanny, heart with horror. Chicago audiences have a nose for honesty on stage and little patience for anything else. They'll find it here, right alongside all the mischief we've made to trouble their sleep.”

Playing Lou and James— a couple trying to escape a sinister force—are Cher Álvarez and Patrick Heusinger. Álvarez has appeared on television in Grey's Anatomy and NCIS: Hawai'i, and has performed at The Goodman Theatre, Steppenwolf Theatre and Writers Theatre, with additional credits at Milwaukee Repertory Theatre and American Players Theatre.

Heusinger has been seen on Broadway in Next Fall and Fiddler on the Roof and starred as Lancelot in the national tour of Spamalot. His television credits include Gossip Girl, Royal Pains and Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce.

The cast also includes Shannon Cochran as James' mother, Carolanne, and Kate Fry as Mrs. Cotgrave, a medium. Cochran's credits include the West Coast premiere of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child in San Francisco, the national tour of Roundabout Theatre Company's Cabaret, and the first national tour of August: Osage County. This production marks her return to the horror genre following her appearance in the 2002 film The Ring. Fry, whose many credits include Henry V, As You Like It, Henry IV Parts 1 and 2, and The Merchant of Venice at Chicago Shakespeare Theater, has recently appeared in The Cherry Orchard at Goodman Theatre and Birthday Candles at Northlight Theatre.

Levi Holloway is an ensemble member of A Red Orchid Theatre, which debuted his plays Grey House—later produced on Broadway—and Turret, starring Michael Shannon. He has performed as an actor with Lookingglass Theatre and Steppenwolf Theatre. Holloway is co-founder of the Neverbird Project, a youth-based deaf and hard of hearing theatre company that creates work for deaf audiences. He previously taught in the deaf department at Bell Elementary in Chicago for more than a decade and teaches playwriting at Silk Road Rising.

Felix Barrett is the founder and artistic director of Punchdrunk and has conceived and directed productions such as Sleep No More, The Burnt City and Viola's Room. He directed the critically acclaimed 2024 UK premiere of Paranormal Activity at Leeds Playhouse, which moves to the West End this winter.

The creative team includes Fly Davis (scenic and costume design), Anna Watson (lighting design), Gareth Fry (sound design), Luke Halls (video and projections design), Chris Fisher (illusions design), Bob Mason (casting), Travis A. Knight (assistant director), Camille Etchart (UK associate scenic designer), Frank McCollugh (US associate scenic designer), Abby May (US associate lighting designer), Will Pickens (US associate sound designer), Lianne Arnold (US associate video and projections designer), Skylar Fox (associate illusions designer), Daniel Weissglass (assistant illusions designer), Melanie J. Lisby (production stage manager), Julie Jachym (assistant stage manager) and Emma W. Lipson (production assistant).

Summary:

Kim Kardashian took the California bar exam after a six-year journey to become a lawyer in June 2025.

After calling psychics “pathological liars” in a TikTok video, Kim sparked reactions from fans and fellow celebrities.

While psychics have a long history, the rise of platforms like #WitchTok has made spirituality a viral trend.

Kim Kardashian has been on an unconventional six-year journey to become a lawyer, and in June 2025, she finally took the California bar exam. A long-time criminal justice reform advocate, she previously expressed confidence she had passed, though that confidence may have come more from her family's psychics than her studies. In a TikTok recap of her mother Kris Jenner's 70th birthday, Kim called the psychics “pathological liars”, sparking reactions from fans and highlighting a trend among celebrities like Khloé Kardashian, Jennifer Lopez, and Brad Pitt, who have all consulted psychics for guidance.

Psychics have fascinated people for centuries, from ancient temples to 19th-century parlors, and today, Gen Z has made the metaphysical world a viral trend on platforms like TikTok's #WitchTok. While many explore spirituality and alternative practices online, scammers have also taken advantage, with most readings focusing on money, love, and careers, making discernment crucial. Even so, some psychics, like Matt Fraser, suggest the spirit world operates on its own timeline — meaning Kim could still pass the bar, the next time she takes it.

The disclosure of emails from the paedophile financier has fuelled calls for the full release of FBI files on his case

It is 20 years since Florida police first investigated the financier Jeffrey Epstein for the sexual abuse of underage girls; six years since he killed himself in prison following his arrest on federal sex-trafficking charges; and more than a year since Donald Trump said that he would have “no problem” with releasing the FBI files on the offender.

As the Democratic politician Ro Khanna noted, releasing the files “was core to Trump's promise … It was his central theme that the American corrupt elite had betrayed forgotten Americans”. The question is not only what Epstein's associates did, but also what they knew and what they did not do. It is not only about their own behaviour, but about any knowledge or suspicion of his crimes, and willingness to overlook them.

Yet the Maga base is still waiting. Mr Trump has said that he had “no idea” about Epstein's crimes. On Wednesday, questions were reignited by the Democrats' release of emails in which Epstein described Mr Trump as “that dog that hasn't barked”, adding that “[victim's name redacted] spent hours at my house with him”. Republicans said the victim was the late Virginia Giuffre, who told lawyers that “I don't think Donald Trump participated in anything”. Separately, Epstein wrote that “of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine [Maxwell] to stop” and that “Trump knew of it” but “he never got a massage”.

Mr Trump, who has mainstreamed and legitimised conspiracy politics and the championing of emotion over fact, attacks the issue as a “hoax”. The very people who urged Maga supporters to pursue this story – such as Kash Patel, now FBI chief – abruptly changed their minds this year without adequate explanation. Republicans released thousands of documents in response to the emails published by Democrats. But Mr Trump faces a bipartisan demand for the full release of the files, with members of the Maga far right joining Democrats.

The Republicans took a drubbing in off-year elections last week, and Mr Trump's approval rating is the lowest of this term. The ending of the longest government shutdown in history – after a handful of Democrats folded on Wednesday – relieved the White House, but opens the way for a vote on releasing the files, expected next week.

Mr Trump has shaken off troubles that would have ended any other political career – including E Jean Carroll's successful civil suit against him for sexual abuse (which he is again asking the supreme court to dismiss) and two dozen allegations of sexual assault, which he denies. The full release of documents might aid him: the slow drip of information has kept the scandal running and made it look, rightly or wrongly, as if the administration has something worse to hide.

For the Maga base, previously fired up by lurid and false “Pizzagate” claims of a paedophile ring connected to the Democratic political elite, this remains a burning issue. Their claims about Epstein's circle have at times been partisan, provably wrong and antisemitic. Yet it's hard to deny that the mills of justice usually grind slower when the rich and well-connected are involved, and that powerful figures who benefited from a relationship with Epstein, such as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and Peter Mandelson, have sought to avoid scrutiny and minimise their ties. It took the courage of victims and dogged reporting to make Epstein accountable, and it took far too long. A fuller reckoning for his associates – from across the political spectrum – is overdue.
