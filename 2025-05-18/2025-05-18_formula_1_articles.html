This allowed for those who had yet to stop to visit the pits without losing much time – and this most crucially included Verstappen, who pitted before emerging back on track with a staggering lead of around 20s from Norris in P2. But there was more drama to come later on when a Safety Car was deployed owing to Kimi Antonelli pulling off track on Lap 46 due to an issue with his Mercedes, allowing Verstappen to stop again – as did Norris, while the other McLaren of Piastri did not, raising questions over whether the papaya team would opt to let the Briton move ahead of his team mate upon the restart. The restart was executed flawlessly by Verstappen, who went on to clinch a fourth consecutive win at Imola in Red Bull's 400th Grand Prix start – while, six seconds behind him, Norris had overtaken Piastri for P2, with the Australian then doing enough to hold off Lewis Hamilton behind him in fourth following a solid recovery drive for Ferrari after their Qualifying woes. Alex Albon continued a good run for Williams by taking P5, having won out in a feisty late-race battle with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc that left the Monegasque in P6. George Russell, meanwhile, took P7 as the sole Mercedes finisher following Antonelli's retirement, while Carlos Sainz added to William's tally in P8. Piastri was amongst those to make an early pit stop in the race Isack Hadjar was ninth for Racing Bulls in another notable performance from the rookie, with Yuki Tsunoda climbing his way up to 10th to claim the final point on offer, perhaps bringing some solace to the Red Bull driver after his dramatic crash in Saturday's Qualifying. Pierre Gasly followed in P13 for Alpine, ahead of Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson and Aston Martin's Lance Stroll. Two changes had been made to the starting order prior to the 63-lap race getting underway, with Colapinto receiving a one-place grid penalty for a rule breach during Qualifying, having entered the fast lane of the pit lane before a session restart time had been confirmed following a red flag in Q1. This meant that the Argentinian – in his first event back on the F1 grid since his nine-race stint as a substitute for Williams in 2024 – would line up in P16 for Alpine, with the returning driver surely hoping for a better Sunday after ultimately crashing out of Qualifying. Tsunoda, meanwhile, was set to start from the pit lane. Elsewhere Hamilton was also looking racy as he tried to find a way past Antonelli in a duel for P11, with the Mercedes ultimately holding the position. Up front, meanwhile, Verstappen had built a lead of 1.6s from Piastri by Lap 5, the pair followed by Russell, Norris, Alonso, Sainz, Albon, Stroll, Leclerc and Hadjar. While Imola might be a tricky circuit to overtake on, there were plenty of drivers trying to pressure their opponents in battles across the pack. That fight between Russell and Norris continued to heat up, leading to Norris trying to make a move on Lap 9 before an attempt one tour later saw the McLaren briefly dip his wheels onto the grass. “I'm not sure how I'm going to make it to the target lap, pushing like this,” Russell radioed in, voicing concerns about his tyre life. After all of this, Russell dived into the pit lane to swap his medium tyres for a set of the hards, with a flurry of pit stops suddenly taking place a little earlier than had been expected. Verstappen, meanwhile, had stayed out on track with a 10-second lead over Norris – who was also yet to pit – while the Dutchman's team mate Tsunoda tried to make Piastri's life more difficult as the Australian tried to overtake him for P10, the Japanese racer putting up a good fight before the McLaren ultimately made a successful move. As Piastri gained further positions by picking off more cars that had yet to stop – that being Bearman and Colapinto – Leclerc continued his own ascent by clinching P11 from Tsunoda. And up at the front, Norris was told by his engineer: “The key for us is free air and going long.” Would a one-stop work for those extending their opening stints? 2025 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix: Norris battles past Russell take P3 Hamilton, meanwhile, was also on a split strategy to the other Ferrari and debated whether an undercut could be effective, only to be told that there was too much traffic around him. By Lap 25, Verstappen remained nine seconds clear of Norris up front, followed by Albon, Hadjar, Antonelli, Hamilton, Piastri, Hulkenberg, Leclerc and Bearman, with Piastri and Leclerc the only two in that top 10 to have made a pit stop. It did not take long for that order to change as Piastri swept past Hamilton for sixth place, meaning that Antonelli was next in his sights. Having to carve through this traffic was not helping the championship leader out, with the gamble to pit him early seemingly not paying off. Piastri also made a second stop, bringing him back out into P4, while some potential unsafe releases looked to have occurred during those busy few minutes in the pit lane. After all of this had shaken out and the VSC period had come to an end, the order on Lap 33 stood as Verstappen – now holding a whopping lead of 19 seconds – from Norris, Albon, Piastri, Hadjar, Antonelli, Hamilton, Leclerc, Alonso and Stroll. Hamilton, meanwhile, looked to be in dynamic form after benefitting from a stop during the VSC phase, the seven-time World Champion taking P6 from Antonelli before surging ahead of Hadjar for P5. Speaking of squad strategy decisions, Gasly voiced his gratitude as the Frenchman was allowed through on new team mate Colapinto to move up into P15, giving the opportunity to chase down Stroll up ahead. Another person not experiencing much luck was home favourite Antonelli, who pulled off onto the grass at Turn 8 on Lap 46 due to an issue with his Mercedes. A full Safety Car was then deployed – and Verstappen took the opportunity to pit again, having been placed well on track to make the stop. Norris also visited the pits but suffered a slightly slow stop, bringing the Briton out in third behind Piastri who had not pitted again. Albon also made another stop before emerging back on track in fifth, with the top 10 now standing as Verstappen, Piastri, Norris, Leclerc, Albon, Russell, Hamilton, Sainz, Hadjar and Hulkenberg. There looked to be concerns about tyre life ahead of the restart, with Leclerc questioning whether he could remain in the points on his older rubber while Norris pointed out that Piastri's 18-lap-old hard tyres may not hold out well – in contrast to his own fresher rubber. While the Dutchman was already 1.5s clear one tour down, Norris had closed to within one second of Piastri in what could prove to be a quandary for McLaren. Hamilton had soon overtaken his former team mate to move up into sixth, just as Norris was getting ever closer to fellow McLaren driver Piastri. As the pair went side-by-side into Turn 2, Norris slipped through to grab second place. Things got incredibly close on Lap 60, with the two cars getting nail-bitingly close – resulting in Albon running through the gravel and dropping back down to sixth. This allowed Hamilton to move up into fifth – before subsequently snatching fourth from his team mate and surging ahead of his fresher rubber. Up ahead, Verstappen crossed the line to seal a 65th career victory some 6.109s ahead of Norris in second, while Piastri followed by a similar margin to his team mate in third. Hamilton ended his first Italian race as a Ferrari driver in fourth, with the Briton dedicating his result to the Tifosi. Albon held onto fifth ahead of Leclerc, while Russell took some valuable points for Mercedes in seventh on a day where only one of their cars made the finish. Antonelli and Ocon both recorded a DNF at Imola, with each having to pull off the track owing to an issue on their respective cars. I could look after my tyres and we had very good pace today. "Again, a massive improvement from Friday, and I'm very pleased for that. That VSC was quite handy to pit, and even then, even on the hard compound, I think our pace was very strong.

Max Verstappen completed a bold and brilliant move on Oscar Piastri around the outside of the first corner to snatch the lead as Sunday's Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix got under way in dramatic style.

Piastri initially held his pole position advantage off the line, while Verstappen worked hard to keep Mercedes rival George Russell at bay, but the tables were turned as the field approached the Tamburello chicane.
