                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Whether you're a longtime fan or still working your way through the 15-season show, there's one episode of the horror-turned-fantasy series that proved it still had some life left in it when many had written it off. After a tough batch of episodes in Season 7, Supernatural's eighth season took things back to the show's roots. Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles) were back on the road, demons (and some angels) were the main opponents, and the brothers struggled to work through their crap, per usual. But after the return of Castiel (Misha Collins), the three go on their first hunt together (okay, their first non-mythology hunt) in "Hunteri Heroici." After Castiel finds a case involving explosive hearts, the trio set off for Oklahoma City, only to discover that the physics of Saturday morning cartoons have become reality, at least in certain locations for a brief period of time. That means anvils are dropped on heads, love-lorn hearts burst out of chests, and one may even float in midair for a moment before plummeting to their death. Everything gets a bit wackier when Sam and Dean realize that the man responsible is actually an old family friend named Fred Jones (Mike Farrell) — and yes, his name is clearly a nod to the Scooby-Doo character of the same name. Five seasons before Season 13's iconic "Scoobynatural" episode, where the Winchesters are pulled into the world of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?, cartoons came to life in the real world in "Hunteri Heroici." Having lost his mental faculties over the years, Fred Jones, a psychokinetic, is unknowingly projecting cartoon reality into the real world — an effect that his doctor, Dwight Mahoney (Greg Webb), uses to his advantage. It turns out that Mahoney has been robbing those living in the nursing home by drawing black holes on the wall, stepping through them, and stealing from banks, homes, and other hiding places. It's quite a gambit, and he would've gotten away with it too if not for the meddling hunters getting into his business. A great Supernatural episode, written by future showrunner Andrew Dabb, "Hunteri Heroici" is loads of fun because you never know what's going to happen next. Action sequences turn into big gags, and the mystery itself is quite enticing. Of course, it's Supernatural, so the ending is a bit of a downer compared to some Looney Tunes episodes, but hey, what else would you expect from a horror show? Part of what has always drawn many fans to Supernatural was how weird and strange the show could be. From its earliest seasons, the Winchesters have been involved in highly comedic horror shows that proved that horror and comedy go together quite well. Although "Scoobynatural" may be a better example of this idea brought to life, it reverses the idea that Andrew Dabb displays here, namely that cartoons can become reality rather than the other way around. What makes "Hunteri Heroici" work so well is that it commits to the cartoon gag when it can, but feels like a standard Supernatural episode/case when that element takes a backseat. Fred Jones may be obvious as a Scooby-Doo reference, but his name also connects to Fred Quimby and Chuck Jones, two animation powerhouses responsible for Tom & Jerry and Looney Tunes adventures. The episode also name-drops Woody Woodpecker and Bugs Bunny (who Castiel believes is a giant insect-rabbit mutant), and the first victim, Gary Freleng (Andrew Zachar), is a direct reference to Friz Freleng, a longtime animator and co-creator of Bugs Bunny himself. In that sense, "Hunteri Heroici" honors them well. Season 7 was a major let-down for many who loved the show's earliest seasons. Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver) was killed off, Dick Roman (James Patrick Stuart) wasn't quite the compelling antagonist that fans had come to expect, and Castiel's entire arc was, well, strange. That's not to mention that the Impala is MIA for a handful of episodes, making much of the season feel a bit alien by comparison. The two seasons where Sera Gamble served as showrunner (Seasons 6 and 7, aka "the Gamble Era") were full of great standalone episodes but struggled to maintain a consistent or engaging plot. When Jeremy Carver took over in Season 8, that began to change, and eventually, "Hunteri Heroici" was a result. Sam's flashbacks to his time with Amelia Richardson (Liane Balaban) and Castiel's talks with Naomi (Amanda Tapping) feel like weird interludes in an episode that would've soared even higher without them. They don't fit in naturally, and each time the episode cuts to them, it feels like it's done by force. Frankly, these scenes can pull the audience out of what makes this episode so grand, but if you can ignore (or skip) those moments, this is one case you won't want to miss. Sam, Dean, and Castiel have had plenty of zany adventures on Supernatural (and hopefully will have some more in the future), but none quite like this.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Among a litany of social media posts shared by Donald Trump on Saturday, the sitting president dredged up a 2016 video rehashing old, false claims implying that former president Bill Clinton and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton are tied to several deaths. Trump has made thousands of false or misleading statements about his political opponents across his two terms in office, and he has repeatedly vowed to use the power of the federal government to punish his foes. Democrats have long warned that such baseless rhetoric could lead to violence. A narrator in the video that Trump shared points out that John F. Kennedy Jr. died in a plane crash while seen as the Democratic front-runner in a New York Senate race, which Hillary Clinton eventually won. At another point in the video, the narrator says that Vince Foster, a deputy White House counsel in the Clinton administration, “supposedly killed himself.” Trump has called Foster's 1993 death “very fishy” and said he thinks he was murdered, but none of the five investigations into his death found evidence of that. Whitewater investigation witness James McDougal suspiciously “suffered a heart attack” before he was able to testify to a grand jury, the narrator claims. However, The Washington Post reported at the time of his death that McDougal had already provided testimony in previous months and was unlikely to have been called as a witness in any public proceedings. The video also dredges up the bogus conspiracy theory that Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich, who was shot dead near his Washington home in 2016, leaked thousands of committee emails to WikiLeaks during the 2016 presidential campaign. Rich's parents also reached a settlement with Fox News after they sued the network for emotional distress over a false story  claiming that investigators had found evidence that Rich was the leaker. As of Saturday afternoon, the video had been shared more than 6,000 times from Trump's Truth Social account. It was also shared by the official X account for Trump's political operation. In 2019, for example, Trump spread an unfounded theory on social media suggesting that financier Jeffrey Epstein's death might be tied to Bill Clinton. Trump's Justice Department announced that Epstein died by “apparent suicide” while held in a federal  detention center in New York. Tariffs and the economy: China and the United States agreed to lower tariffs on goods from each other's countries for 90 days. Trump's 10 percent “universal” tariff on all imports is still in place. First 100 days: Trump is facing growing opposition to his ambitious and controversial agenda, with his approval rating in decline, according to a Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll. But inside the White House, Trump's team isn't dissuaded. Here's a look at Trump's first 100 days in 10 charts. Harvard sued the Trump administration after it froze more than $2 billion in federal funding after the school refused to make sweeping changes to its governance, admissions and hiring practices.</p>

SAN ANTONIO — Paranormal enthusiasts in San Antonio have the chance to see the allegedly haunted doll, Annabelle, this weekend.



The doll, which has inspired several TV shows and its own movie series, is believed to be possessed by a demon.

Annabelle is currently on a nationwide tour, allowing fans of the paranormal to view her in person. Today, she was on display at the Victoria's Black Swan Inn on the northeast side as part of the Psychic and Spirit Fest. 

The Black Swan Inn, itself a subject of paranormal interest, is reputed to be haunted by the spirit of a Confederate soldier and has been featured in several paranormal TV series. 

Annabelle, along with two other haunted items, will be on display again tomorrow from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
