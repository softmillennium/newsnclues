Kentucky was hardest hit as a devastating tornado damaged hundreds of homes, tossed vehicles and left many homeless. At least 19 people were killed, most of them in southeastern Laurel County. Meteorologists predicted a fresh “multi-day” mix of dangerous weather conditions across the nation's midsection starting Sunday with heavy rains, thunderstorms and the possibility of more tornadoes, according to the National Weather Service.

The latest Kentucky storms were part of a weather system Friday that killed seven in Missouri and two in northern Virginia, authorities said. The system also spawned tornadoes in Wisconsin, brought punishing heat to Texas and temporarily enveloped parts of Illinois — including Chicago — in a pall of dust on an otherwise sunny day. The weather service said parts of Missouri and Kansas could see severe thunderstorms, golf ball-sized hail and wind gusts up to 60 mph (97 kph) into Monday.

The storms hit after the Trump administration massively cut staffing of National Weather Service offices, with outside experts worrying about how it would affect warnings in disasters such as tornadoes. Experts said any vacancy rate above 20% is a critical problem. Associated Press writer Sophia Tareen in Chicago contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The car driven by Scott McLaughlin, of New Zealand, becomes airborne after hitting the wall in the second turn during practice for the Indianapolis 500 auto race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Indianapolis, Sunday, May 18, 2025. The car driven by Scott McLaughlin, of New Zealand, becomes airborne after hitting the wall in the second turn during practice for the Indianapolis 500 auto race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Indianapolis, Sunday, May 18, 2025. INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Scott McLaughlin crashed his Team Penske car in Sunday afternoon practice and ruined his chance to repeat last year's Indianapolis 500 pole-winning run. McLaughlin qualified Saturday inside the top 12 and was eligible to run for the pole later Sunday. But he spun at Indianapolis Motor Speedway and immediately lifted both hands to his helmet as he braced for impact with the Turn 2 wall. The New Zealanders' car was destroyed and Team Penske said they'd slot him at 12th and not even attempt a qualifying run Sunday. The car the team was working on for McLaughlin is Penske's backup speedway car and had been earmarked for teammate Josef Newgarden to use in next week's pit crew competition. McLaughlin, who last year led a Penske sweep of the front row in qualifying, was clearly deflated after he was released from the medical center. “It was talking to me and I sort of felt it, and I probably should have backed out, but you're trying to complete a run to see what it feels like and was it worth the risk? He said he felt fortunate the car did not go airborne into the catchfence, but the crash did cause damage to the track surface that IMS workers were fixing during a stoppage created by his wreck. “They can build a new car for me, but I'm just really gutted more than anything,” McLaughlin said. McLaughlin was also rattled to see his wife crying after his crash out of concern for him. “I wanted to get out of the car straight away just so she knew I was OK.” There have been three hard crashes in the last two days at Indianapolis. Marcus Armstrong and Colton Herta both crashed Saturday and Armstrong has to qualify Sunday for the field of 33 using a road and street course backup car. Herta qualified inside the top 30 to lock himself into the field once his car was ready for qualifying.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent testifies before the House Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government, oversight hearing of the U.S. Department of the Treasury on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, May 6, 2025. Empty shopping carts are collected from the parking lot at Walmart store in Burbank, Calif., on Thursday, April 10, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged Sunday that Walmart, the largest U.S. retailer, may pass along some of the costs from President Donald Trump's tariffs to its shoppers through higher prices. Bessent described his call with the company's CEO a day after Trump warned Walmart to avoid raising prices from the tariffs at all and vowed to keep a close watch on what it does. As doubts persist about Trump's economic leadership, Bessent pushed back against inflation concerns, praised the uncertainty caused by Trump as a negotiating tactic for trade talks and dismissed the downgrade Friday of U.S. government debt by Moody's Ratings. Yet Walmart does not appear prepared to “eat the tariffs” in full, as Trump has insisted the company and China would do. Empty shopping carts are collected from the parking lot at Walmart store in Burbank, Calif., on Thursday, April 10, 2025. Bessent said he spoke Saturday with Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, stressing in two news show interviews that what he thought really mattered for Walmart customers was the decline in gasoline prices. “Overall, I would expect inflation to remain in line. But I don't blame consumers for being skittish after what happened to them for years under Biden,” a reference to inflation hitting a four-decade high in June 2022 under then President Joe Biden as the recovery from the pandemic, government spending and the Russian invasion of Ukraine pushed up costs. Walmart did not comment on Bessent's description of his conversation with McMillon. In a social media post on Saturday morning, Trump said Walmart should not charge its customers more money to offset the new tariff costs. Bessent said Walmart on its earnings call on Thursday had been obligated under federal regulations “to give the worst-case scenario so that they're not sued,” suggesting in an NBC interview that the price increases would not be severe in his view. But Walmart executives said last week that higher prices began to appear on their shelves in late April and accelerated this month. “We're wired to keep prices low, but there's a limit to what we can bear, or any retailer for that matter,” Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey told The Associated Press on Thursday. Most independent analyses are skeptical of the administration's claims that it can achieve 3% average growth as Trump's 2018 tax cuts failed to do so. On tariffs, the Trump administration is still trying to determine rates with roughly 40 major trading partners before a July deadline. It's also in the early stages of a 90-day negotiation with China, after agreed a week ago to reset tariffs on that country from 145% to 30% so that talks can proceed. Bessent said any worries about tariffs by small business owners most likely reflected the higher rate previously being charged on China. Still, the uncertainty has been a major drag for consumers and businesses trying to make spending plans in the weeks, months and years ahead. “So if we were to give too much certainty to the other countries, then they would play us in the negotiations.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Romania braces for a high-stakes presidential runoff this weekend between two starkly different candidates: hard-right nationalist frontrunner George Simion, and pro-Western reformist and incumbent Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan, as a geopolitical choice between East or West. Presidential candidate George Simion casts his vote next to his wife Ilinca in the second round of the country's presidential election redo in Mogosoaia, Romania, Sunday, May 18, 2025. Presidential candidate Nicusor Dan exits a voting cabin before casting his vote in the second round of the country's presidential election redo in Fagaras, Romania, Sunday, May 18, 2025. A man casts his vote in the second round of the country's presidential election redo in Mogosoaia, Romania, Sunday, May 18, 2025. By 7.30 p.m., more than 11 million people — or about 61% of eligible voters — had cast ballots, according to official electoral data. Romanians abroad have been able to vote since Friday at specially set-up polling stations, and more than 1.5 million have already voted. Turnout is typically higher in the final round of Romanian presidential elections, and is expected to play a decisive role in the outcome on Sunday. In the first round on May 4, final turnout stood at 9.5 million, or 53% of eligible voters. Romania's political landscape was upended last year when a top court voided the previous election in which far-right outsider Calin Georgescu topped first-round polls, following allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference, which Moscow denied. Shortly after 6 p.m., Romania's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Andrei Tarnea said in a post on X that the election was subject to a “viral campaign of fake news” on the Telegram messaging app and other social media platforms, which tried to influence the electoral process and had “the hallmarks of Russian interference.” Networks of coordinated disinformation have emerged as a pervasive force throughout Romania's entire election cycle. Romanian authorities debunked the deluge of fake news, Tarnea said. Simion appeared alongside Georgescu at a Bucharest polling station on Sunday and told reporters that he voted against the “humiliations to which our sisters and brothers have been subjected.” Years of endemic corruption and growing anger toward Romania's political establishment have fueled a surge in support for anti-establishment and hard-right figures, reflecting a broader pattern across Europe. Most recent local surveys indicate the runoff will be tight, after earlier ones showed Simion holding a lead over Dan, a 55-year-old mathematician who rose to prominence as a civic activist fighting against illegal real estate projects. After voting in his hometown of Fagaras, Dan told reporters that he voted for Romanians “who are quiet, honest, and hardworking, and who have not felt represented for a long time.” “I voted for a change that brings prosperity, not one that brings instability and discourages investment in Romania,” he said. Dan founded the reformist Save Romania Union party in 2016 but later left, and is running independently on a pro-European Union ticket reaffirming Western ties, support for Ukraine and fiscal reform. Simion's rhetoric in the lead-up to Sunday had raised some concerns that he would not respect the outcome if he lost. He appeared on the steps of Romania's colossal Communist-era parliament building early in the afternoon, telling reporters his team was confident in a “landslide victory” if the election was “free and fair.” However, he repeated allegations of voting irregularities among Romanian citizens in neighboring Moldova and said his party members would conduct a parallel vote count after polls close. Adrian Nadin, a 51-year-old musician who supported Georgescu in the previous election, said he chose Simion. Luminita Petrache, a 32-year-old financial crimes analyst, did not want to say who she voted for but described the runoff as a geopolitical choice between East and West. “It is very important because the next president will be our image in Europe, and (decide) how Romania will evolve in the next five years,” she said. The president is elected for a five-year term and has significant decision-making powers in matters of national security and foreign policy. A former activist who campaigned for reunification with neighboring Moldova, Simion says he would focus on reforms: slashing red tape and reducing bureaucracy and taxes. His critics say Simion is a pro-Russian extremist who threatens Romania's longstanding alliances in the EU and NATO. In an AP interview, he rejected the accusations, saying Russia is his country's biggest threat and that he wants Romania to be treated as “equal partners” in Brussels. “I don't think he is a pro-Russian candidate, I also don't think that he's an anti-Russian candidate,” said Claudiu Tufis, an associate professor of political science at the University of Bucharest. In the first-round vote, Simion won a massive 61% of Romania's large diaspora vote, with his calls to patriotism resonating with Romanians who moved abroad in search of better opportunities. Hours after voting abroad opened on Friday, Simion accused the Moldovan government of election fraud, claims that were quickly rejected by Moldovan and Romanian authorities.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Two people have died and more than a dozen others were injured, after a Mexican Navy training ship struck the bottom of the Brooklyn Bridge, according to New York City Mayor Eric Adams. •  The ship, called Cuauhtémoc, was carrying 277 people when it “lost power” and struck the bridge, Adams said. It was on a global goodwill tour and en route to Iceland at the time of the incident Saturday night, officials said. While investigators look into the crash of a Mexican Navy training ship into the Brooklyn Bridge, local authorities are focused on moving the ship so it can be repaired. “And so right now over the next couple of days, our main focus is moving the ship safely to another location where it can begin repairs and then get it back on its way.” The ship is currently docked at Pier 36, where it was towed overnight after striking the bridge. While there is some damage to the underside of the bridge, it is not structural and transportation inspectors have determined the bridge is safe, Iscol said. The Mexican Navy secretary pledged his support to the families of those killed and injured when one of its training ships crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge. “I deeply regret what happened during the maneuver of the Training Ship Cuauhtémoc,” Secretary Raymundo Pedro Morales Ángeles said on X Sunday. Two crew members died after falling from the ship's masts, authorities said. “From the first moment, the protocols for medical care, institutional support, and direct support for the wounded and their loved ones were activated,” he said, adding the naval command is in contact with each affected family. Morales Ángeles also ensured that investigations into the incident will be “promptly followed up with total transparency and responsibility.” He thanked Mexican and US authorities for their support. “I value and appreciate the displays of solidarity expressed by the governments and navies of friendly nations,” he added. Crew members were seen leaving the Cuauhtémoc on Sunday morning after staying onboard overnight. The ship was docked at Pier 36 after it hit the Brooklyn bridge on Saturday evening, leaving at least two people dead and injuring more than a dozen others. “A lot of the crew members remained on the ship last night,” Zach Iscol, commissioner for the New York City office of emergency management, told CNN. Officials with the FDNY Brooklyn can be heard discussing the incident in dispatch audio from Broadcastify. Units from FDNY Manhattan received an “all hands” call to assist with the injured. “Your box is gonna go to an all-hands; they have multiple serious patients coming to your location and we're gonna go to all hands,” one official said. Listen to a portion of the audio here: Authorities are looking into exactly how a Mexican Navy training ship on a goodwill tour struck the Brooklyn Bridge Saturday night, killing two crew members who fell from the ship's masts and leaving about 20 others injured. As it made its way out of the harbor, it was supposed to make a stop at a Bay Ridge fueling dock before heading out to sea on its way to Iceland, the official said. “It wasn't supposed to be headed in that direction.” “They had some sort of mechanical issue, they lost power so without being able to use the rudder, they could not steer,” the official said, cautioning all information is preliminary and subject to change. Now, city officials are working to get them off the ship and home to Mexico, the person said. The National Transportation Safety Board is sending a “go-team” team to New York, where a Mexican Navy training ship struck the Brooklyn Bridge, according to a post Sunday by the agency's X account. The team is expected to arrive late Sunday afternoon. The ship's three masts are visibly damaged, with the splintered tip of one mast hanging at an angle, its sail twisted around it. Early Sunday morning, a group of seven crew members dressed in sailors' uniforms boarded the ship. There has otherwise been minimal visible activity onboard so far. Cuauhtémoc's collision with the Brooklyn Bridge comes just 16 months after a massive cargo ship plowed into Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge on March 26, 2024. The Singaporean-flagged container vessel, named Dali, lost power, veered off course, and smashed into the bridge, killing six construction workers. In 1935, a German freighter, Tirpitz, struck a steel girder on the bridge, bending three of the ship's four masts. The voyage data recorder from the Mexican Navy training ship that crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge Saturday will provide crucial information about what went wrong, one transportation expert told CNN. The data recorder will likely provide investigators with information about both the ship's mechanics, including any “control input” and when power may have been lost, said Mary Schiavo, CNN transportation analyst and former US Department of Transportation inspector general. It may also provide information about the river itself, such as the water's depth and its currents. Investigators may already have that information and be in the process of reviewing it, Schiavo said. They will also need to examine whether communication was lost at any point, she added. Mexico will be involved in the National Transportation Safety Board investigation into the incident, Schiavo said, noting the US agency is used to performing large-scale, international investigations. The crew was scheduled to spend 170 days sailing and 84 days in port, according to the Mexican Navy. Stops included various Caribbean destinations such as Kingston, Jamaica, and Havana, Cuba, as well as Mexican ports, New York, and cities in the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Norway, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Iceland, the news release said. The navy said Cuauhtémoc has traveled the oceans and seas of the world for 42 years, with more than 43 generations of “Captains, Officers, Cadets, and Sailor personnel” on board. A spokesperson for the New York City-area Sail4th 250 events told CNN that the ship “welcomed dignitaries and media” as part of its New York stop on its global tour. The Cuauhtémoc ship is a steel-hulled three-masted barque that's around 300 feet long and 160 feet tall, according to a 2024 press release from one of its training cruises. Government documents show the Brooklyn Bridge has a navigational clearance of 127 feet. Two people have died and two remain in critical condition, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said. Everyone is believed to be accounted for, officials said. The Cuauhtémoc sailing ship was used for training by the Heroic Naval Military School, an elite military academy in Mexico, according to last year's press release. Mexico has referred to the ship as a diplomatic symbol of its country abroad. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum sent her condolences to families of the two crew members killed when a Mexican Navy sailing ship struck the Brooklyn Bridge Saturday. “We are deeply saddened by the loss of two crew members of the Cuauhtémoc Training Ship, who lost their lives in the unfortunate accident in New York Harbor. Our sympathy and support go out to their families,” Sheinbaum said in a post on X early Sunday. The ship has since been moved to New York's Pier 36. Remember: The tall ship was departing from Pier 17 and heading out to open sea en route to Iceland when it struck the underside of the bridge, officials earlier said. Video of the Mexican Navy training ship shortly after it struck the Brooklyn Bridge shows people hanging from at least one of its masts. At least one person is seen clinging from a rope on the top-most rung of one mast, while several others on the top two rungs can be seen crawling to the center part of the mast. On tall ships like the Cuauhtémoc, it is a ceremonial tradition for sailors to climb the masts and rigging when departing or arriving into harbor. At least two people were killed in the incident, according to New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The two individuals fell from one of the ship's masts, a law enforcement official told CNN. They were pronounced dead after being taken to a nearby hospital, the official said. Officials said that nobody has been declared missing. At first, he enjoyed seeing the Cuauhtémoc tall sailing ship in the East River, he said. “But it just kept coming closer and closer to us, and at some point, I was like, I don't think that's right,” Moreira told CNN's Ben Hunte. Moreira said there was “a bit of commotion” when the ship's masts hit the bridge but “also a lot of people started recording like me because it was just such a surreal experience.” “We could see some people being kind of dragged. And they were swinging around, back and forth as soon as the ship hit the bridge,” he said. “The ship was just so close to us, so we could see all those people really struggling to just like holding onto something to… don't fall from the boat,” he added. Correction: A previous version of this post misspelled Ben Hunte's last name. More than 100 fire and emergency medical service (EMS) personnel responded to the scene where a Mexican Navy sailing ship struck the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday night, according to the New York City Fire Department. “Once the marine units arrived on scene, we knew, initially, we knew immediately that we had a serious incident with a boat striking the bridge,” Chief of Training Michael Meyers said in a FDNY post on X. Dual command posts were set up on the Brooklyn and Manhattan sides of the river and marine units were assisting in the emergency response, Meyers said. In its email to CNN, the department said personnel from 25 units was deployed, including 106 fire and EMS workers. “The police, fire and EMS did a tremendous job of working together to get everyone off of that ship safe,” said Meyers. At least two people were killed and about 20 injured when a Mexican Navy training ship carrying 277 passengers struck the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York Saturday night, officials said. What happened: The incident occurred around 8:20 p.m. local time as the captain was departing from New York's Pier 17. City officials earlier said “mechanical issues” may have caused the incident, but cautioned all information so far is preliminary. The National Transportation Safety Board is conducting an investigation. Casualties: Mayor Adams said at least two people were killed in the incident. The two individuals who died fell from one of the ship's masts, a law enforcement official told CNN. Nineteen people were injured, with two seriously, Adams said. The Mexican Navy said a total of 22 people were injured, 19 of whom were taken to hospitals. The Cuauhtémoc was built in Spain in 1981 and acquired by the Mexican Navy to train cadets and officers. It regularly takes part in major regattas around the world. It had been docked at the South Street Seaport in New York since Tuesday. At least two people were killed when the Mexican Navy sailing ship Cuauhtémoc struck the Brooklyn Bridge Saturday night, according to New York City Mayor Eric Adams. “At this time, of the 277 on board, 19 sustained injuries, 2 of which remain in critical condition, and 2 more have sadly passed away from their injuries,” Adams wrote on X. The two individuals who died fell from one of the ship's masts, a law enforcement official told CNN. They were pronounced dead after being taken to a nearby hospital, the official said. City officials earlier said “mechanical issues” may have caused the ship to strike the bridge, but cautioned all information so far is preliminary. Aramboles added that there were “some mechanical issues” that “probably” caused the ship, Cuauhtémoc, to strike the bridge. Officials warned that the information provided is preliminary and subject to change. The National Transportation Safety Board is conducting an investigation into what happened. Aramboles said a number of sailors were on top of the ship's masts and were injured in the incident. New York City's famous Brooklyn Bridge was closed for about 40 minutes following the ship accident, according to a post on X from NYC's official emergency notification system. “The bridge is open at this time after our preliminary inspection,” New York City Mayor Eric Adams said during a news conference Saturday evening. All lanes had previously been closed, the agency said on X at 10:06 p.m. ET, the bridge has reopened, the agency said on X while letting people know to expect delays. New York City Mayor Eric Adams said 19 people were injured after a Mexican Navy training ship carrying 277 passengers struck the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge. Four people have “serious” injuries, Adams said, adding “all passengers were safely removed.” The Mexican Navy said a total of 22 people were injured, 19 of whom were taken to hospitals. The sailboat hit the bridge around 8:26 p.m. and multiple people are being “aided,” a New York Police Department spokesperson told CNN. A total of 19 people were injured, including four people with “serious” injuries, New York City Mayor Eric Adams told reporters from the scene. New York emergency officials said they're responding to an incident at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge. “The situation is developing and details are not confirmed at this time,” NYC Emergency Management said on X.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) Dennis Clark goes through the remains of his house that was destroyed by severe weather in London, Ky., Saturday, May 17, 2025. Kentucky was hardest hit as a devastating tornado damaged hundreds of homes, tossed vehicles and left many homeless. At least 18 people were killed, most of them in southeastern Laurel County. Ten more people were critically injured with state leaders saying the death toll could still rise. “We are hard at work this morning addressing the tragic damage and deaths caused by severe weather,” Gov. The latest Kentucky storms were part of a weather system Friday that killed seven in Missouri and two in northern Virginia, authorities said. The system also spawned tornadoes in Wisconsin, brought punishing heat to Texas and temporarily enveloped parts of Illinois — including Chicago — in a pall of dust on an otherwise sunny day. In London, Kentucky, Ryan VanNorstran huddled with his brother's large dogs in a first-floor closet as the storm hit his brother's home Friday in a neighborhood along Keavy Road where much of the destruction in the community of nearly 8,000 people was centered. Chunks of wood had punched through several parts of the roof but the house avoided catastrophic damage. I'd never really felt that kind of power from just nature,” he said. “And so I was in there and I was just kind of thinking, it's either gonna take me or it's all gonna be all right.” Survey teams were expected on the ground in Kentucky on Monday so the state can apply for federal disaster assistant, Beshear said. Parts of two dozen state roads were closed, and some could take days to reopen, he said. Researchers found in 2018 that deadly tornadoes were happening less frequently in the traditional “Tornado Alley” of Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas and more frequently in parts of the more densely populated and tree-filled mid-South. “The devastation is truly heartbreaking,” she said at a news conference Saturday. A tornado struck in Scott County, about 130 miles (209 kilometers) south of St. Louis, killing two people, injuring several others and destroying multiple homes, Sheriff Derick Wheetley wrote on social media. The storms hit after the Trump administration massively cut staffing of National Weather Service offices, with outside experts worrying about how it would affect warnings in disasters such as tornadoes. Experts said any vacancy rate above 20% is a critical problem.</p>

A fast-food eatery at Pompeii has been excavated, helping to reveal dishes that were popular for the citizens of the ancient Roman city who were partial to eating out. Archaeologists uncovered disturbing details about a Pompeii family's fight for survival during the destructive eruption of Mt. The Pompeii Archaeological Park announced the recent excavation in a Facebook post in April. Researchers investigated the House of Helle and Phrixus in Pompeii, finding proof of "residents' attempts to save themselves from the ongoing eruption." "This opening may have allowed lapilli (volcanic rock fragments) to rain inside the house during the early phases of the eruption, from which the victims, now found, tried to protect themselves by taking refuge in a room barricaded with a bed," noted the statement, which was translated from Italian to English. Archaeologists recently excavated a house in Pompeii, revealing its inhabitants' final moments before disaster struck. Archaeologists also came across the remains of at least four people in the house, including a child. Excavators also found various pantry items, which paint a vivid picture of daily life in Ancient Rome. Pompeii was buried under meters of volcanic ash and pumice in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D. (Pompeii Archaeological Park via Facebook) "However, it continued to be occupied by its residents, who, caught by the eruption, chose not to leave the house, meeting their end there," the statement added. Officials found that Pompeii residents attempted to barricade their bedrooms amid the Mt. The house was named for a mythological painting that depicts Elle and Phrixus, two figures in Greek mythology. The excavation helps to confront "the fragility of life for all of us." "We must assume, therefore, that their function in the homes of the middle and upper classes was primarily entertainment, the display of economic and cultural status, and ‘beauty,' which is also evident in this medium-sized domus." In a statement, Pompeii Archaeological Park director Gabriel Zuchtriegel said the excavation helps to confront "the fragility of life for all of us." "In this wonderfully decorated small house, we found traces of the inhabitants who tried to save themselves by blocking the entrance to a small room with a bed, of which we made a cast," Zuchtriegel said. The remains of four victims, including a child, were found in the House of Helle and Phrixus. "This was because lapilli, volcanic stones, were entering through the atrium roof opening, threatening to invade the space," he continued. "They didn't make it; in the end, the pyroclastic flow arrived, a violent stream of scorching ash that filled every room here, as elsewhere, with seismic shocks having already caused many buildings to collapse."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent testifies before the House Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government, oversight hearing of the U.S. Department of the Treasury on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, May 6, 2025. Empty shopping carts are collected from the parking lot at Walmart store in Burbank, Calif., on Thursday, April 10, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged Sunday that Walmart, the largest U.S. retailer, may pass along some of the costs from President Donald Trump's tariffs to its shoppers through higher prices. Bessent described his call with the company's CEO a day after Trump warned Walmart to avoid raising prices from the tariffs at all and vowed to keep a close watch on what it does. As doubts persist about Trump's economic leadership, Bessent pushed back against inflation concerns, praised the uncertainty caused by Trump as a negotiating tactic for trade talks and dismissed the downgrade Friday of U.S. government debt by Moody's Ratings. Yet Walmart does not appear prepared to “eat the tariffs” in full, as Trump has insisted the company and China would do. Empty shopping carts are collected from the parking lot at Walmart store in Burbank, Calif., on Thursday, April 10, 2025. Bessent said he spoke Saturday with Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, stressing in two news show interviews that what he thought really mattered for Walmart customers was the decline in gasoline prices. “Overall, I would expect inflation to remain in line. But I don't blame consumers for being skittish after what happened to them for years under Biden,” a reference to inflation hitting a four-decade high in June 2022 under then President Joe Biden as the recovery from the pandemic, government spending and the Russian invasion of Ukraine pushed up costs. Walmart did not comment on Bessent's description of his conversation with McMillon. In a social media post on Saturday morning, Trump said Walmart should not charge its customers more money to offset the new tariff costs. Bessent said Walmart on its earnings call on Thursday had been obligated under federal regulations “to give the worst-case scenario so that they're not sued,” suggesting in an NBC interview that the price increases would not be severe in his view. But Walmart executives said last week that higher prices began to appear on their shelves in late April and accelerated this month. “We're wired to keep prices low, but there's a limit to what we can bear, or any retailer for that matter,” Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey told The Associated Press on Thursday. Most independent analyses are skeptical of the administration's claims that it can achieve 3% average growth as Trump's 2018 tax cuts failed to do so. On tariffs, the Trump administration is still trying to determine rates with roughly 40 major trading partners before a July deadline. It's also in the early stages of a 90-day negotiation with China, after agreed a week ago to reset tariffs on that country from 145% to 30% so that talks can proceed. Bessent said any worries about tariffs by small business owners most likely reflected the higher rate previously being charged on China. Still, the uncertainty has been a major drag for consumers and businesses trying to make spending plans in the weeks, months and years ahead. “So if we were to give too much certainty to the other countries, then they would play us in the negotiations.”</p>

Scottie Scheffler showed exactly what the third round of golf tournaments are called "Moving Day" on Saturday. Scheffler owns a three-stroke lead in the PGA Championship at Quail Hollow after shooting 65 to get to 11-under for the tournament heading into the final round on Sunday. With three birdies also added on the card, Scheffler walked into the clubhouse with a familiar position on the leaderboard at a major. Scottie Scheffler shakes hands with Bill Harke, caddie for Max Homa, on the 18th green during the third round of the PGA Championship golf tournament at Quail Hollow. While Scheffler's 6-under round was impressive, Sweden's Alex Norén posted 5-under to earn his spot in the final pairing Sunday with Scheffler at 8-under. Poston and Davis Riley at 7-under, while LIV Golf star Jon Rahm has found his stroke again in majors after posting 4-under on Saturday to sit at 6-under for the tournament. Jhonattan Vegas is also at 6-under, but he could've been in position to win it all if it hadn't been for his 2-over performance on Saturday. The Venezuelan was the leader after two rounds, which was mostly due to his 7-under start on Thursday. But four bogeys on the card compared to two birdies dropped him down the leaderboard with much work to do on Sunday if he wishes to win his first career major. But all eyes will be on Scheffler, who will be going into Sunday hoping to win his first major outside of The Masters. And, of course, last year's PGA Championship at Valhalla was an insane start after he was arrested trying to enter the Louisville-based golf club. Charges would eventually be dropped, but Scheffler was booked, stretched and warmed up in a jail cell and got back to the course in time to play. Scheffler is well past that incident, but the point still stands: he hasn't won a major outside the confines of Augusta National Golf Club. He's in a position to change that on Sunday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But figuring out how to finance college so that neither parent nor child are left financially hard up? It's a new, highly annoying level of hard — at least if you hope to get an adequate financial aid package to supplement your and your child's college savings. The good news: The “net” price of a year of college can be much less, once you account for federal and school aid (both need-based and merit-based), coupled with scholarships and federally subsidized loans. But just how much less depends, among other things, on your family income, how well you've strategized withdrawing your savings for college, and — this is key, college experts say — whether your child's academic performance puts them in a school's top 25% of incoming freshmen. Another consideration may soon be what Congress will do. House Republicans are considering a proposal that would, among other things, end the subsidized loan program for undergraduates and change the rules for getting Pell grants. Whether the proposal makes it into law is anyone's guess. That, coupled with confusion over the Trump administration's expressed desire to dismantle the Department of Education, has in some ways made Beth Walker's job a little easier. As the author of “Buying College Better” who counsels families on how to financially plan for college years before a child applies anywhere, Walker said, “It's never been as easy for me to advocate for taking back control of this purchase — and thinking about it with a consumer mindset.” There are several things you and your kids can do ahead of time to put you in the best position to pay for college. Get good grades and test scores: The better your children do scholastically, the more likely it is they will qualify for merit-based aid. A big key to unlocking merit aid is to get strong standardized test scores (e.g., on the SAT or ACT), said Mike McKinnon, executive director of the National Institute of Certified College Planners. He strongly advises students to study and take practice tests starting as early as middle school to improve their score before they take the official test in 11th or 12th grade. Earn college credits ahead of time: McKinnon also recommends that students try to earn college credits or advance placement in a subject while still in high school. Doing so may let them skip certain required college courses or even graduate early, thereby curbing the total cost for their degree. Check the colleges your child may be interested in attending to see what credits those schools will recognize. Be clear-eyed about your budget: When your child is in 8th or 9th grade, start projecting the financial resources you will have available to pay for college. Todd Fothergill, founder and CEO of Strategies for College, created a free college budgeting calculator called CostHero that lets you input a detailed list of income, savings, expenses and likely federal loans and tax credits to consider when assessing what your family can reasonably afford to pay. It then gives you two budgets based on your inputs — one in which the parents incur no debt and one in which they do. “You can take the time when your student enters high school and get serious about planning for college. Planning for more than one child in college at the same time: Say you have a 7th grader and a 9th grader. You will be dealing with college bills for six years, and doubly large ones during two of those years when both kids are in school simultaneously. So it pays to strategize especially carefully for those overlap years. You want to minimize your income in the “base” years — which is two years ahead of when your child matriculates, Fothergill said. It is information from those two years that is included on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form, which is a key form schools consider when determining your aid package. So, for example, if you plan to sell stocks to help pay for tuition, don't sell them in that two-year window because it may artificially inflate your income during the base years and you may get less aid as a result. Know too that recent changes to FAFSA rules mean that families with two or more kids in school at once get less of a break than they used to, Fothergill noted. Also, not all schools make their aid decisions exclusively using FAFSA. So, before applying anywhere, research what governs aid decisions at schools your child may want to attend. And get your child's Student Aid Index number, which is generated by the FAFSA form once completed. Start looking for scholarships: There is a wide variety of scholarships available at the national, state and local levels and also at individual schools. So do some research to see which ones might be a good fit for your child. The College Board has a free tool that can get you started. Niche.com, for instance, provides users with the 25th to 75th percentile range of standardized test scores among students who've been admitted. So if your child's score is above that range you'll know they would be in the top quartile. In addition, it offers a list of Best Value Colleges, which considers many factors, including net price for tuition room and board, student-faculty ratio, student reviews, return on investment for a degree and how likely the lowest-income students are to move up the economic ladder after graduation. While students may still want to apply to “reach” schools, it's important for families to realize that if their children do get in, it may be a very expensive ride if a child's academic performance lags that of fellow classmates at the school, Fothergill said. “Colleges don't invest [aid] money in the bottom quartile.” US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

Jason Smith, R-Mo., breaks down Republicans' debate over 'SALT' deductions and Medicaid cuts in President Donald Trump's 'big, beautiful' bill on 'The Will Cain Show.' The White House on Saturday released a study estimating that 8.2 to 9.2 million more Americans could be without health insurance as a result of an ensuing recession if President Donald Trump's "big, beautiful bill" on the budget does not pass. The finding comes from a White House Council of Economic Advisers memo titled, "Health Insurance Opportunity Cost if 2025 Proposed Budget Reconciliation Bill Does Not Pass." President Donald Trump during a swearing-in ceremony of Special Envoy Steve Witkoff in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., May 6, 2025. The memo says the estimate is "based on the assumption that states which expanded Medicaid with relatively generous eligibility will pull back to meet balanced budget requirements and try to provide more unemployment support during a severe recession." It also qualifies its conclusions by saying the analysis assumes "no policy countermeasures," which the White House describes as a "very unlikely but plausible worse case" scenario. The economic advisers report that a "major recession" would result in reduced consumer spending as a result of higher individual taxes, lower small business investment and hiring as a result higher pass-through individual taxes, global confidence shock including concerns about U.S. competitiveness, and dollar deflation tightening credit and pushing real interest rates higher. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump dances at a campaign event at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, Oct. 15, 2024, in Atlanta. Unemployment could increase by four percentage points, resulting in approximately 6.5 million job losses. Of those 6.5 million job losses, 60% had employer-sponsored insurance, so the White House projects approximately 3.9 million people would lose coverage and become uninsured as a result. The memo also anticipates a loss of individual and marketplace coverage, as those already without employer-sponsored insurance are no longer able to afford to purchase insurance themselves. The White House expects a 15% drop from approximately 22 million enrolled in 2026 to approximately 3.3 million losing coverage. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., speaks during a news conference at the Capitol, May 6, 2025, in Washington. Without the passage of the "big, beautiful bill," Medicaid and ACA subsidized plan enrollment could experience 10% enrollment frictions, resulting in approximately 500,000 to 1 million people losing or failing to gain coverage, the memo states. The advisers assess that individuals in those working classes without employer-sponsored insurance would no longer be able to afford coverage as a result of a recession, leading to 500,000 to 1 million insurance losses among "vulnerable segments." House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is laboring to get the "One Big Beautiful Act" through the House by a self-imposed Memorial Day deadline despite divisions among Republicans, who maintain control of the lower chamber by a razor-thin margin. The 1,116-page bill includes more than $5 trillion in tax cuts, costs that are partially offset by spending cuts elsewhere and other changes in the tax code, and would make permanent the tax cuts from Trump's first term. It also realizes many of Trump‘s campaign promises, including temporarily ending taxes on overtime and tips for many workers, creating a new $10,000 tax break on auto loan interest for American-made cars, and even creating a new tax-free "MAGA account" that would contribute $1,000 to children born in his second term.

Historic St. Mary's City, a Maryland-based museum and archaeological organization, is opening up a reconstructed 17th-century Catholic Church called the Brick Chapel on April 12. Researchers have uncovered the reason an "unusual" 18th-century mummy was preserved so well in Austria – and it's highly abnormal. Historians believe the mummy's identity was most likely Franz Xaver Sidler von Rosenegg, a vicar who had been temporarily delegated to the St. Thomas parish at the time of his death. Experts were able to glean details about his life, including his diet, from the study. "He had a high-quality diet based on terrestrial animal products [and] showed no signs of major physical work load," the study noted. The unusual preservation of an 18th-century Austrian mummy, identified as Franz Xaver Sidler von Rosenegg, used a unique embalming technique. Despite his relatively healthy lifestyle, researchers believe that he died from an acute pulmonary hemorrhage after suffering from tuberculosis. "[He] was most likely a pipe smoker and suffered from chronic active pulmonary tuberculosis with peripheral and central (hilar) calcifications (primary tuberculous complex) and a right lower lobe cavity with focal heterotopic ossification and potential active inflammation," the study detailed. But experts were stunned when they came across the mummy's midsection and found it full of curious material – including wood chips, twigs and fabric. "Most surprisingly, we detected, in the otherwise completely intact abdominal (and pelvic) cavity, extensive packing with foreign material, which was identified as a mixture of wood chips, fragmented twigs, large amounts of fabric of various types, including elaborate embroidered linen, and even pieces of silk," the article said. The man was determined to be between 35 and 45 years old when he died in the mid-18th century. Researchers also came across a solution made of zinc, chloride and copper that appeared to aid in the cadaver's preservation. "This embalming method seems to have included high-level zinc-ion solution impregnation (most likely zinc-chloride with small amounts of arsenic) and the addition of copper," the study said. "This is the first verified case of such a treatment." Researchers added, "It led to an excellent state of conservation of the [body], while the face (and skull) and peripheral extremities were less well-preserved." Professor Andreas Nerlich discussed the findings in an email with Fox News Digital, noting the embalming technique was previously unknown. Researchers revealed an unusual embalming method that includes wood chips. Though the mummy was found to have had a healthy diet, Nerlich said that factor "obviously had no influence." The professor added, "We have no idea whether this [embalming] technique has been applied more often, but this is the first verified case of such a treatment. We have no data on its use in other cases." Wood chips, twigs and fabric, along with other materials, were found inside the mummy. The mummy is one of several well-preserved remains that have been studied and publicly reported in recent months. Last year, archaeologists unsealed a 2,000-year-old tomb in Italy and found a mummy to be in "excellent state."

Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark began her 2025 WNBA season with a triple-double in her team's 93-58 rout of the Chicago Sky Saturday. During the game, Clark was called for a flagrant foul after a hard foul on her rival, Angel Reese. The star Sky center was angry with the foul by Clark and went after her in a heated exchange broken up by Sky and Fever players. Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark (22) fouls Chicago Sky forward Angel Reese (5) in the second half at Gainbridge Fieldhouse. "It was just a good play on the basketball. "It's a take foul to put them at the free throw line. I've watched a lot of basketball in my life. I wasn't trying to do anything malicious. That's not the type of player I am." Clark then fouled Reese intentionally, hugging her to prevent an easy layup. The ESPN broadcast debated whether Clark pushed Reese slightly with her left arm after committing the foul, which might have led to Reese's angry reaction. Without elaborating, Reese called it a "basketball play" from Clark, a term both players have used in the past. Reese struggled shooting in her season debut, scoring 12 points on 5 of 14 from the field, while grabbing a game-high 17 rebounds. It was a brief moment, but considering the history between Clark and Reese, it's another chapter in a rivalry that goes back to their college days. Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark (22) passes around Chicago Sky forward Angel Reese (5) Saturday, May 17, 2025, at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. Last season, the Fever took three of their four matchups, which included several hard fouls that led to national debate. Stephanie White, who got her first win as head coach of the Fever, also commented on Clark's foul. "Nobody's going to get anything easy against us," White said. "We're going to be a tough defensive team. I thought it was a clear play on the ball as well." "The foul on Clark met the criteria for flagrant foul 1, for wind up, impact and follow-through for the extension of the left hand to Reese's back, which is deemed not a legitimate basketball play, and therefore deemed unnecessary contact," crew chief Roy Gulbeyan said of Clark. "After the foul, there is a physical taunt technical on Boston and a verbal technical on Reese, which offset." Chicago Sky forward Angel Reese (5) reacts to a flagrant foul by Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark (22) Saturday, May 17, 2025, during a game at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.
