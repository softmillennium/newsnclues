                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Voynich Manuscript is a 15th-century book written in an unknown script. I stripped a handful of common suffix-like endings (aiin, dy, etc.) The traditional NLP techniques of stripping suffices and POS identification may actually harm embedding quality than improvement, since that removes relevant contextual data from the global embedding. The author made an assumption that Voynichese is a Germanic language, and it looks like he was able to make some progress with it.I've also come across accounts that it might be an Uralic or Finno-Ugric language. I've also come across accounts that it might be an Uralic or Finno-Ugric language. I didn't re-map anything back to glyphs in this project — everything's built off those EVA transliterations as a starting point. So if "okeeodair" exists in the dataset, that's because someone much smarter than me saw a sequence of glyphs and agreed to call it that. Reference mapping each cluster to all the others would be a nice way to indicate that there's no variability left in your analysis And yes to the cross-cluster reference idea — I didn't build a similarity matrix between clusters, but now that you've said it, it feels like an obvious next step to test how much signal is really being captured.Might spin those up as a follow-up. (Before I get yelled out, this isn't prescriptive, it's a personal preference.) I have no background in NLP or linguistics, but I do have a question about this:> I stripped a set of recurring suffix-like endings from each word — things like aiin, dy, chy, and similar variantsThis seems to imply stripping the right-hand edges of words, with the assumption that the text was written left to right? Or did you try both possibilities?Once again, nice work. > I stripped a set of recurring suffix-like endings from each word — things like aiin, dy, chy, and similar variantsThis seems to imply stripping the right-hand edges of words, with the assumption that the text was written left to right?

A case in point is the Maxsun Terminator B850BKB WIFI, pictured today on ITHome (machine translation), with PCIe slots on both sides. From what we see, the new Terminator B850BKB WIFI bears little relation to previous BTF style designs. It shoves its PCIe 5.0 x16 slot, usually used for graphics cards, round the back. And it has one of its two M.2 SSD slots on the back, too. However, this doesn't seem to have been done in the spirit of BTF – to enable an ultra-clean cable-managed build. In other words, the oft-vanquished CPU power and motherboard power connectors, various front I/O, USB, SATA, and fan headers are all still present upper-deck on this design. The source reckons that this will be useful for low profile expansion cards. That's pretty nice on such a compact Mini ITX form factor. Rooting through the firm's official product pages, we see only the next-size-up Terminator B850M WIFI, which doesn't seem to feature any back-connector shenanigans. Seeing the new Terminator B850BKB WIFI in its planned environment, in a PC case we might be able to buy at retail, would have been more informative. Making the most from the potential that Mini ITX offers often involves very particular component compromises and creative thinking, so hopefully Maxsun will show how using this motherboard delivers advantages compared to its Mini ITX rivals. Computex 2025 officially kicks off on Tuesday, running until Friday, so we hope that Maxsun explains this interesting new motherboard, and any other unusual treats it has in store, on the show floor.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I've tested out a number of e-bikes in my time here at TechCrunch. This sturdy, fat-tire, all-terrain e-bike is worth the $1,699 price tag. But generally, this is an excellent all around e-bike,  whether you want to take it on off-road adventures or use it in the city to do your weekly Trader Joe's shopping.And then there is the question of how long this bike will remain affordable. Heybike is Chinese manufacturer and its bikes are made in China. With tariffs, even at the recently lowered rate, these bikes are likely to get more expensive for U.S. consumers. Most other e-bikes I've tried are built with motors mounted in the wheel hub, which makes for a simpler, more affordable design. Because not everyone wants to buy a Bafang conversion kit and build their own cheap mid-drive. Even at the fifth and highest level of pedal assist, the Alpha is smooth and easy to control, making you feel like you're pedaling a traditional push bike. If you're the type of rider who likes to lean heavy on the throttle, then Heybike's Alpha is probably not for you. A company spokesperson told me Heybike doesn't encourage sole throttle use, especially at the start of a ride, because it could damage the motor and drive train. You have to pedal first and build up to at least 5 miles per hour before the throttle will engage. When you do use the throttle, the speed adjusts based on what pedal assist level you're on. That said, you can push it up to 28 miles per hour while pedaling. I didn't find the throttle constraints to be too much of a problem. Of course, there were those occasional moments while riding through the chaotic streets of New York City when I wanted the quick getaway that a sensitive throttle would provide. Still, I found the pedal assist was responsive enough. And with 105 N m of torque, it was also powerful. I rarely found myself needing to take it off the first level. The shifter let me kick it up to a higher gear on flat terrain and bring it back down to a low gear when climbing hills; this meant I could keep the pedal assist at 1 to save on battery power. The Alpha's UL certified batteries allow for up to 60 miles of range on a single charge, though I wouldn't be surprised if they surpassed that. After removing the battery to charge it once (which ended up being an ordeal that I'll describe below), I took the bike on several trips around the neighborhood and up various hills, probably riding for a total of 22 miles. The Alpha could probably double as a cargo bike for delivery riders. It comes with a rear rack that was more than sufficient to strap three packed bags of groceries, though I could have just as easily attached one of those large food delivery boxes. It also has a total payload of 400 pounds. Heybike's Alpha isn't exactly a small bike that can be tucked away easily in a NYC apartment, but with its aluminum alloy frame, it wasn't too heavy or clunky at 71 pounds. And while the 26 X 4 inch fat tires are great for traipsing over gravel and tree roots, they're just as good at handling the potholes and uneven road surfaces of NYC. Not only the tires, but the bouncy hydraulic front fork suspension took most of the blows from some of those roads and made it easy for me to hop on and off sidewalks. For one, there was a decent amount of setup involved when the bike was delivered, which required careful squinting at a QR-code instruction manual. If you're not in the habit of putting bike parts together (which I am not), you're liable to get a few things wrong. I had the help of two lovely colleagues at my office, but when I hit the road something still felt off. I took it to a bike shop where the mechanic shook his head empathetically and made some tweaks, including to the handlebars which I hadn't installed in the correct position. I tried looking up an instructional video on YouTube, but all I could find was an annoying 16-second remove and install battery ASMR video from Heybike. After a few rides, the cover started popping off half-way mid-ride. Figuring that I likely messed something up while fiddling with the battery cover, I taped it in place and called it a day. Imagine trying to annoy someone by yelling “HOOOONNNKKK” at them loudly. It was so aggressive that I was embarrassed to use it to alert pedestrians or other riders when I was passing, lest I scare the crap out of them. It did come in handy when I wanted to symbolically flip off cars that entered the bike lane, though. It could turn the bike off, but it couldn't turn it on, because the bike needed to be on already to connect to the app via bluetooth. Personally, I think e-bike apps are only worth using if they give you live tracking, anti-theft, and alarms. There aren't many colors to choose from. A final note on the addition of turn signals: they worked fine, but I almost never remembered to use them. Usually a bike with the Alpha's specs will run you anywhere from $2,000 to $4,500, so it's a pretty good deal. Though that issue with the battery cover did raise some red flags about quality issues, and if I had ridden it longer, I wonder what other issues might have arisen. The affordable price tag could be based on poor customer service, based on reviews online, though I couldn't personally speak to that. All I know is that it was one of the smoothest, easiest fat-tire e-bikes I've had the pleasure of riding.

Nvidia's next AI accelerator for the Chinese market, following the recent ban on its HGX H20 offerings, will not be based on the Hopper architecture, reports Reuters citing a Taiwanese TV news stream featuring Jensen Huang. Moreover, according to insider scoops obtained by Nikkei Asia, Nvidia is moving from HBM (High Bandwidth Memory), to a GDDR7 based design, although the specific architecture is still up in the air. The U.S. government effectively banned the export of Nvidia's H20 and AMD's Instinct MI308 AI chips to China last month, requiring a license with a presumption of denial. After the $5.5 billion loss Nvidia incurred following this change, reports pointed towards a further cut-down H20 variant. To mitigate these regulations, Nvidia introduced the H800 in March 2023, which too was eventually barred from export in October of the same year. When questioned about the follow-up to the H20, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang replied, "It's not Hopper because it's not possible to modify Hopper anymore." Nikkei Asia claims that Nvidia is eying introducing GDDR7-based Hopper GPUs. While the consumer-equivalent Ada Lovelace is a possibility as it supports GDDR memory, Hopper was designed from the ground up as an AI/ML powerhouse. Nvidia can rework the existing Hopper architecture to work around U.S. sanctions, which isn't likely, as Jensen has himself directly refuted the idea. Alternatively, Nvidia could shift to Blackwell, with the consumer-focused GB20X (RTX 50) series chips offering support for GDDR7 memory. This uncertainty will likely boost the popularity of Huawei's Ascend accelerators in China, even if they don't match the performance of Nvidia's solutions. The cat and mouse game continues, as Nvidia develops a new solution that will probably be met with another export ban in the future.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Works by tapping into an undocumented WSC API call to tell Windows there's some other antivirus software turned on. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Developer and reverse engineer es3n1n released the new Defendnot tool recently. Defendnot's ancestor disabled Windows Defender by reusing third party code from an existing AV product. Not surprisingly, it was hit by a DCMA takedown request… Defendnot started as an attempt to create a “clean implementation” of the prior project, without any ‘donor' AV. Leaning on prior experience, es3n1n correctly guessed how WSC validated calls made by genuine AV products. So, they injected code into this process, with immediately promising results. The blog shows a “fresh-new antivirus I registered,” and you can see it is arbitrarily named ‘hi2.' In the screenshot below, from GitHub, you can also see it dubbed 'hello readme:).' Many shenanigans later (about three days) es3n1n finessed their Defendnot tool by injecting the fake AV DLL into the already signed and trusted Windows Task Manager process (Taskmgr.exe). From there it can register the fake AV tool with any name. If you check Bleeping Computer, their reporter made a fake AV dubbed the BleepingComputer Antivirus, using Defendnot, for even more fun. With Defendnot injected and registered, Microsoft Defender will immediately shut itself down. As your Defendnot app isn't actually an AV program, that will leave you exposed to viruses and similar malware, as you won't have a real-time scanner enabled. It is kind of scary how a legitimate AV program can be spoofed like this, but as a ‘research project' it forewarns OS makers like Microsoft of potential vulnerabilities which may be exploited by bad actors. If you were to download the Defendnot tool today, Microsoft's Defender has already started to detect and quarantine it as a Trojan based on its machine learning algorithms.

Whether it's the cord fraying, the adapter running hot, or simply not charging your phone as quickly as it should, most of us have had at least one frustrating experience with a cheap or aging charger. Check out Amazon right now to get the Anker iPhone 16 Charger 2-Pack for just $14, down from its usual price of $19. And no matter how you slice it, two chargers for less than $20 is a great deal. Each charger delivers 20 watts of power, which is great for quickly charging newer iPhones, iPads, and other USB-C-compatible devices. If you've ever noticed that your phone seems to charge slowly with older adapters, it's likely because they don't support modern fast-charging standards. With these Anker chargers, you'll get back to 50% battery in around 30 minutes on most iPhones, which can be a lifesaver when you're in a hurry. The low-profile design makes them easy to toss into a bag or keep in a travel pouch without adding bulk. Whether you want one for the bedroom and one for the office, or need an extra for your travel setup, having two means you're covered in more than one spot. Anker is known for building chargers that don't just work well, but they last. So you can count on them to be available when you need them without running out or fizzling out somehow. You might not get excited about a charger, but when it's fast, compact, and dependable, especially for just $14, it's a great price. That's $7 apiece, and where else are you going to get a deal like this one? Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the first time, scientists have collected evidence of cloud convection in Titan's northern hemisphere, observing the moon's methane clouds shifting over time above its eerie lakes. By combining data from the Webb space telescope and the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, a group of scientists observed Titan's clouds rising to higher altitudes over time. This new discovery marks the first time cloud convection is seen taking place in the moon's northern hemisphere, where most of Titan's lakes and seas of liquid methane are located. “This enables us to better understand Titan's climate cycle, how the methane clouds may generate rain and replenish methane evaporated from the lakes,” Conor Nixon, research scientist with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and lead author of the study, said in a statement. Titan is the only moon in the solar system to host a substantial atmosphere, but Saturn's largest moon is shrouded with a layer of yellowish smog. Using space and ground-based observations, the scientists observed the clouds as they appeared to move to higher altitudes over a period of days. They were, however, not able to directly see any precipitation occurring. Titan is the only other place in the solar system known to have an Earth-like cycle of liquids, with rain pouring from clouds and flowing across its surface, filling lakes and seas, and evaporating back into the sky, according to NASA. But instead of water, Titan has liquid methane and ethane. The strange moon is of high interest to astronomers as it holds complex organic chemistry despite its frigid temperatures and gaseous bodies of water. Organic molecules are among the building blocks of life on Earth, and studying Titan helps scientists better understand how different lifeforms could evolve under drastically different planetary circumstances. The recent findings also help scientists understand how different worlds evolve over time. “On Titan, methane is a consumable,” Nixon said. “It's possible that it is being constantly resupplied and fizzing out of the crust and interior over billions of years. If not, eventually it will all be gone and Titan will become a mostly airless world of dust and dunes.” Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. Polestar, according to the original mission statement, is an electric premium brand that puts performance and design at its core. To which we might also add “it's not Tesla” as an increasingly potent selling point. New boss Michael Lohscheller, to the best of our knowledge, has never waved a chainsaw around in a meeting, but he's certainly prioritizing efficiencies and commercial uplift—and he needs to. Polestar sold 44,851 cars globally last year, a 15 percent decline compared to 2023, but retail sales are up by 76 percent in Q1 this year (from relatively small volumes), bolstered by the arrival of the 3 and 4—and Elon Musk's monumental hubris. The fact remains, though, that while the brand's gross margin has now thankfully flipped from negative to positive, Polestar has still lost a thumping $190 million so far this year, while securing $1.7 billion in credit since end of last year. The 4 is very much here as part of the plan to reverse such fortunes, and as this model isn't made in China it can look to US consumers for help. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The previous boss, Thomas Ingenlath, rose to prominence from the automotive design world, and his de facto number two, Max Missoni (now a senior designer at BMW), was tasked with delivering a coupe svelteness that the 4's underfloor battery and overall architecture didn't readily lend itself it to. Move the header rail back so that it sits behind the second row occupants' heads rather than above them, creating an unusually generous amount of headroom in the rear. Any incipient claustrophobia is offset by the presence of a huge panoramic roof and the option of electro-chromatic glass. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Polestar is strong on materials and ambient lighting; the colorways are inspired by the solar system, and there's a choice of a 3D-knitted textile or ethically sourced Nappa leather. Much depends on how wedded you are to the idea of over-your-shoulder vision and a traditional rear window. The Polestar 4 circumvents visibility issues by fitting a digital rear-view mirror (from US supplier Gentex) which uses a feed from a hi-def camera mounted on the roof. Land Rover has been using similar tech for years now, yet the jury's still out. The image is crisp enough, but it takes a second or two for the eyes to focus on it. It's jarring, risks ocular strain, and struggles a bit at night. Losing that back window also means you end up relying on the door mirrors more than usual. As you do if ever you find yourself driving a van, an allusion that doesn't chime with Polestar's aspirations. Pinning those down isn't the work of a moment. Long gone are the days of Polestar being Volvo's electric sibling. It's probably best to think of it now as Volvo's sassier cousin, although the EX90 and ES90 suggest that the mothership is in no mood to cede design or technology leadership to the upstart start-up. The 4 actually uses a different platform to other Polestars, this one supplied by its Chinese Geely parent, and known as SEA1 (it stands for Sustainable Experience Architecture, and it's used by the Zeekr 001 and 009, the Lynk & Co Z10, and the joint venture Ji Yue 01, among others.) Real world range on the Polestar 4 will be well below 300 miles. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Two versions of the Polestar 4 are available, both using a 94 kWh battery (useable) and 400 volt architecture (Polestar says an upgrade to 800 is likely at some point). The Long Range single motor car delivers 268 bhp, an official range of 385 miles (WLTP), and gets to 62 mph (100km/h) in 7.1 seconds. WIRED's test car is the Long Range dual motor, which adds an identically sized motor on the front axle for 544 bhp overall, 367 miles of claimed range, and dispatches 62 mph in just 3.8 seconds. These are all impressive machines in various ways, but the Polestar manages to locate the thing that eludes so many EVs: personality. The dual-motor version gains adaptive damping so it feels better planted on the road, and fidgets less over surface imperfections compared to the more stiffly sprung single motor car. Polestar lets you choose between three different steering settings, and while none feels truly authentic, the heaviest mode is perhaps the best resolved. The blend of regenerative and friction braking is also astutely done. But that extra dynamic precision hurts the range, which hovers well south of 300 miles during our time with the car. The full suite of advanced driver assistance is available, Polestar's kinship with Volvo bequeathing it with a palpable sense of structural integrity.

Key information sits in a smaller 10.2-inch display for the driver, while the central screen measures 15.4 inches across and is now landscape rather than portrait. That brings battery-minded route planning, live updates and route-to-car functionality. Android Automotive and Apple CarPlay are also available (so it seems hopeful that at some point soon this might be upgraded to CarPlay Ultra), as is a digital key that syncs with smartphones for up to six designated users. Keep Climate and Animal Mode maintains a selected temperature on the air con if you or your dog is sitting in the car for up to eight hours. Polestar still has much work to do settling jittery investors, but the product is undeniably strong. What's more, as the 4 is manufactured in South Korea (at a Renault Korea Motors plant in Busan) this allows Polestar to avoid the Trump administration's volatile China tariffs when exporting to the US. Yes, the 4's idiosyncratic design answers a question that few—if any—were asking, but the rest of it feels contemporary, solid and stylish. And if Lohscheller's latest strategy of poaching disgruntled Tesla owners with discounts works, the brand's financial fortunes will hopefully improve further, too.
