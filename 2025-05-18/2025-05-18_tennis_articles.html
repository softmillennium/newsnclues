                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alcaraz, who will climb to world number two behind Sinner on Monday, won his third title of the season ahead of the French Open which starts next weekend. "Beating Jannik and winning in Rome, I think both things mixed together give you a great confidence coming to Paris," said Alcaraz. And a few days rest just to realise what I've achieved, that is important as well. And then my focus is on Roland Garros." Sinner tops the world rankings but his 26-match winning streak was ended by Alcaraz, also the man who had last beaten him in last year's China Open final. Alcaraz is the only man to beat Sinner in a tour final since the start of 2024, when his Italian rival began his rise to the top of men's tennis and three Grand Slam titles. Alcaraz won his second Masters 1000 title of the year in Rome to go alongside his victory at Monte Carlo last month. Finishing runner-up is still a hugely positive result for Sinner in his first tournament since his three-month ban for testing positive twice in March last year for traces of clostebol, a contamination doping authorities accepted was accidental. Sinner's encouraging return though sets up the possibility of another final clash with Alcaraz at Roland Garros, with the two young stars of men's tennis set to be the two top seeds in Paris. Earlier Jasmine Paolini became the first woman since Monica Seles in 1990 to win the Rome singles and doubles titles when she and Sara Errani beat Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens 6-4, 7-5. Paolini secured that brace of victories a day after overcoming former US Open champion Coco Gauff in straight sets, and becoming the first Italian woman to win the Rome singles title since Raffaella Reggi in 1985.</p>

Yet before the glitz and glamour of Hollywood stardom, and even before the first theater roles where he truly broke out as a performer, the Liverpool native was devoted to tennis. Isaacs continues to play nearly every day, and is an almanac of tennis knowledge, even keeping up with the results and storylines of the present.He recently appeared on Tennis Channel 2's "Second Serve" with Eugenie Bouchard, Mark Knowles and Nick Monroe to discuss his passion for this beautiful game, and why there will always be time for tennis in his relentless schedule.

Isaacs was part of a hyper-competitive family in England that loved to be active. It's no coincidence that when he discovered tennis, he was hooked instantly.“I grew up in Liverpool with three brothers. We still are,” Isaacs explained about his upbringing. In tennis he found a sport that he was good at, was time efficient, and could be played wherever his acting career took him.“I like to play best-of-five. And I play singles, because in doubles you really have to have the skill, but in singles you have to just get it back one more time.” “I grew up in Liverpool with three brothers.

The actor had a lot to say about the current state of pro tennis, which he simply cannot get enough of. Issacs values the purity of the sport, but also the entertainment aspect of it, which is something Carlos Alcaraz fully embodies.“Alcaraz, some part of him knows he's in entertainment as well,” the White Lotus star explained. He doesn't go to the stupid end of it and risk losing matches, but he loves having fun, he loves playing the risky shot and entertaining the crowd. And that, you feel it in the arena. “Alcaraz, some part of him knows he's in entertainment as well,” the White Lotus star explained.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ROME (AP) — Top-ranked Jannik Sinner is dominating men's tennis and Italy swept both the Davis Cup and Billie Jean King Cup team titles last year. Players like Lorenzo Musetti, Federico Cinà and Tyra Caterina Grant provide the potential for Italy to dominate tennis for years to come. Still, Italian Tennis and Padel Federation president Angelo Binaghi wants more. “In what other part of society is there a monopoly that lasts for more than 100 years?” Binaghi said Sunday, the final day of the Italian Open. … It's absolutely unfair and doesn't help tennis grow.” Italy has also hosted the ATP Finals in Turin since 2021 and recently extended its hosting contract for the year-ending tournament featuring the top eight men's players through 2030. Also, the Davis Cup Final 8 will begin a three-year run in Italy this November, starting in Bologna. The idea was that eliminating Madrid and making Rome bigger could constitute a fifth Slam. Tournaments in Indian Wells, California, and Miami have also been mentioned as possible fifth Slams. “I mean, it would be great for me, because I'm trying to win one,” said Alexander Zverev, a two-time Rome champion, when asked about the possibility earlier this year. Added former Wimbledon and U.S. Open finalist Ons Jabeur, “We need to improve the structure we have right now more than to have a fifth Grand Slam. I feel like we can do much better things with the four Grand Slams we have and do better for players, for media, and for everyone else around it.” A request for comment sent to the Grand Slam board, which represents the four majors, was not immediately answered. After years of delays, organizers announced new plans to build a retractable roof over the Italian Open's main stadium, Campo Centrale. At a cost of 60 million euros ($67 million), the roof is slated to be ready for the 2028 tournament and will also result in 2,000 extra seats being added — increasing the capacity to 12,500. For this year's tournament, the event grounds at the Foro Italico were increased from 12 to 20 hectares (30 to 50 acres) and another statue-lined competition arena was added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The main draw for the men's and women's singles will take place on Thursday, May 22 with proceedings getting underway at 14:00 local time (13:00 BST). There will be 128 names in both the men's and women's singles draws with 16 players coming through qualifying and eight gaining entry via wildcards. The cutoff for direct entries for both draws was just after the 100 mark while there are also a couple of protected/special rankings entrants. Play gets underway 11:00 local time (10:00 BST) all on courts except for Court Philippe Chatrier as the action starts at 12:00 (11:00 BST) on the showpiece court. One singles match – either men's or women's – will be staged during the night session on Chatrier from May 25 until June 6 and the action will not get underway before 20:15 (19:15) local time. The women's singles final will take place on June 7 at 15:00 (14:00 BST) and the men's finals will be staged 24 hours later. A new name was added to the Coupe des Mousquetaires as Carlos Alcaraz won his first title at Roland Garros, beating Alexander Zverev 6–3, 2–6, 5–7, 6–1, 6–2, just days after he also defeated Jannik Sinner in five sets. It was a familiar story in the women's final as Iga Swiatek won her fourth title in Paris and third in a row as the Pole was too strong for first-time Grand Slam finalist Jasmine Paolini, winning 6–2, 6–1. Jannik Sinner will be the top seed at Roland Garros for the first time in his career as he only became No 1 after last year's tournament. He is followed by Carlos Alcaraz, Alexander Zverev, Taylor Fritz, Jack Draper, Novak Djokovic, Casper Ruud, Lorenzo Musetti, Alex de Minaur and Holger Rune. Alexander Zverev makes strong statement as he is asked if Novak Djokovic can win the French Open Chris Evert rates Iga Swiatek's French Open chances as she names four favourites Instead, the honour goes to Aryna Sabalenka with Coco Gauff taking second place. Jessica Pegula, Jasmine Paolini, Swiatek, Mirra Andreeva, Madison Keys, Zheng Qinwen, Emma Navarro and Paula Badosa complete the top 10. Former French Open champion Stan Wawrinka and the retiring Richard Gasquet are among the high-profile wildcards while 16 more players will come through qualifying. Two-time Grand Slam winner Petra Kvitova used her special ranking of 14 to enter after she missed most of the 2024 season as she was on maternity leave. Emma Raducanu will play at Roland Garros for only the second time and the first time since 2022 as she qualified via her WTA Ranking of 47. Last year she lost in the third round of qualifying. There have been changes to the United States broadcasting deal as TNT Sports, Max and Tru TV will broadcast the event while the tournament will be available on RDS and TSN in Canada. Carlos Alcaraz revealed what he would be "more than happy to see" Novak Djokovic do.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, that does not detract from what has been a hugely promising clay-court campaign for the 21-year-old, reaching two Masters 1000-event finals despite not securing any silverware. If these experiences are to help her win the ultimate clay crown though, she will not care, and with the French Open starting later this month, it's time for her to start dreaming. Even despite an error-strewn Italian Open campaign, Coco Gauff remains optimistic. Speaking at her post-match press conference, the American naturally cut a downbeat figure. However, such is the way with her unrelenting mentality, Gauff remains positive. Hopefully, I can get to the final in Roland Garros and maybe the ‘third time is a charm' thing is a real thing. ‘Overall, I lost to two quality opponents, Aryna in Madrid and Jasmine here. Made the final, maybe not playing my best tennis. It just gives me confidence if I can find that good form heading into Roland Garros, I can do well there.' As a finalist in the French Open already, Gauff will know what to expect if she is to reach that stage again. It would be unwise to discount the world number one Aryna Sabalenka though, who actually beat Gauff in the Madrid final earlier this month. Mirra Andreeva, despite her youth, is not one to ignore either after a startlingly impressive 2025.</p>

Gauff, who is guaranteed to move up to number two in the rankings, lost 6-4, 6-2 to home favourite Jasmine Paolini in Saturday's Italian Open final, after going down to Aryna Sabalenka at the Madrid Open final earlier this month.

"Hopefully I can get to the final in Roland Garros and maybe the 'third time is a charm' thing is a real thing," Gauff told reporters after her second loss in a WTA 1000 final.

"Overall I lost to two quality opponents, Aryna in Madrid and Jasmine here. So yeah, I think I have a lot to improve, a lot that I can work on."

US Open 2023 winner Gauff has struggled with unforced errors during the Italian Open, making over 70 in her semi-final win over Zheng Qinwen and 55 on Saturday, giving Paolini a significant edge.

"I made the final with those errors. Made the final maybe not playing my best tennis," said Gauff, who reached the French Open final in 2022 and was a semi-finalist last year.

"It just gives me confidence if I can find that good form heading into Roland Garros, I can do well there."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz faces Jannik Sinner later today in the Italian Open final, in a match that will bring the tennis world to a standstill. In doing so, he has inadvertently set up another potentially mouth-watering clash in the French Open final, with Alcaraz and Sinner now poised to be on opposite sides of the draw. However, before that, they have the small matter of a Masters 1000 final to contest. Speaking after his hard-fought semi-final victory over Lorenzo Musetti, attention for some already seems to be on the ultimate clay-court event on the tennis calendar. After all, whilst the Italian Open and Madrid are prestigious and enthralling tournaments in their own right, it does feel like all clay-court roads lead to Paris. One question, formed around Musetti's admission that Alcaraz must be considered the favourite for Roland Garros, sought to get Alcaraz's reaction to such a statement. Sinner will be hoping to follow in the footsteps of his compatriot after Jasmine Paolini beat Coco Gauff in the Italian Open final yesterday. And what a match today's meeting promises to be, with Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz to contest the biggest final of their rivalry thus far. However, and rather surprisingly, it is instead Sinner who seems to be heading into the final in greater form after handing a bagel to both Casper Ruud and Tommy Paul with some frighteningly relentless hitting. It is impossible to call which way this tie could fall, but with these two, one thing is always certain: this match will be an absolute blockbuster, and if the stars align, they could repeat it in the French Open final too.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jack Draper got emotional recalling the difficult time he went through as a rookie after accepting a wildcard at the Miami Open. Over the past two years, Draper has consistently risen in the ranks and finally achieved a career high of World No. The title that helped him immensely to achieve this was the Masters 1000 event at Indian Wells. The Brit got the better of several seeded players, including second seed Carlos Alcaraz, to get his hands on his maiden Masters 1000 trophy. Recently, in an interview with Sky Sports, Jack Draper was asked if being in the top five gets a player more respect or more banter in the locker room. While answering, he took a walk down memory lane. Further, he explained that players understand that they are floating in the same boat and eventually respect each other. Draper also claimed that breaking into the top 100 was a more difficult task than breaking into the top five. In the same interview with Sky Sports, Jack Draper was asked what was more difficult, breaking into the top 100 or the top five. Further, he pointed out that it is a very "lonely" road to the top. When Draper made his ATP Tour debut at the Miami Open in 2021, he was ranked just outside the top 300. It was a long road from there, but the Brit kept grinding and climbing the rankings. He finished 2022 inside the top 50 after some deep runs at several tournaments. 2023, however, saw him dip out of the top 100 again as he was sidelined due to injuries. His exceptional tennis was on display in 2024, as he rose from World No. In 2025, he continued his rise and achieved a career-high World No. An Economics Honours graduate, Ali has attained a degree of Master's in Sports Management at IISM, Mumbai.</p>
