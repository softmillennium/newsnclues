                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin has been thrust back into the spotlight by extreme price swings this year, with U.S. president Donald Trump's assault on the global trade order resulting in wild predictions of total U.S. dollar collapse. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run 05/18 update: A U.S. bill that would regulate stablecoin issuers, formerly introducing crypto into the established financial system, will be debated by Congress this coming week, with some claiming it's poised to pass the Senate. “Next week, the Senate will make history when we debate and pass the Genius Act that establishes the first ever pro-growth regulatory framework for payment stablecoins,” Republican senator Bill Hagerty from Tennessee, who sponsored the "Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (Genius) Act, said in a statement. After Democrats raised eleventh hour concerns over the bill earlier this month that stemmed from U.S. president Donald Trump and his administration's links to the crypto world, the bill has been redrafted to satisfy Democrats concerned with consumer protection and national security elements, according to a copy seen by Coindesk. “Let's get this home, we are ready for adoption and to revolutionise the way this financial market works,” Bo Hines, executive director of the president's council of advisors for digital assets, said during the Consensus crypto conference this week. “We're actually having these conversations in real-time—I'm extremely confident in the fact that they will get it pushed through, we'd love to see it on the president's desk. We're well on our way to achieving the presidents' goal. Crypto companies have long been calling for regulation, with Congress under president Joe Biden trying and failing to get rules for stablecoins and issuers passed into law. "The industry wants regulation," investor Ira Auerbach from Offchain Labs said in emailed comments. In April, the JPMorgan analysts warned bitcoin's burgeoning reputation as “digital gold" was under pressure as the bitcoin price failed to hold up in the face extreme market volatility triggered by Trump's global trade war. Bitcoin price bulls have remained upbeat, however, with Miller Value Partners chief investment officer and chairman, Bill Miller IV, telling CNBC the bitcoin price will keep climbing until it eclipses gold's $20 trillion market capitalization. “Bitcoin's back in the six-figures with a lot of room to go. The gold price has hit its own record high this year as investors flee to the traditional safe haven, though it has dipped in recent weeks as the global trade war looks increasingly close to being resolved. With bitcoin's market capitalization “back above $2 trillion and gold trading north of $3,200/oz, the two now stand side-by-side—as hedges against geopolitical turmoil and, increasingly, as high-conviction stores of value for the future,” Gadi Chait, head of investment at bitcoin and crypto custody company Xapo Bank, said in emailed comments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's renewed excitement in the crypto world as analysts predict XRP could soar to new highs if ETF approvals come through. The recent XRP price prediction and Ripple ICO rumors have stirred fresh optimism among investors. But while XRP continues to dominate headlines, another payment-focused token is quietly gaining ground. This token is positioning itself to transform cross-border transactions by merging crypto speed with the simplicity of traditional banking. Could it become the surprise breakout while XRP eyes its next big move? XRP came under pressure after Judge Torres denied a joint request by Ripple and the SEC to lift restrictions on institutional XRP sales and reduce penalties, shaking market confidence. This unexpected ruling has delayed clarity and stirred fresh uncertainty about Ripple's legal path, which could ultimately impact XRP's chances for a U.S.-based spot ETF approval and influence short-term XRP price predictions. Ripple may refile its motion, but progress could take months. A successful SEC challenge could overturn the 2023 ruling that classified XRP's programmatic sales as non-securities, putting ETF hopes at risk. Meanwhile, speculation is growing that Ripple could consider an ICO fundraising if legal pressures mount. XRP's price dipped slightly after the ruling, continuing its broader sell-off as traders wait for clarity. Despite this, optimism remains if legal risks fade and ETF doors open; a break above $2.65 could push XRP toward $3.00 and beyond, reinforcing bullish XRP price prediction scenarios. With Ripple's next court update due by June 16, all eyes are on whether they settle or escalate. While XRP fans fixate on ETF approval and rumor-fueled moonshots, Remittix (RTX) is quietly engineering the next generation of global payments, which doesn't need hype to prove its worth. At the heart of Remittix is a groundbreaking but straightforward concept: use crypto to send money straight into any bank account, anywhere on the planet. No need for the receiver to touch a wallet or even know it came from crypto. Forget about traditional banks gutting your transfers with hidden charges. It's crypto's speed with banking's familiarity without the usual financial bloodletting in between. It's like PayPal on rocket fuel, only decentralized, borderless, and built for scale. The Remittix presale is heating up, with token demand growing daily. Analysts project RTX could double in value by year-end, and with a limited supply of 1.5 billion tokens, early access could mean an exponential upside.

Bitcoin can soon cross the $200K mark due to rapidly contracting supply. Moreover, a huge amount of money has been flowing into Bitcoin ETFs, with the total now standing at $6B. Hougan expects that $BTC sellers would stop at $100K, which also happens to be a huge psychological level. We'll also list down the best altcoins you can buy to benefit from this. Michael Saylor's Strategy has emerged as the most aggressive Bitcoin buyer. Because of this, the Bitcoin supply has turned deflationary (-2.33%), as per analyst Ki Young Ju. Now, with other firms such as Cantor Fitzgerald's Twenty One also buying Bitcoin aggressively and governments rushing to form a Bitcoin reserve, this deflationary rate is only expected to increase in the next few years. In other words, Bitcoin could become an asset of the rich with limited supply. Heavy corporate investments have meant that Bitcoin has become less volatile over the years. Decreasing volatility is a strong indication of increasing institutional interest. If you, too, want to benefit from Bitcoin's mighty swing upwards, this might be your last chance. If you're looking for ideas, here are some of the best cryptos to invest in right now. A Bitcoin rally generally means happy times for the broader crypto (and meme coin) market. However, becoming an early investor in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) will allow you to make the most of Bitcoin's growth. That's because $BTCBULL is the ONLY crypto today offering real (and free) $BTC via airdrops to its token holders. Every time Bitcoin reaches a landmark figure, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K, for the first time, $BTCBULL holders who have stored their tokens in Best Wallet will automatically receive their share of $BTC. As mentioned earlier, Bitcoin is expected to reach $250K this year, meaning you can benefit from at least three $BTC airdrops, depending on when BTC Bull Token goes live. It's also worth noting that the project's developers have planned to follow a deflationary model. This simply means that the total $BTCBULL supply will keep reducing – every time $BTC's price jumps $25K, to be precise – which will likely boost demand. For more information, check out our guide on how to buy BTC Bull Token. We've already witnessed this in the last couple of weeks, with tokens like $MOODENG, $KEKIUS, and $GOAT recording triple-digit gains. $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that stirs up conversations on online platforms like X. It talks to the crypto community and deep dives into their opinions on various altcoins. Remember, $MIND is also self-evolving, which is why it'll be able to create its own tokens once it has spread its popularity far and wide in the crypto community. Hurry up, though, because the $MIND presale is ending in less than two weeks. Each token is currently available for just $0.0037515, and the project has in total raised $9.4M so far. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is Elon Musk's newest infamous initiative. Considering that anything Musk touches becomes a fad in crypto, it's hardly a surprise that $DOGE (not Dogecoin, mind you) has risen to become one of the top trending cryptos. For instance, you don't have to pay any fees while buying, selling, or transferring $DOGE. It's currently trading at $0.03318, which, seeing as Trump's second term is only getting started, could be a great entry point for interested investors. With a Bitcoin rally looking imminent, top altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) and MIND of Pepe ($MIND) offer once-in-a-lifetime opportunities thanks to their unique prospects and low prices.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Starknet (STRK) just leveled up with the official launch of Stage 1. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum co-founder, gave his approval, cementing Starknet's status as one of the few Layer 2s he considers worth paying attention to. Buterin himself was actually part of the STRK token drop last year. He received his stash through Starknet's LockedTokenGrant, then quietly moved over 2 million tokens from his Gnosis Safe to an unlabeled wallet about nine months ago, according to data from the blockchain. No comments were made, no labels were placed — just a silent transfer that made the stash invisible to casual observers. It's unclear whether that was a move for privacy, custody, or something else entirely. Stage 1, as defined by L2BEAT, means that a network has finally adopted key safety measures. Now, there's an upgrade delay, a security council with members beyond just insiders and, importantly, a way for a minority of the council to intervene if the sequencer begins censoring or malfunctions. In short, users now have a backup plan. Next is Stage 2, which is the point of full decentralization in which no single team or council can change the rules, censor transactions, or freeze withdrawals. But Starknet says it's aiming to reach that point by early 2026. In the long term, they plan to bridge Ethereum and Bitcoin directly, making Starknet the first L2 to operate across both ecosystems. To back that vision, StarkWare, the core team, is already stacking ETH and BTC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On-chain data discloses that Dogecoin (DOGE) is approaching a major resistance point, pushing investors to shift funds into altcoin rival FloppyPepe (FPPE). An exclusive 80% bonus is still available for this altcoin rival, but won't last much longer. Reaching its next million-dollar presale milestone will open up massive ROI potential, making now the perfect moment to invest and lock in early gains before the opportunity closes. On-chain data shows Dogecoin (DOGE) is approaching significant resistance after trading with low momentum throughout early May, holding just below the $0.229 mark. Renowned industry expert Ali Martinez shared on X that Dogecoin (DOGE) faces key resistance at $0.36, while a critical support zone to watch is near $0.21. Despite this recent upward movement, concerns remain due to earlier volatility, which saw Dogecoin's (DOGE) inconsistent performance prompt some investors to pull back. The Dogecoin (DOGE) token's erratic consolidation eroded confidence, causing notable dips and pushing many to explore a promising new altcoin rival. According to on-chain data, Dogecoin (DOGE) is stuck at a major resistance level, and this is seemingly pushing investors toward a new altcoin rival. This altcoin rival, FloppyPepe (FPPE), is selling for an affordable $0.0000002 during its early presale. The on-chain data further claims that more funds are flowing into this altcoin rival, FloppyPepe (FPPE), which is proving itself a serious contender among meme coins. The presale is still underway, but closing in on key milestones around $1.8 million, making it the perfect time to act before prices surge. On-chain data points out that early supporters of this altcoin rival could see massive returns once the presale target is hit, creating urgency to secure tokens now. This increases the coin's utility and makes it a valuable tool for investors who want to make the most of their holdings this May 2025. It is perfect for staying ahead, whether investors are trading, researching, or just managing a portfolio. It keeps getting smarter every day, learning from investors' activity to offer even better support. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is redefining staking in the crypto market by transforming it from a dull, low-reward process into a high-yield strategy for boosting profits. Beyond staking, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is building a self-rewarding ecosystem that keeps holders ahead while guaranteeing continuous growth. Security is a top priority, with its smart contract fully audited by SolidProof. On-chain data urges investors interested in these token benefits to consider joining the ongoing presale before it ends. On-chain data signals Dogecoin (DOGE) price resistance, sending investors scrambling to FloppyPepe's (FPPE) low-cost presale at just $0.0000002. The project's referral rewards let investors earn more tokens by inviting others, driving portfolio growth and profits.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Saifedean Ammous says he would “throw in a few sats” to fund a developer dedicated to making Bitcoin spam more costly. Economist and author of The Bitcoin Standard, Saifedean Ammous, has weighed in on the ongoing debate over spam inscriptions on the Bitcoin network, suggesting he would “throw in a few sats” to fund a full-time developer focused on making Bitcoin spamming more difficult and expensive. According to GrassFedBitcoin, the lack of inscription filtering tools contributes to unnecessary blockchain bloat and undermines Bitcoin (BTC)'s role as a monetary protocol. “No one running a node wants to relay inscriptions,” he wrote, arguing that the OP_RETURN limit increases were justified in the past under false assumptions. Blockstream CEO Adam Back challenged the proposal, describing inscription filtering as an “arms race.” He noted that spam data embedded in Bitcoin transactions can be endlessly modified using code structures, requiring constant updates to filtering tools. One participant suggested Core developers treat spam-coding employees at certain startups as “unwilling QA engineers” and simply unstandardize every trick they deploy. Ammous took it further, proposing to “deprecate” the work of developers building spam tools and even hiring outside coders to overwhelm their systems. With inscriptions continuing to congest the network, calls for technical countermeasures — and pointed critiques of those defending spam — are growing louder. In a Feb. 4 report, Mempool Research said the adoption of inscriptions could drive the Bitcoin network's average block size as high as 4 megabytes (MB) per block, far higher than current averages. Bitcoin's average block size — the amount of data in each block posted to the network's public ledger — is currently around 1.5 MB.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The trend of NFTs is constantly moving, with some collections varying their valuation indicators in the short term. Here's how to keep up in the Non-Fungible Token sector. To evaluate the best trending NFTs at the moment, it is necessary to consider some indicators. Such indicators are often offered by websites that aggregate information, managing to provide users with increasingly detailed insights on the most popular blockchain-based collections of the moment. To keep this indicator updated, which will change every 24 hours, simply access the platform and clickc on 24h. In this case, on the podium, in first place is CryptoPunks with 465,900 ETH of market cap, followed by BAYC with 125,000 ETH of market cap and, in third place, the collection Pudgy Penguins with 87,973 ETH of market cap. When the indicator is market capitalization, it is difficult for drastic changes to occur in the short term. On the contrary, other indicators such as floor price change or selling price or fiat currency volume in 24 hours can radically change the rankings drawn up. For each data aggregation platform on NFTs, it is possible to select different filters that offer more targeted information, even on trending collections. For example, a filter could be to choose a specific NFT category and display the rankings based on their floor price, or market cap, or Volume. In fact, NFT collections are today divided into a multitude of categories, such as Games, PFP (profile picture), Sports, Metaverse, Collectibles, Music, Art, RWA (Real World Asset) and much more. Note, however, that not all platforms offer the same NFT categories and the same subdivisions. In this sense, it is possible to see the rankings of the trending NFT collections by blockchain such as Ethereum, Polygon, Immutable X, BNB Chain, and others, such as On CryptoSlam, it is also possible to immediately see the ranking of blockchains based on NFT sales in the last 24 hours. At this moment, the podium sees Ethereum in first place, followed by Bitcoin and then, in third position, Polygon. Last April 22, thanks to CryptoSlam data,  it was observed that the weekly sales of NFTs on Polygon had surpassed those on Ethereum, thanks to the sales of the Courtyard collection in the RWA category. Speaking of NFTs, last month, the famous NFT marketplace OpenSea submitted a letter to the Crypto Task Force of the US SEC, to urge clarity on NFT regulation. Not only that, given the decentralization of the blockchain on which NFT buying and selling transactions occur, the marketplace cannot even be classified as a central authority that accepts or executes payments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The latest CryptoSlam data shows that there has been a strong renewed interest in the NFT market. Buyers of digital collectibles increased by nearly 135% to 261,548 while sellers rose by about 94.22% to 140,985. With a 21.47% increase in sales to $41.3 million from the previous week, Ethereum maintains its position as the leading blockchain for NFTs. The CryptoSlam data shows a 14.85% decrease in this blockchain's wash trading to $4.5 million. Polygon occupies the third position with $14.5 million in sales, indicating a 22.85% drop in sales compared to the previous week. Meanwhile, there was a notable increase in Polygon's wash trading. It increased by 60,536% to almost $1.6 million. While the former recorded a 19.62% drop in sales, the latter had a 17.31% increase in sales. From the collection table, Courtyard (on the Polygon blockchain) has maintained its number one position even after recording a 31.02% drop in sales. There was also a drop in all the metrics of this collection. Dmarket on Mythos also retained its second position with $8.2 million in sales even though it represents a 23.75% drop from the previous week. After a 114.58% increase, BRC-20 NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain rose to the third position with $7.1 million in sales. Cryptopunks is in fourth position after its sales grew by 97.09% to $7 million. Like Courtyard, CryptoPunks also recorded significant positive changes in transactions, sellers and buyers. Its sales grew by 469.59% to $6.8 million.
