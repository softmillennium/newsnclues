                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Plus: Kali Uchis' Sincerely, debuts at No. 1 album, and first top 10, on the Billboard 200 with the chart-topping arrival of its fourth full-length studio release, Even in Arcadia. It's also the biggest week by units for any rock album in nearly a year, and the biggest for any hard rock album in two years. Further, the set's streaming numbers are so big that it scores the largest streaming week ever for a hard rock album. Bruce Springsteen Calls Out 'Unfit President' Trump Again, Says Elected Reps 'Utterly Failed to… The band previously scored one entry on the Billboard 200 with Take Me Back to Eden in 2023, debuting and peaking at No. That set has earned 819,000 units in the U.S. to date, and its dozen songs (six of which were top 10 hits on Billboard's Hot Hard Rock Songs chart) have generated 935 million on-demand official streams in the U.S. 1 debut coincidentally comes just two weeks after another masked hard rock band from Europe, the Swedish act Ghost, landed its first leader with the chart-topping debut of Skeletá (May 10 chart). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album.

Even in Arcadia is just the fourth No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 2025, of 13 total, to also simultaneously be No. 1 on both Top Album Sales and Top Streaming Albums, following Lady Gaga's MAYHEM (March 22), Kendrick Lamar's GNX (Feb. 22) and The Weeknd's Hurry Up Tomorrow (Feb. 15). Prior to Even in Arcadia, the last rock album to have a larger week, by equivalent album units earned, was Zach Bryan's The Great American Bar Scene, in its first full week of release, with 137,000 units (July 20, 2024-dated chart). The last hard rock album to score a larger week was Metallica's 72 Seasons, which debuted with 146,000 units on the April 29, 2023 chart. In terms of streaming numbers, Even in Arcadia posts an eye-popping — and historic — sum for a hard rock set. That's the biggest weekly streaming sum for any hard rock album ever. The last rock album overall with a bigger streaming week was The Great American Bar Scene, when it tallied 77.76 million during its fifth week on the chart, dated Aug. 10, 2024. Even in Arcadia sold 73,500 copies — with vinyl comprising 47,000 of that figure. (It trumps the previous record, set only two weeks ago by the debut of Ghost's Skeletá with 44,000.) With Even in Arcadia debuting at No. 1 just two weeks after another hard rock album was tops — when Skeletá debuted at No. 1 on the May 10 chart — there have been two No. 1 hard rock albums in less than a month. That hasn't happened in more than a decade. The chart last had two hard rock No. 1s in less than a month's time nearly a dozen years ago, when Queens of the Stone Age's …Like Clockwork and Black Sabbath's 13 debuted at No. Finally, Sleep Token is the fifth act in 2025 to score a first No. 1 this year, following Ghost (with Skeletá), Ken Carson (More Chaos), Tate McRae (So Close To What) and PARTYNEXTDOOR (with the Drake collaboration set $ome $exy $ongs 4 U). In all of 2024, there were five acts that got their first No. 1s: Ty Dolla $ign (with the Ye collab Vultures 1), TWICE (With YOU-th), Sabrina Carpenter (Short n' Sweet), Jelly Roll (Beautifully Broken) and Yeat (Lyfestyle). Going back another year, there were also five acts in 2023 that got their first No. 1s that year: TOMORROW X TOGETHER (The Name Chapter: TEMPTATION), Karol G (MAÑANA SERÁ BONITO), NewJeans (2nd EP ‘Get Up'), Zach Bryan (Zach Bryan) and ATEEZ (THE WORLD EP.FIN: WILL). 2 on the Billboard 200, Kali Uchis' Sincerely, debuts with 62,000 equivalent album units earned. It's the artist's third top 10-charting effort, following Orquídeas (No. Of the 62,000 units earned, album sales comprise 38,000 (it debuts at No. 2 on Top Album Sales), SEA units comprise 24,000 (equaling 32.45 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs; it debuts at No. 18 on Top Streaming Albums) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum. The first-week sales of Sincerely, was aided by its availability across 10 vinyl variants (including signed editions), three CD variants (including a signed edition), a cassette and a standard digital download album (all containing the same tracklist), as well as a deluxe download with two bonus tracks. 1 Hurry Up Tomorrow vaults 27-9 with 38,000 equivalent album units earned (up 82%), largely owed to sales generated by the release of new CD and vinyl editions of the album. Rounding out the top 10 of the Billboard 200 is Bad Bunny's Debí Tirar Más Fotos, which falls 1-10 with 38,000 units (down 55%), a week after it hopped back to the top following its release on vinyl.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But there's already tons of drama surrounding the Bravo stalwart before the new season makes it to our screens. Rumors are swirling that Katie Ginella's future on the series is up in the air after reportedly getting iced out by her co-stars and RHOC producers. Production began in early 2025, and it's been nothing but drama both in front of and behind the cameras. The season 19 cast includes Ginella, Heather Dubrow, Emily Simpson, Tamra Judge, Shannon Beador, Gina Kirschenheiter, Gretchen Rossi, and Jennifer Pedranti. Judge apparently quit the show before returning mid-season. But Ginella is allegedly on the outs due to an ongoing conflict with Simpson and Rossi. One source even described it as a “major altercation.” “There's been tension behind the scenes,” an insider dished. She was allegedly absent from the group trip to Amsterdam in early May. It's the high-profile hallmark of each season's drama. Magazine that Ginella wanted to go on the cast trip, but was “not allowed.” They added that Ginella's future on RHOC is “not looking bright” and fans should expect a “major announcement” soon. “Reality TV doesn't seem to be for her, but she has been trying… I don't know if she's done for good or not. I would assume she won't come back next season—and the decision will either be mutual or coming from the producers,” another source revealed. The rumors about Ginella's future on RHOC are definitely juicy. No one in the cast or crew has confirmed that Ginella missed out on the cast events or trip to Amsterdam. There's no actual evidence of her being “iced out” by anyone. This isn't the first time that Ginella has had issues with her co-stars, either. In her debut season, she frequently clashed with Dubrow. She has had some difficulty fitting in with the vets as a newcomer. Another source claims that the cast has tried to “villainize” Ginella in her sophomore season. But, fans shouldn't count her out just yet. “There's been times she wanted to throw in the towel, but even those who don't like her have to give her credit — she's stuck it out and shown she is relentless,” another source shared.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a conversation spanning 50 years of her career, the Oscar winner spoke with Scott Feinberg about why Brian De Palma didn't want her for the seminal Stephen King adaptation. Sissy Spacek brought her Texas charm to Cannes, where the Oscar winner regaled an intimate crowd with stories from her 50-plus- year career. The conversation was lively and funny, with the actress discussing her defining role in 1976's Carrie and nearly missing out on Lynne Ramsay's current Cannes title, Die, My Love. Spacek first met Carrie director Brian De Palma through her husband, famed production designer Jack Fisk. She put Vaseline in her hair and wore a torn dress.

If family is the sharpest and most cutting of double-edged swords, few storytellers have ever wielded it with more violent enthusiasm than Wes Anderson, whose movies often start with — and then scab over — the seemingly mortal kind of wound that only a severed relationship can leave behind, and only a carefully mended one can ever hope to fix. Spackled together from all the gray paint and seriocomic grotesquerie that he couldn't find a use for in his previous work, the “Asteroid City” auteur's hectic father-daughter story takes pains to clarify a certain ethos at the root of his art, even if it does frustratingly little to flesh that ethos out any further. Related Stories Cannes 2025 Films Sold So Far: Lynne Ramsay's ‘Die, My Love' Sells to MUBI in Major Deal ‘The Secret Agent' Review: Wagner Moura Tries to Leave History Behind in Kleber Mendonça Filho's Beautifully Remembered Period Thriller Like so many of Anderson's bad dads before him, mid-century European business mogul Anatole “Zsa-zsa” Korda (Benicio del Toro) is determined to be larger than life or die trying. No one has managed to kill him quite yet, but they're getting awfully close — as we see in a high-flying prologue that makes it weirdly easy to imagine how Anderson might have shot the first scene of “The Dark Knight Rises.” “The Phoenician Scheme” begins with one character being shredded in half by a saboteur's bomb, and ends with another character getting their head blown off by a hand grenade. And yet, Zsa-zsa repeatedly insists that he feels “very safe.” For a man who mostly communicates in maxims, that might be the closest thing he has to a mantra. The immoveable center of a sweet but frantically spinning caper in which family is presented as the only force more inescapable than death (family is a lot of things, okay? The truth of the situation, as our unscrupulous hero starts to realize after surviving his sixth plane crash, is that every step he's taken away from one has led him closer to the other, and vice-versa. His three ex-wives are all deceased, even though Zsa-zsa himself appears to be indestructible, and the nine young sons he shared between them are confined to a dormitory near his mansion, where they sometimes appear on the dining room balcony so that one of them can launch flaming arrows at their father as he sits at the table below. (The kid's aim isn't great, but it gets a little better with each shot.) Zsa-zsa has a lone daughter amidst his brood of boys, but he hasn't seen the girl in six years — not since he sent Liesl away to live as a nun-in-training. That was the easiest way for him to silence the nagging suspicion that Liesl was actually sired by his dastardly half-brother Nubar, who Benedict Cumberbatch plays as a bearded cross between Flemish painter Anthony van Dyck and Agrabahanian royal vizier Jafar (no last name given). The baron and his pious daughter seem at peace with their mutual estrangement until Zsa-zsa suddenly decides to break that habit. His latest brush with death is close enough that it earns him a general meeting with God (Bill Murray, natch), who forces Zsa-zsa to participate in a Dreyer-esque trial for his soul; a tedious and visually uninspired series of interruptions, so far as Anderson's framing devices go. The verdict isn't rendered until the end of the film, but a mere glimpse of the pearly gates is enough for Zsa-zsa to anoint Liesl his sole heir, and for him to make a hail Mary attempt to reconnect with her as they travel across Modern Greater Independent Phoenicia — Stefan Zweig-inspired country located somewhere between Morocco and Zubrowka — in an effort to pull off the biggest deal of Zsa-zsa's life. While the mystery of Liesl's parentage drives a certain portion of the plot, that of the actress who plays her could not be more self-evident, as the character is portrayed by Anderson newcomer Mia Threapleton, a round-faced twentysomething who looks as much like a young Kate Winslet as her mom ever did. A bit of nepo casting feels apropos in a movie that braids history and destiny into a frayed knot that only grows tighter whenever someone tries to pull it apart, but it doesn't hurt that Threapleton is also perfect in the role, wielding a deadpan that makes Zsa-zsa work as hard for her love as he does for his fortune. That goes double for Liesl's infatuated tutor, a Norwegian entomologist named Bjorn (a movie-stealing Michael Cera) who joins his crush and her father as they tour the country in a fundraising bid to cover “the gap” that stands between Zsa-zsa and the development project he wants to create in a poor section of Phoenicia. At least Zsa-zsa is courteous enough to bring souvenir hand grenades with him everywhere he goes. While the energy picks up whenever the bullets start flying (Riz Ahmed, playing a local prince, enters the movie aboard a handcar equipped with a rail gun that he isn't afraid to use, and Richard Ayoade makes the most of his crucial role as a well-armed revolutionary), several of the comic setpieces between them have a way of belaboring their own jokes. That trend continues throughout the rest of the film's similarly contained — if more agreeably mordant — sorties, which find the gang traveling to a Casablanca-like nightclub (owned by Mathieu Amalric's Marseille Bob), boarding a docked freighter owned by a syndicate chief named Marty (Jeffrey Wright), and an unfinished hydro-electric dam operated by Zsa-zsa's cousin Hilda (Scarlett Johansson), before they arrive at the palatial desert hotel where the whole thing comes to a head. Each of these sequences is surely packed full of too many quotable lines for someone to appreciate them all at first blush, but all of them run long enough without moving to create an uncomfortable tension with the film's manic pace, and I spent most of “The Phoenician Scheme” itching to arrive at the destination instead of enjoying the journey there. The expansiveness of the plot's scale turns suffocating as a result, which fatally detracts from Anderson's singular talent for achieving truth through artifice. While production designer Adam Stockhausen remains a wizard beyond compare (not even the film's muted color palette and dreary complexion is enough to diminish his genius), the epicness of Korda's persona feels at odds with the hermetic construction of Anderson's diorama-like style, and there's nothing del Toro's winsomely wounded performance can do to give the movie some room to breathe. Inspired by 20th century names like Onassis and Niarchos, Anatole “Zsa-zsa” Korda is palpably suspended in air between the breeziness of Alexandre Desplat's score and the viciousness of the Igor Stravinsky pieces that Anderson mixes through it. “Break, but don't bend” is his personal motto (not to be confused with his aforementioned mantra), which bodes well for the compromise the revenge-obsessed Zsa-zsa will eventually have to strike with his forgiveness-minded daughter, but “The Phoenician Scheme” is too frenetic for del Toro to chart a compelling path to his character's come-to-Jesus-moment. Like all of Anderson's protagonists, Zsa-zsa picks a point on the horizon and continues to charge towards it with all of his might long after he should've noticed that he's steaming towards a mirage. As Zsa-zsa grows closer to Liesl, it becomes increasingly clear that family is the gap, in addition to being the tycoon's best hope of closing it. “Planning doesn't matter, Zsa-zsa says, “what matters is the sincerity of your devotion.” It's a strange thing to hear towards the end of an Anderson film that's been too obsessed with the planning stage to meaningfully devote itself to anything, but “The Phoenician Scheme” is a movie with its heart in the right place, and a souvenir hand grenade within arm's reach just in case it's needed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Like Jacques Tati, Woody Allen and Luis Buñuel, there can be no mistaking a movie directed and written by Wes Anderson. There's his Oscar-winning masterpiece The Grand Budapest Hotel; animated gems Isle of Dogs and my favorite Wes movie, Fantastic Mr. Fox; and a string of beloved film comedies including The Royal Tannenbaums, The Darjeeling Limited, Moonrise Kingdom and so many more including his 2024 Oscar-winning short The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar. It is good to report that the filmmaker is back in style with his latest, The Phoenician Scheme, after stumbling a bit through the overly narrated and artificial (even for Anderson) Asteroid City, the most recent of his films to debut in Cannes, just as his latest world builder, The Phoenician Scheme, did Sunday night in Competition. This one is particularly refreshing in that, instead of focusing on a number of characters, here it is Benicio Del Toro‘s Zsa-Zsa Korda, a shady, uber-wealthy industrialist who dominates the proceedings much the way we saw in other Anderson riffs like The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. In fact, there also are sly comparisons we could make even to Donald Trump with this man, whose enemies are doing everything to bring down his empire where he is accused of swindling banks, skipping tariffs, filing frivolous lawsuits — you name it, he's done it. RELATED: ‘The Phoenician Scheme's Benicio Del Toro, Michael Cera & Mia Threapleton On Wes Anderson's Comedic Timing – Cannes Studio Zsa-zsa, who has survived six airplane crashes including the latest one that opens the film on a note of excitement, is even starting to see God, or at least a group of religious leaders who act as therapists in a way in fantasy sequences where he thinks he has died. Somehow he never does, even with a price on his head by any number of would-be assassins. His latest plan, with the lofty name of the Korda Land and Sea Phoenician Infrastructure Scheme, has him enlisting his 20-year-old daughter Liesl (Mia Threapleton), who is in training to become a nun but whom he thinks could be better suited to ultimately take over his company and complicated financial dealings. The idea is to create an infrastructure scheme for an unused area of Earth that can be mined for a potentially rich region that doesn't exist yet. To do this he also has to enlist a number of wealthy donors from the worlds of shipping, mining, railroad, banking, real estate and the black market. First up is a visit to Prince Farouk (Riz Ahmed), who has proven savvy with his kingdom's natural wealth, then to an underground tunnel for a meeting with railroad barons Leland (Tom Hanks) and Reagan (Bryan Cranston). Another box introduces us to Marseilles Bob (Mathieu Amalric), a gangster and nightclub owner who wants terrorists to stop shooting up his place. There alsois the shipping magnate (Jeffrey Wright) who could be crucial; a second cousin named Hilda (Scarlett Johansson, in briefly) who could be new wife material; and finally leading up to his brother, the conniving Uncle Nubar (a very amusing Benedict Cumberbatch), who is big trouble in the family. With Liesl just as interested in trying to solve her mother's murder (could it be Nubar?) as in closing the gap of Zsa-zsa's vast finances, they are on dueling paths, joined by the other major character to complete this triangle, that of Norwegian tutor Bjorn (Michael Cera), who also studies insects. contestant might be able to reel off instantly, but you can certainly see the Trump/Musk influence creeping in, even though this was written long before their partnership got into the picture. At least that is what I sniff here, proving Anderson's wholly fictional creation has some odd relation to our current reality. RELATED: Full List Of Cannes Palme d'Or Winners Through The Years: Photo Gallery As with all Anderson films, the production values are spectacular. This one was shot almost exclusively on soundstages at Studio Babelsberg in Germany. Bruno Delbonnel's lush cinematography (first time working on a feature with Anderson, who usually goes back to the same well of artisans) and Adam Stockhausen's production design are exquisite as are Milena Canonero's costumes and Alexandre Desplat's score. So do newcomer Threapleton as Liesl and Cera, a first-timer in Anderson's stock company who undoubtedly will be asked back. Look for Willem Dafoe and F. Murray Abraham as pop-ups along the way, with Hanks, Cranston, Johansson and others in for a fun day's work. Anderson, Jeremy Dawson, John Peet and Steven Rales are producers.

The film is also expected to get a healthy theatrical window and wide release, and MUBI acquired the U.S. rights in addition to some other territories, with some deep pocketed streamers reportedly in the mix.

PIN also “supervises the nationwide investigation and prosecution of election crimes.” Some of the reductions in staff came from resignations among PIN leadership when a top DOJ official directed prosecutors to drop corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams. “Created in response to Watergate, the Public Integrity Section exists to ensure that the Department of Justice fairly and thoroughly investigates corruption by government officials at the federal, state, and local level without regard to those officials' political views or allegiances.

The office also intervened when now former interim U.S. attorney Ed Martin sought to prosecute Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for remarks he made about two Supreme Court justices years before. PIN attorneys told Martin that the comments were not a prosecutable threat, according to multiple Post sources. “This is part of a shift in limiting the power of law enforcement experts in public corruption,” Georgetown Law professor and former PIN attorney Paul Butler told the paper.</p>

As huge as “Saturday Night Live” has been this season with the celebration of its 50th year on air, there was something quaint about its finale bringing in not only one of its staple hosts over the last decade and change, but also wife to one of the show's integral members, Colin Jost. Perhaps, but it was all quickly forgotten once ScarJo took the stage for her monologue and chose to offer focus on the main cast, all of whom have put in some of their best work yet this season. It wasn't an earth-shattering, all-timer monologue like the one that came from Jack Black a few episodes prior, but it was a beautiful gesture and one that set the tone for the rest of the evening to come. As she has before, Johansson blended in seamlessly with the cast, highlighting how “SNL” is not a place for show-boating, but instead, keeping up. In the episode's first pre-taped bit — one of the few “Please Don't Destroy” videos produced this season — she not only keeps up, but makes the whole sketch come together by embracing the oblivious sensibility these bits seem to hone in on. Though not as timely as Season 2 of Nathan Fielder's “The Rehearsal,” the sketch makes light of recent issues surrounding commercial aviation, particularly when it comes to landing or flying out of Newark airport. With Bad Bunny on as musical guest, we knew we would be getting at least one sketch with the talented actor/singer, and it certainly did not disappoint. Pitting Bunny and cast member Marcello Hernandez opposite one another as whipped men forced to fight each other due to their over-the-top female companions (Johansson and Ego Nwodim), this bit showed how far “SNL” has come in terms of expanding its audience. A bilingual sketch is not new in any way, but it stood out for its use of subtitles — an option that might not be available in most live circumstances when comedy is performed. Miss Eggy may just be our new favorite character to come out of “SNL 50” (Sorry, Domingo). Though her return for the finale may not top the introduction that earned her an FFC fine, Nwodim brought the house down with her food-related jokes and Def Jam-style delivery. Do we smell an Emmy nom in her future? For a live bit later in the night, Johansson got to have a little fun with some of her own history by taking aim at the tasteless entertainment journalists she's had to endure over the course of her career. With her and Bowen Yang taking on the role of said press members, the two hurl insulting and invasive questions at female “SNL 50” cast members performing as talent for a soon-to-be-released feature.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Mubi has won out in a multi-distributor tug of war for Jennifer Lawrence‘s Cannes Competition film Die My Love, we understand. The voracious buyer is taking domestic and multiple international rights. The deal is in the range of $23 million, maybe closer to $24 million, with full theatrical commitment on 1,500 screens for 45 days, we hear. It's the first major deal on the ground for a film playing at Cannes and by far Mubi's biggest acquisition ever. This is a big one for Mubi and its chief Jason Ropell, coming after its breakout work last Oscar season on The Substance. Set in rural America, the film is a portrait of a married woman's (Lawrence) mental disintegration as post-natal depression consumes and obliterates her. Reviews have varied for the movie, but plenty of critics were fired up by Lawrence's performance. RELATED: Critics Herald Jennifer Lawrence's “Mesmerizing” Performance In Cannes Drama ‘Die My Love': “Expect Her To Show Up On That Oscar Stage Again” The pic is based on the 2017 novel by Ariana Harwicz and also stars LaKeith Stanfield, Sissy Spacek and Nick Nolte. In Deadline's review, Damon Wise was impressed by Ramsay's “mesmerizing film,” describing it as a “brutal but beautiful story.” As for many critics, Lawrence proved the star of the show. “America knows very well how good Jennifer Lawrence can be,” Wise wrote, “and this could well mean a fifth Oscar nomination if it lands in savvy hands.” Ramsay also came in for particular praise: “It could also be the film that takes Ramsay into the next stage of her career,” he says. Ramsay directed Die My Love from her script written with Enda Walsh and Alice Burch. RELATED: Lynne Ramsay's ‘Die My Love' With Jennifer Lawrence & Robert Pattinson Gets Nine-Minute Ovation After Cannes Premiere The ambitious arthouse studio  , which made a big splash with The Substance this past awards season, is growing fast and aiming high. It now has a fourth Competition film, around 20 percent of the lineup. Known for her Cannes-debuting 1999 drama Ratcatcher, as well as films like We Need to Talk About Kevin and Morvern Callar, Ramsay's most recent feature You Were Never Really Here, the thriller starring Joaquin Phoenix, won her the Cannes Best Screenplay award in 2017.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Both songs appear on Puerto Rican superstar's latest album, Debí Tirar Más Fotos. Bad Bunny helped close out Saturday Night Live's milestone 50th season with a memorable appearance on the show's May 17 season finale, hosted by actress Scarlett Johansson. For his first performance, Bad Bunny delivered a striking rendition of “NUEVAYoL,” seamlessly blending traditional and contemporary Caribbean rhythms. The performance featured a powerful visual homage to the iconic 1930s photograph of 11 ironworkers eating lunch on a steel beam high above Manhattan during the construction of 30 Rockefeller Plaza — appropriately tying to SNL's home turf. Set in a graffiti-covered club bathroom, the performance began with RaiNao's soft, hypnotic vocals before she discovered Bad Bunny seated in a toilet stall. Beyond his musical performances, Bad Bunny — making his third appearance as a musical guest on SNL — also joined Johansson in several sketches. Highlights included a barroom scene where two men bond over their chaotic girlfriends, and a comedic bit in which the rapper heroically steps in as an air traffic controller. Bad Bunny's SNL appearance comes at a high point in his career. Debí Tirar Más Fotos, his sixth studio album, recently surged back to No. Plus, the superstar's actual summer plans involve his highly-anticipated, month-long residency at Coliseo de Puerto Rico, which launches July 11 in San Juan and remarkably sold 400,000 tickets in just four hours earlier this year. Having a Peacock account also gives fans access to previous SNL episodes. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Twenty years after an infamous television moment involving Kanye West and Mike Myers, Saturday Night Live spoofed the incident on their Season 50 finale, with Myers portraying himself alongside Kenan Thompson's Ye. In 2005, during a televised fundraiser for Hurricane Katrina, West went off-script on live TV by declaring that then-president George W. Bush “doesn't care about Black people,” all while he stood next to a mortified Myers. A lot has changed with the rapper in the past two decades, as it is quickly made clear in SNL's “Mike Myers Elevator Ride” sketch. After Myers greets West, the rapper tells him that they haven't seen each other since “that Hurricane Katrina Benefit where I said George Bush doesn't care about Black people and you just had to stand there looking stupid.” Myers then small-talks with West, asking what he's been up to.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>His performance alongside professional dancer Jenna Johnson earned rave reviews and endeared him to fans even more. But could he be returning to the show in a different capacity? Graziadei is not signing back onto DWTS (although many fans would love that), but there has been some interest in whether his fiancée, Kelsey Anderson, would be interested in joining Season 34. I think it's amazing.” She also praised the long-running series and the people who work tirelessly to make it a success. Graziadei had a fantastic experience on DWTS, which also upped his fitness levels. “It's crazy … I think that's such a good workout,” Anderson said of Graziadei's time onstage. Anderson has given her inclusion in the show some serious thought (although only Robert Irwin has been announced as a celebrity contestant for Season 34). She also has a professional dancer partner in mind: Val Chmerkovskiy. I feel we could bring the mirrorball trophy home.” “Through my time on the show, I've never had a football player.” Despite her initial disappointment, Johnson was incredibly impressed when she got to know Graziadei. “He is one of the most genuine humans I've ever met,” she said. “I think we just connected really easily and quickly, and we have so much fun.” She also called him “such a pleasure to work with.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Springsteen doubled down on criticism of the Trump administration Saturday night, after the U.S. president called him "dumb as a rock" and a "dried out 'prune.'" Bruce Springsteen resumed denouncing Donald Trump from the stage of his Land of Hopes and Dreams Tour Saturday night (May 17) in Manchester, England. The Los Angeles Times reports the Boss didn't back down from his stance on Trump this weekend, after the U.S. president called Springsteen “highly overrated,” “dumb as a rock” and a “dried out ‘prune' of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied! “Things are happening right now that are altering the very nature of our country's democracy, and they're too important to ignore,” Springsteen said to the crowd in a three-minute speech on Manchester's Co-op Live stage on Saturday, as heard in a video posted by the L.A. Times. That's happening now,” Springsteen said, echoing what he'd spoken about at his May 14 show. Springsteen continued, “They are removing residents off American streets without due process of law and deploying them to foreign detention centers as prisoners. They have no concern or idea of what it means to be deeply American.” On a note of optimism that quoted novelist and civil rights activist James Baldwin, he added, “The America I've sung to you about for 50 years is real, and regardless of its many faults, it's a great country with a great people, and we will survive this moment. On Friday, after Springsteen had shared similar thoughts from the stage on opening night of his tour, Trump responded on Truth Social, writing: “I see that Highly Overrated Bruce Springsteen goes to a Foreign Country to speak badly about the President of the United States. Never liked him, never liked his music, or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he's not a talented guy — Just a pushy, obnoxious JERK, who fervently supported Crooked Joe Biden, a mentally incompetent FOOL, and our WORST EVER President, who came close to destroying our Country. Sleepy Joe didn't have a clue as to what he was doing, but Springsteen is ‘dumb as a rock,' and couldn't see what was going on, or could he (which is even worse!)? This dried out ‘prune' of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that's just ‘standard fare.' Then we'll all see how it goes for him!” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Derek Hough celebrated his 40th birthday on May 17, 2025, and he used the day to reflect on his life and all that he is thankful for. But the “Dancing With the Stars” professional dancer also decided to show off his playful side with a post about how well he has aged. But it was his caption that grabbed fans' attention (or maybe it was a bit of both). A post shared by Derek Hough (@derekhough) '” Hough wrote in the caption as he referred to his wife, Hayley Erbert. Well, today's the day I can officially say it: ‘Hey, not bad for 40. The comment section has come alive with reactions from fans, including his sister, Julianne Hough. “You post that thirst trap and never delete! 40 never looked so good- remember when we were kids and 40 was balding, pop belly and bad clothes….” she wrote, joking about how their perceptions of aging have changed. happy birthday king.” Her message is touching, and there are many just like it. A post shared by Derek Hough (@derekhough) Fans can always count on him to inject some joy into their Instagram feed. Proud of you G!,” “Not bad at all for 40!! Erbert also commented on the post, praising her husband and his appearance. “You are not too bad, my love,” she wrote. But earlier in the day, Hough posted a more emotional message on Instagram about his milestone birthday and how he was reflecting on all the good things in his life. The dancer also chose to be vulnerable with fans by sharing his passion for music.</p>
