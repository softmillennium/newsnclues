The US does not want negotiations between Russia and Ukraine to drag on indefinitely, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said, stressing that Washington expects concrete results.

He made the remarks after Russia and Ukraine held their first direct talks in three years in Istanbul on Friday. The countries agreed to a prisoner swap involving 1,000 people on each side, and to continue contacts once both parties have prepared detailed ceasefire proposals.

“On the one hand, we're trying to achieve peace and end a very bloody, costly, and destructive war. So there's some element of patience that is required,” Rubio said in an interview aired on CBS News' ‘Face the Nation' on Sunday.

“On the other hand, we don't have time to waste. There are a lot of other things happening in the world that we also need to be paying attention to. So we don't want to be involved in this process of just endless talks. There has to be some progress, some movement forward,” he added.

Rubio said the US would examine the ceasefire proposals from Russia and Ukraine. “If those papers have ideas on them that are realistic and rational, then I think we know we've made progress,” he said.

The diplomat confirmed that the US is ready to impose further sanctions on Russia if no deal is reached. He expressed confidence that both chambers of Congress would pass Senator Lindsey Graham's bill introducing 500% tariffs on imports from countries that purchase Russian oil, natural gas, and uranium.

According to the White House, Rubio spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov by phone on Saturday, reiterating President Donald Trump's call for an immediate ceasefire.

Moscow has rejected demands for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, insisting that talks must address the “root causes” of the conflict, including Ukraine's aspirations to join NATO – which Russia considers a threat to national security.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has maintained that a lasting truce would require Ukraine to halt its mobilization drive, stop receiving weapons from abroad, and withdraw troops from Russian territory. He warned that Kiev would likely use a temporary ceasefire to rearm and regroup.

Portugal plans to ask the European Commission to pressure France over limited electricity supplies from the latter, the Financial Times reported on Sunday, citing Energy Minister Maria da Graca Carvalho. The move follows the April 28 blackout that left millions across Spain, Portugal, and parts of southern France without electricity for up to ten hours. 

Portugal is reportedly blaming Paris for failing to complete and expand critical electricity interconnections with Spain – shortcomings that Lisbon argues exacerbated the blackout by restricting cross-border energy support. The power outage has been described as the largest in recent European history. 

Carvalho claims that Brussels has the authority to arbitrate the matter under EU law, noting that the weak interconnections between France and Spain continue to hamper the bloc's internal energy market.

“We will involve the president of the EC on this to make sure that we are all integrated,” she said, expressing hope for a resolution. “This is a European question, it's not a question between the three countries.”

She urged the Commission to step in if the internal market is being compromised, emphasizing its power to pressure France into accelerating work on infrastructure.

The Iberian Peninsula has some of the lowest energy connectivity levels in the EU, the FT noted. Power links between France and Spain were automatically disconnected to safeguard the wider European grid after Spain's system began to fail.

Earlier this week, Spanish Minister for Ecological Transition Sara Aagesen said an initial investigation had revealed that the chain reaction of grid disconnections were triggered by power generation failures in the provinces of Granada, Badajoz, and Seville. 

A preliminary technical assessment by Entso-E, the European association of transmission system operators, reported that 2.2 gigawatts of capacity went offline in southern Spain less than a minute before the full system collapse. The root causes of the substation failures remain under investigation.

Romanian presidential candidate George Simion has accused the pro-EU government in neighboring Moldova of attempting to rig Sunday's runoff vote. The Euroskeptic leader of the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) came in first in the initial round of the presidential election rerun on May 4, securing more than 40% of the vote.

Around 30% of Moldova's population are dual Moldovan-Romanian citizens. Simion's supporters argue that early turnout among Romanians voting in Moldova is suspiciously high – nearly three times the level recorded during the same period in the first round.

“Enough campaigning – now we have to stop the massive fraud! The government in Moldova has started stealing votes. We won't let them!” Simion wrote on Facebook on Friday.

The AUR claims that Moldova's ruling Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) has been directing voters to support Simion's opponent, Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan. “By 1 p.m., over 50,000 votes had been cast by the diaspora – an increase of almost 70% compared to the first round. These figures are no coincidence,” the party wrote on its website.

The AUR also accused Moldova's Pro TV Chisinau of waging “an illegal and partisan campaign in favor of the establishment candidate” and of voter manipulation “under the guise of independent journalism.”

Chisinau has denied having any interference in the election. “Out of respect for the voters, we urge all political actors to refrain from making accusations that only serve to undermine this democratic exercise,” government spokesman Daniel Voda said. He encouraged Romanian nationals living in Moldova to cast their ballots “without fear.”

The election rerun was ordered after Romania's Constitutional Court annulled the results of the November vote, in which independent right-wing candidate Calin Georgescu came in first with 23%. The authorities cited “irregularities” in his campaign, along with intelligence reports alleging Russian interference – which Moscow has denied.

Simion condemned the annulment of the 2024 election results as a “coup d'état.” He is currently banned from entering Moldova, which he has called “an artificial country” which “will never join the European Union.”

VATICAN, May 18. /TASS/. The inaugural mass marking the official commencement of the pontificate of His Holiness Pope Leo XIV is underway at St. Peter's Square, with the event launched inside the principal Catholic cathedral, en-route from the tomb of Saint Peter in its crypt.

The largest delegations that arrived for the ceremony are from Italy, Peru - where Pope Leo XIV served as a missionary for several decades during his pastoral ministry - and the United States, his country of origin.

The United States is represented by Vice President JD Vance, who visited Pope Francis before his passing on Easter (April 20), along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

The latter has already held a series of meetings at the Vatican in recent days. It is possible that Vice President Vance will hold a private meeting with the Pope despite a fully booked schedule.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, May 18. /TASS/. Long-lasting peace and protection of rights of the Russian-speaking population in Ukraine must be the core result of Russia's special military operation, President Vladimir Putin said in an interview with VGTRK journalist Pavel Zarubin.

Putin stressed that Russia has ample forces to complete the special military operation and reach the designated objectives.

""The objectives are about the elimination of the original causes of this crisis, the formation of conditions for the long-lasting and sustainable peace and the provision of security to Russia,"" he pointed out.

The president added that it also goes ""for people residing on these territories and considering the Russian language to be their native tongue and Russia as their homeland.""

Putin has repeatedly called for resolving the Ukraine conflict, highlighting the need to take Russia's interests into account when addressing the root causes of the crisis. According to him, this is the only way to establish long-term peace, which is what Moscow wants.

The Russian Foreign Ministry reported earlier that on March 17, a phone conversation between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was held at the initiative of the American side.

The top Russian diplomat ""acknowledged the constructive role played by the United States in encouraging Kiev to finally accept President Vladimir Putin's proposal to resume negotiations in Istanbul"" and ""reiterated Moscow's willingness to continue working with US colleagues in this context.""

On May 16, talks were held between Russia and Ukraine in Turkey's Istanbul. Following the meeting, Moscow and Kiev agreed to swap the prisoners of war under a ""1,000 for 1,000"" formula, present their concept of the potential future ceasefire, outlining it in detail, as well as continue the negotiation process. Russian Presidential Aide Vladimir Medinsky who led the Russian delegation at the Istanbul talks said that the Russian side was satisfied with the negotiations' outcome.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Proposed rule change could pave way for president to fire economists whose figures prove politically inconvenient

Summarizing his befuddlement with numbers, Mark Twain observed that there were “lies, damned lies and statistics”.

The acerbic phrase later become so deeply embedded in popular consciousness that it once formed the title to an episode of The West Wing, NBC's portrayal of a fictitious US president played by Martin Sheen.

Now professional economists and number-crunchers fear the aphorism could become a White House theme in real life. Buffeted by global markets and public opinion – both of which show a wary skepticism of Donald Trump's affinity for trade wars – the president may be about to turn his renowned hostility to truths at odds with what he believes towards public servants charged with producing accurate information.

A proposed rule change making it easier to fire civil servants deemed to be “intentionally subverting presidential directives” could pave the way for the White House to fire statisticians employed to produce objective data on the economy but whose figures prove politically inconvenient, experts warn.

Statistics released by agencies such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) are used by the Federal Reserve Bank to set inflation policy and interest rates. They also form the basis on which businesses and investors take decisions.

The US's global reputation as a stable economic power and a reliable partner goes hand-in-hand with its long history of producing accurate data, dating back to the establishment of the BLS in 1884. Interfere with the latter and you risk sacrificing the former, experts warn.

But with Trump under pressure to explain shrinking gross domestic product (GDP) figures amid economists' warnings that tariffs could trigger a recession, the administration could use new employment rules to pressure workers into “cooking the books”.

“There are a number of changes to the civil service that make it much easier for the administration to try to interfere with the activities of the statistical agencies and that worries me,” said Erica Groshen, a specialist in government statistics at Cornell University.

While acknowledging that there is as yet “no evidence” the Trump administration has done so, Groshen, a former commissioner at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), fears a new rule proposed last month by the White House's office of personnel management threatens the future integrity of federal agencies' figures.

The change, based on an executive order signed by Trump on 20 January immediately after his inauguration, would reclassify about 50,000 as-yet-unspecified permanent civil servant positions to “policy/career” category, thus enabling their removal for “poor performance or misconduct”.

The precise roles to be so redefined have yet to be revealed but Groshen fears statistic specialists will be in the administration's crosshairs.

“Bureau of Labor Statistics' leaders could be fired for releasing or planning to release jobs or inflation statistics unfavorable to the president's policy agenda,” she wrote in a briefing paper that urges organizations dependent on BLS figures to submit comments criticizing the proposal.

“By making it easier to remove employees if a president determines that they are interfering with his or her policies, it increases the potential for passivity or political loyalty to be prioritized over expertise and experience.”

Trump regularly cast doubt on the accuracy of economic data when in opposition – calling positive BLS jobs figures during the Obama and Biden administrations “fake” but hailing them as accurate when they painted a rosy picture of the economy during his first presidency.

Last month, when GDP figures showed an economic contraction during the first 100 days – partly fueled by tariffs – Trump put the blame on Biden.

“We had numbers that, despite what we were handed, we turned them around and we were getting them really turned around,” he told reporters.

The commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick – who has direct responsibility over many of the statistical agencies – has suggested changing the way GDP is calculated in a way that might provide more upbeat figures but which would mark a departure from established practice and international standards.

Diluting data agencies' impartiality risks adding the US to the category of countries which have had the veracity of their economic statistics openly doubted, critics say. Groshen cited Argentina, whose official inflation figures were rejected as false by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and Greece, where government statisticians were said to have miraculously made inflation and disqualifyingly high budget deficits “disappear” to enable it to join the European Union's single currency, the euro, in the late 1990s.

The sleight of hand had dire consequences. The 2008 global financial crash propelled the country's economy into a tail-spin, forcing it to seek huge loans from the IMF and the EU, which were only given on condition of harsh austerity measures and cuts to public services.

Popular anger over the conditions in Greece destabilised establishment political parties and led to a rise in support for radical and populist alternatives, including the leftwing Syriza, which won power in 2015. Frequent elections and changes of government since have raised concerns about the health of the country's democracy.

The IMF also censured Argentina and threatened it with expulsion in 2013 after officials were found to have been grossly understating the inflation rate for the previous six years.

Argentina – historically one of the IMF's biggest borrowers – did not receive another loan from the organisation until 2018. That loan, followed by another in 2022, failed to stabilise the country's economy and in 2023, Javier Milei, a far-right candidate and professed admirer of Trump, was elected president pledging drastic spending cuts to address its chronic economic problems.

Last month saw the fund agree to another $20bn bailout for Milei's government.

Despite these baleful precedents, the Trump administration's sensitivity to economic figures indicating a tariff-driven slowdown creates a potential spur to follow a similar path, argued Erasmus Kersting, an economics professor at Villanova University.

“I would say that there's definitely an incentive to cook the books, but I don't think that it is going to be very easy or feasible to do,” he said, citing the US's long tradition of producing accurate economic figures.

“The Bureau of Economic Analysis would essentially need to be silenced or defunded and replaced with some other statistical agency, which would then result in different figures. The same would be true of the Bureau of Labor statistics.”

Accurate and unbiased figures are crucial in helping the Federal Reserve form sound policy, Kersting said. In their absence, Trump might have more scope to attack the Fed's chair, Jerome Powell, who he has already accused of “playing politics” by not bowing to his demand to cut interest rates.

Kitty Richards, a former treasury and White House official under the Biden and Obama administrations, said data collection had been impaired by Elon Musk's attacks on federal agencies under the auspices of the unofficial “department of government efficiency,” or Doge.

“We should view attacks on government data collection as hand in glove with attacks on journalism,” said Richards, now a senior fellow at Groundwork Collaborative, a thinktank. “Undermining data collection and casting doubt on data that is released is part of a program of undermining the public's ability to learn the truth.”

Even a temporary interruption of the US's established data-collecting capacity would be a “real tragedy” and lead to a permanent loss of knowledge, she said. “You can't go back and fix it. If you have a data series stretching back 50 years, then it gets cut for two or three years, you no longer have that 50-year data series. You've lost knowledge forever.”

Greshen, who is calling on users of government statistics to object to the proposed civil service changes before a 30-day window expires on 23 May, said the fate of US democracy could hinge on the continued production of accurate figures.

“In a democracy, you want to be feeding people the right information so they will make the right choices. But if the goal is to destroy democracy, you'd want to control the statistics to fit your story … you want to be promoting your own version of reality.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Twenty-two crew members injured, 11 of them critically, with nine in a stable condition, Mexican government says

Two sailors from the Mexican navy were killed and another 11 critically hurt when a sailing ship taking part in a promotional tour in New York City collided with the iconic Brooklyn Bridge, Mexico's president Claudia Sheinbaum said.

The crash happened on Saturday night when the Cuauhtémoc – an academy training vessel with 277 people on board who shares a name with the last Aztec ruler – lost power and struck the bridge. Eyewitness videos showed dozens of sailors in ceremonial uniforms spread across yardarms shortly before the collision, which snapped the Cuauhtémoc's three masts.

In an update posted to X on Sunday morning, Sheinbaum said: “We are deeply saddened by the loss of two crew members of the training ship Cuauhtémoc, who lost their lives in the unfortunate accident in New York.

“Our solidarity and support go out to their families. The ministry of the navy, with the support of local authorities, is currently attending to the wounded.”

A Mexican government bulletin said 22 crew members were injured, 11 of them critically, with nine in a stable condition. It confirmed that the two who died were navy cadets – and that officials were taking steps to reunite survivors with their families.

“The navy, aware of the risks naval personnel face in their operations, deeply regrets what happened and reaffirms its commitment to the crew's families to provide timely attention and follow-up to the investigations into the events that occurred to accurately determine the causes of this incident,” the bulletin said.

The extent of the damage became apparent at first light on Sunday when images showed the vessel docked on the East River with the tops of two masts splintered – and a third dangling at a 45-degree angle.

Seven uniformed navy members were spotted boarding the ship, CNN reported.

Multiple videos of the crash showed the masts snapping and partially collapsing as they crashed into the deck of the bridge. There was heavy traffic on the bridge at the time of the collision.

The vessel, which was flying a giant green, white and red Mexican flag, then drifted toward the edge of the river as onlookers scrambled away from shore. Nobody was reported injured on the bridge, which was undamaged, said Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City, in a Facebook post.

An earlier statement posted by the Mexican navy said the Cuauhtémoc would be prevented from continuing its scheduled 254-day voyage. It was taking part in an ongoing celebration of the 200th anniversary of the independence of Mexico – achieved from Spain in 1821 – and was to have visited 22 ports in 15 countries to “carry the message of peace and goodwill of the Mexican people to the seas and ports of the world”.

It sailed from Acapulco on Mexico's Pacific coast on 6 April and was due to make stops in a succession of countries around the Caribbean before crossing the Atlantic to Europe, including stopovers in Aberdeen and London.

Its crew consisted of 64 women and 213 men.

Sydney Neidell and Lily Katz told the Associated Press they were sitting outside to watch the sunset when they saw the vessel strike the bridge and one of its masts snap. 
 “We saw someone dangling, and I couldn't tell if it was just blurry or my eyes, and we were able to zoom in on our phone and there was someone dangling from the harness from the top for like at least like 15 minutes before they were able to rescue them,” Katz said.
 They said they saw two people removed from the ship on stretchers on to smaller boats.

The Brooklyn Bridge, which opened in 1883, has a nearly 1,600-foot (490 metres) main span that is supported by two masonry towers. More than 100,000 vehicles and an estimated 32,000 pedestrians cross every day, according to the city's transportation department, and its walkway is a major tourist attraction.

The Cuauhtémoc – about 297 feet long and 40 feet wide (90.5 metres long and 12 metres wide), according to the Mexican navy – sailed for the first time in 1982. Each year it sets out at the end of classes at the naval military school to finish cadets' training.

A far-right win is real possibility in eastern European state on same day as votes in Poland and Portugal

Romanians are voting in a pivotal presidential run-off that could radically alter their country's strategic alignment and economic prospects, as voters in Poland and Portugal also cast their ballots in a European electoral “super Sunday”.

The Romanian contest, the most consequential of the three, pits a brash, EU-critical, Trump-admiring populist against a centrist independent in a knife-edge vote that analysts have called most important in the country's post-communist history.

George Simion, a former soccer ultra and ultranationalist agitator who sees his far-right AUR party as a “natural ally” of the US Maga movement, comfortably won the 4 May first round with a score of 41%, double that of the Bucharest mayor, Nicuşor Dan.

Recent polls have shown the gap between the two candidates closing, with one putting them neck and neck and another placing Dan – who has described the vote as a battle between “a pro-western and an anti-western Romania” – ahead.

By 2pm local time, turnout – which totalled 53% in the first round – had already reached 43%, with more than 1.25m more votes cast than at the same time two weeks ago. Young people were voting in particularly large numbers, official figures showed. Analysts have said a high turnout should favour Dan.

“This is a turning point, a crucial election,” the Bucharest mayor said as he cast his ballot, adding that he voted “for a European direction ... not Romania's isolation”. Simion said he “voted against the inequalities and injustices done to the Romanian people” and “for our future to be decided by Romanian people”.

Siegfried Mureşan, a liberal Romanian MEP, said the election “isn't just about the president of Romania, but about its entire direction”. He said Simion would “weaken Europe's unity, undermine support for Ukraine, and benefit only Vladimir Putin”.

In Poland, 13 contenders are vying to be the country's next head of state in the first round of presidential elections, with the centrist mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, a senior member of prime minister Donald Tusk's Civic Coalition, the frontrunner.

Polls predict that Trzaskowski and Karol Nawrocki, a historian who is formally independent but has been endorsed by the former national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government, will advance to the second round, which is due on 1 June.

A win for the centrist would boost Tusk's ability to push through his reformist agenda, which has been hampered by Polish presidents' power to veto legislation passed by parliament. The outgoing president, Andrzej Duda, is a PiS ally.

Portugal, meanwhile, heads to the polls for its third snap general election in three years after the centre-right prime minister, Luís Montenegro, triggered and lost a confidence vote in parliament over questions about his family's business activities.

Montenegro's Democratic Alliance (AD) platform is forecast to finish first but fall short of a majority, and could struggle to form a government, especially if the Socialist party (PS), likely to finish second, keeps its pledge to oppose his legislative agenda.

Montenegro has vowed not to work with the far-right Chega, whose leader, former TV football pundit André Ventura, was hospitalised on Friday after twice collapsing at rallies, but could be replaced as party leader with someone more Chega-compatible.

Simion's win triggered the collapse of Romania's government of centre-left Social Democrats (PSD) and centre-right Liberals (PNL), and whoever wins will nominate the next prime minister and influence the formation of a new ruling coalition.

The vote is a rerun of last November's ballot, won by a far-right, Moscow-friendly firebrand, Călin Georgescu, who was barred from standing again after the vote was cancelled amid allegations of campaign finance violations and Russian meddling.

Simion has promised to nominate Georgescu, who is under formal investigation on counts including misreporting campaign spending, illegal use of digital technology and promoting fascist groups, as prime minister if he becomes president.

Romanian presidents have a semi-executive role with considerable powers over foreign policy, national security, defence spending and judicial appointments. They can also dissolve parliament if MPs reject two prime ministerial nominations.

Analysts have said that since neither PSD or PNL would want a snap election with Simion's AUR – the second biggest party in parliament – in the ascendant, a minority AUR-led government, backed perhaps by PSD, is a clear possibility if Simion wins.

Simion opposes further aid to Ukraine and has sharply criticised the EU's leadership. While he insists he wants Romania to stay in the EU and Nato, he could ally with Hungary's Viktor Orbán and Slovakia's Robert Fico as another disruptive force.

“Simion's election would mark a sea change in Romanian politics, creating significant risks to domestic stability, Bucharest-Brussels relations, and EU unity over Ukraine,” said Mujtaba Rahman of the political risk consultancy Eurasia Group.

The prospect of a Simion win has spooked markets and investors, causing the Romanian leu to plunge and major foreign business chambers in Romania have warned of a “rapid deterioration” in the business climate. Romania has the EU's highest budget deficit.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

International society should support Taiwan's participation in the WHO and other international healthcare organizations in line with the principles of fairness and professionalism, Minister of Health and Welfare Chiu Tai-yuan (邱泰源) said in Geneva on Saturday.

The annual World Health Assembly (WHA) — the decisionmaking body of the WHO — is to begin today in Genva, Switzerland. As of yesterday, Taiwan had yet to receive an invitation.

The Taiwan WHA Action Team led by Chiu, which includes health officials and legislators, attended the opening ceremony of the “Taiwan's Tech for WHO's Three Core Pillars” interactive exhibition on Saturday. The event, hosted by the civil group Taiwan United Nations Alliance (TAIUNA) in the lobby of Geneva Cornavin train station, is to run until this afternoon.

The ceremony opened with the Puzangalan Children's Choir, made up of children from the indigenous Paiwan community, singing renowned Taiwanese folk songs.

The exhibition, a collaboration of many Taiwanese start-up teams, showcases healthcare technologies, including a chronic diseases information management system for large language models, a blockchain-based health credential platform and a fall detection system, TAIUNA said.

Exhibition curator and TAIUNA member Tung Nai-Yun (董乃昀) said the main topic of the exhibition is the WHO's “Triple Billion” goals — “more people benefiting from universal health coverage,” “more people better protected from health emergencies” and “more people enjoying better health and well-being.”

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan demonstrated its technology governance and public health capabilities, so hopefully the exhibition can show the world how it can use technology to improve global health, she said.

The National Health Insurance system has shown its systemic resilience, allowing flexible responses and civilian mobilization, which is the implementation of the WHO's goal of “more people benefiting from universal health coverage,” Chiu said.

Taiwan used digital technology to assist in border controls, vaccine distribution and medical resource allocation, which prevented its health system from being overwhelmed, he said.

“The international society should support Taiwan's participation in the WHO and other international healthcare organizations, according to the principles of fairness and professionalism,” he said.

“Only when all who are capable of contributing are allowed to participate, can global health truly become sustainable,” he added.

TAIUNA executive director and New Taipei City Councilor Evalyn Chen (陳乃瑜) said that regardless of race and nationality, health is a common responsibility of the whole world, and Taiwan has long shown it has the medical capability to be a WHO member, so it would continue to communicate with the international community.

“Taiwan is not only a participant, but can be a contributor,” she said.

China yesterday announced anti-dumping duties as high as 74.9 percent on imports of polyoxymethylene (POM) copolymers, a type of engineering plastic, from Taiwan, the US, the EU and Japan.

The Chinese Ministry of Commerce's findings conclude a probe launched in May last year, shortly after the US sharply increased tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, computer chips and other imports.

POM copolymers can partially replace metals such as copper and zinc, and have various applications, including in auto parts, electronics and medical equipment, the Chinese ministry has said.

In January, it said initial investigations had determined that dumping was taking place, and implemented preliminary anti-dumping measures in the form of a deposit starting from Jan. 24.

The highest anti-dumping rates of 74.9 percent were levied on imports from the US, while European shipments would face 34.5 percent duties, the announcement said.

China slapped 35.5 percent duties on Japanese imports, except for Asahi Kasei Corp, which received a company-specific rate of 24.5 percent.

General duties of 32.6 percent were placed on imports from Taiwan, while Formosa Plastics Corp (台塑) received a 4 percent tariff and Polyplastics Taiwan Co (台灣寶理) 3.8 percent.

Hopes have risen that the US-China trade war is easing after the two sides said on Monday last week that they had agreed to slash reciprocal tariffs in a 90-day truce, a deal that state mouthpiece the Global Times on Friday said should be extended.

The APEC group of nations warned of “fundamental challenges” facing the global trading system in a communique on Friday after a meeting in South Korea.

This year's World Masters Games opened on Saturday in Taipei and New Taipei City to complaints over the state of the facilities and the translations of people's names.

The multisport event, open to individuals rather than national teams, is to run until May 30.

“There have been many problems since Taipei and New Taipei began preparations for the Games three years ago,” Taipei Citizens Sports Promotion Association chairman Kang Chia-wei (康家瑋) said yesterday. “Now we see a mess of glitches and blunders in its publicity, promotion materials and gift packs, as well as on-site mismanagement issues.”

Kang said the two cities' officials should put in extra effort to ensure things go smoothly for the duration of the Games, but if the disputes and bungling keep on happening, it would make it very difficult for Taiwan to gain hosting rights for another major international competition.

Taiwanese documentary film-maker Ho Chao-ti (賀照緹) yesterday wrote online that she signed up for swimming events, and headed to the venue at University of Taipei's water sports facility in the city's Tianmu District (天母) yesterday morning.

“We wanted to do practice laps in the pool before the competition got under way, and headed to the dressing room, but most storage lockers were broken and the locks unusable,” Ho said. “Only a few lockers were usable, but we found that inside they were full of trash, food and drink containers, chopsticks, used tissues, and even plastic bags for prescription medicine.”

“The dressing room also had quite a few foreigners using many different languages, but the feelings of disgust on their faces made me feel quite ashamed... I don't understand how the organizers failed to check and clean the trash from inside the lockers,” she wrote.

Meanwhile, attention has been drawn to the numerous bad translations of names of participants, volunteers and Games officials. A man surnamed Wang (王) received his name tag reading “King Next Day,” while others complained of strange and misconstrued words in English, instead of using phonetic transliterations.

Some people online have said that the contractor responsible had appeared to use Chinese artificial intelligence tools, as DeepSeek and Baidu Translate give similar results when converting the same names from Mandarin to English, raising security concerns that personal data could be sent to servers in China. 

Concerns were raised online that the name tag contractor could be a Chinese business in disguise, as well as the possibility that other companies contracted by the Taipei City Government for the Games could have the support of Chinese capital.

In a speech at Vilnius University in the Lithuanian capital, Tsai highlighted recent incidents in which vital undersea cables — essential for cross-border data transmission — were severed in the Taiwan Strait and the Baltic Sea over the past year.
Taiwanese authorities suspect Chinese sabotage in the incidents near Taiwan's waters, while EU leaders have said Russia is the likely culprit behind similar breaches in the Baltic.

A race charging straight up the large-hill ski-jump at Okurayama Ski Jump Stadium in Sapporo was held Saturday, with a total of about 1,800 people taking on an elevation gain of roughly 130 meters and a maximum gradient of 37 degrees.

Nicknamed “the world's toughest 400-meter sprint,” the event was in its eighth edition this year. Men's and women's individual races and four-person relays were contested, with competitors clawing their way to the finish line by gripping safety nets and wooden beams installed to prevent falls. Some runners, spent of strength, had to withdraw.

First-time participant Takahiro Shimoyama, a local resident, said, “I felt a level of fatigue I'd never experienced before, but the sense of accomplishment unique to this race was incredible.”

Russia carried out its largest single drone attack since the start of its full-scale invasion, launching 273 drones overnight on May 18, Ukraine's Air Force reported.

The attack comes just two days after Ukraine and Russia held their first direct peace talks since 2022, and one day ahead of a planned call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

Kyiv Oblast Governor Mykola Kalashnyk reported that the attack killed one person and injured three others. Actual casualties from the attack are still being clarified, he said. 

Kyiv Independent journalists in the capital heard multiple explosions throughout the night as air defenses worked.

Ukraine's Air Force said it intercepted 88 drones, while 128 others vanished from radars, likely used as decoys to overwhelm air defenses. The air defense involved the coordinated use of electronic warfare units, mobile fire teams, and anti-aircraft systems.

The previous largest drone attack of the full-scale invasion occurred on Feb. 23, when 267 drones entered Ukrainian airspace, Air Force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat said at the time.

Despite increasing international pressure for an unconditional ceasefire, Moscow has intensified its assaults, displaying ongoing resistance and distain to diplomatic efforts.

The Russian delegation at the May 16 peace talks in Istanbul consisted solely of lower-ranking officials, despite the Kremlin proposing the discussions. President Volodymyr Zelensky had called on Putin to attend personally, saying only the Russian leader could authorize a ceasefire.

Russian negotiators reiterated sweeping demands: that Ukraine abandon NATO aspirations, renounce foreign military support, drop reparations claims, and accept Russian control over Crimea and four occupied regions — demands Kyiv has categorically rejected.

Trump has pushed to broker a deal but has yet to impose new sanctions on Moscow despite mounting frustration from U.S. allies over Russia's refusal to halt its attacks.

Ukraine accepted a U.S.-proposed 30-day unconditional truce in March. Russia has ignored the offer and continued targeting Ukrainian cities with missiles, drones, and guided bombs.

President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican on May 18, following the pontiff's inauguration mass, he said in a post on social media.

""For millions of people around the world, the Pontiff is a symbol of hope for peace. The authority and voice of the Holy See can play an important role in bringing this war to an end,"" Zelensky said.

""We appreciate the support for Ukraine and the clear voice in defense of a just and lasting peace,"" he added.

The visit marked Zelensky's first in-person meeting with the new pope, formerly Cardinal Robert Prevost, who was elected head of the Catholic Church on May 8. 

During their meeting, Zelensky presented Pope Leo with a special icon, ""Mother of God with Child,"" painted on a fragment of a box that held heavy artillery. The icon was brought from Izium, a Kharkiv Oblast town located about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the front line. A pregnant woman was killed in a Russian missile attack against Izium in February of this year.

The gift represents children ""who suffered from the war, who were deliberately kidnapped and deported by Russia and who are very much awaited at home in Ukraine,"" Zelensky said.

The return of Ukraine's forcibly deported children was among the issues Zelensky and Pope Leo discussed during their first phone call on May 12.

During the inauguration mass, Zelensky was accompanied by First Lady Olena Zelenska and Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak. 

The event drew 250,000 pilgrims and 156 foreign delegations, including U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. Vice President JD Vance, who met Pope Francis shortly before his death.

A day before the event, Rubio said that the Vatican could serve as a neutral venue for future peace negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. 

Speaking in Rome before his meeting with Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, the Vatican's envoy on Ukraine, Rubio noted that ""both sides would be comfortable"" holding talks there.

On May 11, during his first public address, the pope said he carried the ""suffering of the beloved people of Ukraine"" in his heart and called for an ""authentic and lasting peace.""

Zelensky had his first phone call with Pope Leo XIV on May 12, describing the conversation as ""warm"" and ""substantive."" On May 18, the pontiff received a list of Ukrainian prisoners of war held by Russia.

Before becoming pope, Leo XIV denounced Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine while serving as Bishop of Chiclayo in Peru. In a 2022 interview, he described it as ""a true invasion, imperialist in nature, where Russia seeks to conquer territory for reasons of power.""

As Ukraine's liberating forces advanced in the fall of 2022, several trucks stopped near the rear yard of the Kherson Local History Museum. Inside the building itself, dozens of people moved back and forth like ants through the corridors.

These people didn't work there — they were employees from museums in occupied Crimea who, on the instructions of the Russian leadership, had come to remove Scythian and Sarmatian gold jewellery, valuable collections of weapons and coins, and thousands of other historical artifacts from then-occupied Kherson.

""Some of them did the packing, others grabbed what they liked,""  a museum guard recalled in an interview with the Kyiv independent.

They then shifted their focus to the nearby Kherson Museum of Local Lore. What was unfolding was just part of what would amount to the looting of nearly 33,000 items from the two museums — the largest such theft in Europe since World War II.

A two-year investigation by Ukrainian authorities has made little progress. The media has only mentioned the names of Ukrainian defectors who collaborated with Russia. 

The Kyiv Independent has discovered not only who organized the illegal removal of valuables, but also where the collections are now held. 

To dupe those responsible into revealing previously secret details of the theft, investigative journalist Yevheniia Motorevska would have to take on the roles of a naive producer of a Russian TV channel, and a tough and inquisitive investigator of the Russian Federation. 

Both museums are located in the central part of Kherson near the Dnipro River, an area which before Russia's full-scale invasion, was always crowded with people visiting the exhibitions and frequenting the local restaurants. 

The city of Kherson was occupied by Russian forces in the early days of March, 2022, until being liberated by Ukraine's lightning counteroffensive later that year.

Today this area is a red zone which suffers constant shelling — just a couple of kilometers away, on the other bank of the Dnipro river, Russian forces fire artillery, and launch drones that systematically target civilians in what has been dubbed a ""human safari."" 

Since the end of the 19th century, the Kherson Local History Museum had accumulated more than 180,000 artifacts including those of the Scythians, Sarmatians, Goths, Greeks and Romans, all of whom lived in the territory of modern southern Ukraine over the centuries. 

Today all that remains are the paper descriptions where they used to be displayed.


""In Russia, they always spoke of themselves as a cultural nation. But no, only vandals could have done that.""
    

The current head of the Kherson Local History museum, Olha Honcharova, told the Kyiv Independent about the moment she first entered the museum after the city's liberation.

""It was a real act of vandalism. In Russia, they always spoke of themselves as a cultural nation. But no, only vandals could have done that,"" she said.

""A very expensive item that was in this hall was the saber of the Emir of Bukhara. It cost, according to some estimates, more than $150,000,"" she added while walking around the empty halls.

Honcharova was appointed to her position immediately after Kherson was liberated from Russian occupation. Her predecessor, Tetiana Bratchenko, collaborated with the occupation regime and is now, according to the Kyiv Independent's investigation, hiding in Russia.

In total, more than 23,000 exhibits were stolen from the Kherson Museum of Local Lore, as well as all the records of the collection.

Witnesses to the theft were two of the museum's guards who continued to work when the city was occupied, but refused to cooperate with Russian forces.

They claim that during the looting, some 70 specialists from occupied Crimea selected exhibits, kept records, and packed items in the museum. None gave their names or positions. 

The guards also pointed to a mysterious commandant who personally supervised the removal of valuables — but the details they provided were not sufficient on their own to identify him.

Before Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukrainian Artem Lagoysky was a Kherson blogger known as ""Bydlo."" When the Russians arrived, he eagerly accepted a post in the occupying regime as deputy minister of culture.

The Kyiv Independent knew he had information about the theft but in order to speak to him and get him to open up, had to pose as Russian journalists making a film about culture in the ""territories liberated by Russia.""

Believing he was speaking to a ""TV producer in Moscow,"" Lagoysky, speaking from the occupied Ukrainian city of Henichesk, Kherson Oblast, freely admitted that he ""personally carried the exhibits from museums during the evacuation.""

Lagoysky also revealed the names of other high-ranking officials from occupied Crimea who came to remove artifacts — Elena Morozova, director of the Chersonesos Museum, which is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List, and Mikhail Smorodkin, director of the Sevastopol Defense Museum, one of the largest museums on the occupied peninsula. 

Both are Russian citizens who moved to Crimea to take up positions there after the peninsula was occupied in 2014.

""They came in groups, with guys. Everyone helped us,"" Lagosky added.

To obtain more evidence of their involvement in the museum theft, it was necessary to contact another defector, Oleksandr Kuzmenko, who at the time of the looting was the ""minister of culture"" in Kherson Oblast. Before the full-scale invasion, he was the director of a local music school.

Kuzmenko no longer holds a minister position and was unlikely to want to speak to Russian journalists, so a different approach was needed — Motorevska called him under the guise of an ""investigator from Moscow"" looking into how several objects that were supposed to be taken to Russian-controlled territories had appeared on the black market.

During the conversation, Kuzmenko confirmed that both Morozova and Smorodkin were present in Kherson, claiming it was they who decided which exhibits should be taken out of the Local History Museum and which should stay.

""They are experts. They know what is valuable and what is not,"" Kuzmenko said.

Using the same cover story, Motorevska called another Kherson defector, Andriy Khodchenko, the Local History Museum's former deputy director, who, after the liberation of Kherson fled to Russia's Krasnodar Krai, a region that shares a border with Ukraine.

Khodchenko also fell for the ruse and confirmed Morozova's presence, also sharing details about another Crimean official, Mikhail Smorodkin, the Sevastopol Defense Museum's director, claiming at one point he tried to put some of the museum's exhibits into his own car.

""But I pointed it out to the commandant, and the commandant made him move the items into the truck. He said: 'Everything will be loaded here. I will seal everything',"" Khodchenko said.

This was confirmation that directors of two museums — the Chersonesos Museum and Sevastopol Defense Museum — were present during the theft. These are also the two museums it was suspected the looted items were taken to. 

Now it was time to establish the name of the Russian officer, the commandant of Kherson, who personally participated in, and possibly oversaw, the theft.

""As I remember, the commandant was limping, he walked with a cane... I don't know his last name, but I saw him during the evacuation,"" Kuzmenko said.

There were clues to his identity — the museum guards said he was wearing the uniform of a colonel, and it was already known he walked with a limp.

Lagoysky said in addition to looting the museums, he and the commandant personally took the remains of Russian military leader Grigory Potemkin from his tomb in St. Catherine's Cathedral in Kherson.

This was even documented — Lagoysky sent photographs of the process to journalists, but the angle of the commandant in the picture prevented identification

Fortunately, Kuzmenko had another photograph which clearly showed the commandant's face, which he sent to the Kyiv Independent via Telegram.

With the help of facial recognition software, he was swiftly identified — Dmitry Lipov, a Russian naval officer with the rank equivalent to a colonel. 

It is known from open sources that he is the head of the communications center of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation, but his senior position among the occupation authorities of Kherson has not been previously reported.

The Russian defectors interviewed by the Kyiv Independent also said Lipov coordinated his actions with the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) — in fact, it was representatives of the FSB who oversaw the entire operation.

Khodchenko reported that FSB officers held meetings in Kherson with museum employees and occupation authorities in Kherson Oblast, and helped organize the theft. 

The Kyiv Independent team discovered the FSB officer who led this process was called Vasily, but could not fully identify him.

According to Kuzmenko, FSB officers also supervised the removal of valuables from the Art Museum where more than 10,000 works of art, including three paintings by the famous Ukrainian painter Ivan Aivazovsky, were looted.

""(The Russians) were mainly focused on taking paintings, they took those away. They left artworks that were not in very good condition, or that they simply didn't like,""  the current deputy director Ihor Rusol said.


In 2022, the Russians stole almost 35,000 artifacts — the same number of items in the exhibition halls of the Louvre in Paris, France. 
    

At least part of the Art Museum's collection is now located in occupied Crimea, at the Taurida Central Museum.

In total, according to the information of the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine, from six museums in the territories liberated by the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 2022, the Russians stole almost 35,000 artifacts — the same number of items in the exhibition halls of the Louvre in Paris, France. 

The illegal removal of valuables also occurred in the territories that remain under occupation — Ukrainian authorities reported the looting of the Melitopol Local History Museum in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, and the Mariupol Local History Museum in Donetsk Oblast. 

The scale of the thefts from these museums is impossible to accurately assess at present.

Vitalii Tytych is a lawyer and military serviceman. In the first two years of the full-scale war, he documented crimes against cultural heritage as part of a special Territorial Defence Forces unit. 

Tytych believes the Russians will, ironically, try to use international law to get away with the thefts, citing the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict to try to convince the world they were not looting, but saving artifacts from possible damage caused by being near the front lines. 

""Persecution of museum workers, theft of the records without leaving descriptions or documenting the selection process — it had nothing to do with the actions stipulated by the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property,” Tytych said. 

The Local History Museum's staff together with public initiatives are working to restore the records of the collection stolen by the Russians. Due to the fact Ukraine does not have a unified state register of museum values, this process is complex. 

However, the relevant documentation is the basis for establishing the extent of the damage caused to Ukraine and for making claims in the future.

Vitalii Tytych sees the looting of museums as part of Russia's state policy to destroy Ukrainian culture, which has been ongoing since tsarist times. 

""The idea of ​​destroying the Ukrainian nation through the destruction of the features of its identity, its distinction from all other 'Russian world' is at the heart of this aggression,"" Tytych said. 


          We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war —
          and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information
          should be available to all.

Pope Leo XIV waves to Catholic faithful at his inaugural mass at the Vatican on May 18.Yara Nardi/Reuters

The Catholic faithful came by the tens of thousands to see the formal inauguration of Pope Leo XIV, the first American pontiff, in an event marked by ancient tradition and pleas for Church openness and peace around the world. 

The pilgrims were joined by more than 150 dignitaries, including Prime Minister Mark Carney, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and Israeli President Isaac Herzog. Notably absent was U.S. President Donald Trump, who had come to Rome earlier this month to attend the funeral of Pope Francis, who died at age 88 on April 21. 

Pope Leo XIV, history's first American pope, vowed Sunday to work for unity so that the Catholic Church becomes a sign of peace in the world, offering a message of communion during an inaugural Mass in St. Peter's Square before an estimated 200,000 pilgrims, presidents, patriarchs and princes. 

The Associated Press

The day before the mass, Mr. Carney met for the first time with Mr. Zelensky. In a message on X, Mr. Carney he “underscored Canada's strong support for Ukraine – today, tomorrow, and every day until there is true freedom, peace and security for all Ukrainians.'

The 267th pope's arrival mixed modern statecraft with ritual that has barely changed in centuries. 

Leo, 69, the former Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, arrived in an electric, open-back Mercedes. At one point, the “popemobile” stopped briefly so he could kiss a child. During his tour of the square, there were chants of “Viva il Papa” and loud applause. 

The mass was delivered mostly in Italian and Latin, but there were readings in other languages, including English, as the pilgrims who could not see the altar clearly watched the event on massive video scenes. 

The mass started when Leo entered St. Peter's Basilica alongside a procession of cardinals. Inside, he received two gifts that symbolize the papacy.

The first was a gold signet fisherman's ring, which is named in honour of St. Peter, a fisherman who became the first pope 2000 years ago. The ring represents the beginning and end of a papacy, and when a pontiff dies, it is destroyed. 

The second gift was a lamb's wool pallium, which symbolizes the pope's role as a shepherd. It was placed over his shoulders and worn during the mass.

When he was elected pope after a remarkably fast, 25-hour conclave that finished on May 8, his first words from the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica were “Peace be with you all.”

On Sunday morning, his homily picked up on the theme as wars continued to lay waste to Ukraine and Gaza. 

“In this our time, we still see too much discord, too many wounds caused by hatred, violence, prejudice, the fear of difference, and an economic paradigm that exploits the Earth's resources and marginalizes the poorest,” he said. 

“Listen to his offer of love and become his one family: in the one Christ, we are one. This is the path to follow together, among ourselves but also with our sister Christian churches, with those who follow other religious paths, with those who are searching for God, with all women and men of good will, in order to build a new world where peace reigns!”

The pilgrims and tourists had flooded into St. Peter's Square well before dawn to ensure they could see Leo mark his official debut as the leader of 1.4 billion Catholics. By 7 a.m., three hours before the start of his inaugural mass, some had fallen asleep on their chairs in the warm morning Roman sun as visitors from all over the world held their positions for fear of losing their chairs.

Some came from Peru, where Leo worked as an Augustine order missionary priest for 20 years; others from the United States to celebrate the debut of the first American pontiff, who is from south Chicago.

Molly Milroy, 47, a freelance writer who lives in Minnesota but lived in Chicago early in her career, traveled to Rome out of a sense of patriotism and Catholic calling. She wore a cap with the city of Chicago flag on it. 

“Having an American pope is incredible,” she said. “I felt the call to come here in my heart, maybe the Holy Spirit. I feel more American. And he is someone who roots for the White Sox!”

Mr. Trump's absence from the mass pleased some visitors. 

“Why did Trump not come?” asked Pino Cavuoti, 64, a radio journalist who is a member of Catholic charity fraternity in the region of Abruzzo, in central Italy. “He probably wanted to make more money during his tour of Gulf states. But from what I have read, he and Leo would not get along anyway.”

The White House was represented at the Leo's mass by Vice-President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their entourages.

How much will Mark Carney's Catholic faith inform the way he governs Canada?

Mr. Carney, who had missed Francis's funeral because of the election, arrived in Rome on Saturday and met his Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni the same day. They discussed the G7 summit, which Canada will host June 15-17 in Kananaskis, Alta. Italy was the host last year. 

In a statement, the Italian government said the first meeting between Mr. Carney and Ms. Meloni “provided an opportunity to address the main international issues, starting with the war in Ukraine, reiterating the shared commitment for a just and lasting peace, and the ongoing efforts to restore stability in the Middle East region.”

An estimated 150,000 pilgrims and dozens of world leaders attended the mass. Among the heads of state or government were Britain's Prince Edward, Argentinian President Javier Milei, Anthony Albanese, the newly re-elected prime minister of Australia, and Germany's new chancellor, Friedrich Merz. 

The funeral of Francis, in effect, turned into an unofficial mini-summit for some of the leaders, in particular Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky, who had recently clashed at the White House. At the funeral, the two men reportedly came to terms on the minerals deal that would see the United States develop mines in Ukraine in exchange for a substantial cut of the profits. 

After his meeting with Mr. Carney in Rome, Mr. Zelensky said on X that he was “grateful for Canada's support” in its defence against Russia. 

“The key priority is to apply pressure on Russia in a way that compels real steps towards ending the war. We spoke in detail about which sanctions can be effective – including secondary sanctions, energy-related measures, and sanctions against the shadow [oil tanker] fleet.”

Two sisters from Bergamo, in northern Italy – Domenica and Marina Bianchi, both business administrators – arrived in St. Peter's Square at 4 a.m. They said they approved of Pope Leo because of his messages of peace and because they thought that he could lure back some of the faithful who had abandoned the Church in recent decades. 

Pope Leo XIV has taken his first popemobile ride through St. Peter's Square ahead of installation, waving from the back of the open-back truck to the crowd waving flags and cheering “Viva il Papa!”

“The Church in general lost the faithful,” said Domenica. “Pope Leo might be able to change this. Francis was a bit too liberal.”

Leo's peace message resonated with many of the pilgrims at the mass. 

In one of his first posts on X, he wrote: “The Holy See is willing to help enemies meet, so they may look each other in the eye and so people may be given back the dignity they deserve: the dignity of peace. With heart in hand, I say to the leaders of nations: let us meet; let us dialogue; let us negotiate!”

The IDF said the ""extensive"" operation began over the past day, involving both active duty and reservists. Meanwhile, Israel said it is open to a deal on stopping the Gaza fighting as negotiators meet in Doha. Follow DW.

Here is a roundup of developments in Israel, Gaza and the wider Middle East region on Saturday, May 17 and Sunday, May 18:

The ongoing intensified fighting in the northern Gaza Strip has forced the last functioning public hospital to close, the health authorities in the Hamas-run enclave said on Sunday.

Patients, medical staff and essential supplies were no longer able to get to the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahia amid the violence, the ministry said.

It said all public hospitals in northern Gaza were now no longer operational. 

This comes as hospitals and medics in Gaza reported that Israeli airstrikes in a new offensive had killed at least 130 people, including children, overnight and into Sunday.

Those deaths come in addition to the 464 Palestinians reported by the Health Ministry to have been killed in Israeli military strikes on Gaza in the past week.

Israel launched the offensive on Saturday with the declared aims of achieving ""operational control in the areas of Gaza.""

The offensive is the largest since Israel broke a ceasefire with Hamas in March.

The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that Israel was open to striking a deal with Hamas that included ""ending the fighting"" in Gaza as teams of negotiators met in the Qatari capital, Doha.

The office said: ""Even at this very moment, the negotiation team in Doha is working to exhaust every possibility for a deal — whether according to the Witkoff framework or as part of ending the fighting,"" referring to US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who has been involved in previous discussions.

It said the latest talks included discussions on a truce and hostage deal, as well as an Israeli proposal to end the war in return for ""the exile of Hamas terrorists, and the disarmament of the Gaza Strip,"" according to the statement.

The latter terms are ones that Hamas has previously rejected.

 A senior Israeli official said there had been no progress in the talks so far.

The Israeli military said Sunday that it had begun ""extensive ground operations"" throughout northern and southern Gaza as part of a new campaign dubbed ""Operation Gideon's Chariots.""

In a statement, the military said it had killed dozens of Hamas fighters and struck more than 670 targets in preliminary strikes over the past week.

Health workers in Gaza have said hundreds of people, including many women and children, have been killed in the past week, with nearly a hundred bodies arriving at hospitals on Sunday.

The Israeli military said the campaign involved both active-duty soldiers and reservists.

""The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) will continue to operate against the terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip as required, in order to defend Israeli civilians,"" the statement read.

Israel says the new plan is meant to increase pressure on the militant Hamas group to release Israeli hostages held in Gaza.

Hamas has said it wants any new ceasefire deal to include provisions for Israeli forces to completely pull out of Gaza along with a road map to ending the fighting.  

The Israeli military said on Sunday it had intercepted a missile fired from Yemen, with the Iran-backed Houthi rebels claiming to have launched two missiles at Israel's main airport.

""A missile that was launched from Yemen was intercepted,"" the Israeli military said in a statement, adding that air raid sirens had sounded in several areas of the country.

The Houthis later said they had fired ""two ballistic missiles"" towards Israel's Ben Gurion Airport, near Tel Aviv. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesman, said the group would continue targeting Israel until the ""siege is lifted"" on Gaza.

Earlier this month, a Houthi missile struck the area of the Tel Aviv airport, causing a hole near its main terminal building and wounding several people in a rare penetration of Israeli air defenses.

On Friday, Israel bombed the Houthi-held Red Sea ports of Hodeida and Salif following three missile attacks in as many days. It threatened to target the Houthi leadership if the attacks continued.

European Council President António Costa called for Israel to lift its blockade of the Gaza Strip.

""Shocked by the daily news coming from Gaza: civilians starving, hospitals hit again by strikes. Violence must stop!"" he said in a post on the platform X.

""The Israeli government must lift the blockade now and ensure the safe, swift, and unimpeded access of humanitarian aid,"" Costa said.

Israel imposed a total aid blockade on the Palestinian territory on March 2.

Costa described the situation in Gaza as a ""humanitarian tragedy.""

""A whole people is being subjected to crushing, disproportionate military force. International law is systematically violated,"" he said.

He called for a ""sustained ceasefire"" and the ""immediate and unconditional release"" of all hostages still held in the Gaza Strip.

Around 58 hostages are though to still be held in Gaza. On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that only 21 of them had been confirmed as alive.

Israel's military campaign in Gaza, which has intensified this week, has also cast a shadow over the Eurovision Song Contest that took place in the Swiss city of Basel on Saturday night.

One of the contestants at the event was Israeli singer Yuval Raphael, whose participation triggered pro-Palestinian protests in Basel earlier on Saturday. Pro-Israel counter rallies were also held.

The protesters calling for Israel to be removed from the contest tried to move across Basel but were confronted by police, who used tear gas to disperse the crowd.

Inside the St. Jakobshalle arena, Raphael, who survived the October 7, 2023 Hamas terror attacks, performed her song ""New Day Will Rise,"" which was met with a mixture of cheers and boos.

Pro-Palestinian protesters attempted to disrupt Raphael's performance.

A crew member was reportedly hit with paint by the protesters, organizers said, according to Swiss broadcaster SRG SSR.

A spokesperson for the Swiss channel said ""a man and a woman tried to get over a barrier on to the stage"" before one of them ""threw paint and a crew member was hit.""

Nobody was injured in the incident, the spokesperson said, adding that the two ""agitators"" were removed from the venue and handed over to police.

Swiss police confirmed that the two protesters had since been released. 

The Israeli military said that it intercepted a missile that was launched from Yemen toward Israel.

""Following the sirens that sounded a short while ago in several areas in Israel, a missile that was launched from Yemen was intercepted,"" the Israeli army said in a Telegram post.

Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis have continued to fire missiles at Israel, which they say is in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, though they agreed to stop attacking US ships.

In response, Israel has carried out strikes, including one on May 6 that damaged Yemen's main airport in Sanaa and killed several people.

Israel is ramping up its military offensive in Gaza as its aid blockade to the Strip approaches 11 weeks.

Rosalia Bollen, UNICEF's spokesperson for Gaza, told DW what families in the war zone are forced to suffer.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from Rome on Saturday, the US State Department said in a statement.

""Secretary Rubio spoke by phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tonight from Rome,"" spokesperson Tammy Bruce said. ""They discussed the situation in Gaza and their joint efforts to secure the release of all remaining hostages.""

The situation in Gaza has dominated a summit of the Arab League in Baghdad, Iraq.

Speaking to delegates UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres insisted that the United Nations will not participate in any aid operations that do not adhere to international law.

""Nothing justifies the collective punishment of the Palestinian people,"" Guterres said, calling for a permanent ceasefire.

Germany's Foreign Ministry said on Saturday that the Israeli army's intensified offensive in the Gaza Strip raised concerns both with regard to Israel's strategic goals and the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian enclave.

""Israel has, like every other state, the right to defend itself within the framework of international law,"" it said in a statement.

""But the current course of action could cost the lives of the remaining hostages, including of the German hostages who are still having to fear for their chances of survival after almost 600 days in Hamas' dungeons,"" the statement continued.

The ministry said the offensive also risked worsening the ""catastrophic"" humanitarian situation of Gaza residents and the plight of the hostages and made the prospects of a long-term ceasefire even more remote.

According to the statement, new German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul held a phone call with his Israeli counterpart, Gideon Saar, on Saturday to discuss the situation and remains in close contact with other partners in the region.

Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani has urged Israel to stop its military offensive in Gaza, saying Palestinian civilians must no longer pay the price of war.

""We have to tell the Israeli government: 'That's enough,'"" Tajani said in a statement. ""We no longer want to see the Palestinian population suffer. Stop the attacks, let's secure a ceasefire, free the hostages, but leave in peace a people who are victims of Hamas.""

His remarks came after Israel's military said it was mobilizing to expand operations in the Gaza Strip. Palestinian health authorities meanwhile said at least 146 people had been killed in the past 24 hours in continuing Israeli airstrikes.

Tajani is due to meet US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Rome on Saturday. The Italian government has been one of Israel's most vocal supporters within Europe, but calls for a ceasefire have been growing amid the devastation being wrought on Gaza.

A new round of indirect negotiations with Israel has begun in Doha ""without any preconditions,"" a senior Hamas official has said, adding that the talks were aimed at ending the war in Gaza.

""This round of negotiations began without any preconditions from either side, and the negotiations are open to discussing all issues,"" senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu said.

""Hamas will present its viewpoint on all issues, especially ending the war, [Israel's] withdrawal and prisoner exchange.""

A two-month ceasefire in Gaza fell apart when Israel resumed its operations in the enclave on March 18, severely intensifying its blockade. Other attempts to stop the war, even temporarily, failed to materialize.

UN agencies have warned that Israel's total aid blockade on the territory has created critical shortages of food, clean water, fuel and medicines, with warnings of famine on the rise.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz argued that the intensified campaign was what brought Hamas back to the negotiating table.

""With the opening of Operation 'Gideon's Chariots' in Gaza, which is being led by the IDF command with great force, the Hamas delegation in Doha announced a return to negotiations on a hostage deal, in contrast to the recalcitrant position they had taken up until that moment,"" he claimed.

Previous negotiations to end the war had often failed, as Hamas remains adamant that any deal must involve a permanent end to the war and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.

Negotiations for the release of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza have been ongoing. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said this week that he had instructed a negotiating team to head to the Qatari capital.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Saturday called for pressure to stop Israel's ""massacre in Gaza"" as forces continue to expand their offensive.

Sanchez added that Madrid is planning a UN resolution requesting a world court ruling on aid access to the Palestinian territory.

He told an Arab League summit in Baghdad that the war triggered by Hamas' October 2023 attack on Israel has led to ""unacceptable numbers"" of victims in Gaza, violating the ""principle of humanity.""

""The extremely grave humanitarian crisis Gaza has endured since October 2023 has caused more than 50,000 dead, 100,000 wounded and 2 million displaced,"" Sanchez said.

World leaders should ""intensify our pressure on Israel to halt the massacre in Gaza, particularly through the channels afforded to us by international law.""

Spain will ""submit to the United Nations General Assembly a proposal to ask the International Court of Justice to rule on Israel's compliance with its international obligations on humanitarian aid access to Gaza"", which has been under a complete aid blockade since March 2, according to Sanchez.

He added his country would also back another draft UN resolution calling on Israel to ""end the humanitarian blockade"" and guarantee ""full and unrestricted access for humanitarian aid"" to enter Gaza.

Speaking in Baghdad on Saturday, he said promoting ""a political solution"" to the conflict was a priority. ""The only path toward peace in the region"" is ""the implementation of the two-state solution"" to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he said. ""I wish once again to urge other countries to recognize the State of Palestine.""","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

Severe storms have swept through midwestern and southern states including Kentucky and Missouri, leaving a trail of death and destruction, as well as cutting power off to nearly 200,000 people. 

At least 21 people have died after severe storms swept through the states of Kentucky and Missouri in the midwestern and southern United States, officials said Saturday.

In Kentucky, governor Andy Beshear said on X that 14 people have been confirmed dead, warning that that toll is ""likely to grow.""

""Kentucky, we're starting today with the tough news that we lost at least 14 of our people to last night's storms, but sadly, this number is expected to grow as we receive more information,"" Beshear said Saturday. ""Please pray for all of our affected families."" 

Laurel County in southeast Kentucky was particularly affected, with local authorities saying nine people were killed by a tornado that touched down on Friday night.

Beshear said over 100,000 people in the state have been left without power, while five counties have declared a state of emergency.

Local media broadcast drone footage from the area which showed widespread devastation in the town of London, where homes were flattened and trees were entirely shorn of branches by the high winds.

""The devastation from last night's deadly weather is heartbreaking, but we are going to make sure we get the support needed to recover and rebuild together,"" the Kentucky governor said.

Rescuers on the ground had spent the night looking for survivors, with search continuing into Saturday morning, the Laurel County Sheriff's Office said.

Eastern Kentucky, where the tornadoes struck overnight, is known historically for its coal mines and is one of the poorest parts of the country.

In neighboring Missouri, at least seven people have died, with five of the fatalities coming in the metropolis of St Louis. Two deaths were confirmed in Scott County, about 130 miles (209 kilometers) south of St. Louis. 

In a post on X, Missouri governor Mike Kehoe said he was ""deeply saddened to learn of the deaths and injuries caused by the tornadoes and severe storms that have affected much of the state today. Our prayers are with all those impacted.""

""Our city is grieving tonight,"" St. Louis mayor Cara Spencer told a press conference on Friday night. ""The loss of life and the destruction is truly horrendous.""

Over 80,000 people were left without electricity in western Missouri, and three shelters have been set up in the area to house people whose homes have been damaged or destroyed, Missouri State Highway Patrol said in a statement.

Officials warned that more severe weather was forecast for Sunday and Monday.   

Last year, the US saw nearly 1,800 tornadoes, the second-highest number ever recorded, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

The election will decide whether Donald Tusk's government can implement reforms that have been stymied by conservative President Andrzej Duda since the government was elected about 18 months ago. DW has more.

Here's a roundup of the latest developments in Poland's presidential election on Sunday, May 18.

The presidential election saw a turnout rate of over 20% of eligible voters by midday, the Polish electoral commission has said.

Despite being four percentage points lower than the same time during the last presidential election in 2020, it is six percentage points higher than in 2015.

Poland has about 28.3 million eligible voters.

Sunday's voting in Poland is not just about whether Rafal Trzaskowski, of the center-right Civic Platform, or the national-conservative Karol Nawrocki, the two front-runners, will become Poland's next president. 

The outcome of the presidential election will determine whether the pro-EU center-right government led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk can take forward its plans, which have been stymied by President Andrzej Duda since the government was elected about 18 months ago.

Voting began in Poland on Sunday in a high-stakes presidential election that will shape the country's political future and decide its stance on abortion, LGBTQ+ rights and relations with the European Union.

The polling stations opened at 7 a.m. (0500 UTC) and close at 9 p.m. (1900 UTC), with exit poll results available after the voting has ended. 

Results are expected to be in by Monday or Tuesday.

The front-runners are pro-EU Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski, backed by Prime Minister Donald Tusk's centrist Civic Coalition, and nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki, supported by the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party. 

Polls show Trzaskowski leading with around 30% support, followed by Nawrocki in the mid-20s, making a June 1 runoff between the two likely.

Trzaskowski has pledged to support abortion rights and LGBTQ protections, while Nawrocki presents himself as a defender of conservative values and national sovereignty.

US President Donald Trump recently met Nawrocki in the White House showing his support.

The polls come amid a tussle between the Polish prime minister and the outgoing, conservative President Andrzej Duda, who has vetoed many of the Tusk government's attempts at policy reform. 

A Trzaskowski win would likely ease that gridlock, while a Nawrocki presidency could stall the coalition's agenda.

There is also a chance that far-right candidate Sławomir Mentzen, campaigning on anti-immigration, anti-EU rhetoric, could play the kingmaker in the second round.

The other candidates in the fray are Parliament Speaker Szymon Holownia of the centre-right Poland 2050 and Magdalena Biejat from the Left.

Voting began in Poland on Sunday in a tight presidential election that will shape the country's political future.

Two naval cadets were killed and several badly injured when a Mexican tall ship crashed into Brooklyn Bridge at the end of a goodwill visit to New York.

Sailors were standing on the masts and rigging of the Cuauhtemoc for a ceremonial departure when it ploughed into the river crossing at speed while attempting to leave harbour.

The training vessel was travelling in reverse when it hit the bridge stern first, snapping off the tops of three masts and sending onlookers running for cover.

Authorities blamed “mechanical issues”, and said the ship had lost power before the crash, at about 8.20pm on Saturday evening.

But some experts have speculated that the ship's engines may have been stuck in reverse after tug boats pushed it into position to set sail.

Pictures and video from the scene showed the boat moving at considerable speed, although it would probably have been aided by incoming tides and light winds in the direction of the bridge.

Questions have been raised about whether a tug boat should have been tethered to the ship to avoid it drifting.

There was “panic on the ship,” said Brooklyn resident Nick Corso, 23, who was standing near the water when the crash happened.

He said he had seen “lots of screaming, some sailors hanging from the masts, it looked like panic happening on the ship”.

“I didn't see anyone fall into the water but lots of people up top. People ran back and were screaming!”

Elijah West, another witness, told the New York Post: “The boat was coming under the bridge, and there were sailors on top of the boat, the sails hit the bridge and then people were falling off of the boat sails. ”

Authorities said no one had fallen overboard and all 277 crew were accounted for. Two were killed and 19 taken to hospital, including at least two in a critical condition.

Claudia Sheinbaum, the Mexican president, said: “We are deeply saddened by the loss of two crew members of the training ship Cuauhtémoc, who lost their lives in the unfortunate accident in New York Harbor. Our solidarity and support go out to their families.”

The vessel arrived last week as part of a promotional tour and had been moored facing the shore at South Street Seaport in Manhattan only a few hundred yards below the Brooklyn Bridge.

The three-masted, 297ft barque had been due to depart south out of New York harbour, with a stop on the Brooklyn waterfront to refuel before heading to Iceland.

Pictures showed the vessel decked in lights on Saturday evening as it backed out, escorted by a tug, with the wind and current moving towards the bridge.

Dozens of sailors were positioned on the mast and rigging, attached by safety lines, in a tradition known as manning the yards.

The Mexican naval cadets were pictured standing on the masts as the ship arrived in New York last week. They were due to return next summer for a maritime parade to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the declaration of independence.

The vessel would have taken on a docking pilot to depart, said John Konrad, a US merchant marine captain and editor of the gCaptain maritime blog.

The tug was not tied to the ship, leaving it to manoeuvre the vessel by pushing it.

Instead of heading south, the vessel instead appeared to drift towards the bridge, where its masts that reach up to 160ft hit the crossing which has a clearance of 127ft.

Mr Konrad said key early questions included why the tugboat had not been tied to the ship, in what he said was normal practice.

He said it was also unclear why the manoeuvrer had used one tug and not two. It was also not immediately clear why, or at what point, the ship's engines had failed.

Other maritime experts examining video of the incident suggested the vessel had been travelling fast enough to produce a wake, speculating the engines were stuck in reverse.

But the city mayor and police said early indications were that the vessel had lost power.

The bridge itself sustained only minor damage and was quickly reopened to traffic.

Several of the ship's crew were taken off with bandages, or on stretchers, while the damaged vessel was later docked at the city's Pier 36 behind a city sanitation depot.

The Cuauhtémoc is a steel-hulled barque built in 1982, used to train seamen at Mexico's Heroic Naval Military School.

On April 6, the Mexican navy said the ship had set sail from Acapulco with the goal of “exalting the seafaring spirit, strengthening naval education, and carrying the Mexican people's message of peace and good will to the seas and ports of the world”.

The vessel was scheduled to visit 22 ports in 15 nations, including Jamaica, Cuba, Mexico and New York.

It had planned to visit Reykjavik, Bordeaux, Saint Malo, Dunkirk and Aberdeen among other cities for a total of 254 days – 170 at sea and 84 in port.

The Brooklyn Bridge was built in 1869, and two other ships are known to have struck the bridge, one in 1921 and another in 1986.

One person has been killed after an explosion at a fertility clinic in California that the FBI says was an “intentional act of terrorism”.

Authorities are investigating after a blast ripped through the American Reproductive Services building in Palm Springs shortly before 11am local time on Saturday.

Images of the scene show shattered glass and debris strewn across the street outside of the clinic. Black smoke can be seen rising from the building while firefighters battle to put out the flames.

The explosion left one person dead, the mayor said, without confirming the name of the victim.

FBI officers said they believe the clinic was targeted by a bomb and they “have a person of interest”.

Akil Davis, assistant director of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said: “Make no mistake, this is an intentional act of terrorism”.

The blast is thought to have come from a car parked outside the fertility clinic and IVF lab on North Indian Canyon Drive.

The make and model of the vehicle is unknown, and all that was left of it at the scene was an axel, according to reports.

“We've got a vehicle that appears to have exploded,” Lt William Hutchinson of the Palm Springs Police Department said. “It appears that we have a deceased person…”

The FBI released a statement saying it was responding to the incident by deploying investigators and bomb technicians.

Ron DeHarte, the Palm Springs mayor, said he believed one person had been killed in the explosion.

“We're still trying to determine a cause,” the mayor told The New York Post.

“The police and fire [services] are down there right now. First, we heard it might be a helicopter crash or a gas leak but that's been ruled out. We should know pretty quickly what it was. There was quite a bit of damage to surrounding buildings as well.”

A witness said the explosion felt like “a bomb went off”.

“It definitely felt like an explosion. It was so loud it felt like it shook my entire core,” Claudio Chavez, who owns an upholstery shop nearby, told the newspaper.

“I was inside my business waiting for a client. I was sitting in my chair and it was like suddenly like a bomb went off. Inside I just saw pieces of debris fall from the ceiling. Walked outside and saw my front window had totally shattered.

“I went to Palm Canyon Drive and went behind and off Indian Canyon you could see more people and a large amount of smoke. Half of one building seemed to have been blown off.”

The clinic's website listed fertility treatments, such as in vitro fertilization and egg freezing, among its services.

Dr Maher Abdallah, who runs the clinic, told The Associated Press that the clinic's office was damaged, but the IVF lab and stored embryos were not.

“I really have no clue what happened,” Dr. Abdallah said. “Thank God today happened to be a day that we have no patients.”

Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, has been briefed on the explosion, his press office said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:truthout.org","Pete Hegseth Has Banned 3 of My Books From the US Naval Academy","https://truthout.org/articles/pete-hegseth-has-banned-3-of-my-books-from-the-us-naval-academy/","Sun, 18 May 2025 13:33:32 GMT","

Censorship is an act of cowardice and a direct refusal of the mirror I hold up to the US's racist past and present.

Not one, not two, but three of my books have been removed and banned from the United States Naval Academy's Nimitz Library by the order of President Donald Trump's appointed defense secretary and former Fox News host Pete Hegseth. The New York Times reports that 378 others were also removed.

Naval students and sailors must feel insulted by Hegseth's lack of confidence in their intellectual ability to read challenging material that encourages self-examination and renders visible the subtle ways in which racism manifests itself. My books lay a foundation for the capacity to think critically and compassionately about those suffering under the toxicity of racism. Navy sailors need to be able to think for themselves and not be immobilized by fear of speaking out against forms of social injustice.

Some have suggested I should feel honored by the removal. There's a sense that one has done something right to garner such negative attention. That's one way of positively framing an alarming situation, but, for me, that sense of honor gave way quickly to frustration, outrage and righteous indignation. I take it that these books were banned because of their capacity to disturb those who'd rather erase certain truths from memory. After all, memory can function as a weapon and threat to those who prefer we forget the horrible history of unfettered power.

The removal of my books is also an attack on my free speech: It is a violation of my First Amendment rights against the government to intervene and engage in censorship. The move is likewise an affront to my civic responsibilities, an injury to my democratic freedom, an assault on the integrity of my written work — a form of silencing that violates my democratic agency to share knowledge, to critique structures of power, and to intervene in processes of racial injustice. Indeed, this censorship isn't just an act of cowardice but a direct refusal of the mirror I hold up to this country's racist past and present.

It says, in no uncertain terms, that my work, my academic scholarship, my philosophical calling, will not be tolerated by those who'd rather live in ignorance and wield a false narrative of the U.S. as “a shining city on a hill.” If the U.S. is on a hill, then it was partly built upon the backs of enslaved Black people and the genocide of Indigenous peoples. Those harsh and brutal realities are inextricably linked to U.S. history. To remain steadfast in one's effort to seek the truth about this history, one is confronted by a “shining city” steeped in political and moral rot. It's my constitutional right to point that out, and no government, no policy and no would-be authoritarian should be allowed to silence me.

As a philosopher, my vocation is to engage in critical thought, to exercise a robust imagination, and to seek beauty, virtue and justice. It is to refuse wanton ignorance, especially the kind that solidifies into mindless lockstep. This censorship represents the kind of shameful and dangerous ignorance found in the dystopic pages of George Orwell's 1984, where ignorance and anti-intellectualism are glorified in the name of intolerance and authoritarian rule. What we're witnessing is an attack on freedom of thought itself, which is linked to a deep fear and hatred directed at those who stand ready to engage in truth-telling practices.

Banning books (or even, eventually burning them) is an anathema to a society predicated upon the free exchange of ideas, the value of political dissent, and the critique of authoritarian political actors and policies. This is why history is so important. As philosopher Jason Stanley reminds us, “The Nazis infamously maintained strict control over the publication and dissemination of books. The Nazi propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, kept lists of books to be censored on the grounds that they were ‘alien' or ‘decadent.'” The emphasis upon “alien” and “decadent” speak powerfully to Trump's broad deployment of the phrase, “the enemy from within.” I assume I too am now such an “enemy” — what Trump calls “some sick people, radical left lunatics.”

The aim of Trump's discourse is to conjure those seen as “traitorous” and committing acts of “sedition.” “Us versus them” is par for the course when it comes to fascist indoctrination. We are in the throes of a dangerous form of 21st-century McCarthyism. In our contemporary moment, however, it's not fear of communism manifesting alarm and paranoia: What's under attack is anything that resembles critical thought that refuses to be policed by fear and hegemonic governmental machinations.

The disappearance of these books is the result of unconstitutional control, and their dissemination and availability are restricted on the grounds that they are “un-American,” and support diversity, equity and inclusion efforts which are now deemed something “alien” and “decadent,” even though those efforts were precisely designed to correct historical injustices. What was once understood as progressive is now being attacked and reframed as something divisive and oppressive.

Banning books is not just about silencing people — it is about silencing critical thinking and introspection.

As Orwell wrote in 1984: “Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.” You get the point. Trump is always right.

After all, Trump believes that he “was saved by God to make America great again.” Here we have a case where God is deployed to underwrite his actions, including banning books. Not only, then, am I the “enemy from within,” but I'm also apparently “an enemy of God.” Needless to say, I reject that implication, and I consider Trump's theology a form of white Chistian nationalism — one that is idolatrous and based on xenophobia, hatred, and the refusal and denigration of the “stranger.” In referring to undocumented immigrants, Trump has said “in some cases, they're not people.” For Trump's God, the concept that we are made in the image of God only applies to some. That is a racist conception of God.

Because I am a Black philosopher, it is not lost on me that it is my Blackness that is also deemed as “alien” and “decadent.” After all, an attack on my books is also an attack on what it means for me to be Black within a white supremacist society. Why? My published work is an expression of my knowledge, and the latter is an expression of my racially embodied existence as Black. Within this context, I am reminded of James Baldwin's line that, “This color [this Blackness] seems to operate as a most disagreeable mirror.” I take the removal of my books from the Nimitz Library as more than merely an academic affair. Their removal is an existential threat: If my books are being erased, then I, too, can be erased, as history has shown time and again.

Trump, after all, has a predilection for all things white (white nativism, white Christianity, white renters, white insurrectionists, white extremism, white pilots, white people from Norway, white South Africans). All three of my now-banned books speak critically about what it means to be white in the U.S. and what that means in terms of white privilege, white complicity and the false claim of white innocence.

This is also the conceptual terrain that I cover within the context of my classes and seminars. It's not about indoctrination but inviting students, especially white students, to begin to think beyond white racism as the expression of intentional hatred toward “racialized others.” I encourage them, through the critical examination of texts, and through robust dialogue, and deep vulnerability, to think in terms of the historical systemic processes of whiteness that they inherit and thereby knowingly or unknowingly perpetuate. By the end of my courses, white students often share with me that they now begin to see how whiteness operates in quotidian ways, though by no means any less consequential for those who are not privileged by whiteness.

If the U.S. is committed to the maintenance of the existence of whiteness as a structure of power and violence, then what I teach is “un-American.” But I am not a national security threat; I'm a philosopher-citizen who desires to make sure that human creative capacities aren't imprisoned, that the imaginative capacities of my students aren't stifled, that they're unafraid to speak with courage and identify injustices where they exist, and that they'll never be seduced by vacuous political slogans designed to suppress their ethical integrity. Speaking of the purpose of education, Baldwin writes that, “What societies really, ideally, want is a citizenry which will simply obey the rules of society.” He then warns, “If a society succeeds in this, that society is about to perish.”

Socrates, whom Martin Luther King Jr. saw as a fellow gadfly, was not the kind of citizen the Athenian society really wanted around. This is why he was condemned to drink hemlock. King was also seen as a nuisance, a threat to the social order of U.S. racism, militarism and capitalism, what he described as the three evils of U.S. society. King, as we know, was assassinated for his efforts to hold the U.S. to its word. Both Socrates and King held their fellow citizens accountable. Both practiced courageous speech in the face of danger.

I care for my students. I encourage students to never make peace with mediocrity, injustice or authoritarian rule. I teach them to question their teachers and academic institutions, and to refuse to accept what I say as “sacrosanct.” A critical educational experience doesn't involve worshipping ideas. In my classroom, I encourage open expression of moral emotions vis-à-vis social injustice and forms of political and physical violence used against those who have been marginalized and dehumanized based on identities deemed “alien” and “decadent.”

In my philosophy courses, we learn how to suffer together, how to name forms of injustice that others would like to invisibilize, and how to never be silenced in the face of social misery and systemic injustice. That, and so much more, is what I teach. In Trump's U.S., that form of pedagogy is a threat to conformism. Philosopher and educational reformer John Dewey writes, “Education is not an affair of ‘telling' and being told, but an active and constructive process.” Philosopher and educator Paulo Freire, meanwhile, reminds us that “to glorify democracy and to silence the people is a farce.” Banning books is not just about silencing people — it is about silencing critical thinking and introspection.

Socrates was defiant until the very end: “As long as I draw breath and am able, I will not cease to practice philosophy,” he said. This meant refusing the peddling of lies and deceptions, and making sure Athenians engaged in honest and relentless self-examination. The refusal to be silenced is what is necessary at this moment, especially as universities are caving in and other governmental structures are being dismantled through fiat. I too will continue to embolden students who so desperately need our courage at this moment, to resist authoritarian rule, and the captivity of their imaginations. That is what love sounds like pedagogically. As Freire writes, “Dialogue cannot exist … in the absence of a profound love for the world and for people. The naming of the world, which is an act of creation and re-creation, is not possible if it is not infused with love.”

In the spirit democratic practice, a steadfast dedication to the value of the free exchange of ideas, and the refusal to perpetuate the silencing of different perspectives, I would challenge the U.S. Naval Academy to invite me to engage in an exchange with Navy sailors regarding how race and racism continue to function in U.S. society.

There is an aphorism that states, “There are no atheists in foxholes.” Perhaps, but I assure you that race exists in foxholes, at universities, in classrooms and in all our daily encounters. Navy sailors, like my students, are racialized before they become college students. They have already internalized and been exposed to the racist stereotypes, assumptions and biases that are part of U.S. DNA.

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

Across the United States, 19 states and DC allow all residents to get driver's licenses. That right is being challenged.

For the six years Marina, 35, had no valid driver's license, she felt constant fear when behind the wheel. She would limit her travels to what was strictly necessary, forgoing professional, educational and leisure opportunities.

“I felt persecuted and had too much fear,” she told Truthout in Spanish. “It was something that impacted all of the days of my life.”

In the rural part of western Massachusetts where she lives, driving is essential. But until recently, only those with valid work permits could get their licenses.



Residents left behind included undocumented people — some of whom are asylum seekers, some of whom are international students. It also affects residents who have applied for a new status and are waiting for their applications to be approved.

Marina said the restrictions also impacted minors who were weighing leaving high school before graduation because they couldn't figure out transportation from their schools to their jobs and had to help feed their families, sometimes on their own.

That's why she supported the Massachusetts 2022 referendum to change the law, bringing food and drinks to campaigners and helping with collecting signatures.

In July 2023, access to driver's licenses was expanded to all in Massachusetts, joining neighboring New York State and now 18 other jurisdictions. Other states like Wyoming and Florida have attempted to invalidate these out-of-state licenses, with Tennessee and Florida passing similar laws. Half a dozen other Republican states have considered similar legislation this year.

Other states don't invalidate licenses but still criminalize those unable to obtain one. On May 6, Ximena Arias Cristobal, a 19-year-old Georgia resident who arrived in the U.S. the year after Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) cutoff, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after a mistaken traffic stop. Despite dropped charges, Arias-Cristobal is still in ICE custody, facing deportation.

Driving rights are also being targeted in court. On February 12, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi sued New York State for its 2019 Driver's License Access and Privacy Act (or “Green Light Law”), which makes driver's licenses available to New Yorkers regardless of their immigration status. This type of legislation has helped immigrants access jobs, participate in their children's education, make medical appointments, and more. Without these laws, immigrants are more likely to be criminalized, as they risk being stopped while driving without authorization. Giving all immigrants legal access to driver's licenses also means there are fewer untrained, untested, uninsured drivers on the road.

The history of driver's license access in the United States is convoluted. Driver's licenses are part of state jurisdiction, and between 1980 and 2015, 122 pieces of legislation were enacted in different legislatures, according to a Research & Policy Brief by the UCLA's Institute for Research on Labor and Employment.

Before the 1990s, anyone could get a driver's license from their state of residence. That changed at the turn of the millennium and ramped up after September 11, 2001. Because the al-Qaeda attackers had driver's licenses, the 9/11 Commission Report recommended that the federal government set standards for different types of identification documents, including driver's licenses. But the 9/11 commission did not specifically discuss access to driver's licenses for undocumented people.

In 2005, the federal REAL ID Act created national standards for driver's licenses. The act allowed states to give driving privileges to all residents only if there were differences between licenses issued to undocumented people and licenses issued to all others. That created a two-tiered driver's license system. Still, states continued to pass legislation restricting driving. By 2011, only New Mexico, Utah and Washington State allowed all residents to obtain licenses.

That trend shifted in the early 2010s, when officials in 17 states confirmed that people who held DACA status could apply for a driver's license. Nine states — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada and Vermont — also enacted laws expanding driving rights, along with D.C. The next decade, seven more states — Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Virginia — changed their laws too, bringing the count to 19 states and D.C.



Researchers and governments have studied the positive effects of these laws, finding that crashes went down by 5 percent; babies' birth weight improved; undocumented women became more likely to work; hit-and-runs decreased by 20 to 50 percent; insured drivers increased; consumers bought more large items like cars, household appliances and houses, benefiting the local economy; revenue was generated for states via license fees; and the number of organ donors increased. It also disincentivized undocumented people from having a fake license or from falsely claiming they live in a state that does have driver license access.

All 20 jurisdictions passed different versions of their laws, with crucial differences. Some were more flexible with the documents they required, others traded that accessibility for requiring fingerprinting by the state's Bureau of Criminal Investigation. Some states clearly differentiate between licenses given only to undocumented immigrants and licenses given to the rest, thereby “outing” undocumented people. In other states, a license for an undocumented migrant isn't different in any way. In Massachusetts, for example, a driver's license is accessible to anyone. A REAL ID is only accessible to citizens and permanent residents. But both citizens and permanent residents can still have a regular license.

Finally, some states have more protections against sharing data with federal agencies.

DMV records are “the only comprehensive internal security database,” argued a 2005 issue of Bender's Immigration Bulletin. In comparison, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) only has information about some citizens and some noncitizens.

Some states give full access to their DMV records, other states require a court order or arrest warrant and some jurisdictions explicitly prohibit their DMV from sharing information. For some jurisdictions, it's unclear. At least seven states had shared personal information from drivers with the ICE since 2020, according to a 2021 investigation by the Center for Public Integrity.

New York State's Green Light NY privacy protections are at the center of Trump's administration lawsuit, Jose Perez, general counsel at the national nonprofit LatinoJustice PRLDEF, told Truthout.

“This law has nothing to do with immigration. It is not a pathway. It doesn't provide legal status,” he said. “What they want to do is be able to come to New York, give us your records applications, and do what we tell you to do, because they want to go searching for immigrants.”

On April 2, LatinoJustice PRLDEF, together with Rural and Migrant Ministry, INC., New York Immigrant Coalition, Hispanic Federation and Make the Road New York filed an amicus curiae brief in support of New York State's motion to dismiss the complaint.

Until 2001, New York State residents applied for driver's licenses without having to provide social security numbers (SSN). But in 2004, the DMV started sending out letters to those for whom it couldn't verify the SSN.

In 2007, then-Gov. Eliot Spitzer issued an executive order restoring driver's license access. But then-U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton and current New York Gov. Kathleen Hochul opposed it. At the time, Hochul was Erie County's county clerk, an elected official who administers the DMV in New York State. The backlash led the governor to backtrack, and political momentum was lost, said Emma Kreyche, director of advocacy, outreach and education at the Worker Justice Center of New York.

A decade later, 2018 New York State election results created another window of opportunity. The Green Light campaign leadership was unique to other grassroots campaigns in the state, Kreyche said. A lot of those active in the campaign were from outside of New York City, where public transportation is unreliable.

“It was an issue propelled forward by immigrant community members in areas of the state where you hadn't traditionally seen a lot of immigrant organizing,” she said. “You had rural farm workers from Wyoming County, six hours from New York City, coming to Albany, and you had a lot of folks from the suburbs in Long Island, places that were not always seen as politically progressive.”

Perez is optimistic that the 16-page lawsuit will be dismissed in the same way that a previous challenge in 2019 was.

He called the lawsuit “baseless and frivolous” and the press conference it was announced at “a joke.” “I can't believe that these people are lawyers and they sign this and go public with it,” he said.

Perez argues that criminalizing immigrants is part of a political project, rather than an adherence to existing laws. Entering without inspection or overstaying a visa is a civil matter, not a criminal one, he said.

“The narrative that is coming out of Washington and people like Governor DeSantis is ‘You're an immigrant, you're illegal. You're undocumented, you're a criminal. And that's the net public narrative, because they're doing partisan political pandering to their supporters and base.”

But advocates like Kreyche believe that even a frivolous lawsuit creates a lot of fear and uncertainty.

Western Massachusetts resident Marina said she has been more cautious under the new administration. She might not travel again to other states like she did between 2023 and now. Her activism is less outspoken. But she's still there.

And she's a little safer than she used to be, thanks to her driver's license.

A resident says the army is firing deadly missiles into crowded neighborhoods without warning or evacuation notice.

Massive explosions shook the Gaza Strip in the first hours of Saturday morning as Israeli warplanes launched intensive airstrikes on north, south, and central Gaza, in what the Israeli army called “preparations to expand operations” in the Strip.

Israeli airstrikes hit Khan Younis, Deir al-Balah, several parts of Gaza City, and Jabalia. A resident of the Shati' refugee camp in Gaza City told Mondoweiss that “the occupation army had issued orders to evacuate Shati' camp, but they called off the orders — and then they called for an evacuation again, keeping residents in constant anxiety.”

“Then, yesterday night, they began bombing all over Gaza, including Shati' camp,” the Shati' resident added. “It lasted all night.”

The airstrikes were accompanied by incursions of remote-controlled Israeli explosive vehicles in north Gaza, with local journalists reporting that the vehicle exploded in the Tal al-Zaatar neighborhood east of Jabalia between inhabited buildings. The pieces of shrapnel reached the Indonesian Hospital in the neighboring town of Beit Lahia, causing damage to the building, local journalists reported. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip have already killed 250 Palestinians in the past two days alone.

The renewed wave of bombings comes a few days after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged last week to “enter Gaza with full force” in implementation of a new expanded ground offensive approved by the Israeli war cabinet nearly a month ago, dubbed “Gideon's Chariots.” 

The Israeli assault would see the army “conquer” Gaza and permanently occupy it, according to Israeli officials. Shortly before the invasion commenced on Saturday, the Israeli army dropped leaflets over Gaza, depicting a Biblical scene of the sea parting and engulfing destroyed buildings in the Strip, with a Star of David insignia in the corner below the words “righteous conquest.”

According to Mahmoud Basal, the Civil Defense spokesperson in Gaza, the Israeli assault has resulted in the deaths of over 100 people in less than 12 hours. “It is a bloody and difficult day for the northern Gaza Strip,” he stated on Telegram. According to the Ministry of Health's daily report, “153 martyrs and 459 injuries have arrived at hospitals in the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours.” The Ministry clarified that the death toll had risen to 53,272 since the beginning of the war.

Hundreds of thousands of displaced families from eastern Gaza City, having evacuated their homes over a month ago due to the Israeli invasion of the Shuja'iyya neighborhood, have crammed into the city's western areas. They have established new displacement centers in Gaza City's parks, stadiums, and universities, including the Yarmouk Stadium and the Islamic University.

During the past week, the Israeli army has threatened to evacuate these displacement centers as well, highlighting areas such as the Islamic University and other schools-turned-shelters as slated for evacuation. 

On May 16, large numbers of people were displaced from areas in north Gaza, where the escalating ground invasion has intensified, prompting some residents to leave their homes for Gaza City.

Despite the Israeli army's incursion into several areas in the central Gaza Strip and east of Khan Younis in the al-Qarara area, residents describe the situation in the north as the most dire.

Sulaiman Abu Sultan, 41, originally from Beit Lahia, says that the intensity of the bombardment in north Gaza forced him to leave his home. He tells Mondoweiss that the Israeli army is firing deadly missiles into crowded neighborhoods without warning or evacuation notice. “Deadly missiles are the warning,” Abu Sultan clarifies.

“The time for warnings through messages and phone calls is over. Now, they are killing hundreds to warn those who remain,” he adds. “They are sending deadly missiles that tear our bodies apart.”

Abu Sultan decided to take his family of five to Gaza City to stay with relatives in the Tal al-Hawa area, but he says that the situation there was not any better. 

“We couldn't bear it in Beit Lahia. The sounds were terrifying, and the bombing was random. The rubble was flying over our heads while we were in our destroyed homes,” Abu Sultan explains. “We thought Gaza City would be less terrifying, but we found the same situation: terrifying sounds and planes flying over us.” 

“Is all this horror for us?” Abu Sultan muses. “It's hard to believe that all this firepower in the sky is reserved for civilian families whose only concern is to save their children from bombardment and feed them so they don't die of hunger.”

The all-out Israeli assault was preceded by over a week of intensified bombardment of the Strip following Hamas's release of Israeli-American captive soldier Edan Alexander as a “goodwill gesture” to Donald Trump, who was due to arrive in the Middle East on his planned tour of Arab Gulf countries. The Israeli army heavily bombarded the European Hospital and Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis throughout the week, allegedly targeting top Hamas leaders in a “command-and-control” complex underneath the European Hospital, even though Haaretz reported that Israel provided no evidence to back up its claims.

According to a Drop Site News interview with Hamas official Basem Naim, Alexander's release was part of a deal Hamas struck with U.S. envoy to the region, Steve Witkoff, who was supposed to compel Israel to lift the blockade on Gaza and let humanitarian aid into the Strip. Naim also said that Witkoff “personally committed” to ending the blockade and that Trump was supposed to publicly call for a ceasefire. 

But according to the senior Hamas leader, the U.S. “threw the deal in the trash.”

Naim told Drop Site that there was “zero” progress in talks for a ceasefire, while Witkoff reportedly told Arab mediators that the U.S. would not be pressuring Israel to end the war on Gaza.

Meanwhile, Netanyahu appears as unmovable as ever, speaking to Israeli daily Maariv last week about how the Israeli army is “destroying more and more houses [in Gaza], and they [the Palestinians] have nowhere to return to,” adding that “the logical result will be the desire of Gaza residents to leave.” Netanyahu also remarked that half of Gazans already want to leave, and that “the difficulty is in finding countries that would accept to receive them.”

As part of Israel's plan to occupy Gaza indefinitely, Israel intends to handle the distribution of aid to the civilian population in a dystopian new plan that would see the vetting of families eligible for aid with the participation of U.S. military contractors. The plan would reportedly have Gazans corralled in a concentration camp in what remains of Rafah, which has been flattened and cleared by the Israeli army, and Israel would later gradually expel Gaza's population from the Strip under the rubric of so-called “voluntary migration.” In essence, this would entail the flattening and extermination of the rest of Gaza and the ethnic cleansing of its population. 

In line with this Israeli plan, NBC reported on Friday that the Trump administration was working on a plan to permanently relocate 1 million Palestinians to Libya in exchange for lifting sanctions imposed on the Arab country over a decade ago. NBC spoke to five unnamed sources “with knowledge of the effort.”

According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, 1 million children in Gaza are at risk of starvation, including 70,000 facing “serious degrees of malnutrition” due to the blockade. According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the UN-affiliated famine monitoring body, 96 percent of Gazans face “high levels of acute food insecurity,” with 22 percent facing “catastrophic levels.” 

Moreover, the Health Ministry announced that the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces in Gaza has exceeded 52,000 dead, in addition to at least 10,000 people missing under the rubble.

Those who survived so far now brace for the next episode of the U.S.-backed Israeli genocidal assault.

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theepochtimes.com","RFK Jr. Defends His Comments on Vaccines","https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/rfk-jr-defends-his-comments-on-vaccines-im-going-to-tell-the-truth-5857914","Sun, 18 May 2025 13:09:47 GMT","

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defended his recent statements about vaccines during a congressional hearing on May 14.

“I'm going to tell the truth about everything we know and we don't know about vaccines,” Kennedy told Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) while testifying before the Senate Health Committee. “I am not going to just tell people that everything is safe and effective if I know there are issues. I need to respect people's intelligence.”

Several lawmakers expressed concern about Kennedy's recent comments, which include saying that the protection conferred by the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine wanes over time.

“The result is to undermine faith in the vaccine,” Murphy said.

“It's kind of like saying, ‘Listen, I think you should swim in that lake, but you know, the lake is probably toxic, and there's probably a ton of snakes and alligators in that lake, but I think you should swim in it.' Nobody is going to swim that lake if that's what you say. I want you to acknowledge that when you say you support the measles vaccine, and then you go out and repeatedly undermine the vaccine, with information that is contested by public health experts, that is not supporting the vaccine.”

Kennedy responded, “If I advise you to swim in a lake that I knew there to be alligators in, wouldn't you want me to tell you there were alligators in it?

“The reason people have lost faith in this program is that they've been lied to by public officials for year after year after year.”

Several outbreaks of measles have appeared in the United States in 2025, including an outbreak in Texas that has spread to hundreds of people. Texas officials say most patients are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status.

“We're always going to have measles, as the vaccine wanes very quickly,” Kennedy said recently at a town hall.

Kennedy testified before the Senate panel and the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee. It was the first time he appeared before Congress since being confirmed in February.

Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) asked Kennedy, who has said his children received the typical vaccines in their childhood, if he had a child today, would he get that child vaccinated with the MMR shot?

“Probably,” Kennedy said. “I would say my opinions about vaccines are irrelevant.

“I don't think people should be taking medical advice from me. I think if I answer that question directly, that it will seem that I'm giving advice to other people, and I don't want to be doing that,” Kennedy said, adding that health officials were going to try to outline the pros and cons, or the risks and benefits, of each vaccine.

Pocan tried to get Kennedy to answer the same question for the chickenpox and polio vaccines. The health secretary demurred.

Republicans largely steered clear of vaccines during the hearings. A number of them praised developments under Kennedy, including the banning of some artificial dyes and the focus on cutting costs at the health agency.

“You've done more to shine the light on things that average Americans can do to make themselves healthier than almost any secretary that I can recall,” Sen. Jon Husted (R-Ohio) said, “so thank you for that service.”","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

NUUK, Greenland—Taatsi Olsen knows what it takes to start searching for minerals in Greenland.

In a warehouse on the outskirts of the capital, Nuuk, he walked through the nuts and bolts of mining exploration in the cold, sparsely populated country: walls of tools and harnesses and small trailers flown to remote sites by helicopter, essential in a place where no roads go from town to town.

Olsen pointed out that Greenland's unique settlement pattern—isolated fishing villages scattered across hundreds of miles of rocky islands and fjords—can have advantages for miners.

“If you are in a remote area, there's a good chance that there's a small village nearby,” he told The Epoch Times.

Olsen is chief operating officer of X-Ploration Services Greenland. The company, which supports mineral exploration on the island, could prosper if the Danish territory's rare earth deposits prove to be a boon.

Yet he knows the odds against individual success. Olsen estimates that just one in a thousand exploratory projects in Greenland yields a mine.

“It's just that difficult to find something where the economics make sense,” he said.

Critical minerals are used in many advanced technologies, including cellphones and defense systems. The industry is currently dominated by China.

For now, just two mines are operating in Greenland, and neither mines rare earths.

Yet mining isn't new to Greenland. It's part of a long history that entangles the world's largest island with Denmark and the United States.

Advocates of rare earth mining hope it will help the case for Greenland's independence. Many seek additional revenue streams in a territory dominated by seafood exports, government employment, and a yearly block grant from Denmark.

One site dating back to the 1850s—the cryolite mine in Ivittuut—proved vital in the 20th century.

Cryolite was necessary in the production of aluminum, and Ivittuut was the only commercial source.

During World War II, Ivittuut proved so crucial to the Allied war effort that the United States set up a naval base nearby to protect it. To this day, the United States maintains a military base in far northern Pituffik.

The promise of rare earths has also drawn attention to the Tanbreez project, a deposit near the town of Narsaq in Southern Greenland.

Horn told The Epoch Times that Tanbreez has sparked interest from a private-sector delegation he led. The group included executives from the mining firms Critical Metals Corp, American Renewable Metals, Refracture, and Cogency Power.

Horn has also partnered with Hardenberg on a seaweed treatment project, which would resemble a state-owned operation developed by Royal Greenland.

Tour guide Pakkutannguaq Larsen said that although she is in favor of Greenland independence, she is not eager for more extractive industry.

“We want to keep the nature as it is,” she told The Epoch Times.

Olsen, whose firm has not been involved in Tanbreez, said Trump's attention toward his home country has fueled both excitement and uncertainty.

U.S. companies are not yet lining up to work with X-Ploration Services, which specializes in logistics, planning, and related areas.

“Most of our customers are Canadians,” Olsen added.

Nikoline Ziemer, a biologist involved in Royal Greenland's seaweed project, said she hopes the government will not withdraw licenses as it has in the past.

“We have to have a stable policy around that because it injures the credibility of Greenland as a possibility for mining,” she said.

In 2021, the country stripped a Chinese firm of an iron ore mining license. That same year, the territory ceased offering new oil exploration licenses.

Olsen said he thinks the government, now under different leadership, could reverse course on the latter decision.

Almost every Greenlander who spoke to The Epoch Times saw a bid for independence from Denmark on the horizon—although the timeline is unclear after March's election. Independence could also help Greenlanders forge closer ties with the United States if they so choose.

Hardenberg said rare earths are one means of moving the territory toward greater autonomy.

Ziemer agreed. Speaking for herself and not Royal Greenland, she said the territory's reliance on fisheries is “not a viable economical [model].”

Hardenberg, who once served in the government, said that he thinks Greenland would be more dynamic if it “freed up more people from the public sector to more productive jobs.”

Not all mining-related activity will translate into work for locals.

Olsen said Greenland's small population—fewer than 60,000 people—means that mining exploration must draw on some foreign talent.

“There's not that many geologists and experts [here],” he said.

He said more jobs for blue-collar Greenlanders will be available if mining advances from exploration to exploitation.

While some streets were lined with decaying housing blocks, others glittered with new construction.

High above the city, an international airport will soon host flights from Scandinavian Airlines and United Airlines, boosting hopes of tourism.

At a government-funded “Fight Club,” where young boxers sparred before a cheering crowd, Ethan Ingholt told The Epoch Times he came to Nuuk from Denmark.

In Denmark, he worked as an arborist. Now, in a land with no trees, he's a construction manager.

“If you're willing to work, there's always jobs,” he said.

Inunnguaq Korneliussen, a student at the event, told The Epoch Times that the economy “is OK right now” but “getting bad.” He cited rising grocery prices.

A few streets away, Jens Smith was selling seafood at a market stall. One popular item was lumpfish roe, a delicacy similar to sturgeon caviar.

As Smith spoke, a man walked in and quickly purchased two bags of roe.

Smith told The Epoch Times that many customers resell his goods in Denmark, where Greenlandic seafood can fetch high prices.

He said the winter has been tough for fishing.

“The water is too cold right now,” he said.

Larsen, an opponent of mining, said she hopes to open her own tour company. She said tourism could help Greenland go its own way, like Iceland did.

Hardenberg said the recent election revealed one commonality across Greenland: “Everybody is agreeing that we need to create our own future. We need to be steering and controlling our own destiny.”","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

Live Updates


            • Two people have died and more than a dozen others were injured, after a Mexican Navy training ship struck the bottom of the Brooklyn Bridge, according to New York City Mayor Eric Adams.
    


            •  The ship, called Cuauhtémoc, was carrying 277 people when it “lost power” and struck the bridge, Adams said. It was on a global goodwill tour and en route to Iceland at the time of the incident Saturday night, officials said.
    


            • The ship was moving in the “wrong direction,” a senior city official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN, pointing in part to the current of the East River.
    


            • City officials earlier said “mechanical issues” may have caused the ship to strike the bridge, ﻿though the cause of the collision remains under investigation.
    


            While investigators look into the crash of a Mexican Navy training ship into the Brooklyn Bridge, local authorities are focused on moving the ship so it can be repaired.
    


            “The (National Transportation Safety Board), the Coast Guard, the government of Mexico are now working on finding a way forward with the investigation, but that's still in the early stages of that,” Zach Iscol, the New York City Emergency Management commissioner, told CNN.
    


                    “And so right now over the next couple of days, our main focus is moving the ship safely to another location where it can begin repairs and then get it back on its way.”
                





            The ship is currently docked at Pier 36, where it was towed overnight after striking the bridge. Many members of the crew spent Saturday night on the ship, while the injured were cared for at hospitals.
    


            While there is some damage to the underside of the bridge, it is not structural and transportation inspectors have determined the bridge is safe, Iscol said.
    


            The Mexican Navy secretary pledged his support to the families of those killed and injured when one of its training ships crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge.
    


                    “I deeply regret what happened during the maneuver of the Training Ship Cuauhtémoc,” Secretary Raymundo Pedro Morales Ángeles said on X Sunday. “My commitment to the well-being of the naval personnel and their families is absolute.”
                





            Two crew members died after falling from the ship's masts, authorities said.
    


            “From the first moment, the protocols for medical care, institutional support, and direct support for the wounded and their loved ones were activated,” he said, adding the naval command is in contact with each affected family.
    


            Morales Ángeles also ensured that investigations into the incident will be “promptly followed up with total transparency and responsibility.”
    


            He thanked Mexican and US authorities for their support.
    


                    “I value and appreciate the displays of solidarity expressed by the governments and navies of friendly nations,” he added.
                





            Crew members were seen leaving the Cuauhtémoc on Sunday morning after staying onboard overnight.
    


            The ship was docked at Pier 36 after it hit the Brooklyn bridge on Saturday evening, leaving at least two people dead and injuring more than a dozen others.
    


                    “A lot of the crew members remained on the ship last night,” Zach Iscol, commissioner for the New York City office of emergency management, told CNN. “A number of them have been in the hospital and remain in the hospitals, and then we have the two who lost their lives.”
                





            After the Cuauhtémoc hit the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday evening, FDNY officials called for “all hands” to help with the incident.
    


                    “It looks like it hit the Brooklyn Bridge, and it drifted under the Manhattan Bridge,” one FDNY official can be heard saying in dispatch audio.
                





            Officials with the FDNY Brooklyn can be heard discussing the incident in dispatch audio from Broadcastify.
    


                    “It looks like a sailboat was going under the Brooklyn Bridge, hit something over there with the mast broken off and is drifting under the Manhattan Bridge with people on the boat,” one official said.
                





            Units from FDNY Manhattan received an “all hands” call to assist with the injured.
    


                    “Your box is gonna go to an all-hands; they have multiple serious patients coming to your location and we're gonna go to all hands,” one official said.
                





Listen to a portion of the audio here:



            Authorities are looking into exactly how a Mexican Navy training ship on a goodwill tour struck the Brooklyn Bridge Saturday night, killing two crew members who fell from the ship's masts and leaving about 20 others injured.
    


            The National Transportation Safety Board is sending a go-team to the site of the crash to investigate, the agency said Sunday, with their arrival expected late afternoon. The ship's voyage data recorder may reveal critical information about the crash.
    


            The ship, the Cuauhtémoc, was carrying 277 people en route to Iceland when it lost power and struck the bridge, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said.
    


            The ship was moving in the wrong direction when it hit the bridge, a senior city official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. Cuauhtémoc's captain said he lost steering of the vessel after the rudder stopped working, according to the senior official.
    


            Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Mexican authorities are supporting the injured and monitoring the situation.
    


            The Mexican Navy training ship that struck the Brooklyn Bridge Saturday was moving in the “wrong direction,” a senior city official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN.
    


            The Cuauhtémoc had been docked at Pier 17 in Manhattan, just down the river below the Brooklyn Bridge. As it made its way out of the harbor, it was supposed to make a stop at a Bay Ridge fueling dock before heading out to sea on its way to Iceland, the official said.
    


            “It was the current that took it under the bridge,” the person said. “It wasn't supposed to be headed in that direction.”
    


            Officials from different city agencies are meeting Sunday morning to determine the next steps in the response and the investigation.
    


            According to the senior official, Cuauhtémoc's captain has told investigators he lost steering of the vessel after the rudder stooped working.
    


            “They had some sort of mechanical issue, they lost power so without being able to use the rudder, they could not steer,” the official said, cautioning all information is preliminary and subject to change.
    


            The city is also investigating the role of a tug boat that can be seen in video appearing to lead the Cuauhtémoc through the river.
    


            The senior official said city divers are expected to go into the water today to inspect the Cuauhtémoc's rudder to determine if the ship can be moved.
    


            The Cuauhtémoc's crew spent the night on the ship, the senior official said. Now, city officials are working to get them off the ship and home to Mexico, the person said.
    


            The city's Office of the Medical Examiner is also working to repatriate the bodies of the two victims, the senior official said.
    


            The National Transportation Safety Board is sending a “go-team” team to New York, where a Mexican Navy training ship struck the Brooklyn Bridge, according to a post Sunday by the agency's X account.
    


            The team is expected to arrive late Sunday afternoon.
    


            The Cuauhtémoc is docked now at Pier 36, where the Mexican Navy training ship was towed overnight after striking the Brooklyn Bridge.
    


            The ship's three masts are visibly damaged, with the splintered tip of one mast hanging at an angle, its sail twisted around it.
    


            Early Sunday morning, a group of seven crew members dressed in sailors' uniforms boarded the ship. There has otherwise been minimal visible activity onboard so far.
    


            Onlookers have been walking the pier throughout the morning, trying to get a glimpse of the damaged ship, but the area is blocked off to the public, and a police patrol boat has been watching over the ship.
    


            Cuauhtémoc's collision with the Brooklyn Bridge comes just 16 months after a massive cargo ship plowed into Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge on March 26, 2024.
    


            The incident caused the 1.6-mile structure to crumble, plunging cars and people into the frigid water below. The Singaporean-flagged container vessel, named Dali, lost power, veered off course, and smashed into the bridge, killing six construction workers.
    


            The Cuauhtémoc is not the first ship to hit the Brooklyn Bridge.
    


            In 1921, the schooner Edward J. Lawrence hit the bridge while being towed beneath it. In 1935, a German freighter, Tirpitz, struck a steel girder on the bridge, bending three of the ship's four masts. In 1986, a freighter from South Korea grazed the bottom of the bridge, The New York Times reported.
    


            The voyage data recorder from the Mexican Navy training ship that crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge Saturday will provide crucial information about what went wrong, one transportation expert told CNN.
    


            The data recorder will likely provide investigators with information about both the ship's mechanics, including any “control input” and when power may have been lost, said Mary Schiavo, CNN transportation analyst and former US Department of Transportation inspector general. It may also provide information about the river itself, such as the water's depth and its currents.
    


            Investigators may already have that information and be in the process of reviewing it, Schiavo said. They will also need to examine whether communication was lost at any point, she added.
    


            Mexico will be involved in the National Transportation Safety Board investigation into the incident, Schiavo said, noting the US agency is used to performing large-scale, international investigations.
    


            The Cuauhtémoc departed Acapulco on the Pacific coast of Mexico on the morning of April 4, according to a news release from the Mexican Secretariat of the Navy.
    


            The mission was “exalting the seafaring spirit, strengthening naval education, and carrying the Mexican people's message of peace and goodwill to the seas and ports of the world,” according to the release.
    


            Plans for the voyage included calling on 22 ports in 15 countries in 254 days. The crew was scheduled to spend 170 days sailing and 84 days in port, according to the Mexican Navy.
    


            Stops included various Caribbean destinations such as Kingston, Jamaica, and Havana, Cuba, as well as Mexican ports, New York, and cities in the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Norway, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Iceland, the news release said.
    


            The trip boasted the highest number of women in the crew, with 64 women and 213 men among the 277 members.
    


            The navy said Cuauhtémoc has traveled the oceans and seas of the world for 42 years, with more than 43 generations of “Captains, Officers, Cadets, and Sailor personnel” on board.
    


            The Mexican Navy ship had been docked at the South Street Seaport Museum for five days of public viewing prior to it hitting the Brooklyn Bridge, according to the museum's website.



            A spokesperson for the New York City-area Sail4th 250 events told CNN that the ship “welcomed dignitaries and media” as part of its New York stop on its global tour.
    


            The sailing ship was expected to join the parade of international tall ships to celebrate America's 250 anniversary on July 4, 2026, the spokesperson said, in what the event is calling “the largest-ever flotilla of tall ships from around the world.”
    


            The Cuauhtémoc ship is a steel-hulled three-masted barque that's around 300 feet long and 160 feet tall, according to a 2024 press release from one of its training cruises.
    


            Government documents show the Brooklyn Bridge has a navigational clearance of 127 feet.
    


            Video shot by bystanders on Saturday showed the Cuauhtémoc's masts hitting the underside of the bridge and breaking as the vessel passed underneath, with pieces falling down toward the deck.
    


            Two people have died and two remain in critical condition, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said. Everyone is believed to be accounted for, officials said.
    


            The Cuauhtémoc sailing ship was used for training by the Heroic Naval Military School, an elite military academy in Mexico, according to last year's press release.
    


            Mexico has referred to the ship as a diplomatic symbol of its country abroad.
    


            The ship, as of last year, had visited 212 ports in 64 countries with 756,085 nautical miles sailed, the latter equivalent to making 35 trips around the world, the release said.
    


            Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum sent her condolences to families of the two crew members killed when a Mexican Navy sailing ship struck the Brooklyn Bridge Saturday.
    


            “We are deeply saddened by the loss of two crew members of the Cuauhtémoc Training Ship, who lost their lives in the unfortunate accident in New York Harbor. Our sympathy and support go out to their families,” Sheinbaum said in a post on X early Sunday.
    


            Sheinbaum said the Mexican Navy is supporting those injured in the incident, and that the Mexican ambassador to the United States and Mexican Consulate General were supporting the navy.
    


            “We are monitoring the situation, and the Secretary of the Navy will continue to provide updates,” she added.
    


            Mexico's US ambassador was at the scene alongside New York officials late Saturday after the Cuauhtémoc struck the Brooklyn Bridge. The ship had been in New York as part of a global goodwill tour and was departing for Iceland at the time of the incident.
    


            The Mexican Navy training ship that struck the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday was moved to a nearby pier to allow passengers to disembark, according to a law enforcement official.
    


            About 250 people were still on the Cuauhtémoc after its masts struck the underside of the bridge, the official said.
    


            The ship has since been moved to New York's Pier 36.
    


Remember: The tall ship was departing from Pier 17 and heading out to open sea en route to Iceland when it struck the underside of the bridge, officials earlier said.
    


            Video of the Mexican Navy training ship shortly after it struck the Brooklyn Bridge shows people hanging from at least one of its masts.
    


            At least one person is seen clinging from a rope on the top-most rung of one mast, while several others on the top two rungs can be seen crawling to the center part of the mast. A few individuals can be seen climbing a ladder to reach those stuck.
    


            On tall ships like the Cuauhtémoc, it is a ceremonial tradition for sailors to climb the masts and rigging when departing or arriving into harbor.
    


            At least two people were killed in the incident, according to New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The two individuals fell from one of the ship's masts, a law enforcement official told CNN. They were pronounced dead after being taken to a nearby hospital, the official said.
    


            Officials said that nobody has been declared missing.
    


            Flavio Moreira was walking with his family along the Brooklyn promenade when the Mexican sailing ship struck the Brooklyn Bridge.
    


            Moreira said the area was busy with people enjoying the warm Saturday evening. At first, he enjoyed seeing the Cuauhtémoc tall sailing ship in the East River, he said.
    


            “But it just kept coming closer and closer to us, and at some point, I was like, I don't think that's right,” Moreira told CNN's Ben Hunte.
    


            Moreira said there was “a bit of commotion” when the ship's masts hit the bridge but “also a lot of people started recording like me because it was just such a surreal experience.”
    


            From the shore, Moreira said he could see people on the boat struggling after the collision.
    


            “We could see some people being kind of dragged. There was some, I believe it was some of the staff, they were on the top of the boat. And they were swinging around, back and forth as soon as the ship hit the bridge,” he said.
    


            “The ship was just so close to us, so we could see all those people really struggling to just like holding onto something to… don't fall from the boat,” he added.
    


Correction: A previous version of this post misspelled Ben Hunte's last name.



            More than 100 fire and emergency medical service (EMS) personnel responded to the scene where a Mexican Navy sailing ship struck the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday night, according to the New York City Fire Department.
    


            The NYFD said in an email to CNN it received the call that a ship had struck the bridge around 8:39 p.m. on Saturday.
    


            “Once the marine units arrived on scene, we knew, initially, we knew immediately that we had a serious incident with a boat striking the bridge,” Chief of Training Michael Meyers said in a FDNY post on X.
    


            Dual command posts were set up on the Brooklyn and Manhattan sides of the river and marine units were assisting in the emergency response, Meyers said.
    


            In its email to CNN, the department said personnel from 25 units was deployed, including 106 fire and EMS workers.
    


            “The police, fire and EMS did a tremendous job of working together to get everyone off of that ship safe,” said Meyers.
    


            The cause of the collision remains under investigation.
    


            At least two people were killed and about 20 injured when a Mexican Navy training ship carrying 277 passengers struck the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York Saturday night, officials said.
    


            Dramatic video shows the Cuauhtémoc's masts hitting the underside of the bridge and breaking as the vessel passes underneath, with pieces falling down toward the deck.
    


            Here's what we know:
    


What happened: The incident occurred around 8:20 p.m. local time as the captain was departing from New York's Pier 17. The ship's masts struck the bridge, breaking on impact and sending debris falling onto the vessel's deck. New York City Mayor Eric Adams said the ship “lost power” and struck the bridge. City officials earlier said “mechanical issues” may have caused the incident, but cautioned all information so far is preliminary. The National Transportation Safety Board is conducting an investigation.
    


Casualties: Mayor Adams said at least two people were killed in the incident. The two individuals who died fell from one of the ship's masts, a law enforcement official told CNN. Nineteen people were injured, with two seriously, Adams said. The Mexican Navy said a total of 22 people were injured, 19 of whom were taken to hospitals.
    


The bridge: There was no visible damage to the Brooklyn Bridge, which was left structurally intact by the incident. Traffic was temporarily closed in both directions for about 40 minutes, but was later reopened. Inspections remain ongoing.
    


The ship: The Cuauhtémoc is a training sailing ship of the Mexican Navy and a diplomatic symbol of Mexico abroad. Known as the “Ambassador and Knight of the Seas,” the ship was in New York as part of a global goodwill tour and was en route to Iceland at the time of the incident. The Cuauhtémoc was built in Spain in 1981 and acquired by the Mexican Navy to train cadets and officers. It regularly takes part in major regattas around the world. It had been docked at the South Street Seaport in New York since Tuesday.
    


            At least two people were killed when the Mexican Navy sailing ship Cuauhtémoc struck the Brooklyn Bridge Saturday night, according to New York City Mayor Eric Adams.
    


            “At this time, of the 277 on board, 19 sustained injuries, 2 of which remain in critical condition, and 2 more have sadly passed away from their injuries,” Adams wrote on X.
    


            The two individuals who died fell from one of the ship's masts, a law enforcement official told CNN. They were pronounced dead after being taken to a nearby hospital, the official said.
    


             The ship has since been moved to New York's Pier 36, the official added.
    


            City officials earlier said “mechanical issues” may have caused the ship to strike the bridge, but cautioned all information so far is preliminary.
    


            The cause of the collision remains under investigation.
    


            Videos posted on social media show the moment the mast of a Mexican Navy training ship struck the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York Saturday evening.
    


            The ship, bedecked with white lights and flying a large Mexican flag, can be seen sailing closer to the edge of Brooklyn Bridge Park when its mast strikes the bottom of the bridge, snapping at parts and falling onto the deck below.
    


            Crewmembers of the ship, Cuauhtémoc, can be seen clinging on to the mast after the incident. Bystanders on the dock can be heard screaming and seen in the videos running away from the scene.
    


            There appears to be no damage to the bridge.
    


            The Mexican Navy training ship that struck the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge Saturday evening likely suffered a “mechanical issue” that forced the captain to lose power, police said in a news conference.
    


            “The captain that was maneuvering the ship lost, I guess, power of the ship,” Chief Wilson Aramboles of the NYPD Special Operations Bureau told reporters Saturday evening.
    


            Aramboles added that there were “some mechanical issues” that “probably” caused the ship, Cuauhtémoc, to strike the bridge.
    


            Officials warned that the information provided is preliminary and subject to change. The National Transportation Safety Board is conducting an investigation into what happened.
    


            The Cuauhtémoc was leaving New York and heading out to sea en route to Iceland when it struck the underside of the bridge.
    


            Aramboles said a number of sailors were on top of the ship's masts and were injured in the incident.
    


            New York City's famous Brooklyn Bridge was closed for about 40 minutes following the ship accident, according to a post on X from NYC's official emergency notification system.
    


            “The bridge is open at this time after our preliminary inspection,” New York City Mayor Eric Adams said during a news conference Saturday evening.
    


            All lanes had previously been closed, the agency said on X at 10:06 p.m. ET.
    


            By 10:48 p.m. ET, the bridge has reopened, the agency said on X while letting people know to expect delays.
    


            New York City Mayor Eric Adams said 19 people were injured after a Mexican Navy training ship carrying 277 passengers struck the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge.
    


            Four people have “serious” injuries, Adams said, adding “all passengers were safely removed.”
    


            The Mexican Navy said a total of 22 people were injured, 19 of whom were taken to hospitals.
    


            Adams said that city officials are working closely with Mexican officials on response efforts.
    


            A Mexican Navy training ship struck the bottom of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York Saturday night, according to police and the Mexican Navy.
    


            The sailboat hit the bridge around 8:26 p.m. and multiple people are being “aided,” a New York Police Department spokesperson told CNN.
    


            A total of 19 people were injured, including four people with “serious” injuries, New York City Mayor Eric Adams told reporters from the scene.
    


            “During the departure maneuver of the Cuauhtémoc Sailboat in New York, an incident occurred with the Brooklyn Bridge that caused damage to the Training Ship, temporarily preventing the continuation of the training cruise,” the Mexican Navy said in a post in Spanish on X.
    


            “The status of the personnel and material is under review by naval and local authorities, who are providing support,” the post added.
    


            New York emergency officials said they're responding to an incident at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge. “The situation is developing and details are not confirmed at this time,” NYC Emergency Management said on X.

            Getting into college can be hard.
    


            But figuring out how to finance college so that neither parent nor child are left financially hard up? It's a new, highly annoying level of hard — at least if you hope to get an adequate financial aid package to supplement your and your child's college savings.
    


            For any parent with a child in the 8th, 9th or 10th grade, now is the time to strategize how to maximize your access to both merit-based and need-based financial aid.
    


            The cost of one year in college for one child — never mind two or more — is always eye-popping.
    


            For this academic year (2024-2025) the average annual sticker price for a private, four-year college including tuition, housing, food, supplies, transportation and the always mysterious “other” is $62,990, according to the College Board.
    


            For a four-year program at a public state university, the average came to $29,910 for in-state students and $49,080 for out-of-staters.
    


            The good news: The “net” price of a year of college can be much less, once you account for federal and school aid (both need-based and merit-based), coupled with scholarships and federally subsidized loans.
    


            But just how much less depends, among other things, on your family income, how well you've strategized withdrawing your savings for college, and — this is key, college experts say — whether your child's academic performance puts them in a school's top 25% of incoming freshmen.
    


            Another consideration may soon be what Congress will do. House Republicans are considering a proposal that would, among other things, end the subsidized loan program for undergraduates and change the rules for getting Pell grants.
    


            Whether the proposal makes it into law is anyone's guess. But if it does, it will change the calculus for how families fund a college education.
    


            That, coupled with confusion over the Trump administration's expressed desire to dismantle the Department of Education, has in some ways made Beth Walker's job a little easier.
    


            As the author of “Buying College Better” who counsels families on how to financially plan for college years before a child applies anywhere, Walker said, “It's never been as easy for me to advocate for taking back control of this purchase — and thinking about it with a consumer mindset.”
    


            There are several things you and your kids can do ahead of time to put you in the best position to pay for college.
    


Get good grades and test scores: The better your children do scholastically, the more likely it is they will qualify for merit-based aid.
    


            A big key to unlocking merit aid is to get strong standardized test scores (e.g., on the SAT or ACT), said Mike McKinnon, executive director of the National Institute of Certified College Planners.
    


            He strongly advises students to study and take practice tests starting as early as middle school to improve their score before they take the official test in 11th or 12th grade.
    


Earn college credits ahead of time: McKinnon also recommends that students try to earn college credits or advance placement in a subject while still in high school. Doing so may let them skip certain required college courses or even graduate early, thereby curbing the total cost for their degree.
    


            Among the ways to get that leg up is to take advance placement courses during the school year, college courses during the summer or college-level examination program (CLEP) tests.
    


            Check the colleges your child may be interested in attending to see what credits those schools will recognize.
    


            At the very least, convey to your kids the value of getting their degree sooner rather than later. Roughly 22% of those earning bachelor's degrees take longer than that to graduate, according to the Education Data Initiative.
    


Be clear-eyed about your budget: When your child is in 8th or 9th grade, start projecting the financial resources you will have available to pay for college.
    


            Todd Fothergill, founder and CEO of Strategies for College, created a free college budgeting calculator called CostHero that lets you input a detailed list of income, savings, expenses and likely federal loans and tax credits to consider when assessing what your family can reasonably afford to pay. It then gives you two budgets based on your inputs — one in which the parents incur no debt and one in which they do. The results will help you frame your thinking about where you might need to save more or spend less.
    


            “You can take the time when your student enters high school and get serious about planning for college. Or you can have the colleges and the government give you the plan they have and it's really expensive,” Fothergill said.
    


Planning for more than one child in college at the same time: Say you have a 7th grader and a 9th grader. You will be dealing with college bills for six years, and doubly large ones during two of those years when both kids are in school simultaneously. So it pays to strategize especially carefully for those overlap years.
    


            You want to minimize your income in the “base” years — which is two years ahead of when your child matriculates, Fothergill said. It is information from those two years that is included on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form, which is a key form schools consider when determining your aid package. So, for example, if you plan to sell stocks to help pay for tuition, don't sell them in that two-year window because it may artificially inflate your income during the base years and you may get less aid as a result.
    


            Know too that recent changes to FAFSA rules mean that families with two or more kids in school at once get less of a break than they used to, Fothergill noted.
    


            Also, not all schools make their aid decisions exclusively using FAFSA. Some use the CSS profile from the College Board to determine how much institutional aid to give. And the rules governing how much a family is expected to contribute using the CSS differ from FAFSA's.
    


            So, before applying anywhere, research what governs aid decisions at schools your child may want to attend. And get your child's Student Aid Index number, which is generated by the FAFSA form once completed.
    


Start looking for scholarships: There is a wide variety of scholarships available at the national, state and local levels and also at individual schools. So do some research to see which ones might be a good fit for your child. The College Board has a free tool that can get you started. 



Apply to colleges most likely to give you what you need: There are now many comprehensive, online sites like Niche.com and Dabima.com that let you research every major aspect of a college relevant to potential applicants — from academics and financial aid to school culture — and assess how your child compares to the average student at a chosen school.
    


Niche.com, for instance, provides users with the 25th to 75th percentile range of standardized test scores among students who've been admitted. So if your child's score is above that range you'll know they would be in the top quartile. And Niche lets you see, based on GPA and test scores, how your child would rank, relative to accepted students. In addition, it offers a list of Best Value Colleges, which considers many factors, including net price for tuition room and board, student-faculty ratio, student reviews, return on investment for a degree and how likely the lowest-income students are to move up the economic ladder after graduation.
    


            By the end of this year, Fothergill is planning to make another tool he created called ListHero available to consumers. It is currently used by educational consultants to identify the top list of schools that offer the best fit and education for their clients at the most affordable price for them.
    


            While students may still want to apply to “reach” schools, it's important for families to realize that if their children do get in, it may be a very expensive ride if a child's academic performance lags that of fellow classmates at the school, Fothergill said. “Colleges don't invest [aid] money in the bottom quartile.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged Sunday that Walmart, the largest U.S. retailer, may pass along some of the costs from President Donald Trump's tariffs to its shoppers through higher prices.

Bessent described his call with the company's CEO a day after Trump warned Walmart to avoid raising prices from the tariffs at all and vowed to keep a close watch on what it does. 

As doubts persist about Trump's economic leadership, Bessent pushed back against inflation concerns, praised the uncertainty caused by Trump as a negotiating tactic for trade talks and dismissed the downgrade Friday of U.S. government debt by Moody's Ratings.

Yet Walmart does not appear prepared to “eat the tariffs” in full, as Trump has insisted the company and China would do.

Bessent said he spoke Saturday with Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, stressing in two news show interviews that what he thought really mattered for Walmart customers was the decline in gasoline prices. Gas is averaging roughly $3.18 a gallon, down from a year ago but also higher over the past week, according to AAA.

“Walmart will be absorbing some of the tariffs, some may get passed on to consumers,” Bessent said on CNN. “Overall, I would expect inflation to remain in line. But I don't blame consumers for being skittish after what happened to them for years under Biden,” a reference to inflation hitting a four-decade high in June 2022 under then President Joe Biden as the recovery from the pandemic, government spending and the Russian invasion of Ukraine pushed up costs.

Walmart did not comment on Bessent's description of his conversation with McMillon.




In a social media post on Saturday morning, Trump said Walmart should not charge its customers more money to offset the new tariff costs. “I'll be watching, and so will your customers!!!” he posted.

Bessent said Walmart on its earnings call on Thursday had been obligated under federal regulations “to give the worst-case scenario so that they're not sued,” suggesting in an NBC interview that the price increases would not be severe in his view.

But Walmart executives said last week that higher prices began to appear on their shelves in late April and accelerated this month.

“We're wired to keep prices low, but there's a limit to what we can bear, or any retailer for that matter,” Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey told The Associated Press on Thursday.

Bessent maintained that the ratings downgrade was a “lagging indicator” as the financial markets had already priced in the costs of a total federal debt of roughly $36 trillion. Still, the tax plan being pushed by Trump would add more roughly $3.3 trillion to deficits over the next decade, including a $600 billion increase in 2027 alone, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

The treasury secretary maintained that deficits would not be a problem because the economy would grow faster than the debt accumulation, reducing its increase as a size of the overall economy. 

Most independent analyses are skeptical of the administration's claims that it can achieve 3% average growth as Trump's 2018 tax cuts failed to do so. Those tax cuts from Trump's first term did boost economic growth before the pandemic, but they also raised the budget deficit relative to previous estimates by the Congressional Budget Office.

On tariffs, the Trump administration is still trying to determine rates with roughly 40 major trading partners before a July deadline. It's also in the early stages of a 90-day negotiation with China, after agreed a week ago to reset tariffs on that country from 145% to 30% so that talks can proceed.

Bessent said any worries about tariffs by small business owners most likely reflected the higher rate previously being charged on China. Still, the uncertainty has been a major drag for consumers and businesses trying to make spending plans in the weeks, months and years ahead.

“Strategic uncertainty is a negotiating tactic,” Bessent said. “So if we were to give too much certainty to the other countries, then they would play us in the negotiations.”

Bessent appeared on NBC's “Meet the Press” and CNN's “State of the Union.”

LONDON, Ky. (AP) — Residents in Kentucky and Missouri sifted through damage in tornado-stricken neighborhoods and cleared debris Sunday after severe storms swept through parts of the Midwest and South and killed more than two dozen people.

Kentucky was hardest hit as a devastating tornado damaged hundreds of homes, tossed vehicles and left many homeless. At least 18 people were killed, most of them in southeastern Laurel County. Ten more people were critically injured with state leaders saying the death toll could still rise. 

“We are hard at work this morning addressing the tragic damage and deaths caused by severe weather,” Gov. Andy Beshear posted on X Sunday morning. “We are securing emergency housing options and looking into sites for intermediate housing.”

The latest Kentucky storms were part of a weather system Friday that killed seven in Missouri and two in northern Virginia, authorities said. The system also spawned tornadoes in Wisconsin, brought punishing heat to Texas and temporarily enveloped parts of Illinois — including Chicago — in a pall of dust on an otherwise sunny day. 

In London, Kentucky, Ryan VanNorstran huddled with his brother's large dogs in a first-floor closet as the storm hit his brother's home Friday in a neighborhood along Keavy Road where much of the destruction in the community of nearly 8,000 people was centered. VanNorstran was house-sitting.

He said he felt the house shake as he got in the closet. Then a door from another house crashed through a window. All the windows blew out of the house and his car was destroyed. Chunks of wood had punched through several parts of the roof but the house avoided catastrophic damage. When he stepped outside he heard “a lot of screaming.”




“I guess in the moment, I kind of realized there was nothing I could do. I'd never really felt that kind of power from just nature,” he said. “And so I was in there and I was just kind of thinking, it's either gonna take me or it's all gonna be all right.”

Survey teams were expected on the ground in Kentucky on Monday so the state can apply for federal disaster assistant, Beshear said. 

Parts of two dozen state roads were closed, and some could take days to reopen, he said. 

About 1,200 tornadoes strike the U.S. annually, and they have been reported in all 50 states over the years. Researchers found in 2018 that deadly tornadoes were happening less frequently in the traditional “Tornado Alley” of Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas and more frequently in parts of the more densely populated and tree-filled mid-South. 

In St. Louis, Mayor Cara Spencer said five people died, 38 were injured and more than 5,000 homes were affected. 

“The devastation is truly heartbreaking,” she said at a news conference Saturday. 

A tornado struck in Scott County, about 130 miles (209 kilometers) south of St. Louis, killing two people, injuring several others and destroying multiple homes, Sheriff Derick Wheetley wrote on social media.

The storms hit after the Trump administration massively cut staffing of National Weather Service offices, with outside experts worrying about how it would affect warnings in disasters such as tornadoes.

The office in Jackson, Kentucky, which was responsible for the area around London, Kentucky, had a March 2025 vacancy rate of 25%; the Louisville, Kentucky, weather service staff was down 29%; and the St. Louis office was down 16%, according to calculations by weather service employees obtained by The Associated Press. The Louisville office was also without a permanent boss, the meteorologist in charge, as of March, according to the staffing data.

Experts said any vacancy rate above 20% is a critical problem.

WASHINGTON (AP) — For generations, official American documents have been meticulously preserved and protected, from the era of quills and parchment to boxes of paper to the cloud, safeguarding snapshots of the government and the nation for posterity. 

Now, the Trump administration is scrubbing thousands of government websites of history, legal records and data it finds disagreeable. 

It has sought to expand the executive branch's power to shield from public view the government-slashing efforts of Elon Musk's team and other key administration initiatives. Officials have used apps such as Signal that can auto-delete messages containing sensitive information rather than retaining them for recordkeeping. And they have shaken up the National Archives leadership and even ordered the rewriting of history on display at the Smithsonian Institution.

All of that follows President Donald Trump discouraging note-taking at meetings, ripping up records when he was done with them, refusing to release White House visitor logs and having staffers sign nondisclosure agreements during his first term — then being indicted for hauling to Florida boxes of sensitive documents that he was legally required to relinquish. 

To historians and archivists, it points to the possibility that Trump's presidency will leave less for the nation's historical record than nearly any before it and that what is authorized for public release will be sanitized and edited to reinforce a carefully sculpted image the president wants projected, even if the facts don't back that up. 

How will experts and their fellow Americans understand what went on during Trump's term when those charged with setting aside the artifacts documenting history refuse to do so?

The administration says it's the “most transparent in history,” citing the Republican president's penchant for taking questions from reporters nearly every day. 

But flooding the airwaves, media outlets and the internet with all things Trump isn't the same as keeping records that document the inner workings of an administration, historians caution. That's especially true given the president's propensity for exaggerating, particularly when it comes to bolstering his own image and accomplishments. 

“He thinks he controls history,” says Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian who served as founding director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California. “He wants to control what Americans ultimately find out about the truth of his administration, and that's dangerous. Because, if he believes that he can control that truth, he may believe that there is nothing that he can do that would have consequences.”

Watchdog groups are most immediately worried about what the administration is doing in real time with little oversight or accountability. They point to Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and other top officials seeking to obscure sweeping efforts to remake government, the economy and large swaths of the nation's civil and cultural fabric.

“With this administration's history of tearing up records, storing them in unsecured facilities in Florida, its use of Signal,” said Scott Amey, general counsel of the Project on Government Oversight, which has sued DOGE seeking greater access to records. “At that point, there are a lot of questions about how's DOGE operating, and is it operating within the law?”

Trump has made concealing even basic facts part of his political persona. 

He long refused to release his tax returns despite every other major White House candidate and president having done so since Jimmy Carter. Today, White House stenographers still record every word Trump utters, but many of their transcriptions are languishing in the White House press office without authorization for public release. That means no official record — for weeks, if at all — of what the president has said.

“You want to have a record because that's how you ensure accountability,” said Lindsay Chervinsky, executive director of the George Washington Presidential Library in Mount Vernon, Virginia. “You can't hold people accountable if you don't actually know what happened.” 

Presidents are legally obligated to keep up the historical record. After the Watergate scandal forced Nixon to resign in 1974, he tried to take documents home to California. Congress approved a law requiring document preservation that applied only to Nixon. 

Four years later, the Presidential Records Act extended similar rules to all commanders in chief. It mandates the preservation, forever, of White House and vice presidential documents and communications. It deems them the property of the U.S. government and directs the National Archives and Records Administration to administer them after a president's term. 

A separate measure, the Federal Records Act of 1950, is meant to safeguard for the historical record the actions of other officials. It says their communications should be preserved, sent to the National Archives, whose headquarters is down the street from the White House, and are generally subject to requests for information under Freedom of Information Act. 

The Presidential Records Act affords presidents the exclusive responsibility for the custody and management of their records while in office, and says the National Archives plays no role except when a president wants to dispose of such materials. 

Further, it protects some presidential records from Freedom of Information requests for five years after a president leaves office, and can even block release of some records for up to a dozen years after a president's term is up. Presidents also can evoke executive privilege to further limit certain types of communication from release. 

Once an administration is over, however, there are rules about what even the president must retain for the public. The Presidential Records Act also prohibits presidents from taking records home. 

That's best evidenced by Trump's 2022 federal indictment for mishandling classified documents. Rather than turn them over the National Archives, Trump hauled boxes of potentially sensitive documents from his first term to his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, where they ended piled up in his bedroom, a ballroom and even a bathroom and shower. The FBI raided the property to recover them. The case was later thrown out, though, and then abandoned altogether after Trump won back the White House last November. 

Trudy Huskamp Peterson, acting Archivist of the United States from 1993 to 1995, said keeping such records for the public is important because “decision-making always involves conflicting views, and it's really important to get that internal documentation to see what the arguments were.” 

The push toward preservation of the historical record predates Nixon and even the United States itself. 

American colonists decried the secrecy around the British Parliament, leading early leaders to install transparency safeguards, including initially rejecting the notion of a presidential Cabinet at the Constitutional Convention. Instead, they endorsed requirements that the president receive advice in writing from department secretaries, so that there would be a written record, said Chervinsky, also author of “The Cabinet: George Washington and the Creation of an American Institution.” 

In 1796, Washington asserted what today might be called executive privilege, arguing that some diplomatic conversations had to be private given their sensitive nature. But the following year, the nation's first president wrote about the need to build a library to house his papers for historians and researchers, Chervinsky said. 

Many early presidents kept meticulous records, including John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, both of whom wanted to “be seen as a positive figure in history,” Chervinsky said. Others, like Abraham Lincoln, had advisers who understood the importance of the era and documented history carefully. 

Other presidents often did not prioritize recordkeeping. 

Ulysses S. Grant, who left office in 1877, famously wrote, “The only place I ever found in my life to put a paper so as to find it again was either a side coat-pocket, or the hands of a clerk more careful than myself.” And it wasn't until 2014 when the Library of Congress, finally clear of legal battles that raged 50 years earlier with Warren G. Harding's family, released correspondence between the 29th president and his mistress, Carrie Fulton Phillips.

Federally authorized presidential libraries did not exist until 1941, when Franklin D. Roosevelt opened his while still in office, although a mostly privately funded library established for Rutherford B. Hayes, who left the presidency in 1881, served as a model. Roosevelt also installed a White House tape recorder to capture conversations, a practice that mostly continued until Nixon's Oval Office tapes upended his presidency. 

After President John F. Kennedy's assassination, many of his presidential recordings were taken by his family and National Archives officials had to negotiate with Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., for public access, Peterson said. President Lyndon B. Johnson recorded phone calls that have informed historians for decades, including his 1964 lament about the Vietnam War: “It just worries the hell out of me.” 

Naftali said that in his role at the Nixon library, he saw drafts materials — and the notes used to compile them — that survived among presidential papers, even when the finished documents were shredded in Watergate cover-up efforts. 

“You should want accountability whether you're a Republican or a Democrat or an independent,” Naftali said. “You want to know what people did in your name.” 

Even after new laws saw Nixon's White House tapes turned over to authorities, it fell to archivists to separate official and political material from the personal, which was potentially subject to more privacy protections. They also had to deal with voice-activated devices clicking on while Oval Office cleaning crews worked.

More recently, President George H.W. Bush's administration destroyed some informal notes, visitor logs and emails. After President Bill Clinton left office, his former national security adviser, Sandy Berger, pleaded guilty to taking copies of a document about terrorist threats from the National Archives by stuffing them down his pants leg. 

President George W. Bush's administration disabled automatic archiving for some official emails, encouraged some staffers to use private email accounts outside their work addresses and lost 22 million emails that were supposed to have been archived, though they were eventually uncovered in 2009.

The younger Bush also signed an executive order seeking to limit the scope of the Presidential Records Act for himself and past presidents. His successor, President Barack Obama, rescinded that. Obama's administration nonetheless moved to block release of White House visitor logs, something Trump continued in his first term. 

Congress updated the Presidential Records Act and the Federal Records Act in 2014 to encompass electronic messaging, including commercial email services known to be used by government employees to conduct official business. But back then, use of auto-delete apps like Signal was far less common. 

“A decade ago, we were still in a Gmail, Yahoo, and AOL world,” said Jason R. Baron, a professor at the University of Maryland and former director of litigation at the National Archives. “The point is, it's far easier to copy — or forward — a commercial email to a dot-gov address to be preserved, than it is to screenshot a series of messages on an app like Signal.”

Further complicating matters is Trump's routinely answering cellphone calls, including from reporters. Guidance dating back decades suggests documenting, through ordinary note-taking, the substance of conversations where significant decisions are made, Baron said. 

But he also noted that the rules are less clear than those around written communications, including texts. Such communications have already been at the center of advocates' work to preserve records around DOGE's work. 

The administration has argued DOGE's efforts are subject to the Presidential Records Act which would potentially shield it from Freedom of Information Act rules. Amey's Project on Government Oversight sued, maintaining that Musk's initiative should be covered by the Federal Records Act. 

Other advocacy groups have also sued DOGE over compliance with Freedom of Information Act requests, prompting the administration to file a one-page record retention policy in March that was revealed in court filings. It requires DOGE staffers to preserve all work-related communications and records, regardless of format — which, if applied completely across the board, would include apps like Signal. 

There were efforts during the first Trump administration to safeguard transparency, including a memo issued through the Office of White House counsel Don McGahn in February 2017 that reminded White House personnel of the necessity to preserve and maintain presidential records. 

Trump's 2017-2021 administration also established a system to capture messages the president posted to Twitter even after he deleted them. 

When Trump frequently ripped up briefing papers and other documents when he was finished with them during his first term, record analysts working across the street from the White House later would gather them up and tape them back together as best they could. 

Experts and advocates say no such guidance memo has been issued from the White House this time, though William Fischer, the National Archives acting chief records officer, released a memo this month reminding agencies about rules for maintaining federal records created on apps such as Signal and recommending using “automated tools to comply” with the Federal Records Act. 

Trump has recently talked about his place in history, and officials around the president have discussed building a presidential library — potentially in Florida — when he leaves the White House for good. But Trump also long exaggerated his right to keep documents for personal use rather than turn them over to archivists. 

“Under the Presidential Records Act, I'm allowed to do all this,” Trump wrote on his social media site in June 2023 after the FBI seized boxes of documents from Mar-a-Lago — an assertion the indictment against him disputed. 

The White House says Trump was “unjustly prosecuted” on “fake charges” during that case. It points to having recently ordered the declassification of bevies of historical files, including records related to the assassinations of Kennedy, his brother Robert and Martin Luther King. 

The administration says it fulfilled records requests from Congress that the administration of his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, ignored, and offered instructions that federal agencies should clear out backlogged Freedom of Information Act requests. 

It says it ended the Biden-era practice of staffers using Microsoft Teams, where chats were not captured by White House systems. The Biden administration had more than 800 users on Teams, meaning an unknown number of presidential records might have been lost, Trump officials now say, though that is something Biden representatives did not confirm. 

But the White House did not answer questions about the possibly of drafting a new memo on record retention like McGahn's from 2017. Nor did it comment about whether nondisclosure agreements remain in use for White House staffers this term, or speak to Trump's past habit of tearing up documents. 

Chervinsky, of the George Washington Presidential Library, said Congress, the courts and even the public often don't have the bandwidth to ensure records retention laws are enforced, meaning, “A lot of it is still, I think, an honor system.”

“There aren't that many people who are practicing oversight,” she said. “So, a lot of it does require people acting in good faith and using the operating systems that they're supposed to use, and using the filing systems they're supposed to use.”

Angered by the role the National Archives played in his documents case, meanwhile, Trump fired the ostensibly independent agency's head, Archivist of the United States Colleen Shogan, and named Secretary of State Marco Rubio as her acting replacement.

Peterson, the former acting national archivist, said she still believes key information about the Trump administration will eventually emerge, but “I don't know how soon.” 

“Ultimately things come out,” she said. “That's just the way the world works.”

Libraries across the United States are cutting back on e-books, audiobooks and loan programs after the Trump administration suspended millions of dollars in federal grants as it tries to dissolve the Institute of Museum and Library Services.

Federal judges have issued temporary orders to block the Trump administration from taking any further steps toward gutting the agency. But the unexpected slashing of grants has delivered a significant blow to many libraries, which are reshuffling budgets and looking at different ways to raise money. 

Maine has laid off a fifth of its staff and temporarily closed its state library after not receiving the remainder of its annual funding. Libraries in Mississippi have indefinitely stopped offering a popular e-book service, and the South Dakota state library has suspended its interlibrary loan program.

E-book and audiobook programs are especially vulnerable to budget cuts, even though those offerings have exploded in popularity since the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I think everyone should know the cost of providing digital sources is too expensive for most libraries,” said Cindy Hohl, president of the American Library Association. “It's a continuous and growing need.” 




President Donald Trump issued an executive order March 14 to dismantle the IMLS before firing nearly all of its employees. 

One month later, the Maine State Library announced it was issuing layoff notices for workers funded through an IMLS grant program.

“It came as quite a surprise to all of us,” said Spencer Davis, a library generalist at the Maine State Library who is one of eight employees who were laid off May 8 because of the suspended funding. 

In April, California, Washington and Connecticut were the only three states to receive letters stating the remainder of their funding for the year was cancelled, Hohl said. For others, the money hasn't been distributed yet. The three states all filed formal objections with the IMLS.

Rebecca Wendt, California state library director, said she was never told why California's funding was terminated while the other remaining states did not receive the same notice.

“We are mystified,” Wendt said.

The agency did not respond to an email seeking comment.

Most libraries are funded by city and county governments, but receive a smaller portion of their budget from their state libraries, which receive federal dollars every year to help pay for summer reading programs, interlibrary loan services and digital books. Libraries in rural areas rely on federal grants more than those in cities.

Many states use the funding to pay for e-books and audiobooks, which are increasingly popular, and costly, offerings. In 2023, more than 660 million people globally borrowed e-books, audiobooks and digital magazines, up from 19% in 2022, according to OverDrive, the main distributor of digital content for libraries and schools.

In Mississippi, the state library helped fund its statewide e-book program.

For a few days, Erin Busbea was the bearer of bad news for readers at her Mississippi library: Hoopla, a popular app to check out e-books and audiobooks had been suspended indefinitely in Lowndes and DeSoto counties due to the funding freeze.

“People have been calling and asking, ‘Why can't I access my books on Hoopla?'” said Busbea, library director of the Columbus-Lowndes Public Library System in Columbus, a majority-Black city northeast of Jackson.

The library system also had to pause parts of its interlibrary loan system allowing readers to borrow books from other states when they aren't available locally.

“For most libraries that were using federal dollars, they had to curtail those activities,” said Hulen Bivins, the Mississippi Library Commission executive director.

The funding freeze came after the agency's roughly 70 staff members were placed on administrative leave in March. 

Attorneys general in 21 states and the American Library Association have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration for seeking to dismantle the agency.

The institute's annual budget is below $300 million and distributes less than half of that to state libraries across the country. In California, the state library was notified that about 20%, or $3 million, of its $15 million grant had been terminated.

“The small library systems are not able to pay for the e-books themselves,” said Wendt, the California state librarian.

In South Dakota, the state's interlibrary loan program is on hold, according to Nancy Van Der Weide, a spokesperson for the South Dakota Department of Education.

The institute, founded in 1996 by a Republican-controlled Congress, also supports a national library training program named after former first lady Laura Bush that seeks to recruit and train librarians from diverse or underrepresented backgrounds. A spokesperson for Bush did not return a request seeking comment.

“Library funding is never robust. It's always a point of discussion. It's always something you need to advocate for,” said Liz Doucett, library director at Curtis Memorial Library in Brunswick, Maine. “It's adding to just general anxiety.”

Presidential candidates in Romania are casting ballots in a tense presidential runoff between a hard-right nationalist and a pro-Western centrist, in a high-stakes election rerun that could determine the geopolitical direction of the European Union and NATO member country.

BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romanians voted Sunday in a tense presidential runoff between a hard-right nationalist and a pro-Western centrist in a high-stakes election rerun that could determine the geopolitical direction of the European Union and NATO member country.

The race pits front-runner George Simion, the 38-year-old leader of the hard-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, or AUR, against incumbent Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan. It comes months after the cancellation of the previous election plunged Romania into its worst political crisis in decades.

Polls close at 9 p.m. (1800 GMT). By 7.30 p.m., more than 11 million people — or about 61% of eligible voters — had cast ballots, according to official electoral data. Romanians abroad have been able to vote since Friday at specially set-up polling stations, and more than 1.5 million have already voted. 

Turnout is typically higher in the final round of Romanian presidential elections, and is expected to play a decisive role in the outcome on Sunday. In the first round on May 4, final turnout stood at 9.5 million, or 53% of eligible voters. 

Romania's political landscape was upended last year when a top court voided the previous election in which far-right outsider Calin Georgescu topped first-round polls, following allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference, which Moscow denied.

Shortly after 6 p.m., Romania's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Andrei Tarnea said in a post on X that the election was subject to a “viral campaign of fake news” on the Telegram messaging app and other social media platforms, which tried to influence the electoral process and had “the hallmarks of Russian interference.” 




Networks of coordinated disinformation have emerged as a pervasive force throughout Romania's entire election cycle. Romanian authorities debunked the deluge of fake news, Tarnea said. 

Simion appeared alongside Georgescu at a Bucharest polling station on Sunday and told reporters that he voted against the “humiliations to which our sisters and brothers have been subjected.”

“We voted against abuses and against poverty,” he said. “I voted for our future to be decided only by Romanians, for Romanians and Romania. So help us God!”

Years of endemic corruption and growing anger toward Romania's political establishment have fueled a surge in support for anti-establishment and hard-right figures, reflecting a broader pattern across Europe. Both Simion and Dan have made their political careers railing against Romania's old political class.

Most recent local surveys indicate the runoff will be tight, after earlier ones showed Simion holding a lead over Dan, a 55-year-old mathematician who rose to prominence as a civic activist fighting against illegal real estate projects.

After voting in his hometown of Fagaras, Dan told reporters that he voted for Romanians “who are quiet, honest, and hardworking, and who have not felt represented for a long time.”

“I voted for a change that brings prosperity, not one that brings instability and discourages investment in Romania,” he said. “I voted for a European direction, and for strong cooperation with our European partners, not for Romania's isolation. I voted for a society where we can have dialogue, not one where we are destined to be divided.”

Dan founded the reformist Save Romania Union party in 2016 but later left, and is running independently on a pro-European Union ticket reaffirming Western ties, support for Ukraine and fiscal reform.

Simion's rhetoric in the lead-up to Sunday had raised some concerns that he would not respect the outcome if he lost.

He appeared on the steps of Romania's colossal Communist-era parliament building early in the afternoon, telling reporters his team was confident in a “landslide victory” if the election was “free and fair.” 

However, he repeated allegations of voting irregularities among Romanian citizens in neighboring Moldova and said his party members would conduct a parallel vote count after polls close. He told The Associated Press the ballot so far had proceeded properly. 

Adrian Nadin, a 51-year-old musician who supported Georgescu in the previous election, said he chose Simion. “A part of Romania prefers conservatism,” he said. 

Luminita Petrache, a 32-year-old financial crimes analyst, did not want to say who she voted for but described the runoff as a geopolitical choice between East and West.

“It is very important because the next president will be our image in Europe, and (decide) how Romania will evolve in the next five years,” she said. “I hope for changes in Romania in good ways.”

The president is elected for a five-year term and has significant decision-making powers in matters of national security and foreign policy. The winner of Sunday's race will be charged with nominating a new prime minister after Marcel Ciolacu stepped down following the failure of his coalition's candidate to advance to the runoff.

After coming fourth in last year's canceled race, Simion backed Georgescu, who was banned in March from running in the election redo. Simion then surged to front-runner in the May 4 first round after becoming the standard-bearer for the hard right.

A former activist who campaigned for reunification with neighboring Moldova, Simion says he would focus on reforms: slashing red tape and reducing bureaucracy and taxes. Still, he insists that restoring democracy is his priority, returning “the will of the people.”

His AUR party says it stands for “family, nation, faith, and freedom” and rose to prominence in a 2020 parliamentary election. It has since grown to become the second-largest party in the Romanian legislature.

His critics say Simion is a pro-Russian extremist who threatens Romania's longstanding alliances in the EU and NATO. 

In an AP interview, he rejected the accusations, saying Russia is his country's biggest threat and that he wants Romania to be treated as “equal partners” in Brussels.

“I don't think he is a pro-Russian candidate, I also don't think that he's an anti-Russian candidate,” said Claudiu Tufis, an associate professor of political science at the University of Bucharest. “I think what is driving him is … his focus on what I call identity politics.”

In the first-round vote, Simion won a massive 61% of Romania's large diaspora vote, with his calls to patriotism resonating with Romanians who moved abroad in search of better opportunities.

Hours after voting abroad opened on Friday, Simion accused the Moldovan government of election fraud, claims that were quickly rejected by Moldovan and Romanian authorities.

BASEL, Switzerland (AP) — Classically trained Austrian singer JJ won the 69th Eurovision Song Contest in Switzerland on Saturday with “Wasted Love,” a song that combines operatic, multi-octave vocals with a techno twist.

Israeli singer Yuval Raphael came second at an exuberant celebration of music and unity that was shadowed by the Gaza war and rattled by discord over Israel's participation.

 JJ, whose full name is Johannes Pietsch, was Austria's third Eurovision winner, and the first since bearded drag queen Conchita Wurst in 2014. The 24-year-old countertenor, who sings at the Vienna State Opera, has called Wurst a mentor. 

“This is beyond my wildest dreams. It's crazy,” said the singer after being handed the microphone-shaped glass Eurovision trophy.

JJ won after a nail-biting final that saw Raphael scoop up a massive public vote from her many fans for her anthemic “New Day Will Rise.” But she also faced protests from pro-Palestinian demonstrators calling for Israel to be kicked out of the contest over its conduct of the war against Hamas in Gaza.

At a post-victory press conference, JJ said the message of his song about unrequited romance was that “love is the strongest force on planet Earth, and love persevered.

“Let's spread love, guys,” said JJ, who added that he was honored to be the first Eurovision champion with Filipino heritage, as well as a proudly queer winner.




He said his message was “acceptance and equality for everyone.”

Political leaders in Austria, which will host the contest next year, congratulated JJ on his win.

“What a great success - my warmest congratulations on winning #ESC2025! JJ is writing Austrian music history today!” Chancellor Christian Stocker posted on X.

The world's largest live music event, which has been uniting and dividing Europeans since 1956, reached its glitter-drenched conclusion with a grand final in Basel that offered pounding electropop, quirky rock and outrageous divas.

Acts from 26 countries — trimmed from 37 entrants through two elimination semifinals — performed to some 160 million viewers for the continent's pop crown. No smoke machine, jet of flame or dizzying light display was spared by musicians who had 3 minutes to win over millions of viewers who, along with national juries of music professionals, picked the winner.

Estonia's Tommy Cash came third with his jokey mock-Italian dance song “Espresso Macchiato.” Swedish entry KAJ, who had been favorite to win with jaunty sauna ode “Bara Bada Bastu,” came fourth.

Several highly praised singers who had been tipped to win fell short, including French chanteuse Louane and soulful Dutch singer Claude.

The show was a celebration of Europe's eclectic, and sometimes baffling, musical tastes. Lithuanian band Katarsis delivered grunge rock, while Ukraine's Ziferblat channeled prog rock and the U.K.'s Remember Monday offered country pop.

Italy's Lucio Corsi evoked 1970s glam rock, while Icelandic duo VAEB rapped about rowing, Latvia's six-woman Tautumeitas offered gorgeous, intertwined harmonies and leather-clad Finn Erika Vikman belted out the innuendo-filled electro-pop song “Ich Komme.”

There were divas aplenty, including Spain's Melody, Poland‘s Justyna Steczkowska, participating in Eurovision for a second time after a 30-year gap,, and Malta's outrageous Miriana Conte, who performed the saucy “Serving” on a set including a glitter ball and giant lips.

Dean Vuletic, an expert on the history of Eurovision, said the competition has become more diverse over the years, and the days are gone when the key to winning was “a catchy, innocuous pop song, usually in English.” 

“An entry needs to be memorable and it needs to be authentic in order to succeed these days,” he said.

This year's contest was roiled for a second year by disputes over Israel's participation. Raphael — a survivor of Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on a music festival in southern Israel that triggered the Gaza war — was met by a mix of cheers and boos as she sang.

Swiss broadcaster SRG SSR said a man and woman were stopped as they tried to climb over a barrier to the stage at the end of her song. It said a crew member was hit by paint thrown by the pair. Raphael's team said she was left “shaken and upset.”

Dozens of former Eurovision competitors, including last year's winner Nemo of Switzerland, have called for Israel to be excluded, and several of the broadcasters that fund Eurovision sought a review of the country's participation.

The Oct. 7 cross-border attacks by Hamas militants killed 1,200 people, and roughly 250 were taken hostage into Gaza. More than 52,800 people in Gaza have been killed in Israel's retaliatory offensive, according to the territory's health ministry.

Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel protests both took place in Basel, though on a much smaller scale than at last year's event in Sweden, where thousands marched in the streets and tensions spilled over backstage, leading to the expulsion of Dutch contestant Joost Klein.

Hundreds of people marched through Basel just before the competition, waving Palestinian flags and chanting “Boycott Israel.”

Earlier, a group of Israel supporters gathered in Basel's cathedral square to root for Raphael and to show that “Jews belong in public spaces in Switzerland,” Zurich resident Rebecca Laes-Kushner said.

She said that “it would be such a strong statement against antisemitism,” if Raphael won.

“This is supposed to be about music, not about hate,” she said.

The European Broadcasting Union, or EBU, which runs Eurovision, tightened the contest's code of conduct this year, calling on participants to respect Eurovision's values of “universality, diversity, equality and inclusivity” and its political neutrality.

Eurovision director Martin Green told reporters that the organizers' goal was to ”re-establish a sense of unity, calm and togetherness this year in a difficult world.” He said all 37 national delegations “have behaved impeccably.”

Hilary Fox and Kwiyeon Ha in Basel, Maria Sherman in New York, Sylvia Hui in London, Stefanio Dazio in Berlin and Stephanie Liechtenstein in Vienna contributed to this report.

A fast-food eatery at Pompeii has been excavated, helping to reveal dishes that were popular for the citizens of the ancient Roman city who were partial to eating out.

Archaeologists uncovered disturbing details about a Pompeii family's fight for survival during the destructive eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 A.D.

The Pompeii Archaeological Park announced the recent excavation in a Facebook post in April. Researchers investigated the House of Helle and Phrixus in Pompeii, finding proof of ""residents' attempts to save themselves from the ongoing eruption.""

The house consists of an entrance, an atrium with a water collection basin called an impluvium, and a bedroom — plus a room with a canopy and a banquet hall with ""richly decorated walls.""

""This opening may have allowed lapilli (volcanic rock fragments) to rain inside the house during the early phases of the eruption, from which the victims, now found, tried to protect themselves by taking refuge in a room barricaded with a bed,"" noted the statement, which was translated from Italian to English. 

""A cast of the bed was made by identifying voids in the solidified ash formed by the organic decomposition of the wood,"" officials said.

""Plaster was poured into the voids to reconstruct the shape of the bed preserved as an imprint in the ash.""

In one striking account, researchers found that a family placed a bed across a bedroom door as a makeshift barricade to protect themselves against the volcanic eruption.

Archaeologists also came across the remains of at least four people in the house, including a child. 

""The child likely owned the bronze bulla found here, an amulet worn by boys until reaching adulthood,"" the post said. 

A family placed a bed across a bedroom door as a makeshift barricade to protect themselves against the volcanic eruption.

Excavators also found various pantry items, which paint a vivid picture of daily life in Ancient Rome.

""Among various other objects discovered were a stash of amphorae stored under a staircase serving as a pantry, some used to contain garum, a widely used fish sauce; and a set of bronze vessels, including a ladle, a single-handled jug, a basket-shaped vase, and a shell-shaped cup,"" the statement said.

The house may have also been undergoing renovation at the time of the eruption, as there were thresholds removed and traces of wall cutting sitting at the entrance of the residence.

""However, it continued to be occupied by its residents, who, caught by the eruption, chose not to leave the house, meeting their end there,"" the statement added.

The house was named for a mythological painting that depicts Elle and Phrixus, two figures in Greek mythology.

The painting was found on one of the house's walls, though archaeologists do not believe that the inhabitants worshiped Greek gods.

""[In] the 1st century AD, these stories no longer held the religious and cultural significance they had in the archaic and classical ages,"" the archaeological organization said. 

The excavation helps to confront ""the fragility of life for all of us.""

""We must assume, therefore, that their function in the homes of the middle and upper classes was primarily entertainment, the display of economic and cultural status, and ‘beauty,' which is also evident in this medium-sized domus.""

In a statement, Pompeii Archaeological Park director Gabriel Zuchtriegel said the excavation helps to confront ""the fragility of life for all of us.""

""In this wonderfully decorated small house, we found traces of the inhabitants who tried to save themselves by blocking the entrance to a small room with a bed, of which we made a cast,"" Zuchtriegel said.

""This was because lapilli, volcanic stones, were entering through the atrium roof opening, threatening to invade the space,"" he continued.

Pro golfer Phil Mickelson joins ‘Fox & Friends' to discuss the LIV Golf tournament in Miami, the rivalry with the PGA Tour and the latest on potential merger talks.

Scottie Scheffler showed exactly what the third round of golf tournaments are called ""Moving Day"" on Saturday. 

Scheffler owns a three-stroke lead in the PGA Championship at Quail Hollow after shooting 65 to get to 11-under for the tournament heading into the final round on Sunday. 

Scheffler was dialed in throughout the third round, which included one of his best shots of the tournament: driving the green at the 15th and setting himself up for an easy eagle putt. With three birdies also added on the card, Scheffler walked into the clubhouse with a familiar position on the leaderboard at a major.

While Scheffler's 6-under round was impressive, Sweden's Alex Norén posted 5-under to earn his spot in the final pairing Sunday with Scheffler at 8-under. 

Tied for third are J.T. Poston and Davis Riley at 7-under, while LIV Golf star Jon Rahm has found his stroke again in majors after posting 4-under on Saturday to sit at 6-under for the tournament.

Jhonattan Vegas is also at 6-under, but he could've been in position to win it all if it hadn't been for his 2-over performance on Saturday. 

The Venezuelan was the leader after two rounds, which was mostly due to his 7-under start on Thursday. But four bogeys on the card compared to two birdies dropped him down the leaderboard with much work to do on Sunday if he wishes to win his first career major.

But all eyes will be on Scheffler, who will be going into Sunday hoping to win his first major outside of The Masters. While he is the number one golfer on the planet, and his 2024 season saw him wear another green jacket and win the FedEx Cup, he has yet to win the PGA Championship, U.S. Open or The Open Championship. 

And, of course, last year's PGA Championship at Valhalla was an insane start after he was arrested trying to enter the Louisville-based golf club. Charges would eventually be dropped, but Scheffler was booked, stretched and warmed up in a jail cell and got back to the course in time to play. 

Scheffler is well past that incident, but the point still stands: he hasn't won a major outside the confines of Augusta National Golf Club.

Historic St. Mary's City, a Maryland-based museum and archaeological organization, is opening up a reconstructed 17th-century Catholic Church called the Brick Chapel on April 12. Henry Miller, Ph.D., shared the details.

WARNING: This article contains graphic images. Reader discretion is advised.

Researchers have uncovered the reason an ""unusual"" 18th-century mummy was preserved so well in Austria – and it's highly abnormal.

A study about the mummy was recently published in the journal Frontiers in Medicine. The so-called ""air-dried chaplain"" is housed in the crypt of the church of St. Thomas am Blasenstein in Upper Austria.

Historians believe the mummy's identity was most likely Franz Xaver Sidler von Rosenegg, a vicar who had been temporarily delegated to the St. Thomas parish at the time of his death.

STRANGE VIKING GRAVE WITH 'CHRISTIAN OVERTONES' DISCOVERED BY PERPLEXED ARCHAEOLOGISTS: ‘VERY UNUSUAL'

He was between 35 and 45 years old when he died and passed away between 1730 and 1780, according to carbon dating. Experts were able to glean details about his life, including his diet, from the study.

""He had a high-quality diet based on terrestrial animal products [and] showed no signs of major physical work load,"" the study noted.

Despite his relatively healthy lifestyle, researchers believe that he died from an acute pulmonary hemorrhage after suffering from tuberculosis.

""[He] was most likely a pipe smoker and suffered from chronic active pulmonary tuberculosis with peripheral and central (hilar) calcifications (primary tuberculous complex) and a right lower lobe cavity with focal heterotopic ossification and potential active inflammation,"" the study detailed.

EXPERTS REVEAL DETAILS ABOUT A 16TH-CENTURY CATHOLIC SAINT FOUND 'PERFECTLY PRESERVED': 'TRULY UNIQUE'

But experts were stunned when they came across the mummy's midsection and found it full of curious material – including wood chips, twigs and fabric.

""Most surprisingly, we detected, in the otherwise completely intact abdominal (and pelvic) cavity, extensive packing with foreign material, which was identified as a mixture of wood chips, fragmented twigs, large amounts of fabric of various types, including elaborate embroidered linen, and even pieces of silk,"" the article said.

The man was determined to be between 35 and 45 years old when he died in the mid-18th century. (Andreas Nerlich)

Researchers also came across a solution made of zinc, chloride and copper that appeared to aid in the cadaver's preservation. 

The solution had been inserted into the mummy's abdominal cavity.

""This embalming method seems to have included high-level zinc-ion solution impregnation (most likely zinc-chloride with small amounts of arsenic) and the addition of copper,"" the study said.

""This is the first verified case of such a treatment.""

Researchers added, ""It led to an excellent state of conservation of the [body], while the face (and skull) and peripheral extremities were less well-preserved.""

Professor Andreas Nerlich discussed the findings in an email with Fox News Digital, noting the embalming technique was previously unknown.

""The most significant factors for the embalming of this mummy were the internal stuffing [of] fabric and wood chips and the zinc-chloride solution,"" the expert said.

Though the mummy was found to have had a healthy diet, Nerlich said that factor ""obviously had no influence.""

The professor added, ""We have no idea whether this [embalming] technique has been applied more often, but this is the first verified case of such a treatment. We have no data on its use in other cases.""

WNBA star Sophie Cunningham spoke to Fox News Digital about her offseason trade to the Indiana Fever and her hopes for the upcoming season.  

Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark began her 2025 WNBA season with a triple-double in her team's 93-58 rout of the Chicago Sky Saturday. 

During the game, Clark was called for a flagrant foul after a hard foul on her rival, Angel Reese.

The star Sky center was angry with the foul by Clark and went after her in a heated exchange broken up by Sky and Fever players. Clark walked away and never once looked at Reese as Reese continued to walk toward her.

While it appeared tense on the court, Clark and Reese said the foul wasn't as bad as it seemed after the game. 

""Let's not make it something that it's not,"" Clark said after dropping 20 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists. ""It was just a good play on the basketball. I'm not sure what the ref saw to upgrade it, and that's up to their discretion. 

""It's a take foul to put them at the free throw line. I've watched a lot of basketball in my life. That's exactly what it was. I wasn't trying to do anything malicious. That's not the type of player I am.""

ANGEL REESE, CAITLIN CLARK HAVE HEATED EXCHANGE AFTER HARD FOUL DURING SKY-FEVER GAME

During the play, Reese got an offensive rebound, and Clark appeared to motion toward the referee that the Sky center pushed off a fellow Fever player. Clark then fouled Reese intentionally, hugging her to prevent an easy layup. 

The ESPN broadcast debated whether Clark pushed Reese slightly with her left arm after committing the foul, which might have led to Reese's angry reaction. 

Without elaborating, Reese called it a ""basketball play"" from Clark, a term both players have used in the past. 

Reese struggled shooting in her season debut, scoring 12 points on 5 of 14 from the field, while grabbing a game-high 17 rebounds. 

It was a brief moment, but considering the history between Clark and Reese, it's another chapter in a rivalry that goes back to their college days. The Fever and Sky are now rivals because of the history between Clark and Reese.

Last season, the Fever took three of their four matchups, which included several hard fouls that led to national debate. 

Stephanie White, who got her first win as head coach of the Fever, also commented on Clark's foul. 

""Nobody's going to get anything easy against us,"" White said. ""We're going to be a tough defensive team. I thought it was a clear play on the ball as well.""

""The foul on Clark met the criteria for flagrant foul 1, for wind up, impact and follow-through for the extension of the left hand to Reese's back, which is deemed not a legitimate basketball play, and therefore deemed unnecessary contact,"" crew chief Roy Gulbeyan said of Clark. 

""After the foul, there is a physical taunt technical on Boston and a verbal technical on Reese, which offset.""

A European startup successfully completed the first orbital test flight of its Phoenix 1 re-entry space capsule.

While the United States has long been a leader in space exploration and commercial launches, Europe is now making significant strides of its own. Recently, a major milestone was achieved when Atmos Space Cargo, a European startup, successfully completed the first orbital test flight of its Phoenix 1 re-entry space capsule. 

This mission, which launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, as part of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rideshare, marks a new chapter in global space logistics. 

By demonstrating that Europe can develop and operate advanced return technology, Atmos is helping to make space more accessible and efficient for researchers, businesses and innovators on both sides of the Atlantic. 

This achievement signals the arrival of a new player in the space return market and opens the door to greater collaboration and competition in the rapidly growing field of commercial space logistics.

Phoenix 1   (Atmos Space Cargo)

Phoenix 1 launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, as part of the Bandwagon-3 rideshare mission. After reaching a 45-degree inclination orbit, the capsule completed one full trip around Earth. A carefully timed de-orbit maneuver then sent Phoenix 1 back toward the planet. During its descent, the capsule deployed an innovative inflatable heat shield, a technology designed by Atmos to protect the capsule during the intense heat and friction of reentry. 

FIRST PRIVATE SPACEX POLAR MISSION SPLASHES DOWN NEAR CALIFORNIA

As Phoenix 1 reentered Earth's atmosphere, it transmitted critical system and payload data to ground stations in South America. The capsule splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean, about 1,240 miles off the Brazilian coast. Because of the remote landing location, recovery of the capsule was not planned. However, the mission's main objectives were met, and the data collected is now being analyzed to inform future missions.

The success of Phoenix 1 establishes Atmos as the fastest-moving private space logistics company in Europe to conduct an orbital return mission. This achievement demonstrates that Europe is on the path to developing independent, sovereign return capabilities. 

It also shows that private industry can lead the way in building essential space infrastructure. Atmos' rapid prototyping approach allowed the team to develop, qualify and fly Phoenix 1 in less than a year. This speed is almost unheard of in the space industry and highlights the company's commitment to innovation and hands-on problem-solving. The mission also proved that multinational collaboration is possible, as teams from around Europe worked together to achieve a common goal.

The Phoenix 1 mission had several core objectives. The team aimed to collect in-flight data from the capsule and its subsystems while in orbit. The mission also carried scientific and commercial payloads, including technology demonstrators and biological experiments from partners such as Frontier Space, Imperial College London, DLR and IDDK. 

Another key goal was to deploy and test the inflatable heat shield under real reentry conditions. Although some data from the final stage of descent could not be retrieved due to the splashdown location, the mission still provided valuable insights. The data received from the capsule has already contributed to the development of Phoenix 2, the next-generation capsule planned for launch in 2026.

The inflatable heat shield is a breakthrough in reentry technology. Traditional capsules rely on heavy, single-use heat shields or parachutes to survive reentry. Atmos' design is lighter, more efficient and potentially reusable, which could dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of returning cargo from space. 

Atmos' development philosophy is based on rapid prototyping and real-world testing. The team believes in building and testing hardware quickly, learning from each iteration and making improvements based on real data rather than relying solely on simulations. This approach allowed Phoenix 1 to go from concept to space in record time.

Phoenix 1   (Atmos Space Cargo)

Atmos is already working on Phoenix 2, which will include its own propulsion system. This upgrade will allow the capsule to control its reentry trajectory and choose its splashdown zone, making recovery much easier and more practical. The company's vision is to create a flexible, cost-efficient and reliable logistics platform for space, supporting both commercial and institutional missions. 

With a payload efficiency of 1:2, Phoenix already offers the highest mass efficiency on the market. This opens new opportunities for microgravity research, in-space manufacturing and biotechnology. The technology will also support Europe's defense sector and strengthen the continent's independent space infrastructure.

Phoenix 1  (Atmos Space Cargo)

The success of Phoenix 1 is not just a technical achievement for engineers and scientists. It has the potential to assist with many aspects of everyday life. Faster and more affordable access to space means that new technologies, medicines and materials can be developed and tested in microgravity and then brought back to Earth for use.

Universities, startups and small companies will have more opportunities to conduct experiments in space without the high costs and long wait times that have been barriers in the past. Atmos Space Cargo's growing space capabilities could also lead to new jobs, investment and technological leadership.

President Donald Trump's decision to lift sanctions on Syria was a smart gamble for a president with historic ambitions. On Tuesday in Saudi Arabia, Trump announced that he will lift all sanctions on Syria, many of which have been in place for decades. Then, on Wednesday, he met Syrian President Ahmed al Sharaa, the first encounter between an American president and a Syrian counterpart in a quarter-century. Though not without risks, Trump's move to normalize relations between the United States and the war-torn country could secure long-term strategic interests and reshape a region long beset by chaos.

Crucially, the move signals Trump's determination to prevent Iran from reasserting its influence following Israel's punishing military campaigns against Iranian proxies. Tehran spent tens of billions of dollars propping up the Bashar Assad regime to maintain its land bridge to Lebanon, without which the prospect of rebuilding Hamas and Hezbollah grows drastically more difficult. Syria aligning with the U.S. and moderate Arab allies such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates severely hampers Iran's efforts to dominate the region and threaten Israel. This, in turn, further improves the U.S. position in negotiating a new nuclear deal with Iran. 

Lifting the sanctions also weakens Russia's and China's strategic and economic leverage in the country and region. Russian President Vladimir Putin was a key backer of the Assad regime during the Syrian civil war, offering military and economic aid. Assad's fall cost Russia its most significant regional ally and Moscow's military foothold in the Mediterranean. Syria's subsequent normalization with the U.S. will likely cost Russia lucrative energy contracts and arms deals.

Beijing's soft power also stands to take a significant hit. China previously positioned itself, with its Belt and Road Initiative, as the chief financier of Syria's reconstruction, an effort likely to cost hundreds of billions of dollars. Allowing U.S. companies to compete with Chinese firms for contracts will counter China's use of debt-trap diplomacy, in which it extends large loans to developing countries for infrastructure projects that lead to financial dependency or asset forfeiture. China could lose its regional foothold.

Meanwhile, there will be new opportunities for U.S. companies in infrastructure and energy, particularly in reconstruction. U.S. exporters will be able to tap Syria's market, generating millions of dollars in trade. Stabilization will allow the U.S. to reduce its presence in the Middle East and pivot to Asia, which it must do.

The strategic shift comes with risks. Al Sharaa and others in his Hayat Tahir al Sham movement have violent jihadi pasts. Al Sharaa joined al Qaeda in Iraq shortly before the 2003 U.S. invasion and fought for three years before being captured and held until 2011. He then became the emir of an al Qaeda affiliate and struggled for power with Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi. His leadership of the offensive that overthrew Assad led to his eventual appointment as president of Syria. 

THE ARABIAN LEOPARD

Dealing directly with and thereby legitimizing such a figure could encourage other violent jihadis to attain power through militancy and could alienate Israel. It also risks empowering and enriching a leader with jihadism in his veins. But al Sharaa's actions so far signal a willingness to moderate. He has pursued ties with moderate Arab states and expressed openness to joining the Abraham Accords. He has vowed to protect minorities and promised not to impose strict Shariah law. He has even appointed a Christian woman to his Cabinet. Sanctions relief should be crafted to encourage moderate behavior, but also to be easily restored should al Sharaa backslide into extremism. 

The upside of normalizing relations is worth these risks. We applaud Trump's decision to avoid ideological crusades in favor of pragmatic engagement. By normalizing relations with Syria, the U.S. can be a stabilizing force in the Middle East and have a hand in charting its future, all while dealing strategic blows to our greatest geopolitical adversaries.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A Mexican navy training ship on a promotional tour of New York City crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday night, with multiple videos on social media capturing the horrifying moment its masts made contact with the famous landmark.

The ship, called the Cuauhtémoc, which was covered in lights and brandishing a huge Mexican flag, was carrying about 200 people when it collided with the structure, according to the New York Post.

The outlet reported that a search and rescue operation was underway. At least 20 people are reportedly injured, three of whom are in critical condition, according to CNN.

Footage taken by James Rogers showed the bridge was packed with traffic when the incident happened.

A statement from the Mexican Navy posted to X and translated to English, said a “mishap” occurred with the bridge, “causing damage to the training ship, preventing the continuation of the training cruise for the time being.”

“The status of personnel and equipment is being reviewed by naval and local authorities, who are providing support,” the statement read. “The Navy reaffirms its commitment to personnel safety, transparency in its operations, and excellent training for future officers of the Mexican Navy.

The Brooklyn Bridge is of the most famous structures in the Big Apple. The cable-stayed suspension bridge joins the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn across the East River. Its clearance is 127 feet, whereas the Cuauhtémoc's masts are 147 feet.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Trump the Grifter","https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/05/trump-qatari-jet-constitution/682829/","Sun, 18 May 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The framers of the Constitution were trying to prevent exactly this sort of corruption.

In the years before the Constitution was written, two of the most famous figures of the American Revolution were caught up in controversy over fears of undue foreign influence caused by their receipt of opulent gifts from European kings. One was a gold snuff box encrusted with 408 diamonds that King Louis XVI of France gave to Benjamin Franklin. The other was a horse, given to John Jay by the King of Spain. Both of these gifts were publicly reported to the new Confederation Congress, and despite vocal public objection, both men kept the gifts.

The controversies were still ripe in the minds of American leaders when they soon went to draft a new constitution. They worried that large and valuable gifts might inappropriately influence American officials in their dealings with foreign states—that a snuff box or a horse could psychologically warm a person to another country, distorting his ability to put America's interests first. To prevent that distortion, the drafters made anti-corruption provisions a cornerstone of the new constitution. Indeed, if the frequency of their attention to a particular issue is a measure of how significant their concern was, then few issues were as alarming to them as corruption, which the original Constitution explicitly addresses in four separate instances—plus a fifth that was later added.

President Donald Trump's instinct for self-enrichment is a horrific exemplar of what the Founders hoped to prevent: a president profiting from public office. Trump's ventures—intending to accept the gift of a Qatari jet, profiting from the sale of a self-referential cryptocurrency, auctioning off a chance to have dinner with him—all reflect his disregard for the Founders' concern.

Two of the Constitution's efforts to restrict conflicts of interest are direct and distinct prohibitions on profiteering by the president. One of these (in Article II, Section 1) was an absolute ban on domestic gifts to the president: Aside from compensation for his service, “he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.” Emolument, a word first recorded in the 15th century, signifies a “profit or gain arising from station, office, or employment.” That is, making money off one's position by, say, selling favors to fellow citizens (for example, the opportunity to dine with the president) is expressly prohibited.

Yair Rosenberg: The darker design behind Trump's $400 million plane

The second prohibition (in Article I, Section 9) was conditional. Presidents may not “accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State” without Congress's consent. In other words, the answer to the offer of a personal gift (such as the use of an airplane either during or after presidential service) is a constitutionally required “no,” unless Congress affirmatively authorizes it. Rejecting a gift is not “stupid,” as Trump suggested—it's required by the law of the land, and for good reason.

In addition to these direct limitations on presidential conduct, also notable is that the impeachment clause (Article II, Section 4), which generally authorizes impeachment for “high crimes and misdemeanors” names two (and only two) crimes specifically as grounds for impeachment: treason and bribery—receipt of a gift in exchange for an official act. Not all gifts are bribes, but some are, and those would be grounds for removal from office.

Beyond these three instances, the Constitution twice addresses the problem of possible profiteering by other federal officials, namely members of Congress: in Article I, Section 6 and in the Twenty-Seventh Amendment (which restricts Congress's ability to increase its own pay, and which was originally proposed in 1789).

What animated the Founders' fear of conflicts of interest? An understanding of human nature and a respect for history.

First they recognized that influence could be readily purchased from unprincipled leaders. As Alexander Hamilton put it in “Federalist No. 22”: “One of the weak sides of republics, among their numerous advantages, is that they afford too easy an inlet to foreign corruption.” Commenting on human nature, he went on to explain: “In republics, persons elevated from the mass of the community, by the suffrages of their fellow-citizens, to stations of great preeminence and power, may find compensations for betraying their trust, which to any but minds animated and guided by superior virtue, may appear to exceed the proportion of interest they have in the common stock, and to over-balance the obligations of duty.” In short, Hamilton argued, the average citizen might (unless he or she was a person of “superior virtue”) put their own financial interests above their duty to the country.

Jonathan Lemire and Russell Berman: The MAGA-world rift over Trump's Qatari jet

The requirement of congressional consent for foreign gifts persists today. When I served as a minor official at the Department of Homeland Security 20 years ago (I was the acting assistant secretary for international affairs and routinely interacted with foreign officials), any ceremonial gifts above a de minimis limit that foreign officials gave me as part of my official duties were, as constitutionally required, turned over to the department for receipt, processing, and storage. Congressional consent to keep a few small gifts was authorized by the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act.

Trump's proposed acceptance of the Qatari jet, which he plans to use after he leaves office, stems from his view that Qatar is a country “we have successfully defended for many years” with a “special royal family.” This sort of conflict of interest is precisely what the Founders feared. Americans cannot know now whether Qatari security continues to be in America's best interests or only in Trump's desire to please his “special” friends. That doubt is exactly why the Framers adopted a formal practice of requiring the notice and consent of Congress before foreign gifts may be accepted.

An unfortunate flaw in the Founders' design was that they anticipated ready compliance with the prohibition on gift receipt. I think they could have barely imagined a president accepting a personal gift without congressional consent despite the express words of the constitutional text. Nor could they have readily imagined a president soliciting personal benefits to himself or his family as a condition of access to and influence on his decision making.

Perhaps even more to the point, in the absence of such compliance, the Framers no doubt anticipated aggressive congressional oversight to enforce the obligations of consent, buttressed by the ultimate remedy of impeachment to compel compliance. And they might even have anticipated enforcement of the anti-emolument provisions in the courts. But Congress today is supine—this, perhaps more than anything, is what they could not possibly have imagined. And when, in the first Trump administration, emoluments cases were brought in the courts, they were delayed until after Trump left office and ultimately dismissed, leaving open questions of standing and substantive scope.

All of which puts the nation in an exceedingly uncomfortable place. The emoluments clauses were integral to how the Founders sought to constrain human nature, fearful as they were of self-interest triumphing over constitutional duty. But today, faced with a president who seemingly has no concern for constitutional limitations, the carefully crafted restrictions of the Constitution appear to be unenforceable; the courts are ineffective, and Congress doesn't seem to care. The Framers, one suspects, would weep.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Bad Bunny's sketch about what two Latino men are really saying about their girlfriends reveals what people often miss across cultural barriers.

There's a low-stakes thrill in eavesdropping on strangers from afar, especially if the exchange descends into chaos. Yet a sketch in last night's season finale of Saturday Night Live—which revolved around two couples at a bar boisterously fighting for a preferred table as two men watched nearby, whiskies in hand—raised the stakes of voyeurism in fascinating ways.

The sketch began with Ego Nwodim and Marcello Hernández's characters having glasses of wine at a bar; she was ready to move in after three weeks of dating, and he was sweatily trying to steer the conversation elsewhere. He got a break when another woman, played by this week's host, Scarlett Johanssen, insisted that their table belonged to her and her man—played by the musical guest, Bad Bunny. After Nwodim urged Hernández to defend her honor, he got in Bad Bunny's face—shouting “Ay!”—and they erupted in loud Spanish. But here's what he really said: “I'm sorry, but my woman is a pain in my ass!” Picking up on the stray mention of “culo,” Nwodim jumped in: “That's right, he's about to beat your ass!”

The table argument was a flimsy premise, but it established Johanssen's character as territorial and, crucially, inspiring terror in her paramour. Instead of demanding the table, Bad Bunny commiserated with Hernández: “Well mine too—and I'm afraid of her!” He looked back at Johanssen nervously, then confessed: “I know we're not supposed to say that women are crazy. But this one? She's crazy!” Hearing him say “loca,” Johanssen chirped up: “Do you hear that? He's gonna go loca on you!” Meanwhile, the eavesdropping barflies (played by Andrew Dismukes and James Austin Johnson) looked on with glee at what looked like a raging bar fight: “I feel like I'm watching a telenovela,” Johnson said, scratching his chin and practically licking his chops. Dismukes hoped it would end in a “slap and kiss”: “See, in their culture, the line between passion and violence is paper-thin.”

Johanssen's botched attempts at Spanish (“I'm about to asparagus nothing more and your ankle!”) made for good comedy, but the sketch's best work wasn't done by the peeved girlfriends or the barflies' misbegotten commentary. Instead, it lay in the gap between what these non-Spanish speakers were confidently reading into the situation, casting these men as macho Latino guys in some exotic melodrama, and what the men were actually saying. They were not only misunderstanding the words; they were missing the subtext. And so might have some viewers.

For those onlookers, the boyfriends were assuming archetypal roles that were completely at odds with how they actually felt, and their conversation deepened into a heart-to-heart between two strangers who didn't know how to quit a relationship they knew was bad for them. As the argument grew more heated between Nwodim and Johanssen, Bad Bunny reassured her: “Baby, baby, baby, you're talking about asparagus. Let me handle this.” He let out a little “heh”—in a moment that displayed his natural comedic timing. Instead of puffing his chest out, he went even deeper with Hernández: “Why do you think we have such bad luck in love?” he cried out. Hernández took the opportunity to confess a hard truth about himself, bellowing: “Honestly, I think I seek it out!”

In fact, the sketch was even more nuanced than non-Spanish-speaking SNL viewers could know, in part because of the live show's limitations. The terse subtitles elided the subtleties of Hernández and Bad Bunny's banter in Caribbean-inflected Spanish. (Hernández is Cuban and Dominican, and Bad Bunny is Puerto Rican.) When Hernández admitted that “in his heart, I think I want a woman who's off her rocker”—his literal phrase was “crazier than a coffee maker.” The subtitles neutered the sarcasm entirely, reading: “Because deep down I want a woman who is not mentally stable.” At other points, the subtitles arrived too late, for instance making Bad Bunny's expertly delivered lament—“Instead of thinking with our head, we think with the other one!”—land with a slightly awkward thud. Some parts of their dialogue weren't even translated, such as when Bad Bunny said: “I feel you, brother.”

The gag at the end was that no one got the table at all. Hernández and Bad Bunny agreed that there were some perks to their current circumstances, particularly in the bedroom. They cackled and bro-hugged, confusing Johanssen. “Why are you two laughing? What did you just say?” She didn't know what was going on after all, because just like the barflies, she thought she was watching a telenovela: A machista argument about honor resulting in blows and a triumphant return to their favorite two-top.

On the surface, this was just another SNL sketch about messed-up relationships and whether straight men are okay. But in its deliberate and inadvertent mistranslations, it also posed an intriguing question to its audience: How much truth can we really discern from a stranger we watch from across the distance of a bar table or a language barrier? Not much, it turns out.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

“Swallow your pride and make the first move,” one reader says.

This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Many analogies have been made of friendship—it's like shifting seasons, or a plant, or a really good bra—but I picture friendship most clearly as a house, jointly occupied. Each party agrees to perform their end of the upkeep, and the result is something shared that can last. But how friendships are maintained is a matter of personal preference. I recently asked The Atlantic's writers and editors to share the ways they stay in touch with people, and their responses included spontaneous phone calls, dog-park meetups, and being brave about watching horror films. So I turned the question to The Daily's readers too, who replied with their own accounts of how they care for their friends.

In many relationships, the first step is the hardest one to take. Fred Gregory, a retired Army medic who served in Afghanistan, wrote that after his “Army buddies spread to the four winds,” he realized that something—or somebody—had to give. “Men, in general, are terrible at maintaining friendships,” he noted. “Swallow your pride and make the first move, hooha.”

And sometimes, a reminder to reach out can come in the form of a cold shock. “A year ago, a dear college friend died suddenly while walking his dog. It was distressing we hadn't remained closer,” Scott King, 71, wrote from Bermuda. He committed to calling his friends more, “frequently while walking my small Schnauzer on the golf course. Hopefully, I won't meet the same fate.”

Consistency is key: Robert Rose, from West Virginia, goes out with his “group of old guy friends” to eat at a different locally owned restaurant each week. “We are MENSA,” he wrote: “Men Eating Nowhere Special Again.” Lori Walker, 58, praised the “pre-book” strategy, so that the next meetup date is set when everybody is already together. And once a month, Ella T., from Los Angeles, meets her British childhood friends on Zoom: “We begin with the ‘organ recital,' namely which anatomical parts need repair or have fallen off.” Then comes the “doom exchange” of politics and news updates, followed by a head count of their “mushrooming army of grandkids. Mostly, we giggle.”

Generational differences can be stark when it comes to communication; Denise P., 71, from Ohio, loves to make her own cards and receive handwritten letters from her friends and family, which is “a rarity nowadays.” Samyukta Reddy, 17, from India, observes that her friends usually rely on texting and sharing memes as a way to keep in touch, but she remains wistful for “the analog past” of a simple phone call. To bridge the gap, maybe all it takes is finding an activity that people can share: For one reader, it's playing “Jewdle,” a Jewish-word version of Wordle; for another reader, it's making custom buttons to hand out at protests. “We are ten strong,” ranging in age from 30s to 80s, Meg C., 81, wrote of her friend group. “Youth gives us rage and age gives us humor.”

A well-maintained friendship is a long-lasting one. And a long-lasting friendship can document life's many bends. Priscilla Newberger, 81, from Oregon, is part of a female class that made up a tiny percentage of MIT's graduates 60 years ago. They bonded over social isolation and the great difficulty of finding a bathroom on campus. Since the pandemic, a bunch of them have been gathering on video calls each month. “Some of these women I haven't seen in many years,” she wrote, “but we are friends forever.”

That same refrain runs through Rebecca Vara's story: At 46 years old, she has been friends with a group of women since the seventh grade. In high school, some boys started calling them the “Acorns,” and the name stuck. Their friendship “took deep roots, grew proud and strong, weathered seasons of joy, grief, drought and renewal; we've witnessed marriages, births, deaths of loved ones, divorce, all the things that make up a life,” Vara wrote. “34 years is a long time when you're only 46. There is great joy in knowing these incredible women will be in my life for the next 34 and beyond.”

America Is Having a Showboater Moment

By Jill Leovy

Over the dozen years I spent covering the police as a beat reporter in Los Angeles, I came to realize there are two kinds of officers: showboaters and real cops.

The showboaters strut around and talk tough. They think they know a lot but they don't. They get in your face when you turn up to cover a story and wax poetic about bad guys, knuckleheads, and gangsters. They praise blanket measures, crackdowns, sweeps. I had to learn how to get past them and find my way to the real cops, who tend to be quieter but know more.

They were sent to exploit foreign lands, but they were victims of exploitation themselves.

In September 1890, William Digance, the son of an impoverished farmer from Surrey, set off for Brazil to hunt orchids. Full of excitement and bravado, the 25-year-old assured his employer, “I mean to succeed.” But Digance struggled with the language and the amount of money everything cost; he found himself stranded by rising water and thunderstorms in the rainy season, overpowered by the heat, and repeatedly sick. In his letters, he protested that he'd been deceived by his employer's business manager, who'd assured him the trip would be “easy.” The man only said that, Digance wrote bitterly, because he hadn't visited Brazil himself. It was easy enough to travel in the capital or by rail, but the situation was quite different once one headed into the interior, “& everything has to be done with animals they are not English roads—it is a series of climbing up one mountain & down another through rivers & woods where one has to sometimes stop & cut a road. it is not very easy I can assure you.”  Six months after his departure, Digance was dead.

Plant hunting may conjure up images of bold Victorian explorers, intrepid grail seekers, and storied men of science—Joseph Banks, Charles Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace. Certainly, that is how plant hunters have been described in recent works, including a 2012 children's book, The Plant Hunters: True Stories of Their Daring Adventures to the Far Corners of the Earth. And that's how they were depicted in the Victorian age too. In illustrations, plant hunters are handsome mustached men wearing boots and plaid khaki pants as they venture into the tropical rainforests.

But this is only one slice of the story. The majority of plant hunters were not particularly fashionable or wealthy; they did not become members of the era's august natural-history societies. On the contrary, the men who answered newspaper job advertisements for “plant collectors” were generally poor and ill-educated. Many were barely literate. These plant hunters don't fit neatly into the archetypes that have come to dominate stories of colonial extraction. They were neither powerful imperialists nor dispossessed native people.

These men didn't write famous books, but they did leave records, though these documents were never intended to be published. Employers demanded detailed letters from their hunters—information on each area visited, plants found and their condition, numbers of boxes shipped and their transportation routes, and, most important, spying notes on rival hunters operating in the region.

On torn, faded pages, many bearing the imprint of a local hotel or railway station, hunters attempted to answer their employers' demands. Most letters were long ago destroyed, but a substantial archive is preserved at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, London. They are remarkable documents, a window into the lives of many plant hunters that would otherwise be lost to history.

The men emerging from these letters complicate how historians of the Victorian period think about the British Empire. For a long time, many have argued that the romanticized image Britain presents of itself—including the adventurous plant hunter in khakis—has been used to cover up the violence and hubris that characterized British colonization. We historians have studied the ways in which countries all over the world were robbed of their cultural treasures and natural riches—including orchids—as a result of colonial plunder. We have come to see colonizers as oppressors and colonized peoples as oppressed.

From the June 1919 issue: Orchid-hunting

But plant hunters are not easy to place in this dichotomy. They advanced imperial interests but gained little in the process. They were sent to exploit resources of a foreign land but were themselves victims of exploitation. They were not only tasked with bringing home the product but expected to be part of the product: Their stories of adventure contributed to orchids' commercial appeal.

According to the companies that employed them, plant hunters were men of “indefatigable zeal” who loved nothing more than danger. This was not what the hunters wrote.

Frederick Sander reached the peak of his career as a nursery owner in the final decades of the 19th century, a time when emerging middle classes in North America and Europe longed for “exotics.” Queen Victoria bestowed on Sander the honorific “Royal Orchid Grower,” and the Romanovs made him a Baron of the Holy Russian Empire. Sander's lavish nursery premises in St. Albans, outside London, were one of the wonders of Europe. After a visit, the orchidophile Frederick Boyle wrote in 1893:

Orchids everywhere! They hang in dense bunches from the roof. They lie a foot thick upon every board, and two feet thick below. They are suspended on the walls. Men pass incessantly along the gangways, carrying a load that would fill a barrow. And all the while fresh stores are accumulating under the hands of that little group in the middle, bent and busy at cases just arrived. They belong to a lot of eighty that came in from Burmah last night—and while we look on, a boy brings a telegram announcing fifty more from Mexico, that will reach Waterloo at 2.30pm.         

The letters of Sander & Co.'s hunters, however, reveal what it took to achieve “orchids everywhere.” On thousands of pages, dozens of collectors recount losses—of fragile orchids destroyed to prevent rival hunters from acquiring them, orchids trampled underfoot and discarded in frenzied scenes of collection, orchids dying en masse on the journey home in crates or freezing, the night before a sale, in the auction rooms. They also narrate their own losses: of health, money, possessions.

Sander was hugely demanding of his employees as hunters and as writers: He instructed Claes Ericsson, a Swedish hunter, to “write me longer letters.” Digance, whom Sander employed, wrote that he anticipated a “devil of a row for not writing oftener.” If Sander felt any sympathy for the hunters' struggles, he did not express it in the few of his own letters that survive. He used violent turns of phrase: “MOUTH SHUT!” he wrote once, and “If I'd got you here I would beat you until not a single patch of your skin was left unbruised.”

In an 1896 interview published in a magazine called Tit-Bits, Sander bragged of spending up to 3,000 pounds—more than half a million dollars in today's money—on each hunter every year. In truth, he spent about one-third of that, but that sum covered considerable traveling expenses. Sometimes, he simply refused to pay up in advance. “I would have sent you more 50 cases but got no money, so I'm going to put them on the rubbish heap tomorrow,” Ericsson wrote, after months of begging his employer to help him cover his hotel bills. “Now I'm so upset I can not write any more.”

Sander abandoned the plant hunters when they cost too much. Ericsson was deserted in Singapore without money for the trip home; a fellow hunter had to lend him the cash. When another, Louis Perthius, was abandoned in Brazil, his father, Léon, wrote letters to each of Sander's offices to excoriate the businessman for his cruelty. How was it even possible, Léon asked, that a man with his own family, a father, could treat another man's son this way; could risk a young man's life and sacrifice his youth to “enrich your establishment”?

Scholars today don't know whether or how Sander responded to these cries for help. Although most of Sander's letters were lost, presumably discarded abroad, his head office staffers annotated the letters they received, so that we can at least see what moved readers in London as they read. Vigorous underlinings indicate interest in new plants, new shipments, and the plans and actions of rival companies. Pleas for money to cover expenses and reports of disease outbreaks were, for the most part, left unmarked.

The Dutch collector Cornelius Oversluys started a letter in April 1893 in his usual, quite well-formed handwriting, only to start quaking as he succumbed to yellow fever. “The fever don't let me finish … I am all shaking,” he wrote, in frenzied and wobbly script. Digance, after a sequence of “colds” and attacks of “colic,” would die of “bilious fever” in Rio de Janeiro. A colleague, Bavarian Fritz Arnold, died after suffering stomach pain while collecting orchids near the Orinoco River. A fellow hunter itemized Arnold's possessions—a revolver, a watch, a suitcase, keys, and money—and notified Sander.

Rather than lamenting these losses, in media reports, Sander glamorized stories of his hunters' deaths. According to Sander, for example, Arnold's body was found not near but literally on the Orinoco River, in thrillingly mysterious circumstances: His corpse lay “in an open boat,” and “the cause of his death was never definitely known.” Sander told an interviewer that another of his hunters was burned to death by priests for blasphemy—a fate recalling that of the main character of Rudyard Kipling's short story “The Mark of the Beast.”

Eventually, British and European society began reckoning with some of the uglier aspects of its orchid mania—but this reckoning had nothing to do with labor conditions.

Critics began to point out that the abundance of orchids in Europe and North America meant they were disappearing from their natural habitats. “Not satisfied with taking 300 or 500 specimens of a fine Orchid, they must needs scour the whole country, and leave nothing for many miles around,” lamented Eduard Ortgies, the director of the Zurich botanical garden in 1877. “This is no longer collecting, it is wanton robbery.” The magazine The American Garden singled out Sander and one of his competitors, Siebrecht & Wadley, noting that their hunters were working to cut out the few orchids “still trembling in their tropic homes.”

Victorians all along the political spectrum worried about their obsession with things and accumulation. The packaged orchid had become, to quote contemporary Karl Marx, a “commodity.” Marx wrote about the ways in which commodities become detached from geographical and human origins, but the bit about the human origins didn't worry Victorian society as much. Perhaps Sander and other orchid sellers were so successful in painting a certain picture of plant hunters that the human cost of plant hunting, unlike the environmental one, never leaked to the press.

If anything, the hunters in Sander's sensationalized media reports became subjects of satire. The plot of the 1903 West End musical The Orchid, for instance, concerns a side-splitting hunt in Peru for the rare purple Cattleya—which could easily be found in Britain. That was a new problem with orchids: They became too common. The orchids went from precious exotic that cost the lives of so many working-class plant hunters to the mundane commodities they are today–that ubiquitous office gift, a couple of steps up from scented candles and boxed soap.

The plight of the hunters remained invisible. “Do not forget your Travellers in Brazil for the Bricks of St. Albans,” Ericsson begged Sander in March 1892. He understood that the company's successes, the spread of orchids across the windowsills of homes in rich countries of the world, were built on the sacrifices of expendable men like him.

Students are growing less religious. Many chaplains are adapting.

On May 24, 1961, the Yale University chaplain William Sloane Coffin Jr. led a group of Freedom Riders on a 160-mile bus ride from Atlanta, Georgia, to Montgomery, Alabama, to protest segregation laws. The voyage and his subsequent arrest turned Coffin into a national figure in the fight for civil rights. Yet even as he made headlines, Coffin remained committed to another, quieter aspect of his role as a college chaplain. Over the course of his 18 years at Yale, he spent virtually every afternoon counseling students. They discussed relationships, academic worries, theological questions, and—for those eligible—the prospect of being drafted into the Vietnam War. A priest first and foremost, he considered it “a great privilege” to enter what he called “the secret garden of another person's soul.”

Today, at a moment when young people are much less likely to say they're religious, you might think that the demand for college chaplains would be on the decline. But recent evidence suggests that the opposite is true. Although a 2022 report from the Public Religion Research Institute found that nearly 40 percent of young adults do not identify with any established religion, college students are actually attending religious-life programs in larger numbers than they have in decades, and many colleges and universities have more chaplains, some volunteer and some paid, than they did in the early 2000s, James W. Fraser, a professor emeritus of history and education at New York University and the author of the forthcoming book Religion and the American University, told me. Many of these chaplains are taking inspiration from Coffin: They're reimagining what a spiritual leader can be in order to better meet the needs and beliefs of their students—many of whom, religious or not, still crave a sense of belonging, meaning, and purpose.

For centuries, religion was central to American university life. Many colleges were established as divinity schools and led by presidents who doubled as ordained ministers, John Schmalzbauer, a religious-studies professor at Missouri State University who studies chaplaincy and campus ministry, told me. But in the early 20th century, a great number of those institutions began shifting their focus from ministry to research, and college presidents started to devote less of their time to spiritual life. In their place, universities hired chaplains to preside over daily chapel services and offer moral guidance to students.

Read: Religious education and the meaning of life

The shape of the college chaplaincy transformed multiple times over the next several decades—first during the Coffin era, when it became a platform from which to advocate for social justice; and again in the late 1970s and '80s, when the social movements of the '60s lost steam, academic communities became significantly less religious, and the college chaplaincy shed some of its previous status.

Modern college chaplains, deans, and directors of religious life have taken on a new grab bag of duties. In addition to leading forms of worship and talking with students about their faith, as they always have, many chaplains also help students navigate housing insecurity, safety threats, and campus protests. Although the position was once thought of as a “defined pot,” Kirstin Boswell, Elon University's chaplain and dean of multifaith engagement, told me, it is now more an interdisciplinary “web.” The chaplains themselves are also much more diverse. Whereas the chaplaincy was once dominated by white Christian men, many today are women or people of color, and they come from a range of religious traditions. Of the 471 chaplains recently surveyed by the Association for Chaplaincy and Spiritual Life in Higher Education (ACSLHE)—the nation's largest membership organization for university chaplains, directors, and deans of religious and spiritual life—6 percent said they don't identify with a major religion, and 2 percent said they don't believe in God at all.

Chaplains' primary work is still counseling students, but many approach these conversations with more openness than their predecessors did. Reporting this story, I spoke with about a dozen college chaplains and campus-ministry experts across the country, several of whom sit on ACSLHE's board. Citing their own experiences, which are backed up by a robust body of research, they explained that most modern-day chaplains both engage with established religious practices and embrace alternative forms of spirituality or self-care, which can be as varied as coloring sessions, friendship courses, and nature walks. Some students might see “the religious center as a place where someone would try to convert them,” Vanessa Gomez Brake, the senior associate dean of religious life at the University of Southern California and the first atheist-humanist to occupy that position at a major American university, told me. But chaplains today tend to draw from a range of texts and traditions, rather than proselytizing their own beliefs.

For less-religious students, some of their first conversations about spiritual matters may be with chaplains. At a stage of life when they are figuring out who they are and what they believe, many undergrads are likely to find themselves in a “hardwired body, mind, and soul spiritual growth spurt,” Lisa Miller, a clinical psychologist and the founder of the Spirituality Mind Body Institute at Columbia University, told me. Although religion is by no means necessary for navigating this growth spurt, it has historically served as a helpful starting point for many students. Until relatively recently, most American families were religious to some degree, which fostered “a de facto spiritual life in the air and water of our culture,” Miller explained. Regardless of their own religious beliefs, many teens used to arrive on campus with a “backpack of spiritual and religious practices.” Today, many show up having never prayed.

Read: When faith comes up, students avert their eyes

Perhaps because of students' lack of exposure, contemporary college chaplains say they “have never felt more needed,” Schmalzbauer, of Missouri State, told me. Having devoted their lives to service and existential inquiry, chaplains can be well positioned to advise religious devotees, the spiritually curious, or just the average young person beset by angst. Their guidance might help undergrads as they sort through any number of uncertainties, whether about God, school, friendships, romance, family, or their undecided futures. “Students need someone who will hear them, who will sit with them, who will be present with them, and who won't be on their phones in front of them,” Nathan Albert, ACSLHE's board president and the chaplain at the University of Lynchburg, told me.

Of course, the help college students need is sometimes beyond what chaplains are trained to provide. Recent data show that Gen Z is, by some measures, the loneliest generation in the United States, and that rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation on university campuses are at a peak. “These kids achieve to very high levels, they jump through the hoops, they get to college, and then they're left wondering what it's all for,” Jennifer Breheny Wallace, the author of Never Enough: When Achievement Culture Becomes Toxic—And What We Can Do About It, told me. Universities aren't blind to the pressures students are under, and many have made student wellness a priority. This may be one reason more schools are investing in religious and spiritual life, Schmalzbauer, NYU's Fraser, and others told me.

But crucially, as Schmalzbauer explained, pastoral care is not the same thing as psychological counseling. Chaplains can occasionally end up in tough spots, particularly as demand for mental-health care has outpaced the supply of therapists and psychiatrists on college campuses. Varun Soni, the dean of religious life at USC, told me that most of his students are dealing with routine anxieties, which he feels comfortable talking through. Yet he also meets with some students experiencing depression and suicidal ideation. For these more serious cases, Soni and his colleagues work closely with the university's mental-health center and even walk students to a counselor's door themselves.

This isn't to say that chaplains don't have a role to play in improving student health and well-being. Research from Columbia University's Miller and others has found that spiritual development is associated with protection against depression and substance abuse, and with setting young adults up for healthier relationships, more purposeful work, and greater emotional resilience. In recent years, some schools have paired chaplains with therapists and counselors to provide “preventative mental health care,” Wendy Cadge, the president of Bryn Mawr College and founder of the Chaplaincy Innovation Lab, told me.

Yet, unlike mental-health professionals, the chaplain's goal is not to treat students, but rather to help them find community, meaning, and a reprieve from the grind. “People want to feel loved for who they are and not what they do,” Chaz Lattimore Howard, the university chaplain and vice president for social equity and community at the University of Pennsylvania, told me. Whether or not they believe in God, they “want to be reassured that it's going to be okay.” In a world where so much may not seem okay, college chaplains say they can help students—not via certainty or quick fixes, but as Coffin once did: by tending to their inner lives.

Presidential emergency declarations mean emergency powers — and a way around Congress.

by  Amanda Lewellyn and  Noel King

President Donald Trump has made a habit of declaring emergencies. 

Since he took office for his second term, Trump has issued declarations of emergency at the southern border. On energy and trade. About drug trafficking and cartels, and even the International Criminal Court. In all, he's declared eight emergencies in his first 100 days, a rate that far outstrips any previous president, including his own first term. 

It's unclear whether all these things meet the legal standard for an “emergency” — a situation so unusual and extraordinary that it can't wait for congressional action. The US trade deficit with China, for instance, has been the status quo for decades. But by declaring it an emergency, Trump unlocks special authorities that wouldn't otherwise be available to him. 

The question of whether Trump can use his emergency powers this way is currently making its way through the courts, and our colleague Ian Millhiser has been following along as proceedings kicked off in the Court of International Trade. 

In the meantime, we at Today, Explained wanted to understand why Trump is so keen to tap these powers to achieve his agenda, so we called up Elizabeth Goitein. She's a senior director at the Brennan Center for Justice and an expert on presidential emergency powers. 

Goitein spoke with Today, Explained co-host Noel King about the history of national emergencies, what Trump can do with his powers, and whether Congress should do something about it. An excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts and Spotify.

I don't think most Americans feel like we're living in a time of eight distinct emergencies that we weren't living in six months ago. Why does the president do this? 

A national emergency declaration is an extraordinarily powerful thing. It unlocks enhanced powers that are contained in 150 different provisions of law, all of which say something like, “In a national emergency, the president can do X,” or, ”In a national emergency, the president doesn't have to do Y.” These are powers that allow the president to take actions that go beyond what Congress has authorized in nonemergency situations. In some cases, they allow him to take actions that Congress has expressly prohibited in nonemergency situations. 

This can be a very tempting tool in order to implement policy in situations where there's not sufficient support from Congress or where Congress has actually prohibited that policy. You can see why the temptation is there for presidents to use these powers rather than go through the normal policy-making and law-making process.

President Trump sometimes behaves as if the emergency powers were granted by God, but actually what you're saying is: They come from Congress. This is Congress saying, “We will allow you to have additional power in times of emergency.” When and why did Congress initially do this? 

Congress has been providing these powers to the president since the founding. 

Our current system, in which the president declares a national emergency, and that declaration unlocks powers that are included in other statutes, dates back to World War I. This system where Congress would talk about national emergencies and then the president started issuing declarations of national emergency evolved organically. In fact, the organic nature of it turned out to be a problem, because there was no overarching law that governed the process. There was no time limit on how long an emergency could stay in place. There was no reporting to Congress. 

This is why Congress, in the 1970s, enacted the National Emergencies Act. It placed a time limit on how long an emergency declaration could stay in place without being renewed by the president. The NEA also, as originally enacted, gave Congress the power to terminate an emergency declaration using a legislative veto. That's a law that goes into effect with a simple majority of both houses of Congress and without the president's signature. That was a ready means for Congress to shut down an emergency declaration that was either inappropriate or was lasting too long. 

But then in 1983, the Supreme Court held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional. So today, if Congress wants to terminate an emergency declaration, it basically has to pass a law by a veto-proof supermajority, which is next to impossible in today's political climate. 

How far can the president go with emergency powers? What kinds of things could he do? 

If you look at these 150 powers that are at the president's disposal in a national emergency, a lot of them really do seem reasonable on their face. They seem measured, something that you would want and expect the president to have. 

But others seem like the stuff of authoritarian regimes. There is a law that dates back to 1942 that allows the president to take over or shut down communications facilities. This was last invoked in World War II. Today, it could arguably be used to assert control over US-based internet traffic. 

There's another law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, that allows the president to freeze the assets of almost anyone, including a US person, if the president deems it necessary to address a foreign or partially foreign threat. 

In fact, the president can also make it illegal for anyone to engage in any financial transactions with that person, including something as simple as renting them an apartment or giving them a job or even selling them groceries. So these are some really alarming authorities in terms of the potential for abuse.

You've laid out why granting some of these powers does make sense in times of emergency. Some of them, though, seem like a lot of power. Donald Trump is a highly unusual American president. Is it possible that Congress made a mistake in assuming that every American president would be like the guy who came before?

Yes. Congress made a mistake. 

To be fair, Congress did give itself a ready means of terminating emergency declarations, and Congress did not foresee that the Supreme Court was going to take that off the table. 

However, I think it was a mistake to leave the law in place as it was without that safeguard. I think it is time — past time — for a reckoning for Congress, to not only reform the process of national emergency declarations and the termination of those declarations, but also to look at some of these individual powers like the Communications Act, which allows the president to take over or shut down communications facilities, and the power over domestic transportation. Congress should put some limits and safeguards on those powers.

Pope Leo XIV, history's first American pope, vowed Sunday to work for unity so that the Catholic Church becomes a sign of peace in the world, offering a message of communion during an inaugural Mass in St. Peter's Square before tens of thousands of people, presidents, patriarchs and princes.

Leo officially opened his pontificate by taking his first popemobile tour through the piazza, a rite of passage that has become synonymous with the papacy's global reach and mediatic draw. The 69-year-old Augustinian missionary smiled and waved from the back of the truck, but didn't appear to stop to kiss babies and the crowd.

During the Mass, Leo appeared to choke up when the two potent symbols of the papacy were placed on him — the pallium woolen stole over his shoulders and the fisherman's ring on his finger — as if the weight of responsibility of leading the 1.4-billion strong church had just sunk in.

He turned his hand to look at the ring and seal and then clasped his hands in front of him in prayer.

Security was tight as civil protection crews in neon uniforms funneled pilgrims into quadrants in the piazza and up and down the boulevard that leads to it for the ceremony blending ancient ritual, evocative symbols and a dose of modern-day celebrity.

U.S. Vice President JD Vance, one of the last foreign officials to see Pope Francis before he died, led the U.S. delegation honoring the Chicago-born Leo after paying his respects at the Argentine pope's tomb upon arriving in Rome late Saturday.

In his homily, Leo said he wanted to be a servant to the faithful through the two dimensions of the papacy, love and unity, so that the church could be a force for peace in the world.

""I would like that our first great desire be for a united church, a sign of unity and communion, which becomes a leaven for a reconciled world,"" he said. ""In this our time, we still see too much discord, too many wounds caused by hatred, violence, prejudice, the fear of difference, and an economic paradigm that exploits the Earth's resources and marginalises the poorest.""

His call for unity was significant, given the polarization in the Catholic Church in the United States and beyond.

Francis' radical 12-year pontificate, which emphasized care for the poor and marginalized and disdain for the capitalist economic system, often alienated conservatives and traditionalists. Leo's May 8 election, after a remarkably quick 24-hour conclave, has appeared at the outset to have pleased conservative Catholics who seem to appreciate his more disciplined, traditional style and Augustinian background, emphasizing core truths of Catholic doctrine.

""Let us build a church founded on God's love, a sign of unity, a missionary church that opens its arms to the world, proclaims the word, allows itself to be made restless by history, and becomes a leaven of harmony for humanity,"" he said, referencing some of the themes of Francis' pontificate as well.

Strict diplomatic protocol dictated the seating arrangements at his inaugural Mass, with both the United States and Peru getting front-row seats thanks to Leo's dual citizenship. Vance, a Catholic convert who tangled with Francis over the Trump administration's mass migrant deportation plans, is being joined by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who arrived in Rome ahead of time to try to advance Russia-Ukraine peace talks.

Peruvian President Dina Boluarte is one of around a dozen heads of state attending, as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Russia is being represented by the culture minister, Olga Liubimova.

Diplomatic protocol also dictated the dress code: While most wore black, the handful of Catholic queens and princesses — Charlene of Monaco and Letizia of Spain among others — wore white in a special privilege allowed them. Three dozen of the world's other Christian churches sent their own delegations, the Jewish community had a 13-member delegation, half of them rabbis. Other representatives headed Buddhist, Muslim, Zoroastrian, Hindu, Sikh and Jain delegations.

Security was tight, as it was for Francis' funeral on April 26, which drew an estimated 250,000 people. Rome authorities are planning for another 250,000 on Sunday. The piazza and main boulevard leading to it, and two nearby piazzas were set up with giant television screens, and dozens of portable toilets have been erected in a nearby park.

U.S. seminarian Ethan Menning, 21, from Omaha, Nebraska, wrapped himself in an American flag, purchased at a truck stop in Iowa, to celebrate.

""Rome always felt like home for a Catholic, but now coming here and seeing one of our own on the throne of Peter ... it almost makes Jesus himself more accessible,"" he said.

Kalen Hill, a pilgrim from the U.S., got to St. Peter's soon after the gates opened at dawn Sunday morning and said he never expected an American would lead the 1.4-billion strong church.

""I would say all the Americans are emotional about it,"" he said. ""It is really powerful for American Catholics who sometimes feel separated from the world church to be brought in and included in this community through Pope Leo.""

The two symbols of the papacy handed to Leo were the pallium, and the fisherman's ring. The pallium, draped across his shoulders, symbolizes the pastor carrying his flock as the pope carries the faithful. The ring, which becomes Leo's official seal, harks back to Jesus' call to the apostle Peter to cast his fishing nets.

The other symbolically important moment of the Mass was the representational rite of obedience to Leo: Whereas in the past all cardinals would vow obedience to the new pope, more recent papal installations involve representatives of cardinals, bishops, priests, deacons, nuns, married couples and young people participating in the rite.

Gregory and Susan Hudak, who lived for 40 years in the Chicago area, found themselves in Rome after booking a trip in February, with just a faint hope of perhaps glimpsing the pope. Seeing the popemobile pass by in front of them, with the Chicago-born Leo on board, was even better than watching Michael Jordan play, said Gary Hudak, a former altar boy wearing a Chicago Bears hat.

""Originally, the only hope I had coming here was to see the inside of the Sistine Chapel,"" he said. ""Seeing the pope was not scheduled, it was a long shot hope. And this was a treasure, simple as that.""

China on Sunday announced anti-dumping duties as high as 74.9% on imports of POM copolymers, a type of engineering plastic, from the United States, the European Union, Japan and Taiwan.

The commerce ministry's findings conclude a probe launched in May 2024, shortly after the U.S. sharply increased tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, computer chips and other imports.

POM copolymers can partially replace metals such as copper and zinc and have various applications including in auto parts, electronics and medical equipment, the ministry has said.

In January, the ministry said initial investigations had determined that dumping was taking place, and implemented preliminary anti-dumping measures in the form of a deposit starting from January 24.

According to Sunday's announcement, the highest anti-dumping rates of 74.9% were levied on imports from the United States, while European shipments will face 34.5% duties.

China slapped 35.5% duties on Japanese imports, except for Asahi Kasei Corp, which received a company-specific rate of 24.5%.

General duties of 32.6% were placed on imports from Taiwan, while Formosa Plastics received a 4% tariff and Polyplastics Taiwan 3.8%.

Hopes have risen that the U.S.-China trade war is easing after the two sides said on Monday they had agreed to slash reciprocal tariffs in a 90-day truce, a deal that state mouthpiece the Global Times said on Friday should be extended.

The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group of nations warned of ""fundamental challenges"" facing the global trading system in a communique on Friday after a meeting in South Korea.

With President Donald Trump's private dinner for top meme coin holders less than a week away, the leaderboard is awash with crypto wallets that are effectively anonymous.

On May 22, the top 220 $TRUMP holders are invited to a dinner with the president at his Virginia golf club outside of Washington, D.C. The event was announced last month, and the tally closed Monday night.

The nature of the pseudonymous wallets raises questions about the true identities and motivations of the token's largest holders, who have bought a seat at the table with a U.S. president.

Documents from blockchain analytics firm Inca Digital that were reviewed by CNBC show where the top 275 $TRUMP token holders send and receive the token. Many are heavily tied to international exchanges like Binance that don't service U.S. customers, an indication that they're likely not U.S. citizens.

An analysis by Bloomberg revealed that 19 of the top 25 wallets are almost certainly owned by individuals operating outside the U.S.

Justin Sun, who openly shared that he bought $75 million worth of the Trump family's World Liberty Financial token — a digital coin where 75% of proceeds go to Trump-related entities — is believed to be at the top of the $TRUMP meme token leaderboard.

Sun, who was born in China, is the crypto entrepreneur behind the Tron blockchain and is in talks with the SEC to resolve civil fraud charges.

A wallet called Sun currently holds more than $18 million worth of $TRUMP, with $4.5 million bought after the dinner contest announcement, according to Bloomberg.

Multiple reports point to the wallet being tied to the Tron founder. A representative for Sun didn't respond to CNBC's request for comment or confirm whether Sun is the wallet owner.

MemeCore, a Singapore-based crypto network that was vocal in its quest to secure a spot at the Trump dinner, landed in second place with an investment of $18 million. An Australian crypto entrepreneur also reportedly made the cut.

The leaderboard points to the token's extreme volatility.

Inca Digital told CNBC that while 560,376 wallets have made a combined $5.2 billion in realized gains on the $TRUMP token, an even larger number — 592,962 wallets — have collectively lost $3.9 billion.

The figures underscore the massive wealth transfer within Trump's crypto ecosystem, where early buyers have seen windfalls while the majority have suffered losses.

Chainalysis and Elliptic, two leading blockchain analytics firms, initially tracked $TRUMP token movements and trading fees. But days after CNBC published a story on the number of crypto wallets that had lost money on the meme coin, the firms said they were too busy with existing clients to continue blockchain analysis of the president's self-branded meme token.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., the ranking member of the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations, warned that the Trump family's growing crypto holdings may serve as a backdoor for foreign and corporate interests seeking access to the president.

Freight Technologies, a Houston-based logistics firm that trades on the Nasdaq and has a market cap of just over $2.3 million, bought $2 million worth of the $TRUMP tokens to influence U.S.-Mexico trade policy, according to a release. CEO Javier Selgas described the move as a strategic push to ""champion fair and free trade"" across the U.S.-Mexico border.

Freight Technologies finished in 250th place, missing the cut for the dinner.

The $TRUMP token, 80% of which is controlled by the Trump Organization and affiliated entities, has become the centerpiece of Trump's expanding crypto empire.

The meme coin debuted in January just ahead of the inauguration and soared to a $15 billion market cap almost instantly, fueled by President Trump's posts on Truth Social and X declaring, ""It's time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!""

But within days, the token lost most of its value. A brief revival in April saw it surge 50% on news of the dinner, pushing its market cap to $2.7 billion, before it again dropped.

The White House told CNBC that Trump's assets are held in a trust managed by his children, and there are ""no conflicts of interest.""

Former Vice President Mike Pence said Sunday that President Donald Trump should turn down the gift of a $400 million jet from the royal family of Qatar, citing national security concerns.

""Qatar has a long history of playing both sides,"" Pence said in an interview with NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""The very idea that we would accept an Air Force One from Qatar I think is inconsistent with our security, with our intelligence needs ... I think it's just a bad idea, and my hope is the president will think better of it.""

Trump's plan to accept the lavish Qatari jumbo jet, a Boeing 747-8, and convert it to be used as Air Force One has sparked fierce controversy over the legality, ethics and national security implications of what would be the largest foreign gift ever received by the U.S. government.

Trump previously said any acceptance of the aircraft would be due to delays at U.S. manufacturer Boeing.

""There are profound issues, the potential for intelligence gathering, the need to ensure the president of the United States is safe and secure as he travels around the world,"" Pence said. ""My hope is the president reconsiders it. I think if Qatar wants to make a gift to the United States, they ought to take that $400 million and plow it into infrastructure on our military base.""

Experts have warned that converting such a jet into Air Force One could take years to complete and could cost U.S. taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars over time, NBC previously reported. 

Trump said the plane will be formally given to the U.S. Department of Defense. Once Trump ends his second term as president, the ownership of the gift is expected to be transferred to the Trump presidential library foundation. By doing so, the palatial jet would never be owned personally by Trump.

""This highly respected country is donating the plane to the United States Air Force/ Defense Department, AND NOT TO ME,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social Sunday. ""By so doing, they are saving our country, and the American Taxpayer, hundreds of millions of dollars.""

At least five companies from mainland China or Hong Kong are planning IPOs, dual listings, or share placements in Singapore in the next 12 to 18 months, four sources said, as Chinese firms look to expand in Southeast Asia amid global trade tensions.

The companies include a Chinese energy company, a Chinese healthcare group, and a Shanghai-based biotech group, said the sources, who have direct knowledge of the matter, but declined to be named or to name the firms as the plans are not finalised.

The listings would give a boost to Singapore Exchange Ltd (SGX),which, despite being a popular venue for yield plays such as real estate investment trusts, has been struggling to attract mega listings and bolster trading volumes.

SGX hosted just four initial public offerings in 2024, according to its website. That compares with 71 new company listings recorded by its rival regional bourse Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. 

Chinese companies are looking to tap the Singaporean bourse as they look to enter, or expand business in, Southeast Asia amid a trade war with the United States, Jason Saw, investment banking group head at CGS International Securities, said.

U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 145% on imports of Chinese goods, and China in turn raised tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%, before the two sides agreed a 90-day pause last weekend. But uncertainty remains, given the time limit and the Trump administration's unpredictability.

Enquiries about listings on SGX ""shot through the roof"" after Trump ramped up his trade actions against China, Saw said.

""For the next years and decades, gateways from China to the world are going to be more important,"" said Pol de Win, senior managing director and head of global sales and origination at SGX.

""Singapore is an important gateway, whether it's trade (or) business activity from China to the outside world, and a listing in Singapore is an important component of that."" De Win did not mention the listing plans of the Chinese and Hong Kong firms.

CGS International, a unit of state-owned brokerage China Galaxy Securities, is working with at least two China-based companies to list on the SGX as early as this year, according to Saw. He declined to name the companies.

Some of the mainland Chinese and Hong Kong companies could raise around $100 million via primary listings in Singapore, said one of the sources. 

SGX is usually not the first choice for Chinese companies eyeing an offshore market debut. Most of them prefer Hong Kong due to Beijing's support and a large pool of institutional and retail investors more familiar with Chinese brands.

Beijing's efforts to boost ties with Southeast Asia, amid escalating tension with Washington, have, however, encouraged some Chinese companies to increase their presence in the region, capital market advisers said. 

The listing plans in Singapore come after the city-state in February announced measures to strengthen its equities market, which included a 20% tax rebate for primary listings, and vowed to unveil a next set of measures in the second half of 2025.

The initiatives are set to boost interest in the local IPO market, said Ringo Choi, EY's Asia Pacific IPO Leader, adding that Singapore's ""political stability and neutral stance"" on geopolitical matters should appeal to companies.

Not many, however, see Singapore closing its gap with Hong Kong in equity listings in the near future, due to factors including Singapore's relatively conservative investors and stricter listing requirements.

""You need to make it easier for companies, especially technology companies, to list,"" said the managing director of a Singapore-based multinational software company, who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

""Most of the startups in the region are headquartered in Singapore, so this should be the place they list.""

Poles vote on Sunday in a presidential election that will decide whether Warsaw follows the pro-European path set by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, or takes a step towards bringing back nationalist admirers of U.S. President Donald Trump.

Trump's return to power has energised eurosceptics across Europe, and Sunday's ballot will be the sternest test of Tusk's pro-European vision since he came to power in 2023, ousting the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party.

The election pits Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, from Tusk's Civic Coalition (KO), against conservative historian Karol Nawrocki, who is backed by PiS.

Trzaskowski has been cast as the frontrunner, likely to face Nawrocki in a run-off, due on June 1 if no candidate wins over 50%. Media blackout laws forbid the publication of opinion poll results from Saturday morning until voting ends on Sunday.

Also competing are far-right candidate Slawomir Mentzen from the Confederation party, Parliament Speaker Szymon Holownia of the centre-right Poland 2050 and Magdalena Biejat from the Left.

The Polish first round vote takes place on the same day as a second round presidential run-off in Romania, where George Simion, a nationalist who campaigns to ""Make Romania Great Again"", faces centrist Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan.

A victory for two eurosceptic candidates would send shockwaves through the EU at a time when it is grappling with the twin challenges of Russia's invasion of Poland's eastern neighbour Ukraine and Trump's tariffs.

Polls in Poland open at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT) and close at 9 p.m. Around 29 million people are eligible to vote.

The Polish president has limited executive powers but can veto legislation. That has allowed outgoing President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, to stymie efforts by Tusk to undo judicial changes put in place under the PiS, which Tusk says hamper democracy.

Trzaskowski has pledged to cement Poland's role as a major player at the heart of European policymaking and work with the government to roll back PiS's judicial changes.

""I would definitely strengthen relations with our partners... within NATO and the EU,"" he told state broadcaster TVP Info on Friday. ""I will also ask lawmakers to give me the bills Duda vetoed to sign... I also hope that we will end the chaos in the justice system that PiS left us.""

Nawrocki's campaign was rocked by allegations, which he denies, that he deceived an elderly man into selling him a flat in return for a promise of care he did not provide. But Trump showed support by meeting Nawrocki in the White House.

Nawrocki casts the election as a chance to stop Tusk achieving unchecked power and push back against liberal values represented by Trzaskowski, who as Warsaw mayor patronised LGBT marches and took down Christian crosses from public buildings.

""The cross that my opponent took down in Warsaw... 1,000 years of heritage of the Polish state, is our strength, is our energy,"" he told a rally in the eastern city of Lublin.

Unlike some other eurosceptics in central Europe, Nawrocki supports military aid to help Ukraine fend off Russia. However, he has tapped into anti-Ukrainian sentiment among some Poles weary of an influx of refugees from their neighbour. 

He has said Polish citizens should get priority in public services and criticised Kyiv's attitude to exhumations of the remains of Poles killed by Ukrainian nationalists during World War Two.

Bitcoin's BTC$105,580.48 price chart is echoing a bullish pattern that foreshadowed the late 2024 price surge from $70,000 to $100,000 amid mounting concerns over the sustainability of the U.S. debt.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value appears on track to confirm a ""golden cross"" in the coming days, according to charting platform TradingView. The pattern occurs when the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of prices crosses above the 200-day SMA to suggest that the short-term trend is outperforming the broader trend, with the potential to evolve into a major bull run.

The moving average-based golden cross has a mixed record of predicting price trends. The impending one, however, is worth noting because it's about to occur weeks after its ominous-sounding opposite, the death cross, trapped bears on the wrong side of the market.

A similar pattern unfolded from August through September 2024, setting the stage for a convincing move above $70,000 in early November. Prices eventually set a record high above $109K in January this year.

The chart on the left shows that BTC bottomed out at around $50,000 in early August last year as the 50-day SMA moved below the 200-day SMA to confirm the death cross.

In other words, the death cross was a bear trap, much like the one in early April this year. Prices turned higher in subsequent weeks, eventually beginning a new uptrend after the appearance of the golden cross in late October 2024.

The bullish sequence is being repeated since early April, and prices could begin the next leg higher following the confirmation of the golden cross in the coming days.

Past performance does not guarantee future results, and technical patterns do not always deliver as expected. That said, macro factors seem aligned with the bullish technical setup.

On Friday, credit rating agency Moody's downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating from the highest ”Aaa” to ”Aa1”, citing concerns over the increasing national debt, which has now reached $36 trillion.

The bond market has been pricing fiscal concerns for some time. Last week, CoinDesk detailed how persistent elevated Treasury yields reflected expectations for continued fiscal splurge and sovereign risk premium, both bullish for bitcoin.

One important technical sign just popped up on the XRP/BTC daily chart, showing that XRP is losing ground to Bitcoin. It looks like a death cross has formed — that's when a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term one — and it might be setting the stage for more weakness.

To be more specific, if you look at the 23-day moving average, it is now below the 200-day average. When this happens, it's often seen as a sign that the asset's momentum is slowing and might be losing steam. In this case, XRP appears to be taking a backseat to Bitcoin, and the chart is showing that shift.

At the same time, XRP/BTC hit resistance with the middle line of the Bollinger Bands. Market price usually balances at this level, but in this case, XRP hasn't managed to break through it. Such a rejection adds to the sense that the pair is stuck below key levels, and XRP may struggle to gain ground anytime soon.

Examining the recent volume, it's clear that there hasn't been a meaningful increase to justify a bullish reversal. Following the rally earlier this month, price action has cooled off, with candles clustering just above short-term support.

None of these two developments — the moving average crossover or the failure at mid-band resistance — point to an immediate breakdown. But they do suggest that XRP is growing weaker against Bitcoin.

Once again, the next few trading sessions will be important. For the outlook to favor XRP over Bitcoin, there needs to be a push back above resistance. If not, the current trend will continue to favor the leading cryptocurrency in this pairing.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","‘Bitcoin Standard' author backs funding dev to make spamming Bitcoin costly","https://cointelegraph.com/news/saifedean-ammous-funds-dev-to-fight-bitcoin-spam","Sun, 18 May 2025 09:41:59 GMT","

 Saifedean Ammous says he would “throw in a few sats” to fund a developer dedicated to making Bitcoin spam more costly. 

Economist and author of The Bitcoin Standard, Saifedean Ammous, has weighed in on the ongoing debate over spam inscriptions on the Bitcoin network, suggesting he would “throw in a few sats” to fund a full-time developer focused on making Bitcoin spamming more difficult and expensive.

Ammous made the remarks in response to a thread initiated by the pseudonymous developer GrassFedBitcoin, who called for Bitcoin Core to merge pull request #28408, which would enable node operators to filter inscriptions more easily.

According to GrassFedBitcoin, the lack of inscription filtering tools contributes to unnecessary blockchain bloat and undermines Bitcoin (BTC)'s role as a monetary protocol.

“No one running a node wants to relay inscriptions,” he wrote, arguing that the OP_RETURN limit increases were justified in the past under false assumptions. He pushed for a configurable, default policy discouraging the use of Bitcoin for storing JPEGs rather than monetary data.

Blockstream CEO Adam Back challenged the proposal, describing inscription filtering as an “arms race.” He noted that spam data embedded in Bitcoin transactions can be endlessly modified using code structures, requiring constant updates to filtering tools.

Ammous compared the Bitcoin spam issue to email spam — another arms race society continues to fight without abandoning the system.

“It's not easy, but it's worth trying to help bankrupt the spammers faster,” Ammous said. He argued that fighting spam is not censorship, noting that node operators already reject invalid transactions.

The debate drew commentary from other users. One participant suggested Core developers treat spam-coding employees at certain startups as “unwilling QA engineers” and simply unstandardize every trick they deploy.

Ammous took it further, proposing to “deprecate” the work of developers building spam tools and even hiring outside coders to overwhelm their systems.

The conversation reflects ongoing tensions in the Bitcoin community over the network's intended use. With inscriptions continuing to congest the network, calls for technical countermeasures — and pointed critiques of those defending spam — are growing louder.

In a Feb. 4 report, Mempool Research said the adoption of inscriptions could drive the Bitcoin network's average block size as high as 4 megabytes (MB) per block, far higher than current averages.

Bitcoin's average block size — the amount of data in each block posted to the network's public ledger — is currently around 1.5 MB.

Ethereum (ETH) is up more than 58% in the last 30 days, with nearly 40% of that surge happening in just the past 10 days. Despite this sharp rally, several key indicators are starting to flash caution. 

BBTrend has turned negative, whale accumulation is declining, and short-term EMA momentum is stalling. These signals suggest Ethereum may be approaching a critical point where renewed buying pressure is needed to sustain its uptrend—or risk a potential reversal.

Ethereum's BBTrend has just dipped into negative territory, now sitting at -0.02 after maintaining a positive trend for about seven consecutive days. 

This shift follows a strong peak of 28.39 on May 12, signaling the end of the bullish phase. 

The move below zero comes after Ethereum surged 58.5% over the past month, raising questions about whether the asset is entering a consolidation period or facing early signs of a pullback.

The BBTrend, or Bollinger Band Trend, measures price momentum relative to volatility by assessing how far price moves deviate from their average within the Bollinger Bands. 

When BBTrend values are positive, it generally indicates bullish momentum, while negative values suggest the market may be losing strength or entering a bearish phase. 

With ETH's BBTrend now slightly below zero, it may signal waning buying pressure after the recent rally. If this trend continues downward, Ethereum's price could stall or retrace as traders shift to a more cautious stance.

Ethereum whale activity is showing signs of decline after weeks of stability. Addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH—classified as Ethereum whales—had remained above 5,440 since mid-April, reaching 5,463 on May 8. 

However, over the past 10 days, this number has been gradually falling, despite minor fluctuations. 

As of now, it sits at 5,393, marking the first time it has dipped below 5,400 since April 9—an important psychological and historical support level for large holders.

Tracking Ethereum whales is crucial because these addresses often act as market movers due to the size of their holdings. When whale numbers rise, it typically signals accumulation, reflecting confidence and long-term positioning. 

Conversely, a decline may suggest distribution, profit-taking, or caution among major players. 

The recent drop could imply reduced conviction from large investors following ETH's strong rally, potentially leading to increased volatility or a cooling-off period in price momentum. 

That comes at a time when some analysts are pointing out that ETH could overtake BTC and others are questioning whether ETH is still a good investment in 2025.

Ethereum's EMA (Exponential Moving Average) lines remain bullish, with short-term EMAs positioned above long-term ones. 

However, momentum appears to be slowing, as the short-term lines have flattened and the gap between them is narrowing. This pattern often signals a potential shift in trend, especially if buyers fail to regain control. 

While the overall structure is still positive, the loss of upward momentum introduces short-term uncertainty.

ETH price has struggled to break key resistance levels at $2,741 and $2,646 over the past few days. 

Without renewed buying pressure, the asset may fail to reclaim the psychological $3,000 mark—a level it hasn't touched since February 1. 

If selling pressure increases, Ethereum could revisit support at $2,408. A breakdown there might trigger further losses, with $2,272 and $2,112 acting as the next significant support zones.

Starknet (STRK) just leveled up with the official launch of Stage 1. In simple terms, the network has officially hit the first stage of decentralization, according to L2BEAT. This means that users are no longer completely at the mercy of the core team. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum co-founder, gave his approval, cementing Starknet's status as one of the few Layer 2s he considers worth paying attention to.

Buterin himself was actually part of the STRK token drop last year. He received his stash through Starknet's LockedTokenGrant, then quietly moved over 2 million tokens from his Gnosis Safe to an unlabeled wallet about nine months ago, according to data from the blockchain.

No comments were made, no labels were placed — just a silent transfer that made the stash invisible to casual observers. It's unclear whether that was a move for privacy, custody, or something else entirely.

Welcome to the stage 1 gang @Starknet! https://t.co/iHKWh2uOOf

Stage 1, as defined by L2BEAT, means that a network has finally adopted key safety measures. Now, there's an upgrade delay, a security council with members beyond just insiders and, importantly, a way for a minority of the council to intervene if the sequencer begins censoring or malfunctions. In short, users now have a backup plan.

Previously, Starknet was in Stage 0 territory, where everything was based on trust in the developers.

Next is Stage 2, which is the point of full decentralization in which no single team or council can change the rules, censor transactions, or freeze withdrawals. Currently, no one has reached this stage. But Starknet says it's aiming to reach that point by early 2026.

Moreover, they are not limiting themselves to Ethereum. In the long term, they plan to bridge Ethereum and Bitcoin directly, making Starknet the first L2 to operate across both ecosystems. To back that vision, StarkWare, the core team, is already stacking ETH and BTC.

Bitcoin can soon cross the $200K mark due to rapidly contracting supply. Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer of Bitwise, said that the king cryptocurrency can hit the milestone by the end of 2025, considering demand and supply.

Moreover, a huge amount of money has been flowing into Bitcoin ETFs, with the total now standing at $6B. Add to this governments and corporations also buying $BTC left, right, and center, and we're witnessing an unforeseen demand for the ‘digital gold.'

Hougan expects that $BTC sellers would stop at $100K, which also happens to be a huge psychological level.

Keep reading to learn more about Bitcoin's brewing rally. We'll also list down the best altcoins you can buy to benefit from this.

Michael Saylor's Strategy has emerged as the most aggressive Bitcoin buyer. The company now holds a whopping 568,840 $BTC worth $59.03B.

Because of this, the Bitcoin supply has turned deflationary (-2.33%), as per analyst Ki Young Ju. Simply put, Bitcoin's supply is decreasing by 2.33% every year.

Now, with other firms such as Cantor Fitzgerald's Twenty One also buying Bitcoin aggressively and governments rushing to form a Bitcoin reserve, this deflationary rate is only expected to increase in the next few years.

In other words, Bitcoin could become an asset of the rich with limited supply.

Heavy corporate investments have meant that Bitcoin has become less volatile over the years. Earlier, it was about three times more volatile than the S&P 500, but it's now less than twice as volatile.

Decreasing volatility is a strong indication of increasing institutional interest. The more money flows into an asset, the less volatile it becomes.

If you, too, want to benefit from Bitcoin's mighty swing upwards, this might be your last chance. If you're looking for ideas, here are some of the best cryptos to invest in right now.

A Bitcoin rally generally means happy times for the broader crypto (and meme coin) market.

However, becoming an early investor in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) will allow you to make the most of Bitcoin's growth.

That's because $BTCBULL is the ONLY crypto today offering real (and free) $BTC via airdrops to its token holders.

Every time Bitcoin reaches a landmark figure, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K, for the first time, $BTCBULL holders who have stored their tokens in Best Wallet will automatically receive their share of $BTC.



As mentioned earlier, Bitcoin is expected to reach $250K this year, meaning you can benefit from at least three $BTC airdrops, depending on when BTC Bull Token goes live.

The project is currently in presale, with over $5.9M in early investor funding. Luckily for you, one $BTCBULL is available for just $0.00252.

It's also worth noting that the project's developers have planned to follow a deflationary model.

This simply means that the total $BTCBULL supply will keep reducing – every time $BTC's price jumps $25K, to be precise – which will likely boost demand.

For more information, check out our guide on how to buy BTC Bull Token.

A booming crypto market is a launchpad for viral meme coins. We've already witnessed this in the last couple of weeks, with tokens like $MOODENG, $KEKIUS, and $GOAT recording triple-digit gains.

MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is a potentially revolutionary new crypto that will help you identify such high-potential tokens before they rocket to the moon.

$MIND is an autonomous AI agent that stirs up conversations on online platforms like X. It talks to the crypto community and deep dives into their opinions on various altcoins.

Finally, it analyzes all the data it has collected using its cutting-edge hive-mind analysis to read the pulse of the market and zero in on the best cryptos to buy.



Remember, $MIND is also self-evolving, which is why it'll be able to create its own tokens once it has spread its popularity far and wide in the crypto community.

Additionally, if you want to make the most of $MIND's predicted 800% growth, consider becoming an early investor in the project.

Hurry up, though, because the $MIND presale is ending in less than two weeks. Each token is currently available for just $0.0037515, and the project has in total raised $9.4M so far. Buy $MIND now.

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is Elon Musk's newest infamous initiative.

As the name suggests, DOGE's mission is to assist the second Trump administration by maximizing the productivity of the federal government.

Considering that anything Musk touches becomes a fad in crypto, it's hardly a surprise that $DOGE (not Dogecoin, mind you) has risen to become one of the top trending cryptos.



To make the most of its viral bottom line, the $DOGE meme coin offers a few distinct advantages to crypto traders.

For instance, you don't have to pay any fees while buying, selling, or transferring $DOGE. Next, this low-cap coin is now completely owned by the community; the $DOGE owner has given up control over it.

$DOGE is up over 140% in the last month or so, including 76% in just the last seven days.

It's currently trading at $0.03318, which, seeing as Trump's second term is only getting started, could be a great entry point for interested investors.

With a Bitcoin rally looking imminent, top altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) and MIND of Pepe ($MIND) offer once-in-a-lifetime opportunities thanks to their unique prospects and low prices.

However, bear in mind that the crypto market guarantees nothing. It's highly volatile and unpredictable, which is why you should only risk what you can afford to lose.

A major altcoin rally may be brewing. Rising global liquidity, bullish technicals, and early Bitcoin-to-altcoin rotation point to a possible “Altseason 3.0,” with XRP (XRP) positioned to be one of the top beneficiaries.

These three XRP charts reveal why it could lead the next altcoin market breakout.

On the 3-day chart, XRP is consolidating inside a classic bull flag, a bullish continuation pattern that often follows a steep rally.

In this setup, the price forms a downward-sloping channel after a vertical move upward, resembling a flag on a pole. The pole represents the prior breakout, while the flag suggests a temporary pause before continuation.

XRP's current flag ranges between approximately $2.00 and $2.65. A breakout above the flag's upper trendline — ideally with high trading volume — could confirm the pattern and signal the next leg up.

The projected target from the flagpole points toward $4.25, a potential 78% move from current levels.

Importantly, this pattern comes after a fakeout earlier this year, where the price briefly broke above resistance but failed to hold. With momentum building again, the flag structure remains intact, offering a high-probability bullish setup if confirmed.

The second chart tracks the growth of the Global M2 money supply — a measure of total liquidity — alongside Bitcoin (BTC). Historically, Bitcoin has followed changes in M2 with a 12-week delay.

As M2 expands, it adds liquidity to global markets, often fueling risk-on assets like crypto.

Now, that liquidity wave appears to be washing over altcoins, and XRP looks positioned to benefit. In a monthly chart pairing XRP with US M2 data, XRP's biggest bull runs in 2017 and 2021 both coincided with sharp M2 expansions.

The same macro backdrop is unfolding again in 2025, with M2 accelerating and XRP already trading well above its 50-month EMA (~$0.95), suggesting strong upside sentiment.

This correlation reinforces the idea that XRP's next move could align with broader monetary trends. If M2 continues to rise, it may drive a surge in altcoin demand, with XRP likely among the leaders due to its historical sensitivity to liquidity shifts.

A widely shared chart comparing Bitcoin to altcoins identifies clear cycles of altcoin dominance, labeled Altseason 1.0 (2017) and Altseason 2.0 (2021) — each delivering 120x to 150x gains across the sector.

The chart now places the market at the beginning of Altseason 3.0, projecting a 175x opportunity.

XRP has historically benefited from such rotations. In 2017, XRP rallied over 1,000%. In 2021, it lagged early due to SEC vs. Ripple headwinds but eventually followed the broader altcoin surge.

Now, with partial legal clarity and underperformance relative to peers, XRP could be primed for a breakout if Altseason 3.0 unfolds as expected.

On-chain data discloses that Dogecoin (DOGE) is approaching a major resistance point, pushing investors to shift funds into altcoin rival FloppyPepe (FPPE). Its presale remains in the early stages, offering a rare chance to secure tokens at a discounted $0.0000002.

An exclusive 80% bonus is still available for this altcoin rival, but won't last much longer. Reaching its next million-dollar presale milestone will open up massive ROI potential, making now the perfect moment to invest and lock in early gains before the opportunity closes.

On-chain data shows Dogecoin (DOGE) is approaching significant resistance after trading with low momentum throughout early May, holding just below the $0.229 mark. The Dogecoin (DOGE) price chart is showing gains, with a 40% spike last month, 27% over the past 14 days, and 11% in the last week. 

Renowned industry expert Ali Martinez shared on X that Dogecoin (DOGE) faces key resistance at $0.36, while a critical support zone to watch is near $0.21. Despite this recent upward movement, concerns remain due to earlier volatility, which saw Dogecoin's (DOGE) inconsistent performance prompt some investors to pull back. The Dogecoin (DOGE) token's erratic consolidation eroded confidence, causing notable dips and pushing many to explore a promising new altcoin rival.





According to on-chain data, Dogecoin (DOGE) is stuck at a major resistance level, and this is seemingly pushing investors toward a new altcoin rival. This altcoin rival, FloppyPepe (FPPE), is selling for an affordable $0.0000002 during its early presale. The on-chain data further claims that more funds are flowing into this altcoin rival, FloppyPepe (FPPE), which is proving itself a serious contender among meme coins.

The presale is still underway, but closing in on key milestones around $1.8 million, making it the perfect time to act before prices surge. An 80% bonus boosts token allocations, fueling FOMO among investors. On-chain data points out that early supporters of this altcoin rival could see massive returns once the presale target is hit, creating urgency to secure tokens now.

FloppyPepe (FPPE) offers practical utility in everyday crypto transactions, removing the need to convert other cryptocurrencies to cover transaction costs. This increases the coin's utility and makes it a valuable tool for investors who want to make the most of their holdings this May 2025. 

FloppyAI is an intelligent crypto assistant that understands commands, tracks live market data, and delivers real-time insights, alerts, and actions. It is perfect for staying ahead, whether investors are trading, researching, or just managing a portfolio. It keeps getting smarter every day, learning from investors' activity to offer even better support.

FloppyPepe (FPPE) is redefining staking in the crypto market by transforming it from a dull, low-reward process into a high-yield strategy for boosting profits. Its token distribution supports this with 7.8% allocated to staking, 8% to liquidity, 2% for community rewards, 2% for airdrops, and 3% for marketing.

Beyond staking, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is building a self-rewarding ecosystem that keeps holders ahead while guaranteeing continuous growth. Security is a top priority, with its smart contract fully audited by SolidProof. On-chain data urges investors interested in these token benefits to consider joining the ongoing presale before it ends.

On-chain data signals Dogecoin (DOGE) price resistance, sending investors scrambling to FloppyPepe's (FPPE) low-cost presale at just $0.0000002. In a crowded meme coin market, this new rival meme coin rises with AI tools and huge ROI potential. The project's referral rewards let investors earn more tokens by inviting others, driving portfolio growth and profits.

Set to lead the booming AI agent sector, FloppyPepe delivers with its FloppyX video AI agent, built for standout content and next-gen video creation. The limited 80% bonus with code “FLOPPY80” is fueling demand. Don't miss the chance to join early in this rising altcoin rival with massive gain potential this May 2025.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","NFT Trend: the most popular collections of the moment on Blockchain","https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2025/05/18/nft-trend-the-most-popular-collections-of-the-moment-on-blockchain/","Sun, 18 May 2025 06:00:00 GMT","

The trend of NFTs is constantly moving, with some collections varying their valuation indicators in the short term. Here's how to keep up in the Non-Fungible Token sector. 

Summary

To evaluate the best trending NFTs at the moment, it is necessary to consider some indicators. 

Such indicators are often offered by websites that aggregate information, managing to provide users with increasingly detailed insights on the most popular blockchain-based collections of the moment.

In fact, during this week, the platform CoinGecko defined the ranking of the top 7 NFT Trending, based on the highest percentage change of the floor price in the last 24 hours from the publication.

To keep this indicator updated, which will change every 24 hours, simply access the platform and clickc on 24h. In this way, the user can obtain the ranking of NFT trends in real-time, always based on the highest percentage change of the floor price.

On DappRadar, however, the ranking of the top NFT collections of the last 24 hours considers the Volume as an indicator, understood as “the fiat value of all NFT transactions in the time period”

If instead you click on Top Sales, the DappRadar ranking considers the NFTs sold in the last 24 hours, with the highest fiat sale price. 

The platform of NFT Price Floor, on the other hand, the ranking of trending NFTs primarily considers market capitalization and its changes in the last 24 hours. 

In this case, on the podium, in first place is CryptoPunks with 465,900 ETH of market cap, followed by BAYC with 125,000 ETH of market cap and, in third place, the collection Pudgy Penguins with 87,973 ETH of market cap. 

When the indicator is market capitalization, it is difficult for drastic changes to occur in the short term. On the contrary, other indicators such as floor price change or selling price or fiat currency volume in 24 hours can radically change the rankings drawn up. 

For each data aggregation platform on NFTs, it is possible to select different filters that offer more targeted information, even on trending collections. 

For example, a filter could be to choose a specific NFT category and display the rankings based on their floor price, or market cap, or Volume. 

In fact, NFT collections are today divided into a multitude of categories, such as Games, PFP (profile picture), Sports, Metaverse, Collectibles, Music, Art, RWA (Real World Asset) and much more. 

Note, however, that not all platforms offer the same NFT categories and the same subdivisions. 

On the contrary, something that cannot be a subjective choice is the category of Blockchain to which the NFT collection belongs. 

In this sense, it is possible to see the rankings of the trending NFT collections by blockchain such as Ethereum, Polygon, Immutable X, BNB Chain, and others, such as 

On CryptoSlam, it is also possible to immediately see the ranking of blockchains based on NFT sales in the last 24 hours. At this moment, the podium sees Ethereum in first place, followed by Bitcoin and then, in third position, Polygon. 

Last April 22, thanks to CryptoSlam data,  it was observed that the weekly sales of NFTs on Polygon had surpassed those on Ethereum, thanks to the sales of the Courtyard collection in the RWA category. 

Speaking of NFTs, last month, the famous NFT marketplace OpenSea submitted a letter to the Crypto Task Force of the US SEC, to urge clarity on NFT regulation.

OpenSea reportedly asked to eliminate the existing confusion in the sector, including the classification of NFT marketplaces as exchanges or as securities brokers. 

Not only that, given the decentralization of the blockchain on which NFT buying and selling transactions occur, the marketplace cannot even be classified as a central authority that accepts or executes payments. 

The final suggestion that OpenSea offers to the competent authority is to consider the idea that NFT marketplaces are just exploration tools.

Crypto World News

May 18, 2025 by Vaigha Varghese 

There's renewed excitement in the crypto world as analysts predict XRP could soar to new highs if ETF approvals come through. The recent XRP price prediction and Ripple ICO rumors have stirred fresh optimism among investors. But while XRP continues to dominate headlines, another payment-focused token is quietly gaining ground.

This token is positioning itself to transform cross-border transactions by merging crypto speed with the simplicity of traditional banking. Could it become the surprise breakout while XRP eyes its next big move? Let's take a closer look.

Source: Coinmarketcap

XRP came under pressure after Judge Torres denied a joint request by Ripple and the SEC to lift restrictions on institutional XRP sales and reduce penalties, shaking market confidence. This unexpected ruling has delayed clarity and stirred fresh uncertainty about Ripple's legal path, which could ultimately impact XRP's chances for a U.S.-based spot ETF approval and influence short-term XRP price predictions.

Ripple may refile its motion, but progress could take months. If appeals proceed, the case might reach the U.S. Supreme Court, further delaying ETF developments. A successful SEC challenge could overturn the 2023 ruling that classified XRP's programmatic sales as non-securities, putting ETF hopes at risk. Meanwhile, speculation is growing that Ripple could consider an ICO fundraising if legal pressures mount.

Source: FXEmpire

XRP's price dipped slightly after the ruling, continuing its broader sell-off as traders wait for clarity. Despite this, optimism remains if legal risks fade and ETF doors open; a break above $2.65 could push XRP toward $3.00 and beyond, reinforcing bullish XRP price prediction scenarios. With Ripple's next court update due by June 16, all eyes are on whether they settle or escalate.

While XRP fans fixate on ETF approval and rumor-fueled moonshots, Remittix (RTX) is quietly engineering the next generation of global payments, which doesn't need hype to prove its worth. At the heart of Remittix is a groundbreaking but straightforward concept: use crypto to send money straight into any bank account, anywhere on the planet. No need for the receiver to touch a wallet or even know it came from crypto. They get fiat in their account. You get peace of mind.

The real magic? Zero FX fees and transparent flat pricing. Forget about traditional banks gutting your transfers with hidden charges. With Remittix, there are no conversion losses, no wire fees, and no surprises. Whether you're sending $50 or $50,000, what you send is what the other side receives. It's crypto's speed with banking's familiarity without the usual financial bloodletting in between.

Speed is another killer feature. Crypto transfers settle instantly, and Remittix leverages local payment rails to ensure fiat arrives in the recipient's account on the same day. No more multi-day waits or cryptic “processing” statuses. It's like PayPal on rocket fuel, only decentralized, borderless, and built for scale.

The Remittix presale is heating up, with token demand growing daily. At the current price of $0.0757, early investors have a golden window to secure their $RTX before the next price hike kicks in. With over 90% of tokens already sold in this round, this opportunity won't last long.

Participation is seamless. Connect your wallet at Remittix.io, choose between ETH, USDT, or debit/credit card, and your RTX tokens will land in your dashboard in minutes. Analysts project RTX could double in value by year-end, and with a limited supply of 1.5 billion tokens, early access could mean an exponential upside.

Remittix is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about projects in crypto, and for good reason. This new crypto-to-fiat payment network lets users send money directly to bank accounts using over 50 cryptos and 30 fiat currencies, all with same-day transfers.

While XRP has long been the leader in this space, its slow price movement and fading hype are making holders uneasy. Meanwhile, Remittix's presale has already smashed past $15 million, and the momentum just keeps building.

Remittix is shaping up as the best crypto to buy right now, especially as XRP faces a looming bear storm. While XRP did good with its PayFi thesis focusing on big corporations, Remittix takes things further by including everyday users in its vision.

Its Pay API lets merchants accept crypto and get fiat payments in under 24 hours, making real-world adoption seamless. Plus, its PayFi protocol allows anyone to send crypto as fiat directly to bank accounts worldwide, solving major headaches in cross-border payments.



 

With the SEC easing its stance on crypto, Remittix is likely to avoid the legal battles that Ripple faced, clearing the path to disrupt the massive $190 trillion global remittance market.

The RTX presale, still priced at $0.0757, offers huge upside potential. Investors have already poured $15 million into it, attracted by deflationary tokenomics and an 8% APY staking yield.

The Remittix Wallet is a powerful, non-custodial wallet giving you full control over your digital assets with strong security and privacy. Its user-friendly design makes it easy to trade, swap, and manage over 50 cryptocurrencies right inside the wallet.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","Bitcoin News: BTC Nears Bullish Golden Cross as Moody's Downgrades U.S., Citing Debt Concerns","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/18/bitcoin-nears-bullish-golden-cross-following-failed-death-cross-echoing-2024-pattern","Sun, 18 May 2025 16:58:40 GMT","

Bitcoin's BTC$105,630.05 price chart is echoing a bullish pattern that foreshadowed the late 2024 price surge from $70,000 to $100,000 amid mounting concerns over the sustainability of the U.S. debt.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value appears on track to confirm a ""golden cross"" in the coming days, according to charting platform TradingView. The pattern occurs when the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of prices crosses above the 200-day SMA to suggest that the short-term trend is outperforming the broader trend, with the potential to evolve into a major bull run.

The moving average-based golden cross has a mixed record of predicting price trends. The impending one, however, is worth noting because it's about to occur weeks after its ominous-sounding opposite, the death cross, trapped bears on the wrong side of the market.

A similar pattern unfolded from August through September 2024, setting the stage for a convincing move above $70,000 in early November. Prices eventually set a record high above $109K in January this year.

The chart on the left shows that BTC bottomed out at around $50,000 in early August last year as the 50-day SMA moved below the 200-day SMA to confirm the death cross.

In other words, the death cross was a bear trap, much like the one in early April this year. Prices turned higher in subsequent weeks, eventually beginning a new uptrend after the appearance of the golden cross in late October 2024.

The bullish sequence is being repeated since early April, and prices could begin the next leg higher following the confirmation of the golden cross in the coming days.

Past performance does not guarantee future results, and technical patterns do not always deliver as expected. That said, macro factors seem aligned with the bullish technical setup.

On Friday, credit rating agency Moody's downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating from the highest ”Aaa” to ”Aa1”, citing concerns over the increasing national debt, which has now reached $36 trillion.

The bond market has been pricing fiscal concerns for some time. Last week, CoinDesk detailed how persistent elevated Treasury yields reflected expectations for continued fiscal splurge and sovereign risk premium, both bullish for bitcoin.

 A retired fabricator was tricked into entering his seed phrase on a fake Coinbase site, losing a crypto portfolio worth $2 million. 

Retired artist Ed Suman lost over $2 million in cryptocurrency earlier this year after falling victim to a scam involving someone posing as a Coinbase support representative.

Suman, 67, spent nearly two decades as a fabricator in the art world, helping build high-profile works such as Jeff Koons' Balloon Dog sculptures, according to a May 17 report by Bloomberg.

After retiring, he turned to cryptocurrency investing, eventually accumulating 17.5 Bitcoin (BTC) and 225 Ether (ETH) — a portfolio that comprised most of his retirement savings.

He stored the funds in a Trezor Model One, a hardware wallet commonly used by crypto holders to avoid the risks of exchange hacks. But in March, Suman received a text message appearing to be from Coinbase, warning him of unauthorized account access.

After responding, he got a phone call from a man identifying himself as a Coinbase security staffer named Brett Miller. The caller appeared knowledgeable, correctly stating that Suman's funds were stored in a hardware wallet.

He then convinced Suman that his wallet could still be vulnerable and walked him through a “security procedure” that involved entering his seed phrase into a website mimicking Coinbase's interface.

Nine days later, a second caller claiming to be from Coinbase repeated the process. By the end of that call, all of Suman's crypto holdings were gone.

The scam followed a data breach at Coinbase disclosed this week, in which attackers bribed customer support staff in India to access sensitive user information.

Stolen data included customer names, account balances, and transaction histories. Coinbase confirmed the breach impacted roughly 1% of its monthly transacting users.

Among those affected was venture capitalist Roelof Botha, managing partner at Sequoia Capital. There is no indication that his funds were accessed, and Botha declined to comment.

Coinbase's chief security officer, Philip Martin, reportedly said the contracted customer service agents at the center of the controversy were based in India and had been fired following the breach.

The exchange has also said it plans to pay between $180 million and $400 million in remediation and reimbursement to affected users.

 UK crypto firms will need to report customer transactions on their platforms from 2026 onward as part of an initiative to strengthen crypto tax reporting practices. 

United Kingdom crypto companies will need to collect and report data from every customer trade and transfer beginning Jan. 1, 2026 as part of a broader effort to improve crypto tax reporting, the UK government said.

Everything from the user's full name, home address and tax identification number will need to be collected and reported for every transaction, including the cryptocurrency used and the amount moved, the UK Revenue and Customs department said in a May 14 statement.Details of companies, trusts and charities transacting on crypto platforms will also need to be reported.

Failure to comply or inaccurate reporting may incur penalties of up to 300 British pounds ($398.4) per user. The UK Revenue and Customs department said it would inform companies on how to comply with the incoming measures in due course.

However, UK authorities are encouraging crypto firms to start collecting data now to ensure compliance readiness.

The new rule is part of the UK's integration of the Organisation for Economic Development's Cryptoasset Reporting Framework to improve transparency in crypto tax reporting.

The changes reflect the UK government's aim to establish a more robust regulatory framework that supports industry growth while ensuring consumer protection.

UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves also introduced a draft bill in late April to bring crypto exchanges, custodians and broker-dealers within its regulatory reach to combat scams and fraud.

“Today's announcement sends a clear signal: Britain is open for business — but closed to fraud, abuse, and instability,” Reeves said at the time.

A study from the UK's Financial Conduct Authority last November found that 12% of UK adults owned crypto in 2024 — a significant increase from the 4% reported in 2021.

The UK's move to integrate the crypto rules into its existing financial framework contrasts with the European Union's approach, which introduced the new Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation framework last year.

According to the MiCA Crypto Alliance, one key difference is that the UK will allow foreign stablecoin issuers to operate in the UK without needing to register.

There will also be no cap on stablecoin volumes, unlike the EU's approach, which may impose controls on stablecoin issuers to manage systemic risks.

 Saifedean Ammous says he would “throw in a few sats” to fund a developer dedicated to making Bitcoin spam more costly. 

Economist and author of The Bitcoin Standard, Saifedean Ammous, has weighed in on the ongoing debate over spam inscriptions on the Bitcoin network, suggesting he would “throw in a few sats” to fund a full-time developer focused on making Bitcoin spamming more difficult and expensive.

Ammous made the remarks in response to a thread initiated by the pseudonymous developer GrassFedBitcoin, who called for Bitcoin Core to merge pull request #28408, which would enable node operators to filter inscriptions more easily.

According to GrassFedBitcoin, the lack of inscription filtering tools contributes to unnecessary blockchain bloat and undermines Bitcoin (BTC)'s role as a monetary protocol.

“No one running a node wants to relay inscriptions,” he wrote, arguing that the OP_RETURN limit increases were justified in the past under false assumptions. He pushed for a configurable, default policy discouraging the use of Bitcoin for storing JPEGs rather than monetary data.

Blockstream CEO Adam Back challenged the proposal, describing inscription filtering as an “arms race.” He noted that spam data embedded in Bitcoin transactions can be endlessly modified using code structures, requiring constant updates to filtering tools.

Ammous compared the Bitcoin spam issue to email spam — another arms race society continues to fight without abandoning the system.

“It's not easy, but it's worth trying to help bankrupt the spammers faster,” Ammous said. He argued that fighting spam is not censorship, noting that node operators already reject invalid transactions.

The debate drew commentary from other users. One participant suggested Core developers treat spam-coding employees at certain startups as “unwilling QA engineers” and simply unstandardize every trick they deploy.

Ammous took it further, proposing to “deprecate” the work of developers building spam tools and even hiring outside coders to overwhelm their systems.

The conversation reflects ongoing tensions in the Bitcoin community over the network's intended use. With inscriptions continuing to congest the network, calls for technical countermeasures — and pointed critiques of those defending spam — are growing louder.

In a Feb. 4 report, Mempool Research said the adoption of inscriptions could drive the Bitcoin network's average block size as high as 4 megabytes (MB) per block, far higher than current averages.

Bitcoin's average block size — the amount of data in each block posted to the network's public ledger — is currently around 1.5 MB.

Visualizing Science: Illustration and Beyond

Where does the illustrator end and the infographer begin? How does data visualization fit in? And what does science have to say about the design decisions we make? 

By Jen Christiansen 

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

This article was published in Scientific American's former blog network and reflects the views of the author, not necessarily those of Scientific American

In July I presented at the 50th anniversary conference of the Guild of Natural Science Illustrators (GNSI). Here's a lightly-edited transcript of that talk, with an abridged set of companion images. 

***Thanks for including me in the annual meeting. Particularly this year, here in Washington, DC. Although I've been a bit of an absentee family member, this feels something like a homecoming, in that the first GNSI meeting I attended was also in Washington DC, 22 years ago.

With the goal of reinforcing connections between communities and to strengthen some of those family ties, I plan to use this time to prompt you to think about what you [scientific illustrators] can learn from—and teach to—a few different sub-disciplines within the broader orb of visual science communication. For example: Where does the illustrator end….

….and the infographer begin?

How does data visualization fit in?

And what does science have to say about the design decisions we make?

But first, I should provide some context. The thoughts to follow are very much rooted my own experiences. This is a bit of a reflection upon what I've observed over the last 20 years as an art director. This is not a comprehensive literature review or a rigorous look at the entire field of science visualization. These are musings related to my journey—rooted in the world of publishing—with shout-outs to some of the resources and communities that I've found helpful or thought-provoking along the way. I am inevitably going to get myself into some trouble, as I'm not a specialist in all of the sub-disciplines that I'll be speaking about. But I do work at the intersection of these sub-disciplines, and over time I have developed a set of resources that may be of interest to you.

As background, for context on what has shaped my point of view, I should say that I self define as a graphics editor, science communicator, and an infographer. I was trained primarily in traditional (or physical) media. Here's one of my first published scientific illustrations—ink drawings of hydrothermal vent shrimp mouthparts. It's one of the products of a few summers in college, working in a crustacea lab at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles.

But I did get a chance to dabble in the digital realm starting in the late 1980's with a Commodore Amiga, thanks to my high school art teacher, Robert Tartter. I then shifted over to tablets and virtual drawing at Smith College, where my instructor Gary Niswonger led exercises like blind contour figure drawing. Model in the middle of the room, our backs towards our monitors, and Wacom tablets in our laps.

As much as I loved my art and design courses, I also loved my courses in science. I resisted choosing one discipline at the expense of the other, and pursued a double major in geology and studio art. Then, a scientific illustration graduate program at the University of California, Santa Cruz (now hosted by California State University at Monterey Bay) caught my eye, and allowed me to officially merge the two disciplines under the tutelage of Ann Caudle, Jenny Keller, and Larry Lavendal. Instead of dedicating myself to a single scientific line of research, I'd help make other people's research accessible to wider audiences through a visual language.

I entered the publishing scene after graduate school, as an intern in the art department at Scientific American, thanks to my mentor, Ed Bell. This is my first illustration for the magazine; a watercolor cockroach. 

My internship turned into a full-time job, and as my role shifted from artist to art director, I found myself setting my watercolors and Rapidograph pens aside and turning to the computer as my primary tool. In 1998, I left Scientific American to work as an assistant art director, then a designer, at National Geographic. All the while, growing as an art director, and learning about print production from some of the best in the business. Five years later, I left DC and established a freelance science communication business, focusing mainly on magazine and book projects.

In 2007, I returned to Scientific American, where I'm now the senior graphics editor. Today, there are two of us on the graphics team, Amanda Montañez and me. We art direct all of the information graphics in the magazine, from data visualizations (like the sample on the left by Pitch Interactive), to illustrated explainers (like the sample on the right, by Cherie Sinnen). Occasionally we develop the final images ourselves, but most often we hire freelance artists, and manage the project.

We also manage digital versions of all the graphics for web and phone viewing, and Amanda develops graphics specifically for the web environment…

…but I'm going to remain rooted in print examples for what I'll be sharing today.

Editorial illustrations, like these examples by Maria Corte Maidagan and Jay Bendt, are art directed by other folks in the art department (design director Michael Mrak and art director Jason Mischka).

What's the difference? By my definition, information graphics are illustrations, built on a foundation of research, that exist primarily to convey information. Whereas editorial illustrations are thematic illustrations that are inspired by the text, and which entice readers to engage more fully with the magazine's content.

For example, for an article on the microbiome, illustrator Bryan Christie developed an opening image that is not a literal representation of the concept, but instead nods to the idea of a human as being defined by the microbes within. Bryan is telling a story with visual symbols and thoughtful composition. This is not an information graphic. Instead, it's a metaphorical illustration that nods to the theme of the text.

Within the article, Bryan and his collaborator Joe Lertola shift into information-graphic mode, using visual symbols and thoughtful composition to convey very specific information that is rooted in research. This is not an editorial illustration. It's an information graphic or explanatory diagram.

Some artists, like Bryan Christie, are comfortable in both of these worlds.

But this is where I reside, when it comes to my own illustration work and in my role as a graphics editor. 

That said, I can learn from, and often work with, artists who navigate both sides. For example, for an article on malaria vaccines, I built out the content plan and composition, shown here. 

But knew that it would take an adept artist to breathe life into the spread. So I hired the illustration team of Peter and Maria Hoey to develop the final rendering. Peter and Maria have a great way with icons and develop rich textures and depth in their editorial work, attributes that served this information graphic well.

Similarly, I leaned heavily on editorial illustrator Leandro Castelao's styling and color palette to make this schematic of interferometers feel like it belongs in a consumer magazine, and not a scientific journal…

…and Gavin Potenza's style provided a fresh look at a topic that lots of media outlets covered, giving us a stylistically distinctive timeline of Mars exploration.

When working on my own illustrations, I find that I sometimes get hyper-focused on details related to accuracy, and the illustration style can fall flat. Things can get very academic looking and anonymous really fast. Editorial illustrators like Jillian Ditner and Chad Hagen remind me that injecting the artist's voice and point of view and sense of style is OK, particularly in the context of a magazine.

Let's revisit this slide…

…and dive in further to some lessons learned and specific resources related to information graphics.

I tend to think of information graphics as a continuum, with figurative representations at one end and abstract representations on the other.

In the world of science visualization, you could argue that the full continuum can also be referred to as data visualizations. 

After all, essentially all of our work is rooted in data collection at some stage in the process: from bone length measurements in dinosaur reconstructions, …

…to meticulously documented laboratory experiments that build up to a more complete understanding of processes like photosynthesis …

…to representations of mathematical expressions, like Feynman diagrams…

…to straight-up plotting of the raw data itself, in chart form. 

But, outside of the world of science visualization, it may be more useful to think of the continuum like this:

When I flip through old issues of Scientific American, it strikes me that many artists worked across this full spectrum. Regular contributor Bunji Tagawa's body of work astounds me. Here's a small sample, to give you a glimpse at the breadth of his skillset. It ranges from figurative depictions of objects…

…to medical cutaways…

…technical schematics…

…and data visualizations. [For more, see “Remembering Bunji Tagawa” by Amanda Montañez].

But as a graphics editor at the magazine now, I find myself maintaining discrete freelance pools for each of the different points along the continuum. 

Perhaps this is an artifact of my own biases, but when I flip through old issues of Scientific American, it occurs to me that this increased specialization may also be in part due to the shifting tools of each of these areas. When the primary tool for developing representative illustrations, explanatory diagram, and data visualizations for print magazines was pen and ink, an artist could become a master at pen and ink, then explore different methods of problem solving in each of these areas. Here are more examples from Tagawa. Again, from organics…

...to technical cutaways…

…abstract representations of processes…

…and number-based plots. All in pen and ink.

As desktop publishing became ubiquitous and digital rendering tools diversified and became more widely available, it seems to me that the simple act of choosing a primary tool starts to define the edges of the artist's scope. As an art director, I find myself specifically looking for 3D artists to build physical objects, like this example by Don Foley.

And I look for artists like Tami Tolpa, who hone in on composition and the flow of information by iterating with tools like Adobe Illustrator for explanatory diagrams.

And data designers that build solutions with code for visualizing large datasets, like Jan Willem Tulp.

Each of these tools, mediums, styles and genres take lots of time to master, and tend to favor certain portions of the continuum.

Many of the conferences I attend and communities that I engage with seem to reinforce these divisions, by focusing on the tools. And it seems that artists that span more than one of these orbs are harder and harder to find. 

Perhaps that way of thinking about things is a bit overly dramatic. The reality is probably much more like this.

And perhaps this is a completely natural and fine state to be in—particularly since the primary tools for these different sub-disciplines have bifurcated over time. And perhaps there isn't value in trying to force discrete clusters to reconnect.

After all, some of my favorite recent Scientific American graphics are the result of bringing together different artists—plucking experts from each of those groups and matching them up to create a final image that draws upon all of their strengths, not forcing one artist to excel in all areas. For example, I love to take an artist who can develop spot illustrations with a stylus or pen, and pair them up with an artist who can custom code data visualization solutions, as in this example by Moritz Stefaner and Jillian Walters.

But it also applies to graphics like these, in which different pieces of the full story are simply better served by different types of visualizations and areas of artist expertise.

That said, I argue that even if you don't have the desire to work across the full continuum—or the time to dedicate to becoming proficient across the full continuum—there is lots to be learned from each of these clusters, and I'd love to see more cross pollination of ideas between them. I think we'd all benefit, if things looked more like this:

And even better, if things looked like this:

I'm not arguing that everyone along this continuum should learn how to code. Or that everyone along the continuum should build clay maquettes and paint from life. I'm arguing that we can—and should—learn how science visualizers from cross the full spectrum think through and solve problems.

In that spirit, I'd like to share some of the things that I've learned from individuals within these different clusters. 

First, I should note that at this web address: http://bit.ly/jenGNSI, you'll find a Google Sheet of more complete citations and links to sources that directly relate to the rest of my presentation. I'll be showing some examples from the magazine that exemplify the lessons that I've learned, but in many cases, I've absorbed those lessons through a variety of books, blog posts, presentations, podcasts and workshops. This Google Sheet will guide you to specific references that you might find inspiring as more context for each of the following points.

And at this web address: http://bit.ly/SciVizResources, you'll find a more general list of references that I've built in response to specific requests from students, scientists, and artists interested in learning more about scientific visualization—all the way from illustration to data visualization—as well as references related to the work I do as a science graphics editor.

Back to representative illustrations. Here are 5 key lessons that I've gleaned largely from the scientific illustration community.

Lesson number 1: Every detail is worthy of intense attention and care. Every feature should be observed and considered.

For a graphic about the impact of mosquitoes on public health, artist Immy Smith demonstrates that yes, a lineup of different mosquito species can, in fact, be visually interesting and informative…

…and reinforces the idea that different mosquito species are connected to different diseases in humans. Some of my colleagues were a bit skeptical at this plan—they worried that the mosquitos would all look the same. But the careful and exacting eye of artist Immy Smith revealed the variations between them. 

It's clear here that every pencil mark is intentional and considered. To my mind, the thoughtful and meticulous rendering of every single detail is a challenge to the reader to, in return, carefully and thoughtfully consider each insect depicted.

Lesson 2: Get your eyes on the subject matter

For an article on the American burying beetle, artist Kelly Murphy knew she'd need to render the insect from a variety of angles. Existing images online made for great references for top-down views. But in order to get a better look at the mouthparts and in order to more accurately represent the beetle in different positions, she tracked down a specimen at the California Academy of Sciences and spent some time photographing it from all angles.

Lesson 3: if you can't get your eyes on the subject matter, consider making an approximation.

Artist James Gurney's scenes are incredibly convincing in part due to the dimensional models he develops to inform his composition and lighting.

Lesson 4: There is power in photorealistic and hyper-real renderings

As Ed bell wrote in 2010, “Artist Ron Miller takes us on a journey to eight of the most breathtaking views that await intrepid explorers of our solar system. The scale of these natural wonders dwarfs anything Earth has to offer. What might we see and feel if we could travel to these distant domains? The artist's eye—interpreting data from probes such as NASA's Cassini, which is now exploring the Saturnian system, and MESSENGER, which has flown by Mercury three times and goes into permanent orbit next March—allows us an early visit to these unforgettable locales.”

Lesson 5: There is power in non-photorealistic renderings

Here, artist Carol Donner edits out non-essential details and employs transparency to create an aesthetically appealing and clear look at the heart. Unlike Ron Miller's objective in the view of Saturn, the goal here is not to help the reader to experience an environment. The goal here is to represent the behavior of an object.

As Ian Suk and his co-authors wrote in The Journal of Biocommunication, “Medical illustration, by its very essence, requires some degree of simplification and idealization of the subject. It is the role of the illustrator to visually educate the reader regarding a complex biomedical procedure, structure, or process in an aesthetic and efficient manner.”

Let's start to slide over more into the realm of information graphics and explanatory diagrams.

Lesson 1: There's power in knowing when and how to distort the physical form of your subject to best serve the informational content

This particular example was rendered by Bunji Tagawa. It's a variation on a classic schematic representation of the cardiovascular system. Rather than get caught up in the details of a human figure, the information is streamlined in a way that highlights the closed and circular flow of blood through the system. 

Lesson 2: Composition is key: the artist should be acutely aware of how they are guiding the reader's eye through an illustration

Here, John Grimwade very intentionally guides the reader's eye through the page with spare linework, selective color, and setting up the flow of action in a way that reinforces the flow of information.

Lesson 3: Text is vital. It is just as important as images.

Here, artist Emily Cooper presents an elegant set of four Atlantic Ocean views. Labels help orient the reader to a certain degree, and you can piece together parts of the story: We're looking at how winds and the gulf stream relate to temperature. But it's hard to sort out what the take-home message is.

That's where text comes in. The headline and annotation subheads immediately provide context.

The graphic aims to explain why winter is warmer in Europe, according to four different models. Through that lens, the reader is now primed to compare and contrast the four models.

Lesson 4: Welcoming gestures, in the form of relatable details or moments of joy, can engage readers

Nigel Holmes is an expert at including touches of humor and humanity to explanatory graphics. Here, he manages to inject life into a graphic about group theory and the mathematical underpinnings of symmetry. But the figures aren't simply decorative. They help reinforce the concept of the cube rotation around different axes.

Lesson 5: Context is key. Your audience and the goal of the information graphic should guide both content and style.

For an article on artificial photosynthesis, a scientist provided us with the reference material on the left. It's a schematic of the device they had developed to mimic the process. The image is perfectly serviceable for the scientist's peers, and for the context of a scientific paper. But for a consumer magazine, we needed to not only engage non-specialist readers, but also help them more immediately see the parallels between this technology and natural photosynthesis. Our version is on the right. Note that we introduced a photosynthesis primer of sorts for basic context. And the context of a consumer magazine granted us the freedom to go a bit more playful with the rendering style, making it a great match for botanical artist Cherie Sinnen.

Let's continue sliding over more into the realm of abstract renderings and data visualization.

Lesson 1: Fully explore your dataset. Then explore it some more.

For a graphic about changing bee populations over time, data visualizer Moritz Stefaner started by exploring the raw data, in forms ranging from bar charts to tables and heat maps to network diagrams, all in the service of examining the shape of the data through many different lenses. The data sketches on the left are just a small sample of the total. Only after he had thoroughly examined the data in different forms did he start to hone in on what final form might serve the data—and our readers—the best.

Lesson 2: It's OK to embrace complexity

But when presenting people with a complicated, layered, and rich look at a topic, always provide the reader the tools they need to interpret the visualization. Here, for an article on the evolution of mythical stories, the design studio Accurat presents many levels of data in a single visual. It's a complicated and rich data visualization, rooted in a complicated and rich dataset from a scientist. Some folks might argue that we're requiring too much effort on behalf of the reader. There's not a quick way to read this.

However, we set things up with a clear “How to Read this Figure” key, using informal language that you might use when talking a friend through the graphic. The idea being that once the reader dedicates a bit of guided effort into learning how to read things, they can then pop over and see a few annotated main takeaway points, then explore further on their own. This type of approach also allowed us to present the full dataset, rather than distilling things down into an over-simplistic summary.

Lesson 3: Novel forms can draw a reader in

For a piece on when babies are born, data scientist Zan Armstrong and visualizer Nadieh Bremer collaborated to develop this custom solution for the magazine. The information here could be presented in a more classic and linear chart form as well. But I doubt it would've captured the readers' attention nearly as well. The circles are not only captivating, but they also reinforce the cyclical nature of the data, like a clock. As with the complex example, however, the reader should be given a clear guide on how to read the graphic.

Lesson 4: But sometimes a straightforward line graph or bar chart is best

For this chart nugget on bias in coronary artery disease research, there was no need to push the boundaries or try to be clever. A straightforward and simple and familiar chart form was all that was needed.

Lesson 5: Your source data is not objective. Nor is it complete. 

I've included links to some great resources about this in my main reference list, but I think it's worth nodding directly to a few specific writings here.

As researcher, artist and software developer Catherine D'Ignazio writes in her post “What would feminist data visualization look like?”

“What's the issue? Feminist standpoint theory would say that the issue is that all knowledge is socially situated and that the perspectives of oppressed groups including women, minorities and others are systematically excluded from ‘general' knowledge…

…Until we acknowledge and recognize that power of inclusion and exclusion, and develop some visual language for it, we must acknowledge data visualization as one more powerful and flawed tool of oppression.”

And on the topic of missing data, artist and researcher Mimi Onuoha writes, “Datasets are the end product of classification systems, the clean outputs of intentional orderings. Datasets point to their own contrasts—specifically the things that we haven't collected…

…And if it is true that we make sense of the world through exclusion, then perhaps there is a special type of meaning to be found in the things that we leave out.”

These ideas have made me approach some projects with both more trepidation and clearer vision. For an article on infectious diseases, we hoped to give folks a sense of the global state of things. How have infectious diseases impacted public health over time and space? 

Art researcher Amanda Hobbs was a huge help on this front, doing a large literature survey and identifying some of the known pitfalls. We ended up using pretty standard and authoritative sources for the bulk of the spread: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization.

But even seemingly well-meaning authoritative sources can't control for data collection variations over time and space. And data collection methodologies are developed by individuals with inherent biases. So, I made sure to read the data documentation carefully, avoiding known pitfalls and making note of when methodologies changed. That helped guide decisions like the time interval we used, as well as some on-chart annotations. And we ran things by a few experts in the field for a reality check.

I'm still thinking that we should have done more to help readers understand that this sort of data is far from perfect. In the future, I plan to fight a little harder to keep more explanatory text intact. But we at least left a pretty clear crumb trail with the source citation, so that it's possible for people to inspect the original data for themselves.

And now, four bonus lessons from across and around the continuum.

Lesson 1: Question design “rules” 

Many of us can probably recite oft-quoted “rules” from well-known authors, like Edward Tufte's proclamation that “Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space.” But how do we know that's true? And if it is true in one context, is it true in another? Perception scientists are steadily chipping away at some of these sorts of questions.

I'd encourage you to check out the Datastories podcast for interviews with some of those researchers, Robert Kosara's blog Eagereyes for leads on where else to look, and Kennedy Elliot's post entitled “39 studies about human perception in 30 minutes.”

Lesson 2: Share

I am often struck by how generous the data journalism community is when it comes to sharing visualization best-practices, story ideas, techniques, tools and resources. If you're interested in learning more, a great place to start is the Computer Assisted Reporting program of the Investigative Reporters and Editors organization.

A few more specific resources include Jennifer LaFleur's guide to bulletproofing your data…

….and ProPublica's “The Nerd Blog.”

Lesson 3: Create spaces for dialogue

The intersection of science and the fine and performing arts is a bit further outside of my personal wheelhouse, but I'm excited to continue to learn more about how artists and performers engage with broad audiences in different kinds of spaces. And I'm interested trying to figure out how to apply those lessons of engagement within my magazine work.

For more, I'd encourage you to check out SciArt Center, an online platform and event organization that promotes cross-disciplinary collaborations, art exhibits and events.

And for more information about the performing arts and science, see Jamé McCray's talk at the SciVizNYC conference in 2017, as well as one of the communities she references in that talk, SuperHero Clubhouse. As I mentioned a moment ago, I'm trying to figure out how to apply some of their lessons of audience engagement and dialogue within my magazine work.

But meanwhile, I'm trying to actively create spaces for dialogue for the science visualization community as a member of the organizing team of SciVizNYC. I'd love to see this model put into action in other locations. 

The idea for this event rolled out of conversations with medical illustrator Jill Gregory. She and I enjoyed visiting each other's workplace, to see how we each put our training in scientific illustration to use. We wondered if a roving meet-up event could work, in which a group moved from one office to another studio to another newsroom over the course of a day, seeing how different folks put scientific visualization to use in their daily work. As the idea grew, Jill and I were joined by co-organizers Christopher Smith, Amanda Montañez, and Ni-ka Ford. We ended up moving forward with a more traditional—and logistically easier—all-day event in a single location featuring 14 speakers. Our first event, in 2016, was free. We charged $35 a seat for our second event to discourage no-shows. But it was important for us to keep the cost of entry as low as possible, while still paying our speakers a small honorarium for their time. Thanks to funding from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, we were able to make that happen. Our event brings together a wide variety of visual science communicators together—primarily from the New York City area—to learn about the topic from many different angles.

Which brings me to Lesson 4: We're stronger together

I'd like to tip my hat to platforms and communities that encourage idea and tool sharing. I've grown a great deal by seeing the data visualization community problem solve in real time on Twitter, watching panel discussions about technology and interaction through the lens of ethics at Eyeo Festival, listening to talks about the open web at OpenVisConf, learning about how visual journalists from around the world solve problems at the Malofiej World infographics Summit,….the list is too long to call them all out individually here, but I've included some of my favorites in my general resource list.

There's certainly already evidence of lesson crossover between communities. For example, the idea of using annotations in information graphics has infiltrated the data visualization world, as demonstrated by tools developed in 2017 by data visualization engineer Susie Lu. Her work facilitates annotation integration for charts built with code.

And you could argue that the photo-real versus non-photo-real dynamic in scientific illustration, is mirrored by the complex versus simple dynamic in data visualization.

But I think we still have so much to learn from each other, especially when it comes to the challenge of visualizing scientific uncertainty—a communications challenge that cuts across all areas of science, and thus, all areas of science visualization.

At the magazine, we often work with academics and research scientists. Communities that regularly fall back on conventions like error bars. And all too often, I faithfully reproduce those error bars (shown here in gray), figuring that adding a few labels might be enough to unpack meaning.

The same goes for confidence intervals, like these. I'm not convinced that I did enough here to really help the reader fully understand what they're looking at.

A few years ago, I had a pivotal conversation with a cartographer at a Gordon Research Conference for visualization in science and education. Diana Sinton (from Cornell University) caused me to step back, and think about how I depict uncertainty more critically. We kicked off a collaboration, with support by a mini grant funded by NASA that resulted in this poster presentation, in the hopes of adding another perspective to the broader conversation on visualizing uncertainty.

At the time, conversations with regards to uncertainty tended to swirl around climate projections, but more recently, I think it's fair to say that election forecasting has taken center stage.

We started by diving into the literature, and that got me wondering, in data visualization, do we lean too heavily on conventions like the whisker box plot, error bars, and violin plots? And are conversations about which of these approaches are better than others too circular in nature?

What if we borrowed from qualitative, rather than quantitative examples? At Scientific American, we deal with representing different types of uncertainty all the time across different disciplines in explanatory diagrams. Can we borrow from those, and apply to data visualization?

What if data visualizers took inspiration from scientific illustrators? And scientific illustrators took inspiration from data visualizers? Maybe we could work together to figure out more intuitive ways to represent statistical uncertainty.

Quantum mechanics, and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle seems like a great place to start. Specifically, the idea that “events at the atomic level cannot be observed with certainty.” It's worth underscoring that the uncertainty principle describes quantum behavior and uncertainty at the particle level. And isn't a perfect analogy for uncertainty at the macro or classical physics level. 

But I'm more concerned with how we *illustrate* the uncertainty associated with the idea. So I think that studying figures like this one, which depict quantum mechanics, can still be really useful beyond the quantum world.

I don't want to get too bogged down in the science behind many of these examples, and truth be told, I only have a fleeting grasp on some of the physics they represent. But I still think that they can be informative, and hopefully inspiring. On the left, the classical view of light as a combination of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. On the right, light as viewed through the lens of quantum mechanics—in which that line fluctuates within a larger envelope of uncertainty (shaded region).

The level of uncertainty not only varies over space, but also varies over time. Here's a neat example of three different ways to visualize that concept.

Neuroscience is another field filled with uncertainty. Here, regions of the brain are labeled like mountain ranges on a map. No clear boundaries are drawn because the boundaries aren't precisely known.

Around 70 years later, some structures and functions are known with greater precision. But we still rely on fuzzy edges quite a lot.

Here's another strategy for dealing with the uncertain geography of the brain. The entire structure is abstracted.

And here, the brain is rendered realistically, but process arrows float above the structure, suggesting that the exact details of those interactions are still a work in progress.

I think that this one (from 1969) is my favorite. Brain inputs—A B and C—and outputs —X, Y, and Z—are more or less understood. However, “far less is known about the workings of regions in between, which make up most of the brain.”

And those of you working in the realm of animal reconstructions have to deal with the challenge of building forms based on incomplete information all of the time. Here, artist Rudolf Freund uses strong line-work to signal what is known, and lighter line-work to signal what is uncertain.

And many of us deal with illustrating processes that aren't yet fully understood, or hypotheses that aren't yet proven. Sometimes it may make sense to simply resort to the use of a question mark and inset box, to help flag that a particular interpretation is still not fully embraced.

I'm not trying to suggest that the samples I just shared are perfect examples of visualizing uncertainty. But I think it would be exciting to see how qualitative solutions in general might inform quantitative solutions, and vice-versa.

So with that, I'll end with a request.

I hope that you'll join me in thinking on the topic of visualizing uncertainty, as well as developing other ways of strengthening ties and sharing lessons across the broader world of science visualization.

Polestar, according to the original mission statement, is an electric premium brand that puts performance and design at its core. To which we might also add “it's not Tesla” as an increasingly potent selling point.

New boss Michael Lohscheller, to the best of our knowledge, has never waved a chainsaw around in a meeting, but he's certainly prioritizing efficiencies and commercial uplift—and he needs to.

Polestar sold 44,851 cars globally last year, a 15 percent decline compared to 2023, but retail sales are up by 76 percent in Q1 this year (from relatively small volumes), bolstered by the arrival of the 3 and 4—and Elon Musk's monumental hubris.

The fact remains, though, that while the brand's gross margin has now thankfully flipped from negative to positive, Polestar has still lost a thumping $190 million so far this year, while securing $1.7 billion in credit since end of last year. The 4 is very much here as part of the plan to reverse such fortunes, and as this model isn't made in China it can look to US consumers for help.

The lack of a rear windscreen is a bold design choice.

The 4 bears the imprimatur of Polestar's rigorous design-oriented philosophy. The previous boss, Thomas Ingenlath, rose to prominence from the automotive design world, and his de facto number two, Max Missoni (now a senior designer at BMW), was tasked with delivering a coupe svelteness that the 4's underfloor battery and overall architecture didn't readily lend itself it to.

The solution, then, is eye-catching. Move the header rail back so that it sits behind the second row occupants' heads rather than above them, creating an unusually generous amount of headroom in the rear. Luxuriate in the benefits brought by a wheelbase that's a solitary millimeter shy of three meters. Then delete the back window.

The result is a pleasingly fastback silhouette and a uniquely cocooning rear compartment. Any incipient claustrophobia is offset by the presence of a huge panoramic roof and the option of electro-chromatic glass.

The interior, however, is the best yet from Polestar.

Polestar 4

Polestar is strong on materials and ambient lighting; the colorways are inspired by the solar system, and there's a choice of a 3D-knitted textile or ethically sourced Nappa leather. The quasi-coupe configuration also brings marginal gains to the car's aero numbers which in turn enhances the overall range.

But what of the driver? Much depends on how wedded you are to the idea of over-your-shoulder vision and a traditional rear window. The Polestar 4 circumvents visibility issues by fitting a digital rear-view mirror (from US supplier Gentex) which uses a feed from a hi-def camera mounted on the roof.

Land Rover has been using similar tech for years now, yet the jury's still out. The image is crisp enough, but it takes a second or two for the eyes to focus on it. It's jarring, risks ocular strain, and struggles a bit at night. Losing that back window also means you end up relying on the door mirrors more than usual. As you do if ever you find yourself driving a van, an allusion that doesn't chime with Polestar's aspirations.

Pinning those down isn't the work of a moment. Long gone are the days of Polestar being Volvo's electric sibling. It's probably best to think of it now as Volvo's sassier cousin, although the EX90 and ES90 suggest that the mothership is in no mood to cede design or technology leadership to the upstart start-up. The 4 actually uses a different platform to other Polestars, this one supplied by its Chinese Geely parent, and known as SEA1 (it stands for Sustainable Experience Architecture, and it's used by the Zeekr 001 and 009, the Lynk & Co Z10, and the joint venture Ji Yue 01, among others.)

Real world range on the Polestar 4 will be well below 300 miles.

Two versions of the Polestar 4 are available, both using a 94 kWh battery (useable) and 400 volt architecture (Polestar says an upgrade to 800 is likely at some point). The Long Range single motor car delivers 268 bhp, an official range of 385 miles (WLTP), and gets to 62 mph (100km/h) in 7.1 seconds. WIRED's test car is the Long Range dual motor, which adds an identically sized motor on the front axle for 544 bhp overall, 367 miles of claimed range, and dispatches 62 mph in just 3.8 seconds. It costs £66,990 in the UK ($74,300 in the US, with Plus and Performance Packs included.)

Rivals include the Audi Q6 e-tron, Porsche Macan electric, and the Tesla Model Y. These are all impressive machines in various ways, but the Polestar manages to locate the thing that eludes so many EVs: personality. The dual-motor version gains adaptive damping so it feels better planted on the road, and fidgets less over surface imperfections compared to the more stiffly sprung single motor car.

Polestar lets you choose between three different steering settings, and while none feels truly authentic, the heaviest mode is perhaps the best resolved. It's a satisfying car to drive quickly, if a little more buttoned-up than the Macan Electric. The blend of regenerative and friction braking is also astutely done.

Option the Plus Pack and you get bigger wheels and tires and more “engineered” handling. But that extra dynamic precision hurts the range, which hovers well south of 300 miles during our time with the car. In terms of charging, the 4 takes around 30 mins to go from 10 to 80 percent on a 200 kW charger. The full suite of advanced driver assistance is available, Polestar's kinship with Volvo bequeathing it with a palpable sense of structural integrity. You need to option the Pilot Pack to gain adaptive cruise control, though.

Back inside, the 4 remixes the available tech to deliver what might be the most agreeable Polestar interior so far. Key information sits in a smaller 10.2-inch display for the driver, while the central screen measures 15.4 inches across and is now landscape rather than portrait.

Two things to note: while the 4 foolishly (and potentially dangerously) still asks you to delve into the screen to adjust the steering wheel and door mirrors, there are at least proper stalks for the indicators and wipers, and a physical on/off/volume control rotary switch between the seats. All is not lost, after all.

The 4 uses Android Automotive OS, but benefits from a more intuitive menu set-up than the Polestar 3 thanks in part to the screen's landscape orientation. There are useful shortcuts for the ADAS, and Google apps and services, including Maps and Assistant, are built-in. That brings battery-minded route planning, live updates and route-to-car functionality. Android Automotive and Apple CarPlay are also available (so it seems hopeful that at some point soon this might be upgraded to CarPlay Ultra), as is a digital key that syncs with smartphones for up to six designated users. Keep Climate and Animal Mode maintains a selected temperature on the air con if you or your dog is sitting in the car for up to eight hours. But who would do that?

Polestar still has much work to do settling jittery investors, but the product is undeniably strong. What's more, as the 4 is manufactured in South Korea (at a Renault Korea Motors plant in Busan) this allows Polestar to avoid the Trump administration's volatile China tariffs when exporting to the US.

Yes, the 4's idiosyncratic design answers a question that few—if any—were asking, but the rest of it feels contemporary, solid and stylish. No mission creep here. And if Lohscheller's latest strategy of poaching disgruntled Tesla owners with discounts works, the brand's financial fortunes will hopefully improve further, too.

During a recent cabinet meeting, President Donald Trump's then national security adviser, Mike Waltz, must have been bored. Apparently unaware of the photographer behind him, he was caught clandestinely checking his Signal messages under the table.

Only he wasn't using the official Signal app, which is widely considered to be the gold standard of encrypted messaging apps. He was actually using a clone of Signal called TeleMessage Signal, or TM SGNL. This app, made by TeleMessage (which was recently acquired by Smarsh), works in almost exactly the same way as Signal, except that it also archives copies of all the messages passing through it, shattering all of its security guarantees.

Two days after the photo of Waltz was published, an anonymous source told me that they had hacked TeleMessage. “I would say the whole process took about 15 to 20 minutes,” the hacker said, as Joseph Cox and I reported in 404 Media. “It wasn't much effort at all.” Representatives from TeleMessage and Smarsh did not respond to a request for comment.

The exploit that the hacker used was incredibly simple. At the time, we chose not to publish any details about it because it would be so easy for others to replicate. Since then, TeleMessage has temporarily suspended all services, which is now why WIRED can share exactly how this hack took place without risking anyone's private data.

“I first looked at the admin panel secure.telemessage.com and noticed that they were hashing passwords to MD5 on the client side, something that negates the security benefits of hashing passwords, as the hash effectively becomes the password,” the hacker said. (Hashing is a way of cryptographically obfuscating a password stored on a system, and MD5 is an inadequate version of the algorithms used to do so.) Drop Site News has since reported that it appears that this admin panel exposed email addresses, passwords, usernames, and phone numbers to the public.

The weak password hashing, and the fact that the TeleMessage site was programmed with JSP—an early 2000s-era technology for creating web apps in Java—gave the hacker “the impression that their security must be poor.” Hoping to find vulnerable JSP files, the hacker then used feroxbuster, a tool that can quickly find publicly available resources on a website, on secure.telemessage.com.

The hacker also used feroxbuster on archive.telemessage.com, another domain used by TeleMessage, which is where they discovered the vulnerable URL, which ended in /heapdump.

When they loaded this URL, the server responded with a Java heap dump, which is a roughly 150-MB file containing a snapshot of the server's memory at the moment the URL was loaded.

The hacker said they “knew from past experience that heap dumps from web servers” will include the “bodies” of http requests, they said, “and this may include credentials of users logging in.” And for TM SGNL, they did. By downloading a heap dump and then searching for “password,” the hacker could see usernames and passwords of random users.

They tried logging into secure.telemessage.com using a pair of these credentials and discovered that they had just hacked a user with an email address associated with US Customs and Border Protection, one of the agencies implementing Trump's draconian immigration policy. CBP has since confirmed that it was a TeleMessage customer.

After spending a few more minutes digging through the heap dump, the hacker also discovered plaintext chat logs. “I can read Coinbase internal chats, this is incredible,” the hacker said. (Coinbase did not respond to WIRED's request for comment, but did tell 404 Media that “there is no evidence any sensitive Coinbase customer information was accessed or that any customer accounts are at risk, since Coinbase does not use this tool to share passwords, seed phrases, or other data needed to access accounts.”)

At this point, the hacker says they had spent 15 to 20 minutes poking at TeleMessage's servers, and had already compromised one of their federal government customers, along with one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges.

As I discovered from analyzing TM SGNL's source code, TeleMessage apps—like the one running on Mike Waltz's phone—uploaded unencrypted messages to archive.telemessage.com (I call this the archive server), which then forwards the messages to the customer's final destination. This contradicts TeleMessage's public marketing material, where they claimed TM SNGL uses “end-to-end encryption from the mobile phone through to the corporate archive.”

The archive server is programmed in Java and is built using Spring Boot, an open source framework for creating Java applications. Spring Boot includes a set of features called Actuator that helps developers monitor and debug their applications. One of these features is the heap dump endpoint, which is the URL the hacker used to download heap dumps.

According to Spring Boot Actuator's documentation: “Since Endpoints may contain sensitive information, careful consideration should be given about when to expose them.” In the case of TeleMessage's archive server, the heap dumps contained usernames, passwords, unencrypted chat logs, encryption keys, and other sensitive information.

If anyone on the internet had loaded the heap dump URL right as Mike Waltz was texting using the TM SGNL app, the heap dump file would have contained his unencrypted Signal messages, too.

A 2024 post on the cloud security company Wiz's blog lists “Exposed HeapDump file” as the number one common misconfiguration in Spring Boot Actuator. “Up until version 1.5 (released in 2017), the /heapdump endpoint was configured as publicly exposed and accessible without authentication by default. Since then, in later versions Spring Boot Actuator has changed its default configuration to expose only the /health and /info endpoints without authentication (these are less interesting for attackers),” the author wrote. “Despite this improvement, developers often disable these security measures for diagnostic purposes when deploying applications to test environments, and this seemingly small configuration change may remain unnoticed and thereby persist when an application is pushed to production, inadvertently allowing attackers to obtain unauthorized access to critical data.”

In a 2020 post on Walmart's Global Tech Blog, another developer gave a similar warning. “Apart from /health and /info, all actuator endpoints are risky to open to end users because they can expose application dumps, logs, configuration data and controls,” the author wrote. “The actuator endpoints have security implications and SHOULD NEVER EVER be exposed in production environment.”

The hacker's quick exploit of TeleMessage indicates that the archive server was badly misconfigured. It was either running an eight-year-old version of Spring Boot, or someone had manually configured it to expose the heap dump endpoint to the public internet.

This is why it took a hacker about 20 minutes of prodding before it cracked open, with sensitive data spilling out.

Despite this critical vulnerability and other security issues with TeleMessage's products—most notably, that the Israeli firm that builds the products can access all its customer's chat logs in plaintext—someone in the Trump administration deployed it to Mike Waltz's phone while he was serving as national security adviser.

Graduation season is here. May is typically reserved for college grads getting ready to start their first season of adulthood, but June is when most high school seniors across the country walk across a stage to snag their diplomas. But shopping for Gen Z teens can be difficult and slightly scary. We've put together a hand-picked list to make things simple, whether it's something they can use for a summer trip, their first semester of college, or a new job.

Don't see anything here you like? Check out our other buying guides, like the Best Viral TikTok Gifts, Best Laptop Backpacks, Best MacBook Accessories, and Best Wireless Headphones.

Kodak

Amazon

Walmart

Best Buy

I recently went to a bar with some friends and couldn't believe the number of point-and-shoot cameras people were using for selfies and group photos—there wasn't an iPhone in sight. It's likely your grad would love a digital camera. I've been using this one from Kodak for about a year now. It has a 16-MP CMOS sensor, a 27-mm wide-angle lens (with 4X optical zoom), along with face detection and red-eye removal. It can record 1080p video as well. It produces really fun, retro-looking photos that bring me back to when I was in high school.

Amazon

If your grad always has a book in their hand or never travels without one, this Kindle is the perfect choice. It's lightweight, easy to hold with one hand, and fits into a small purse or bag (so it's easy to travel with). The high contrast ratio, bright front light, and faster page-turn rate make it a joy to read on for long periods. It also comes in a really cute Matcha color that's tough not to love. You should also check out our Best Kindle Accessories guide to tack on a few more fun items.

JBL

Amazon

Best Buy

JBL's Clip 5 is a great Bluetooth speaker for summer outings—your grad can attach it to their bike, belt loop, or backpack using the wide carabiner. There's rich detail and definition in the sound quality, which can be tweaked using JBL's Portable app. With a dust- and water-resistant body, they won't have to baby it. Buy two, and they can pair them via Auracast for stereo sound.

Bose

Amazon

Walmart

Bose

Whether it's for travel, reading, or studying, a solid pair of noise-canceling headphones can make all the difference. The QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are currently our favorite in our Best Noise-Canceling Headphones guide. They deliver top-tier noise canceling, clear and punchy sound, and good customization options, built into a sleek and elegant design. These are headphones that they can keep using for years.

Motorola

Amazon (Ultra)

Amazon (Razr)

Best Buy (Ultra)

Best Buy (Razr)

What's old is gold, and the kids now love flip phones. Except they're not dumb flip phones (those are popular too). No, these are smartphones that bend in half, making them easy to stuff in ever-shrinking pockets and purses. Motorola's latest Razr 2025 phones are our current favorite folding flip phones (8/10, WIRED Recommends). The Razr 2025 is a great place to start, and it sells at a shockingly reasonable $700. But if your grad is particular about photo and video quality, you may want to upgrade them to the Razr Ultra. They can even hold it in Camcorder mode to capture fond memories, like the good old days.

reMarkable

Amazon (With Marker Plus and Book Folio)

ReMarkable (With Marker)

ReMarkable (with Marker Plus)

For the grad who is constantly jotting down random thoughts, mapping out to-do lists, or prefers hand-written notes, a digital notebook is an excellent choice, and they won't run out of pages. The ReMarkable 2, the top pick in our Best Digital Notebooks guide, has a matte screen that feels like paper, and writing on it is quick and responsive. They can organize different notebooks or quick sheets and sort them via folders and tags.

The stylus doesn't need to be recharged, and it attaches to the side of the tablet magnetically. For an extra $50, there's the Marker Plus upgrade, which adds an eraser on the other end of the stylus. ReMarkable offers a keyboard attachment ($199) as well, which feels satisfying to type on (distraction-free) and doubles as a notebook cover.

Nintendo

Walmart

Best Buy

Target

GameStop

You could buy your grad the Nintendo Switch we all know and love, or you can surprise them with the next-gen Switch 2. It launches on June 5, and it's going to be the hot item of the summer. The catch is you'll have to try and snag a preorder one now, and stock is thin (though there have been restocks). We have a preorder guide you can follow to try and get one, and if you succeed, you'll forever be in their good graces.

The Switch 2 may not look all that different from the original, but it has a larger and sharper 7.9-inch screen, a more powerful processor, and graphics to bring it up to speed for modern-day games. We have not reviewed the console yet, but you can read our in-depth hands-on experience here. Make sure you snag the bundle with Mario Kart World so they can play with their friends all summer long.

PopSockets

Amazon

Best Buy

Popsockets

Portable batteries are great for when you need to juice up your phone while on the go. But they can feel awkward to hold when attached to the back. PopSocket's MagSafe PowerPack comes with a grip. That way, your grad can hold their phone comfortably while it's charging. The battery has a 5,000-mAh capacity along with an LED on the side to see how much power is left. It recharges via USB-C. Read our Best MagSafe Power Banks guide for more.



Amazon

Target

Aura

Graduating from high school can be bittersweet, as everyone goes their separate ways to start new lives. With a digital photo frame, grads can pack it with photos from their high school years and summer adventures. Aura's digital frames have high-quality displays and unlimited photo storage. The device is controlled through the app, so they don't have to mess around with the unit itself. They can heart photos or scroll through them using the touch bar on top. With support for Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, some features can be controlled via voice assistant.

Casetify

Amazon

Casetify

If your giftee received a shiny new car for graduation (lucky!), then this wireless car charger is the perfect accessory. It's easy to install into the car vents, has MagSafe support (with a USB-C cable), and an adjustable ball joint to set it at various viewing angles. With Qi2 support, it'll charge the iPhone at a 15-watt rate, which is speedier than most wireless chargers. The best part, however, is all the fun designs you can pick from.



Amazon

Smart lighting panels are great, but they're not ideal for dorms, as there's a risk of damaging the wall when moving out. This smart lamp can be placed on a desk or nightstand instead. It's easy to set up, and the 3-inch hexagonal panels can be reconfigured into any shape. Using the app, your grad can pick from a range of solid colors and effects. The panels will also react to music and voice commands.



Fjallraven

Amazon (only in Graphite color)

There's nothing like getting a new backpack for the start of college. This Fjallraven bag can fit a 14-inch MacBook Pro in its laptop pocket, while the large compartment can hold a notebook, a thick planner, and lunch. The small front pocket can fit an e-reader, chargers, or other accessories. It's a great bag for upcoming summer travel as well. You can even customize it with colors you know your giftee will like.

Logitech

Amazon

Best Buy

Walmart

Logitech

I would've loved to have the Logitech Casa Pop-up Desk (9/10, WIRED Recommends) in college, specifically for those long nights at the library. This portable system has a small keyboard, trackpad, and a carrying case that doubles as a laptop stand. All the accessories have a dedicated slot in the case that keeps everything neat and makes it convenient to travel with. The ProtoArc XKM01 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is a more affordable option that isn't as cute, but also comes with a keyboard, mouse, and laptop stand that folds neatly into a carrying case.

SimpleHuman

Amazon

Simplehuman

Your grad may soon be living with roommates for the first time in their life. When I did, I rarely had access to the bathroom to do my makeup. Investing in a makeup mirror was a game changer because I could get ready on my own accord, without knocking on a bathroom door. This smart mirror from SimpleHuman has a built-in sensor that automatically illuminates a ring light around the mirror when your grad moves in front of it, and the light is adjustable. With 10X magnification, it's great for detailed makeup that requires precision (like applying eyeliner or blending eye shadow).



Plum Paper

Whether it's for a summer job, a fun trip, or their freshman semester of college, a new grad can't turn away a new planner. The A5 from Plum Planner offers several different layouts and covers to pick from, with the option to customize it by adding their name or the year. You can also have it start on any month, so they won't have to skip months or wait to use it.

Bandolier

Bandolier

This is the only phone lanyard that isn't ugly. Plus, it's Taylor Swift-approved in case your grad is a Swiftie. The case has a cardholder built into the back, along with a mini pouch attached to the strap that can hold earbuds, keys, and chapstick. Most importantly, it looks super chic and eliminates the need for a purse. I prefer the black and gold version because it's easy to match with most outfits, but it's also available in black/silver and pastel matcha.

BAGGU

Amazon

BAGGU

MoMA (Keith Haring Edition)

Baggu's Duck Tote has a horizontal design that fits a larger laptop (up to 15 inches) but still leaves room for additional things like a book or planner, a 32-ounce water bottle, a phone, and more. Your grad can carry it using the top handles or across their body with the adjustable strap. It's machine washable, which is great for accidental coffee spills or stains.



Helix

Although summer is usually the best time for relaxing, some grads might already be feeling the anxiety that comes with starting a new school or job. A good weighted blanket can help ease that. This one from Helix has an open-knit design that's breathable but rigid. That way, the weight doesn't drape itself off you and drag toward the floor. With plenty of airflow, it doesn't get too hot either. You'll have the choice between 10 and 15 pounds, along with a bunch of color options.

Dash

Amazon

Walmart

Target

Wayfair

A popcorn maker can be used for many different occasions: movie nights, game nights, study sessions in college, sleepovers—the list goes on. This one from Dash is a great kitchen companion. Scoop the kernels in, add butter to the tray (the measuring cup doubles as a melting tray), press the button, and watch kernels turn to popcorn. It's also compact, so it won't take up too much room on a countertop. These retro popcorn containers (which I use exclusively when I make popcorn) make for a fun add-on.

Brümate

Amazon

BruMate

This water bottle is a lifesaver for the giftee who is clumsy and prone to spilling drinks. It comes with a leakproof straw lid that has three modes, including open, locked, and centered (which allows you to remove the straw). BrüMate claims it's 100 percent leakproof, but some water might spill out from the sides if they're mixing flavored powders into it. Aside from that, it won't spill if they accidentally knock it over or carry it in a bag (propped up). It's cup-holder friendly and dishwasher safe as well.

Nutribullet

Amazon

Best Buy

Nutribullet

Wayfair

Graduation is usually followed by a busy summer of parties and hangouts before everyone leaves for college, where the schedule is even more hectic. Having a powerful blender on hand is great for making quick, protein-filled smoothies for when they don't have time to sit down for a full meal. Nutribullet's 1200 Pro+ has 1,200 watts of power that crushes ice, berries, nut butter, and more. There's also a separate pulse setting that offers more flexibility when blending.

The Trump administration and congressional officials are scrutinizing a deal between Apple and Alibaba that would bring Alibaba-powered AI features to iPhones sold in China, according to The New York Times.

Citing anonymous sources, the NYT says White House officials and members of the House Select Committee on China have asked Apple executives directly about the deal, with questions focused on what data would be shared with Alibaba and whether the company was making any commitments to Chinese regulators. The executives were reportedly unable to answer most of those questions.

In a statement, Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi (the ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence) described Alibaba as “a poster child for the Chinese Communist Party's military-civil fusion strategy” and said it was “extremely disturbing” that Apple had “not been transparent about its agreement.”

The deal itself has only been publicly confirmed by Alibaba, not Apple. This is far from the only challenge that rising tensions between the United States and China presents to the iPhone maker's business, as the company faces on-again, off-again tariffs.

I've tested out a number of e-bikes in my time here at TechCrunch.  And I've never been so tempted to hang onto one as I have with Heybike's new Alpha.

This sturdy, fat-tire, all-terrain e-bike is worth the $1,699 price tag. The Alpha ticked a whole lot of my boxes, including ones I didn't even know I had. For instance, I knew I'd like an e-bike with pedal assist and a throttle, but I didn't know that I would love an e-bike with pedal assist, a throttle, and a manual shifter. Perhaps the dreamiest part of riding the Alpha was the mid-drive motor with torque sensor, which led to a more natural riding feel. That, and the battery life that seemed to last forever. 

It wasn't all roses and rainbows. I have a few complaints about the app, setting up the bike, and the outsized horn. But generally, this is an excellent all around e-bike,  whether you want to take it on off-road adventures or use it in the city to do your weekly Trader Joe's shopping.And then there is the question of how long this bike will remain affordable. Heybike is Chinese manufacturer and its bikes are made in China. With tariffs, even at the recently lowered rate, these bikes are likely to get more expensive for U.S. consumers.

The Alpha is Heybike's first with its made-in-house Galaxy eDrive system, which uses a 500W Mivice mid-drive motor alongside a 680Wh battery, which provides a smooth ride. 

Most other e-bikes I've tried are built with motors mounted in the wheel hub, which makes for a simpler, more affordable design. A mid-drive motor is located near the pedals, and if you can get a bike like that at a decent price? Take it. Because not everyone wants to buy a Bafang conversion kit and build their own cheap mid-drive. 

Even at the fifth and highest level of pedal assist, the Alpha is smooth and easy to control, making you feel like you're pedaling a traditional push bike. There's nothing jerky about the acceleration.

There are downsides to the mid-drive, though. If you're the type of rider who likes to lean heavy on the throttle, then Heybike's Alpha is probably not for you. A company spokesperson told me Heybike doesn't encourage sole throttle use, especially at the start of a ride, because it could damage the motor and drive train.

And with the Alpha, you actually can't start a ride with the throttle. You have to pedal first and build up to at least 5 miles per hour before the throttle will engage. When you do use the throttle, the speed adjusts based on what pedal assist level you're on. Though even at the highest level, the top speed while using the throttle only reaches 20 miles per hour. That said, you can push it up to 28 miles per hour while pedaling. 

I didn't find the throttle constraints to be too much of a problem. Of course, there were those occasional moments while riding through the chaotic streets of New York City when I wanted the quick getaway that a sensitive throttle would provide. Still, I found the pedal assist was responsive enough. 

And with 105 N m of torque, it was also powerful. I rarely found myself needing to take it off the first level. The addition of the Shimano Altus 8-gear shifter helped augment that power. The shifter let me kick it up to a higher gear on flat terrain and bring it back down to a low gear when climbing hills; this meant I could keep the pedal assist at 1 to save on battery power. 

And while I'm on the subject of hills, it's worth noting that the Alpha handled inclines like an absolute champ, once again due to the mid-drive motor. 

The Alpha's UL certified batteries allow for up to 60 miles of range on a single charge, though I wouldn't be surprised if they surpassed that. After removing the battery to charge it once (which ended up being an ordeal that I'll describe below), I took the bike on several trips around the neighborhood and up various hills, probably riding for a total of 22 miles. The battery life on the LCD mid-mounted screen somehow didn't drop below 100%. 

That could have something to do with the Galaxy eDrive, which seemed to have a regenerative braking system that provided power back to the battery whenever I braked. Heybike says its Galaxy system provides more than 8% of additional range compared to batteries of the same capacity.

The Alpha could probably double as a cargo bike for delivery riders. It comes with a rear rack that was more than sufficient to strap three packed bags of groceries, though I could have just as easily attached one of those large food delivery boxes. 

It also has a total payload of 400 pounds. That's the same amount as the Pedego cargo bike I tested last year, which is twice the price and also twice as heavy. Heybike's Alpha isn't exactly a small bike that can be tucked away easily in a NYC apartment, but with its aluminum alloy frame, it wasn't too heavy or clunky at 71 pounds. 

And while the 26 X 4 inch fat tires are great for traipsing over gravel and tree roots, they're just as good at handling the potholes and uneven road surfaces of NYC. Not only the tires, but the bouncy hydraulic front fork suspension took most of the blows from some of those roads and made it easy for me to hop on and off sidewalks. 

The Alpha was not without its challenges. For one, there was a decent amount of setup involved when the bike was delivered, which required careful squinting at a QR-code instruction manual. 

If you're not in the habit of putting bike parts together (which I am not), you're liable to get a few things wrong. I had the help of two lovely colleagues at my office, but when I hit the road something still felt off. I took it to a bike shop where the mechanic shook his head empathetically and made some tweaks, including to the handlebars which I hadn't installed in the correct position.

I also struggled with removing the battery cover from the down tube. It just wouldn't come off! I tried looking up an instructional video on YouTube, but all I could find was an annoying 16-second remove and install battery ASMR video from Heybike. In the end, I had to jimmy the cover open, and found that someone appeared to have screwed that latch the wrong way, hindering the release of the metal cover. I screwed it back on the right way so it could be clicked in properly.

But then, more battery cover drama. After a few rides, the cover started popping off half-way mid-ride. I'd clip it back in, hit a bump, and there it went again. Figuring that I likely messed something up while fiddling with the battery cover, I taped it in place and called it a day.

Another downvote for the Alpha was the horn. My god, it was loud. Imagine trying to annoy someone by yelling “HOOOONNNKKK” at them loudly. That's what the horn sounded like. It was so aggressive that I was embarrassed to use it to alert pedestrians or other riders when I was passing, lest I scare the crap out of them. It did come in handy when I wanted to symbolically flip off cars that entered the bike lane, though. 

The app was also unimpressive. It could turn the bike off, but it couldn't turn it on, because the bike needed to be on already to connect to the app via bluetooth. The app could also turn on and off the front headlight (which was very bright, by the way), as well as record and share any trip data. Personally, I think e-bike apps are only worth using if they give you live tracking, anti-theft, and alarms.   

There aren't many colors to choose from. In fact, if you want a step-through, you're getting it in white. And if you want a step-over frame, you'd better be happy with black. 

A final note on the addition of turn signals: they worked fine, but I almost never remembered to use them. 

All in all, I thought the Heybike Alpha was a solid ride, particularly for the price point. Usually a bike with the Alpha's specs will run you anywhere from $2,000 to $4,500, so it's a pretty good deal. Though that issue with the battery cover did raise some red flags about quality issues, and if I had ridden it longer, I wonder what other issues might have arisen. 

The affordable price tag could be based on poor customer service, based on reviews online, though I couldn't personally speak to that. All I know is that it was one of the smoothest, easiest fat-tire e-bikes I've had the pleasure of riding.

The Voynich Manuscript is a 15th-century book written in an unknown script. No one's been able to translate it, and many think it's a hoax, a cipher, or a constructed language. I wasn't trying to decode it — I just wanted to see: does it behave like a structured language?I stripped a handful of common suffix-like endings (aiin, dy, etc.) to isolate what looked like root forms. I know that's a strong assumption — I call it out directly in the repo — but it helped clarify the clustering. From there, I used SBERT embeddings and KMeans to group similar roots, inferred POS-like roles based on position and frequency, and built a Markov transition matrix to visualize cluster-to-cluster flow.It's not translation. It's not decryption. It's structural modeling — and it revealed some surprisingly consistent syntax across the manuscript, especially when broken out by section (Botanical, Biological, etc.).GitHub repo: https://github.com/brianmg/voynich-nlp-analysis

The traditional NLP techniques of stripping suffices and POS identification may actually harm embedding quality than improvement, since that removes relevant contextual data from the global embedding.

The author made an assumption that Voynichese is a Germanic language, and it looks like he was able to make some progress with it.I've also come across accounts that it might be an Uralic or Finno-Ugric language. I think your approach is great, and I wonder if tweaking it for specific language families could go even further.

I didn't re-map anything back to glyphs in this project — everything's built off those EVA transliterations as a starting point. So if ""okeeodair"" exists in the dataset, that's because someone much smarter than me saw a sequence of glyphs and agreed to call it that.

Reference mapping each cluster to all the others would be a nice way to indicate that there's no variability left in your analysis


reply



And yes to the cross-cluster reference idea — I didn't build a similarity matrix between clusters, but now that you've said it, it feels like an obvious next step to test how much signal is really being captured.Might spin those up as a follow-up. Appreciate the thoughtful nudge.

I have no background in NLP or linguistics, but I do have a question about this:> I stripped a set of recurring suffix-like endings from each word — things like aiin, dy, chy, and similar variantsThis seems to imply stripping the right-hand edges of words, with the assumption that the text was written left to right? Or did you try both possibilities?Once again, nice work.

Chargers are one of those everyday items you don't think about until they break, disappear, or stop working as fast as they used to. Whether it's the cord fraying, the adapter running hot, or simply not charging your phone as quickly as it should, most of us have had at least one frustrating experience with a cheap or aging charger. That's why having a couple of good, reliable backups is always a smart move. And you don't have to spend an arm and a leg to get a great one.

Check out Amazon right now to get the Anker iPhone 16 Charger 2-Pack for just $14, down from its usual price of $19. That's 26% off and $5 off. And no matter how you slice it, two chargers for less than $20 is a great deal.

See at Amazon

Each charger delivers 20 watts of power, which is great for quickly charging newer iPhones, iPads, and other USB-C-compatible devices. If you've ever noticed that your phone seems to charge slowly with older adapters, it's likely because they don't support modern fast-charging standards. With these Anker chargers, you'll get back to 50% battery in around 30 minutes on most iPhones, which can be a lifesaver when you're in a hurry.

They're also compact and travel-friendly. The low-profile design makes them easy to toss into a bag or keep in a travel pouch without adding bulk. Whether you want one for the bedroom and one for the office, or need an extra for your travel setup, having two means you're covered in more than one spot.

What really sets these apart is reliability. Anker is known for building chargers that don't just work well, but they last. You also get built-in safety features like temperature regulation and short-circuit protection, so you're not putting your phone or tablet at risk every time you plug it in. So you can count on them to be available when you need them without running out or fizzling out somehow.

At $13.99 for two, it's a no-brainer. These chargers are great for everyday use, for keeping in your suitcase, or for giving to a family member who's always asking to borrow yours. You might not get excited about a charger, but when it's fast, compact, and dependable, especially for just $14, it's a great price. That's $7 apiece, and where else are you going to get a deal like this one?

Saturn's most metal moon just got more intriguing. On Titan, clouds of methane unleash a cold, oily rain—very different from the water-based downpours we see on Earth. For the first time, scientists have collected evidence of cloud convection in Titan's northern hemisphere, observing the moon's methane clouds shifting over time above its eerie lakes.

By combining data from the Webb space telescope and the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, a group of scientists observed Titan's clouds rising to higher altitudes over time. This new discovery marks the first time cloud convection is seen taking place in the moon's northern hemisphere, where most of Titan's lakes and seas of liquid methane are located. The findings are detailed in a study published this week in the journal Nature.

“This enables us to better understand Titan's climate cycle, how the methane clouds may generate rain and replenish methane evaporated from the lakes,” Conor Nixon, research scientist with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and lead author of the study, said in a statement.

Titan is the only moon in the solar system to host a substantial atmosphere, but Saturn's largest moon is shrouded with a layer of yellowish smog. To probe different depths in Titan's atmosphere, the scientists used various infrared filters on Webb and Keck to estimate the altitudes of the clouds. The team behind the study observed Titan in November 2022 and July 2023, capturing clouds in the moon's mid and high northern latitudes. Using space and ground-based observations, the scientists observed the clouds as they appeared to move to higher altitudes over a period of days. They were, however, not able to directly see any precipitation occurring.

Titan is the only other place in the solar system known to have an Earth-like cycle of liquids, with rain pouring from clouds and flowing across its surface, filling lakes and seas, and evaporating back into the sky, according to NASA. But instead of water, Titan has liquid methane and ethane.

The strange moon is of high interest to astronomers as it holds complex organic chemistry despite its frigid temperatures and gaseous bodies of water. Organic molecules are among the building blocks of life on Earth, and studying Titan helps scientists better understand how different lifeforms could evolve under drastically different planetary circumstances.

The recent findings also help scientists understand how different worlds evolve over time. “On Titan, methane is a consumable,” Nixon said. “It's possible that it is being constantly resupplied and fizzing out of the crust and interior over billions of years. If not, eventually it will all be gone and Titan will become a mostly airless world of dust and dunes.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Is the New Pope an Environmentalist?","https://gizmodo.com/is-the-new-pope-an-environmentalist-2000602088","Sun, 18 May 2025 10:00:57 GMT","

On a sweltering January day in 2018, Pope Francis addressed 100,000 of the faithful in Puerto Maldonado, Peru, not far from where gold mining had ravaged an expanse of Amazon rainforest about the size of Colorado. “The native Amazonian peoples have probably never been so threatened on their own lands as they are at present,” he told the crowd. He simultaneously condemned extractive industries and conservation efforts that “under the guise of preserving the forest, hoard great expanses of woodland and negotiate with them, leading to situations of oppression for the native peoples.”

Francis denounced the insatiable consumerism that drives the destruction of the Amazon, supported those who say Indigenous peoples' guardianship of their own territories should be respected, and urged everyone to defend isolated tribes. “Their cosmic vision and their wisdom have much to teach those of us who are not part of their culture,” he said.

To Julio Cusurichi Palacios, an Indigenous leader who was in the stadium that day, the words from the head of the Catholic Church — which claims 1.4 billion members and has a long, sordid history of violence against Indigenous peoples worldwide — were welcome and momentous.

“Few world leaders have spoken about our issues, and the pope said publicly the rights of Indigenous peoples were historically violated,” he said after Pope Francis died last month. “Let us hope that the new pope is a person who can continue implementing the position the pope who passed away has been talking about.”

During his 12 years as pontiff, Francis radically reshaped how the world's most powerful religious institution approached the moral and ethical call to protect the planet. Beyond his invocations for Indigenous rights, Francis acknowledged the Church's role in colonization, and considered climate change a moral issue born of rampant consumption and materialism. As the Trump administration dismantles climate action and cuts funding to Indigenous peoples around the world — and far-right politics continues to rise globally — experts see the conclave's selection of Robert Francis Prevost, or Pope Leo XIV as he is now known, as a clear beacon that the faith-based climate justice movement his predecessor led isn't going anywhere.

In 2015, Pope Francis released his historic papal letter, or encyclical, titled Laudato si'. In the roughly 180-page document, he unequivocally identified planet-heating pollution as a pressing global issue disproportionately impacting the world's poor, and condemned the outsize role wealthy countries like the U.S. have in contributing to the climate crisis. With it, Francis did what no pope had done before: He spoke with great clarity and urgency about human degradation of the environment being not just an environmental issue, but a social and moral one. Laudato si' established the definitive connection between faith, climate change, and social justice, and made it a tenet of Catholic doctrine.

“Pope Francis routinely said that we have a throwaway society. We throw away people, we throw away nature … and that we really need a culture that's much more based in care,” said Christopher Cox, executive director of the Seventh Generation Interfaith Coalition for Responsible Investment and a former priest. “That means care for people, especially the most poor, the most vulnerable, the most marginalized. And we also need much greater care for creation. We've been given a beautiful earth and we're consuming it at a rate that goes far beyond what will be able to sustain life for the long term.”

The first Latin American pope, Francis was unique in implicitly embracing some elements of liberation theology, a Catholic social justice movement that calls for the liberation of marginalized peoples from oppression. Although Francis was occasionally critical of the doctrine's Marxist elements and never fully supportive of it, many observers see his statements regarding poor and Indigenous peoples as reflective of the doctrine's central values.

“Right from the beginning of his papacy, that outreach, that recognition of Indigenous ways of being Catholic and Indigenous language in Catholicism, heralded — up to that point — the most expansive official recognition of Indigenous contributions to Catholicism thus far,” said Eben Levey, an assistant professor of history at Alfred University who has studied the relationship between Catholic Church and Indigenous peoples in Latin America. In the centuries since conquistadores arrived in the Americas and forced Indigenous peoples to accept their religion, many Indigenous communities have made Catholicism their own, and a growing number of church leaders have embraced the idea that there are multiple ways of being Catholic and that Catholicism and Indigenous cultures can coexist.

A year after becoming pope, Francis approved the use of two Mayan languages, Tzotzil and Tzeltal, in mass and sacraments like baptism and confession. In 2015 he expanded that list to include the Aztec language Nahuatl, and in 2016, during a visit to Mexico, he celebrated mass in Tzeltal, Tzotzil and Chol.

In 2022, Francis officially apologized to Canada for the residential schools that ripped Indigenous children from their families, leading to the deaths of many who were later buried in unmarked graves. The following year, he rejected the Doctrine of Discovery, a religious concept that colonizers used to justify the illegal seizure of land from Indigenous peoples and became part of an 1823 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that described Native Americans as “savages.”

“The Doctrine of Discovery is not part of the teaching of the Catholic Church,” Pope Francis said, adding that he strongly supports the global implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. He also drew a clear connection between those rights and climate action: In 2023, he made clear that Indigenous peoples are critical to fighting climate change when he said, “Ignoring the original communities in the safeguarding of the Earth is a serious mistake, not to say a great injustice.”

But Pope Francis' progressivism had its limits. In 2019, he called for a meeting of church leaders, known as the Synod of Bishops, for the Pan-Amazon region to address issues affecting the Amazon Basin. Indigenous Catholics who attended brought up illegal logging and violence against land defenders and proposed reforms. “The ancestral wisdom of the aboriginal peoples affirms that mother earth has a feminine face,” reads the document that emerged from the gathering and urged the church to give women more leadership roles and allow married deacons to be ordained as priests. In his response, Francis condemned corporations that destroy the Amazon as committing “injustice and crime,” yet refused to embrace the proposals to make church leadership more inclusive of women and married men.

Francis' climate activism was also riddled in constraint. He transformed how religious institutions viewed the climate crisis, framing a failure to act on it as a brutal injustice toward the most vulnerable, but could have implemented “more direct institutional action,” said Nadia Ahmad, a Barry University School of Law associate professor who has studied faith-based environmental action. Though the former pontiff publicly supported renewable energy adoption, called for fossil fuel disinvestment, and prompted churches across the world to go solar, he did not mandate what he deemed a “radical energy transition” across dioceses, schools, and hospitals. The work he accomplished “could have been amplified a bit more and had more accountability,” said Ahmad.

But that limitation, she noted, likely stemmed from contradictory politics playing out within the church — many traditional, conservative Catholics, particularly in the United States, resisted Francis' progressive teachings. A 2021 study found that over a period of five years, most U.S. bishops were “nearly silent and sometimes even misleading,” in their official messaging to parishioners about climate change and the pope's famed encyclical.

Though Pope Leo XIV has been lauded for his advocacy in defense of immigrants and worker rights — his namesake, Leo XIII, who reigned from 1878 until 1903 is known as a historical Catholic champion of social justice and equality — the new pope's track record on engaging directly with climate change is sparse.

Still, Mary Evelyn Tucker, co-director of the Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology, sees comments the new pope made last year on the need to move “from words to action” as a promising sign that he will continue Francis' commitment to communicating the urgency of a warming world. The timing of the conclave's unprecedented decision to select the first pontiff from the United States, coming amid the Trump administration's sweeping dismissal of climate action, elimination of environmental protections, and attacks on Indigenous rights, isn't lost on her.

“It may be a signal to say ‘America, come back into the world community, come back into a planetary future where we collectively have been working to create a future worthy of our children and our children's children,'” she said.

Leo grew up in Chicago and is a citizen of both the U.S. and Peru, where he spent decades serving as a missionary and bishop before Francis made him a cardinal in 2023. He speaks five languages fluently and some Quechua, an Indigenous Incan language.

While he was working in Peru in the 1990s, Leo was critical of the government's human rights abuses — though he refrained from explicitly taking sides in the political fight between Maoist rebels and the government of then-dictator Alberto Fujimori, according to Matthew Casey, a historian and clinical associate professor at Arizona State University based in Lima. Still, his reaction to the country's authoritarianism could provide a glimpse of what stances he might take as pope, Casey said. “It doesn't matter who was abusing human rights, he was on the side of the people,” he said.

In 2016, the would-be pontiff spoke at a conference in Brazil where attendees talked about threats to the Amazon rainforest and Indigenous peoples who lived there. He praised Francis' encyclical, describing the document as “very important,” and representing “something new in terms of this explicit expression of the church's concern for all of creation.” To Casey, that suggests Pope Leo XIV, like his predecessor, has an awareness of the issues affecting Indigenous peoples, such as the rampant degradation of the environment.

“Both Francis and Prevost are attuned to Indigeneity in ways that they couldn't have been if they worked in Europe or the United States, because the politics of Indigeneity in Latin America are just so different,” Casey said. More than a week after the conclave that named him pope, communities across Peru are still celebrating the selection of Pope Leo XIV.

Francis and Leo's shared experiences working with marginalized communities harmed by colonialism and climate change, and their commitment to the social justice aspects of the church's mission, are particularly meaningful in this political moment, said Levey, the Alfred University historian.

“We are seeing a resurgence of ultra right wing politics globally, and the Catholic Church next to the United Nations is one of the few multilateral organizations perhaps capable of responding in some form or fashion to the questions of our modern age or contemporary moment,” he said.

If you've ever tried to do real work on just a laptop screen, especially when juggling emails, spreadsheets, and video calls, you know it's not exactly ideal. Having a second monitor makes everything easier, but hauling a full-size screen around or finding desk space for it isn't always realistic. That's where portable monitors can hep change your life. Okay, maybe not your life, but perhaps the way you work at home or on the go.

Right now, you can head to Amazon to snag this fantastic 15.6-inch 1080p monitor for just $69, down from its usual price of $129. That's $60 off and a discount of 46%.

See at Amazon

This monitor has a 15.6-inch Full HD IPS display which means it's good-looking no matter the viewing angle you have. It's not a high-end display for color grading or hardcore gaming, but it's more than capable for day-to-day tasks, whether you're checking emails, watching videos, or using it as a screen extension for presentations. And you probably have lamented many times over that you want some more space to show those PowerPoint slides or Excel spreadsheets, undoubtedly.

One of the big benefits here is how lightweight and thin it is: At only 1.7 pounds and less than half an inch thick, it slides easily into a backpack or laptop sleeve. It also comes with a magnetic smart cover that protects the screen when you're on the move and doubles as a stand when you're ready to set it up. It's a simple, thoughtful addition that makes this monitor feel user-friendly right out of the box.

The KYY monitor connects via USB-C or Mini HDMI, so it's compatible with laptops, phones, gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch, and even tablets. You'll find all the necessary cables included, so setup is quick and easy, so you don't need any adapters or extra accessories. That's pretty rare these days, too.

There are also built-in speakers and a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is a nice touch for casual use. The sound isn't going to replace a dedicated speaker, but it's perfectly fine for Zoom calls or watching a few videos.

If you're someone who values extra space whether you're working or playing, this is a great deal that it would behoove you not to miss out on. Just make sure you snag it while it's available at its $69 price before it goes back up, because it's well worth it while it's discounted. You'll find tons of uses for it, maybe more than you know.

Dropping over $4,000 on a laptop is a fantasy for just a handful of affluent consumers, well beyond the means of most shoppers. Yet Amazon is making the impossible possible by offering the new HP Pavilion 16 touchscreen laptop originally priced at $4,199 and currently available at an incredible 72% discount for just $1,169. You can have this top-of-the-line piece of hardware in your hands with a discount of more than $3,000. Windows 11 Pro, Microsoft Office Pro lifetime, a charger and a mouse are also included.

See at Amazon

Powered by the Intel Core Ultra 7 155U processor, the 2025 HP laptop features a 12-core CPU with a base clock speed of 1.3 GHz and turbo speed up to 4.3 GHz which delivers robust performance for everything from daily productivity to more demanding applications. The onboard Intel Arc Graphics with 4 cores offers crisp graphics and decent graphics performance well adequate for creativity and media consumption. Processor balancing is done by 32GB of fast LPDDR5 RAM for smooth multitasking and rapid handling of demanding software. Storage comes in the form of a 2TB SSD with fast access to files and ample space for documents, media, and programs.

The Pavilion 16 boasts a 16-inch IPS LCD touchscreen with a 2K resolution of 1920 x 1200 pixels that produces crisp and vibrant pictures with a 16:10 aspect ratio that allows for optimal vertical screen space for work. The screen is also treated with an anti-glare matte finish for ease of use under varying lighting levels.

In terms of design, the laptop finds an optimal balance between portability and usability. Measuring around 3.98 lbs in weight and slightly under 18 mm in thickness, it is convenient to move around home, office or school. The frame is a combination of aluminum and plastic materials that ensure durability without making it look outdated. The keyboard is also backlit for improved usability in dimly lit conditions, and the presence of a numeric keypad makes it convenient to perform data entry operations.

Battery life is similar, up to 10 hours per charge, and the laptop offers fast charging with a 65W USB-C power adapter, charging the battery to 50% of capacity in around 30 minutes. This will be useful for busy users needing quick top-ups between apps. It also comes with Windows 11 Pro included and a lifetime version of Office Pro (including Excel, Word and PowerPoint), a charger and a mouse.

This HP Pavilion 16 is a smart purchase considering the astronomically high discount that is currently available on Amazon. It is coming with a latest-generation Intel processor, ample memory, high-definition touchscreen, and average build quality that makes it just right for use by students and business professionals. Don't miss up this opportunity, the discount is really massive (and we've never seen it in the past).

Works by tapping into an undocumented WSC API call to tell Windows there's some other antivirus software turned on.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


There's a new tool available for folk who want to disable Windows Defender without replacing it with a rival antivirus (AV) product. Developer and reverse engineer es3n1n released the new Defendnot tool recently. The software taps into an undocumented Windows Security Center (WSC) API to tell the OS there's some other antivirus software turned on, thus gracefully giving Windows Defender the elbow.

In a blog post discussing Defendnot development, es3n1n introduces the new tool by highlighting how it is a replacement for their no-defender tool from a year ago. Defendnot's ancestor disabled Windows Defender by reusing third party code from an existing AV product. Not surprisingly, it was hit by a DCMA takedown request… Defendnot started as an attempt to create a “clean implementation” of the prior project, without any ‘donor' AV. This wasn't easy, as WSC isn't (publicly) documented.

Leaning on prior experience, es3n1n correctly guessed how WSC validated calls made by genuine AV products. So, they injected code into this process, with immediately promising results. The blog shows a “fresh-new antivirus I registered,” and you can see it is arbitrarily named ‘hi2.' In the screenshot below, from GitHub, you can also see it dubbed 'hello readme:).'



Many shenanigans later (about three days) es3n1n finessed their Defendnot tool by injecting the fake AV DLL into the already signed and trusted Windows Task Manager process (Taskmgr.exe). From there it can register the fake AV tool with any name. If you check Bleeping Computer, their reporter made a fake AV dubbed the BleepingComputer Antivirus, using Defendnot, for even more fun.

With Defendnot injected and registered, Microsoft Defender will immediately shut itself down. As your Defendnot app isn't actually an AV program, that will leave you exposed to viruses and similar malware, as you won't have a real-time scanner enabled. To keep your new ‘AV' and WSC implications live between reboots, Defendnot is added to Windows autorun.

It is kind of scary how a legitimate AV program can be spoofed like this, but as a ‘research project' it forewarns OS makers like Microsoft of potential vulnerabilities which may be exploited by bad actors. If you were to download the Defendnot tool today, Microsoft's Defender has already started to detect and quarantine it as a Trojan based on its machine learning algorithms.

SoccerToday features original articles with exclusive interviews plus influential columnists covering youth and professional soccer, coaching, nutrition, and the wonderful soccer life.

Explore the leadership timeline of the National Women's Soccer League, from its founding in 2013 to today's reforms under Commissioner Jessica Berman.

Since its launch in 2013, the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) has undergone a transformation—from a startup supported by U.S. Soccer to an expanding, independently-run league with record attendance and international acclaim. 

Here's a look at the key figures who have led the NWSL and how each era has influenced the league's identity.

Editor's Note: The title of “commissioner” did not yet exist in the NWSL's original structure.

In 2022, Plush came under scrutiny and reproach after the Yates report accused him of failing to act on abuse allegations during his time with the league—raising questions about the league leadership's accountability.

As the NWSL continues to evolve—adding new franchises, setting attendance records, and growing global interest—its leadership remains central to its integrity and future. 

From foundational figures like Cheryl Bailey to reformers like Jessica Berman, each phase of NWSL leadership tells part of the league's larger story: one of resilience, progress, and accountability.

De Bruyne will leave City after 10 years when his contract expires in the close-season, but there has been speculation he could sign a short-term deal to remain with Pep Guardiola's side for the Club World Cup.

The first of two summer transfer windows is an additional registration period created by FIFA for teams involved in the Club World Cup, effectively allowing players in De Bruyne's situation to stay on for the tournament.

City's opening game is against Moroccan club Wydad AC in Philadelphia on June 18th.

However, the 33-year-old is unlikely to be involved given his future plans are unresolved at present.

""It does not make any sense. But that happens when you push in new tournaments in the middle of a contract situation,"" De Bruyne said.

""I have to take care of myself, because if I get injured in the Club World Cup, what am I going to do? Nobody's going to take care of me at that point, so there's a big chance I probably won't play it, but I don't know, maybe yes.""

De Bruyne has helped City to six Premier League titles and Champions League glory since signing in 2015.

But what is likely to be his last showpiece occasion with City ended in disappointment as Crystal Palace won 1-0 in Saturday's FA Cup final at Wembley.

The Belgium midfielder is not in a rush to make a decision about his future, but did not rule out a move to another Premier League club and admitted he has already had conversations with some suitors.

Asked after the FA Cup final if he ideally wants to stay in the English top-flight, De Bruyne said: ""I don't know. It depends who comes.

""I have a family, I have young kids, I have to take care of a decision that suits everybody, not just me. When I was 20 years old and by myself, I could make a decision that was very easy, but now it's a bit more complex.""

De Bruyne's inconsistent display in the Cup final underlined why Guardiola was willing to part ways with a City icon whose career has been ravaged by injuries over the last two years.

Pressed on whether or not his next employers could be in the Premier League, De Bruyne replied: ""Maybe.""

After four successive titles prior to this season, it has been a dismal campaign by City's high standards.

But City are still fighting for a Champions League place next season, with Tuesday's home game against Bournemouth and a trip to Fulham on May 25 offering a chance to climb back into the top five.

""Of course it's not been the season we wanted. We want to win all the time, but this season we have not done it,"" De Bruyne said.

""You have to take it on the chin, and sometimes it doesn't go the way that you want to, but we tried, and you have to move on.

""I think comparing to a lot of players, I've won way more than others, so I will be forever happy and grateful for what we have done as a team, what they have given me.""","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","soccer"

Teun Koopmeiners's Serie A season with Juventus is expected to be over, which leaves him targeting a return in time for the start of the FIFA Club World Cup in mid-June according to various reports in Italy. 

The Dutchman has not featured for the Bianconeri since the 2-1 win over Lecce on April 12, a game in which he scored his third Serie A goal of the 2024-25, his fourth in all competitions. 

Koopmeiners has been struggling with an achilles tendon injury since then, an issue that will keep him out of action against Udinese in Serie A on Sunday, and which is also expected to rule him out of the final game of the season against Venezia as well. 

That leaves him pushing for a return in time for the start of the newly-formatted Club World Cup, which starts on June 15. Juventus's first game of the competition will fall on June 19 against Al Ain in Washington, D.C.. 

USMNT star Weston McKennie is in line to start in midfield alongside Manuel Locatelli against Udinese on Sunday in Koopmeiners's absence. 

The Old Lady will claim the last remaining Champions League spot in Serie A if they win their final two matches of the season, although there is a scenario where they can claim fourth place this weekend, if they win and if Lazio, Roma and Bologna all lose. 

If that does not happen, the Champions League race will go into the final day of the 2024-25 season.



You sign players with proven Serie A experience, and you expect them to deliver. Teun's drop off in form since leaving Atalanta has been unbelievable.

Cristiano Ronaldo has received a ""tempting"" offer to leave Al Nassr after contract negotiations came to a halt with the struggling Saudi Pro League side.

After leaving Manchester United for a second time, Ronaldo signed with Al Nassr in a game-changing December 2022 transfer, penning a deal which reportedly sees him earn £177 million per year.

The five-time Ballon d'Or winner has scored 97 goals in 109 games for the club and previously went on record to say he would ""probably retire"" with the Riyadh outfit and was ""happy at the club.

Advert

Out of contract in the summer, Ronaldo had reportedly been in talks over a two-year contract extension with Al Nassr but those discussions have been halted amid a poor run of form which has seen them slip to fourth in the SPL.

Having been eliminated from the AFC Champions League at the semi-final stage, Al Nassr are confirmed to end the season trophyless.

And their talisman and face of football in Saudi could also be on the move. Jose Felix Diaz of MARCA claims that Ronaldo and his entourage have received a ""significant"" offer from  an unnamed Brazilian club who want give the Portuguese superstar one last big move before he hangs up his boots.

The proposal is described as an ""off-market offer"" which would be partly funded by contributions from outside investors.

According to the report, Ronaldo is now in a ""dilemma"" about what his next step should be as the offer presented is a ""tempting one"".

It is claimed that Al Nassr had ""almost sealed"" a contract renewal for Ronaldo but it is now ""evaporating by the minute"" - opening up the possibility of a final career switch to South America for the 40-year-old.

MARCA noted that the Manchester United and Real Madrid legend was poised to receive a salary of €183 million - which would still make him the highest-paid player in the world.

But it is now ""up in the air"" as a result of a poor season for the club and a fresh challenge could be on the cards.

Though no exact club has been named in Brazil, it is mentioned that a move could open up the door for an appearance in this summer's Club World Cup in the United States.

In the revamped, 32-team tournament, Palmeiras, Flamengo, Fluminense, and Botafogo are all representing Brazil.

Juventus, Inter Milan, and Napoli are all ready to go head-to-head for the signature of striker Jonathan David this summer.

This according to Italian broadcaster Sky Sport Italia, via FCInterNews. They report that Juventus have made yet another approach for the Canadian, but that Inter and Napoli are still very much in the race.

Striker Jonathan David is one of the big free transfer opportunities of this summer transfer window.

The 25-year-old will leave Lille after five seasons when his contract expires. His deal only runs until the end of June.

Therefore, there are a number of clubs keeping tabs on David.

Inter Milan have already made their offer to the Canadian international.

The Nerazzurri have certainly made a habit of taking advantage of free transfer opportunities since Beppe Marotta arrived at the club.

Meanwhile, Arsenal and Bayern Munich have also already sounded out David's agents.

Napoli have also recently met with representatives of the Canadian. And then, Barcelona and Juventus have been linked with David for months.

According to Sky Sport Italia, it is looking more and more like Serie A will be the eventual destination for Jonathan David.

The broadcaster report that in the last couple days, Juventus have made further contacts with the 25-year-old's representatives.

The Bianconeri do indeed see David as one of their major targets in attack. Therefore, they are taking steps to get a deal for the Canadian done.

However, Juventus have not yet taken a decisive advantage in the race for David's signature.

Sky confirm that Inter and Napoli are still very much candidates to sign the 25-year-old.

The Nerazzurri's offer is still on the table, and David has not rejected it. And the Partenopei's recent meeting with the striker's agents is a strong signal of their interest.

Therefore, all three Italian heavy-hitters will certainly vie for David's signature in the coming weeks.","{'href': 'https://ca.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo'}","soccer"

There are many projects in Saudi Arabia, most of them ambitious, and many of them designed to disrupt the status quo.

One such project is NEOM SC, a soccer club owned by the Public Investment Fund — the same sovereign wealth fund that owns Premier League club Newcastle United — and which is being fast-tracked to become one of the biggest in the world.

Five years is their ambitious target for reaching the Club World Cup, then the plan is for the team and its stadium, to be built at the controversial project The Line, to act as a showpiece when the kingdom hosts the World Cup in 2034.

In this extract from the book Engulfed: How Saudi Arabia Bought Sport, and the World, which explores ambition, family rivalries, extreme wealth, power, murder and disinformation behind the kingdom's use of sport as a geopolitical tool, James Montague visited the remote city of Tabuk to find out more about the so-far secretive club…

Tabuk, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia

It wasn't until late afternoon, when the shadows grew long enough to offer some protection from the insane August heat, that the thousands started arriving at the King Khalid Sports City Stadium.

An hour earlier, the car park and concourses of the old but charismatic stadium surrounded by desert on the outskirts of Tabuk, a city of just over half a million people in the remote north west of Saudi Arabia close to the Jordanian border, had been empty.

Now there was life. Street food stalls and pop-up coffee shops and merch stands and games. Fathers wearing white thobes waited as their daughters got their faces painted. Women in black abayas with niqabs covering their faces worked as volunteers, pointing fans towards the tight security at the stadium entrance. Groups of excitable teenage boys waited their turn to play EA FC on a bank of massive flat screen TVs. It was Tuesday night and it felt more like a low-key music festival than the build-up to a football match.

The match against Al Jandal was officially a 10,000 sell-out, something that had not happened before, in part because there had not been much success for the fans to get excited about. This was a game in the Saudi First League, the country's second division. Al Suqoor, ‘The Falcons' in Arabic, was founded in 1965 and had spent almost all of its six-decade history bouncing between the third and fourth tier of Saudi football. They had never played in Saudi Arabia's elite league. In the past, Al Suqoor would be lucky if a few dozen fans attended. But the team was no longer called Al Suqoor and no longer wore their traditional gold, black and white shirts. They were now known as NEOM Sports Club, named after their new owners, the $1.5trillion real estate mega project being built in virtual secrecy down the road.

NEOM was entirely owned by the Public Investment Fund. It was a project of breathless ambition, or hubris, depending on who you spoke to. Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) announced it in 2017, a high-tech series of developments covering 27,000 square kilometres of Tabuk province bordering on Saudi Arabia's pristine and undeveloped Red Sea coastline. It was virgin land, the developers said, to build the settlement of the future. At its centre was The Line, a proposed 170-kilometre-long ‘cognitive city', built — in the spirit of nominative determinism — in a straight line. AI would monitor everything and use the data to predict and satisfy the needs of the city's proposed nine million citizens.

There would be no roads or currency and the project would be staffed by robot servants and flying cars. MBS had said that The Line would usher in “a civilisational revolution that puts humans first”. The whole NEOM mega project had become one of the most important elements of MBS's economic and social revolution, as well as Saudi Arabia's bid to host the 2034 World Cup, which would be rubber-stamped by FIFA a few months from now.

The 2034 bid document stated that one of the stadiums would be in NEOM, built at the top of The Line, half a kilometre off the ground, taller even than the Empire State Building. The early concept designs for the stadium showed layered, tessellating shells glowing neon blue. It looked like an arena a player might be able to choose in Rocket League.

So, if NEOM was to be a world-class city with a World Cup stadium, it also needed a world-class football team. The most efficient way of achieving that was to find a club that had already been established and one that inhabited a sort of Goldilocks zone: not too big so that the existing fans would complain about the eradication of its history, but not too small, otherwise it would take too long to reach the top of the Saudi football pyramid. And NEOM was on a tight timeline. A suitable candidate was scouted in the nearest big city to the project, which was Tabuk. In the summer of 2023, Al Suqoor was purchased and then moulded in NEOM's image. The club's old badge – a falcon in profile – was replaced by NEOM's corporate logo.

Outside the stadium, volunteers handed out hundreds of NEOM SC's blue flags and scarves, the club's new corporate brand-aligned colours. It wasn't just football either. NEOM had an entire sports division, with diverse investments in Formula E and Indian Premier League cricket, among others. Sport was, according to the corporate blurb, pivotal to promoting and anchoring Brand NEOM.

NEOM's corporate symbol and colour palette was everywhere.

“We are here to cheer,” said Faris, a former youth player of Al Suqoor who, at 18, had given up on his dream of playing football. He felt no loss for his old club and was now all in for NEOM SC. He was part of ‘The NEOM Unit' – previously known as ‘Al Suqoor Unit' — a group of eight friends who would lead the chants in the crowd with their songs and tabla hand drums. They gathered around with their instruments as Faris spoke.

“I was a player for Al Suqoor, and when they got bought by NEOM, I switched to being a fan. I don't play anymore. I'm too fat. This is the best thing I can do for my team to be better. We will make a dangerous noise today. And we will win!”

As the desert light dissolved and dissipated, turning the sky the colour of warmed honey before blackening entirely, a nearby minaret announced the maghrib prayer. The concourses of the stadium were filled with men and boys praying. In the absence of prayer mats, the NEOM flags being handed out for free were used instead.

Like Newcastle United, the club now had a legitimate claim to be the richest in the world. Both were effectively bankrolled from money that originated from the same source. In little over 12 months, tens of millions of Saudi riyals had been poured into the project. A whole new management structure was brought in as the club signed top Saudi and international players, who had no business playing in the second tier of Saudi football for a rebranded team in a remote corner of the country.

Saudi national team captain Salman al Faraj arrived from Al Hilal. Egypt international and Al Ittihad captain Ahmed Hegazy was persuaded to join him. Brazilian coach Pericles Chamusca had been in charge of Saudi Pro League side Al Taawoun FC, before he too was convinced to sign for NEOM SC. Pericles had been coaching in Saudi since 2018 and had acclimatised well to the Kingdom, which might have explained why he wore a blazer and tie in the stifling heat as he ran the players through their final warm-up routine on the pitch.

Trying to find out anything about NEOM, either the mega-development or the football team, was hard work. The building site itself was inaccessible thanks to its remote location, but also by design. There had been several bad news stories in recent years. It was nearly impossible to visit the site and NEOM Sports Club shared some of that secrecy, at least initially. There was no phone number or other contact details on the club's website. So I turned up. Once in the stadium, an official quickly grabbed me and asked who I was and what I was doing. They escorted me out to the car park. At first, I thought I was being thrown out, but they instead politely showed me into a lift.

When the doors opened, I was standing in NEOM Sports Club's VVIP room. A lavish buffet of Arabic food, dates and chocolate cakes skirted the room. Waiters weaved around, serving cardamom-scented Arabic coffee in tiny porcelain cups. The deputy governor of Tabuk, a member of the Saud royal family, had just arrived, as had Olympiacos sporting director and 1998 World Cup winner Christian Karembeu. He was wearing a NEOM-branded polo shirt and was the guest of Kyriakos Dourekas, NEOM SC's new sporting director, who had been poached from Nottingham Forest, whose billionaire owner Evangelos Marinakis also owned Olympiacos.

Moaath Alohali strode forward and warmly introduced himself. Moaath was the acting CEO of NEOM SC, although I recognised him from somewhere else. He once held the same position at Al Ettifaq, a Saudi Pro League team from Dammam, his home city on the country's oil-rich Persian Gulf coast. Famously, he had recruited Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard as coach. Moaath was in the photos, in a white thobe, smiling as the players signed their lucrative new contracts.

He was in Tabuk with his boss, Meshari al Motairi, the chairman of NEOM SC. Meshari al Motairi was a man of influence. He was not a member of the House of Saud but did have one of the most powerful jobs at NEOM, as executive director of government affairs. It highlighted just how important those in charge viewed the football club to NEOM's future. “This is part of the revolution led by His Royal Highness (Mohammed bin Salman),” he explained when we finally spoke. “We're trying to add new DNA to this club by building the structure, so (it) can compete with the big clubs in the Kingdom.”

Al Motairi had never given an interview to a Western journalist before. He made it clear this was very much out of choice. But once we began to talk, he was open about why NEOM had bought what was then a third division football club. “Sport, it's a big attraction. Imagine Barcelona,” he said. “I was there a few months ago and I met many people. They said Barcelona as a city before the (1992 Summer) Olympics, it's not Barcelona after the Olympics. Sport, how can I say? It fills the dots… It's an accelerator for a lot of things.”

The players and staff, he said, had not just been attracted by the money to play in Tabuk, but NEOM's vision. “I think the most important thing that attracted all of them is NEOM, NEOM as a project,” he said.

The project.

It was a phrase I would hear a lot over the next weeks and months. And the project, essentially, was to build one of the world's biggest football clubs from scratch. The first stage was to incubate it in Tabuk, here at the King Khalid Sports City Stadium, and then transplant it to The Line a decade from now, just in time for the 2034 World Cup. The club was on a tight schedule. Promotion to the SPL this year was a necessity, followed by the league and continental titles in subsequent seasons.

Where do you see NEOM SC in five years, I asked. “The (Club) World Cup,” he replied quickly. “We don't believe this word ‘impossible'. Everything is possible. We need to work hard, double time, and we will reach it.”

The final call to prayer for the day rang out and, like the fans down in the concourses, the men in the most expensive seats in the house prayed, too, near to the buffet, portraits of King Salman and MBS hanging from the wall above.

The NEOM Unit had already been singing for over an hour when the match kicked off, a swirling, joyous noise that pulsed and swelled like the waves of a gentle sea. Even the security guards and policemen who surrounded them joined in with the dancing and singing. The noise only stopped — for the briefest of moments — when NEOM SC scored, which was four times. Pericles Chamusca's side dismantled Al Jandal with ease.

Romarinho, a Brazilian player who was considered one of the best in the SPL last season, scored twice as they won 4-0. The VVIPS and the NEOM Unit applauded the players and Pericles as they came off the pitch, all with the same inevitable conclusion: this season, and in the seasons to come, NEOM would sweep all before them.

“It's clear in our strategy that we will be there within 10 years, max,” Moaath said of NEOM SC's move to the state-of-the-art World Cup stadium that was going to be built on top of The Line, a brand-new old club on old-brand-new land.

The problem was that The Line perhaps wasn't being built on virgin land after all.

The Dutch giants blew a nine-point lead in the final five games of the campaign to become the latest side to throw away an almost-guaranteed trophy

No matter how far clear a team is at the top of the table heading into the final weeks of a season, football fans around the world know that a title isn't won until it's mathematically won. Never more does that hit home when a team collapses from a seemingly impossible position to hand their rivals the league trophy in the final stretch.

In 2024-25, it is Ajax who have suffered the ignominy of bottling what looked an almost-certain triumph just a few weeks ago. Francesco Farioli's side sat nine points clear of second-placed PSV with just five games of the Eredivisie season remaining, and the vast majority of supporters in the Netherlands already believed that Ajax's name was on the trophy.

However, a run of four games without a win, including heavy defeats to both Sparta Rotterdam and NEC Nijmegen, as well as a draw with 10-man Groningen during which the mid-table side scored a 99th-minute equaliser, suddenly left Ajax a point behind PSV going into the final day. And though Jordan Henderson and co. got back to winning ways against FC Twente, PSV got the victory they needed to secure a title that they had all-but given up on less than two months earlier.

Ajax's collapse, per Opta, is the biggest by any team in European football history, so with that in mind, GOAL has ranked the worst collapses in recent history to have preceded the Dutch giants' remarkable late-season fall...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Everything you need to know about the new Rangers kits for the 2025-26 season.

Rangers FC are turning the page and stepping into a bold new era with Umbro, who return as the club's official kit supplier for the 2025-26 campaign, marking their first partnership in over a decade.

The iconic brand makes its comeback to Ibrox, unveiling a fresh home strip that blends vintage inspiration with a modern twist. Designed to echo the club's storied past while setting sights firmly on the future, the kit is a nod to tradition with a sharp, contemporary edge.

While it may look like a fresh start with a new name, the Gers switch to Umbro for the 2025-26 kits isn't quite what it seems. Castore, who've been kitting out the Ibrox side recently, actually acquired the rights to the Umbro brand in the UK back in spring 2024. So, despite the new badge on the shirt, it's still very much Castore pulling the strings, just under a name with more heritage and pull among supporters.

Umbro is no stranger to Rangers fans, either. The brand was a staple at Ibrox from 1964 to 1990 and later returned between 2005 and 2013, dressing the club through some iconic chapters. Now, it's back on the sleeve—only this time, with a familiar face behind the curtain.

With Celtic having held the upper hand in the title race for the last four seasons, the pressure is on for Rangers to mount a serious challenge. And with a sleek new look and fresh ambition, the Gers are gearing up to bring the silverware back to the blue side of Glasgow.

So, what will Rangers be wearing in the 2025-26 season? GOAL brings you everything we know so far, including leaks, rumours, where to buy, prices and more.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Carlos Alcaraz proved too strong for home favourite Jannik Sinner in the final of the Italian Open, winning 7-6 (7-5) 6-1 in Rome.

A tight first set went to a tiebreak as Alcaraz then kicked on to a 3-0 advantage within it, closing it out 7-5 for a crucial lead.

The second set could not have proven more one-sided, however, as a dominant Alcaraz streaked out to a 5-0 lead, with Sinner powerless to stop him closing the game out on serve.

After Jasmine Paolini's trophy success in the women's final on Saturday, Italy were looking to earn their first ever sweep of the Rome singles titles this weekend.

Instead, the last local man to raise the trophy remains Adriano Panatta in 1976.

Jack Draper got emotional recalling the difficult time he went through as a rookie after accepting a wildcard at the Miami Open. The World No. 5 also compared breaking into the top 100 with breaking into the top five.

Over the past two years, Draper has consistently risen in the ranks and finally achieved a career high of World No. 5 in May 2025. The title that helped him immensely to achieve this was the Masters 1000 event at Indian Wells.

The Brit got the better of several seeded players, including second seed Carlos Alcaraz, to get his hands on his maiden Masters 1000 trophy. Recently, in an interview with Sky Sports, Jack Draper was asked if being in the top five gets a player more respect or more banter in the locker room. While answering, he took a walk down memory lane.

Further, he explained that players understand that they are floating in the same boat and eventually respect each other.

Draper also claimed that breaking into the top 100 was a more difficult task than breaking into the top five.

In the same interview with Sky Sports, Jack Draper was asked what was more difficult, breaking into the top 100 or the top five. The Brit answered the top 100 and explained that the Futures and Challengers level is very difficult. He had to go to some ""not amazing"" places to earn his rankings.

Further, he pointed out that it is a very ""lonely"" road to the top.

When Draper made his ATP Tour debut at the Miami Open in 2021, he was ranked just outside the top 300. It was a long road from there, but the Brit kept grinding and climbing the rankings. He finished 2022 inside the top 50 after some deep runs at several tournaments.

2023, however, saw him dip out of the top 100 again as he was sidelined due to injuries. His exceptional tennis was on display in 2024, as he rose from World No. 61 to No. 15 by bagging two titles. In 2025, he continued his rise and achieved a career-high World No. 5 ranking.

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz will resume their rivalry on Sunday in the 2025 Internazionali BNL d'Italia final, which will take place Sunday not before 5:00 p.m. CEST/11:00 a.m. EDT.

Sinner is competing for the first time since he won the Australian Open in January and has looked close to his best at times in the Italian capital, dropping just one set en route to the final. Alcaraz, who is 29-5 on the year according to the Infosys ATP Win-Loss Index, defeated Lorenzo Musetti in the semi-finals and is aiming to win his second ATP Masters 1000 title of the season (Monte-Carlo).

The No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings Sinner trails Alcaraz 4-6 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series with this their first meeting in 2025. On clay they are level at 1-1. Sinner defeated the 22-year-old in the Umag final in 2022 and Alcaraz then overcame the Italian in the Roland Garros semi-final last year. Both are competing in their 25th tour-level final.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Alcaraz leads Sinner in absorbing Rome final","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/sinner-alcaraz-rome-2025-final","Sun, 18 May 2025 16:49:55 GMT","

Carlos Alcaraz was in no mood for an Italian fairytale on Sunday at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome, where he soared past home favourite Jannik Sinner to claim his seventh ATP Masters 1000 title.

The 22-year-old Spaniard delivered a classy display to prevail 7-6(5), 6-1 and snap the Italian's 26-match winning streak. Alcaraz saved two set points in an absorbing opener before carrying that momentum through a one-hour, 45-minute victory to claim his 19th tour-level trophy, tying Sinner for the most among players born in the 2000s.

“I'm just really happy to get my first Rome [title], hopefully it's not going to be the last one,” said Alcaraz. “The first thing I want to say is that I'm just really happy to see Jannik back at this amazing level. I'm sure it wasn't easy for him coming back after three months and making the final of a Masters 1000 in his first tournament [back]. It's something insane, so I have to congratulate him.

“I'm proud of myself, with the way I approached the match mentally. Tactically, I think I played pretty well from the first point until the last one. I didn't do a rollercoaster… I maintained my good level throughout the whole match, so I'm really proud about everything I did today.”

VENI, VIDI, VICI 👑@carlosalcaraz snaps Sinner's 26-match winning streak, 7-6(5) 6-1 to capture his first title in Rome!@InteBNLdItalia | #IBI25 pic.twitter.com/xlbVCAcN3x

By improving to 7-4 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Sinner, Alcaraz became the first player to claim three ATP Tour titles this season, having triumphed in Rotterdam and Monte-Carlo. Alcaraz, who owns a Tour-leading 30 wins in 2025, is just the fifth man to win all three clay-court ATP Masters 1000 events.

The No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Sinner was competing in his first event since winning the Australian Open in January and was aiming to become the first male Italian champion in Rome since Adriano Panatta in 1976. Yet he was unable to withstand Alcaraz once the Spaniard had found his rhythm, and will be forced to rue the misplaced backhand he struck on his second set point on return at 6-5, 30/40 in the opener.

Gauff, who is guaranteed to move up to number two in the rankings, lost 6-4, 6-2 to home favourite Jasmine Paolini in Saturday's Italian Open final, after going down to Aryna Sabalenka at the Madrid Open final earlier this month.

""Hopefully I can get to the final in Roland Garros and maybe the 'third time is a charm' thing is a real thing,"" Gauff told reporters after her second loss in a WTA 1000 final.

""Overall I lost to two quality opponents, Aryna in Madrid and Jasmine here. So yeah, I think I have a lot to improve, a lot that I can work on.""

US Open 2023 winner Gauff has struggled with unforced errors during the Italian Open, making over 70 in her semi-final win over Zheng Qinwen and 55 on Saturday, giving Paolini a significant edge.

""I made the final with those errors. Made the final maybe not playing my best tennis,"" said Gauff, who reached the French Open final in 2022 and was a semi-finalist last year.

""It just gives me confidence if I can find that good form heading into Roland Garros, I can do well there.""

Former No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings Marin Cilic and former No. 12 Borna Coric headline the Roland Garros qualifying draw, which was released Sunday.

Cilic is competing on the Parisian clay for the first time since 2022, when he reached the semi-finals. The Croatian has tallied a 31-16 record at the clay-court major, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, and will take on Wu Yibing in the first round of qualifying.



Coric is the top seed in qualifying. The Croatian has made the third round of the main draw on five occasions. He will open against home favourite Titouan Droguet.

Other players to watch in qualifying include second seed Alexander Shevchenko, third seed Nishesh Basavareddy and former Top-10 star Fabio Fognini. The action begins Monday.

The battle to claim one of 16 main draw spots starts at Porte d'Auteuil on Monday

US Open 2014 champion Marin Cilic headlines the field of 128 men bidding to earn a place in the main draw of Roland-Garros 2025.

Young guns Brandon Holt, Elmer Moller and Ethan Quinn will look to disrupt the order among plenty of experienced competitors, while Adrian Mannarino leads a strong French contingent.

➡️ Men's qualifying draw

➡️ Monday Order of Play

Here are five names to keep tabs on as the three men's qualifying rounds begin on Monday.

The former world No.3 has pretty much done it all - Grand Slam glory, an Olympic medal, Davis Cup silverware, 21 ATP titles, you name it.

Rewind to Roland-Garros 2022 and the Croat completed his Majors semi-final set with a run to the last four. However, since then the 36-year-old has endured the arduous rehab and recovery process from knee surgeries in early 2023 and May 2024.

Still hungry for more success, last September Cilic won the Hangzhou title as the world No.777, becoming the lowest-ranked champion in ATP history. Into 2025 and the world No.109 has recently competed on the second-tier ATP Challenger Tour, building up momentum for Paris with a title in Girona and a final showing in Madrid.

Cilic – who last played Roland-Garros qualifying with a successful run in 2007 - opens his account in a potentially pulsating duel with China's Wu Yibing. The duo practised together onsite in Paris on Sunday ahead of the draw.

There is no one quite like Fabio Fognini. His shoulder-rolling swagger, slow-paced strut across the baseline punctuates his flamboyant shot making, which has graced the tour for the past two decades.

This is set to be the Italian's final campaign on the terre battue, before hanging up his racket for plenty of family time pencilled in at the end of the year.

The former world No.9, a quarter-finalist at RG 2011, is seeking the perfect early birthday present in the upcoming week. Fognini turns 38 on 24 May, so can Fabio serve up some final flashes of brilliance to qualify?

First up Fognini takes on world No.149 Nicolas Moreno de Alboran.

Top seed Borna Coric has been playing plenty of top tennis this season.

The resurgent Croatian, who reached a career-high ranking of No.12 back in 2018, lifted three consecutive ATP Challenger titles in March.

Coric then earned the perfect Roland-Garros preparation earlier this month, clinching further ATP Challenger success with the Open Aix Provence title following a 6-7(5), 6-3, 7-6(4) victory over Stan Wawrinka.

Working back to his best, Coric has plenty of match play under his belt. The world No.84 landed a tough opener in Paris, across the net from home charge Titouan Droguet.

Former college tennis star Christopher Eubanks enjoyed a purple patch in 2023 with a quarter-final berth secured on the immaculate lawns at Wimbledon. As a result, Eubanks rocketed up to his finest ranking to date at No.29.

That season the towering American made his Roland-Garros main draw debut, falling in the first round in four sets to the No.6 seeded Holger Rune.

Searching to recapture his very best, the qualifying draw will be wary of Eubanks' booming serve and smooth transition play up the court. A quarter-final on home US clay in Houston two months ago indicates that Eubanks can deliver in Paris.

The 29-year-old must hurdle the challenge presented by Austria's Jurij Rodionov in the opening round.

Growing up with fellow Americans Alex Michelsen and Learner Tien on the courts of southern California, Nishesh Basavareddy is part of another exciting wave of talent representing the stars and stripes.

Having gone pro last December, the world No.100 shot into the global spotlight at this year's Australian Open in a compelling tussle with his childhood idol Novak Djokovic. Basavareddy stormed through the opening set against the 24-time Grand Slam champion, before gallantly bowing out 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 on Rod Laver Arena.

The 20-year-old displayed his clay court credentials with a quarter-final spot at the Aix-en-Provence Challenger earlier this month.

Andrea Collarini represents his first opponent in qualifying at Porte d'Auteuil.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Coco Gauff rates her chances of winning Roland Garros after losing to Jasmine Paolini in the Italian Open final","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/coco-gauff-rates-her-chances-of-winning-roland-garros-after-losing-to-jasmine-paolini-in-the-italian-open-final/","Sun, 18 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Coco Gauff flattered to deceive in the Italian Open final, losing in straight sets to Jasmine Paolini.

However, that does not detract from what has been a hugely promising clay-court campaign for the 21-year-old, reaching two Masters 1000-event finals despite not securing any silverware.

If these experiences are to help her win the ultimate clay crown though, she will not care, and with the French Open starting later this month, it's time for her to start dreaming.

Even despite an error-strewn Italian Open campaign, Coco Gauff remains optimistic.

Speaking at her post-match press conference, the American naturally cut a downbeat figure.

However, such is the way with her unrelenting mentality, Gauff remains positive.

Asked about Roland Garros specifically, which is obviously the pinnacle of the clay-court season, she rated her chances of lifting the trophy: ‘Yeah, I think it's both confidence and motivation to do better. Hopefully, I can get to the final in Roland Garros and maybe the ‘third time is a charm' thing is a real thing. That's looking so far ahead.

‘Overall, I lost to two quality opponents, Aryna in Madrid and Jasmine here. So yeah, I think I have a lot to improve, a lot that I can work on.

‘I made the final with those errors. Made the final, maybe not playing my best tennis. It just gives me confidence if I can find that good form heading into Roland Garros, I can do well there.'

Gauff spoke about the Italian Open crowd too, which has drawn criticism over the last week.

As a finalist in the French Open already, Gauff will know what to expect if she is to reach that stage again.

However, despite a really strong clay-court season, there will be others to provide strong competition.

Paolini is obviously one such contender, especially after reaching the final last year, whilst Iga Swiatek will be hoping to recapture her form to add to her four titles in the French capital.

It would be unwise to discount the world number one Aryna Sabalenka though, who actually beat Gauff in the Madrid final earlier this month.

Mirra Andreeva, despite her youth, is not one to ignore either after a startlingly impressive 2025.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

The second Grand Slam of the 2025 tennis season, the French Open, is around the corner and here is all the information you need ahead of the clay-court major at Roland Garros.

This year marks the 124th edition of the French Open and it will once again be staged at Stade Roland Garros – the venue since 1928.

The only clay-court Grand Slam on the calendar will get underway on Sunday, May 25.

The women's final will take place a fortnight later on Saturday, June 7 on Court Philippe-Chatrier while the men's showpiece match will be on Sunday, June 8 at the same spectacular clay-court venue.

The main draw for the men's and women's singles will take place on Thursday, May 22 with proceedings getting underway at 14:00 local time (13:00 BST).

There will be 128 names in both the men's and women's singles draws with 16 players coming through qualifying and eight gaining entry via wildcards.

The cutoff for direct entries for both draws was just after the 100 mark while there are also a couple of protected/special rankings entrants.

Play gets underway 11:00 local time (10:00 BST) all on courts except for Court Philippe Chatrier as the action starts at 12:00 (11:00 BST) on the showpiece court.

One singles match – either men's or women's – will be staged during the night session on Chatrier from May 25 until June 6 and the action will not get underway before 20:15 (19:15) local time.

The women's singles final will take place on June 7 at 15:00 (14:00 BST) and the men's finals will be staged 24 hours later.

A new name was added to the Coupe des Mousquetaires as Carlos Alcaraz won his first title at Roland Garros, beating Alexander Zverev 6–3, 2–6, 5–7, 6–1, 6–2, just days after he also defeated Jannik Sinner in five sets.

It was a familiar story in the women's final as Iga Swiatek won her fourth title in Paris and third in a row as the Pole was too strong for first-time Grand Slam finalist Jasmine Paolini, winning 6–2, 6–1.

Jannik Sinner will be the top seed at Roland Garros for the first time in his career as he only became No 1 after last year's tournament.

He is followed by Carlos Alcaraz, Alexander Zverev, Taylor Fritz, Jack Draper, Novak Djokovic, Casper Ruud, Lorenzo Musetti, Alex de Minaur and Holger Rune.

Alexander Zverev makes strong statement as he is asked if Novak Djokovic can win the French Open

Chris Evert rates Iga Swiatek's French Open chances as she names four favourites

On the women's side, Iga Swiatek won't be the top seed for the first time since 2021 as she has dropped down the rankings following a poor clay-court season so far.

Instead, the honour goes to Aryna Sabalenka with Coco Gauff taking second place. Jessica Pegula, Jasmine Paolini, Swiatek, Mirra Andreeva, Madison Keys, Zheng Qinwen, Emma Navarro and Paula Badosa complete the top 10.

The cutoff for direct entries for the ATP side was 101 while Reilly Opelka (33) and Jenson Brooksby (52) are some of the high-profile players who entered with their protected ranking.

Former French Open champion Stan Wawrinka and the retiring Richard Gasquet are among the high-profile wildcards while 16 more players will come through qualifying.

Two-time Grand Slam winner Petra Kvitova used her special ranking of 14 to enter after she missed most of the 2024 season as she was on maternity leave.

Emma Raducanu will play at Roland Garros for only the second time and the first time since 2022 as she qualified via her WTA Ranking of 47.

Meanwhile, rising star Alex Eala will make her debut as her incredible Miami Open run helped her to qualify with a ranking of 72. Last year she lost in the third round of qualifying.

So far there have been no high-profile withdrawals from the tournament, but a week is a long time in tennis.

The host broadcaster for the French Open is France TV while Prime Video will also air the tournament in France. Most of Europe is covered by Eurosport with the exception of Austria (Servus TV), Belgium (RTBF) and Switzerland (SRG SSR).

There have been changes to the United States broadcasting deal as TNT Sports, Max and Tru TV will broadcast the event while the tournament will be available on RDS and TSN in Canada.

ESPN covers Latin America and Brazil, a combination of BeinSport, SuperSport and Canal+ will show it in the Middle East, North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa.

Asia is covered by BeinSport, China has CMG and SSPORTS), Japan has WOWOW, India has Sony Ten and Australia has Channel 9 and Stan Sports.

                Carlos Alcaraz revealed what he would be ""more than happy to see"" Novak Djokovic do.            


                Seven top 25 players have pulled out of the ATP 500 event, including three top 10 stars.            


                Jannik Sinner's form could be good news or bad news for the rest of the ATP Tour.

Fred Stolle was not only a great tennis player, but the two-time grand slam singles title winner was the voice of the sport as a commentator on Australian and US television.

Born in Sydney, Stolle emerged from an incredibly competitive Australian tennis scene, where rivals included Roy Emerson, John Newcombe, Ken Rosewall, Tony Roche and Rod Laver.

He lost the first five grand slam singles finals he reached and also lost three Wimbledon finals in a row from 1963-65.

His first singles major came at the 1965 French Open and he won the US Open the following year.

Doubles was where Stolle really made his mark, winning all four men's grand slam doubles titles from 10 victories in total and seven major mixed doubles titles.

He was part of the Australian Davis Cup-winning team in 1964, '65 and '66.

Stolle coached American major winner Vitas Gerulaitis for several years; his son Sandon was a US Open doubles winner.

Fred Stolle died on March 5, aged 86. — APL/agencies

Albon left with mixed feelings over P5 finish in Imola after ‘licking my lips' at potential Williams podium

Hamilton hails ‘really great feeling' of fightback to P4 at Imola as Leclerc reflects on ‘frustrating day'

FACTS AND STATS: Verstappen's Imola record and Hamilton's best Ferrari result to date

HIGHLIGHTS: Relive Verstappen's breathtaking first-lap overtake on Piastri en route to stellar Imola victory

Verstappen talks through bold Piastri pass that ‘unleashed' Red Bull's pace in statement Imola victory drive

Max Verstappen has surged to an impressive second victory of the season at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, the Dutchman having snatched P1 at the start before holding his position ahead of the McLaren pair in an eventful afternoon that featured Virtual Safety Car and full Safety Car phases.

The race got underway in exciting fashion as polesitter Oscar Piastri initially launched well off the line – only for Verstappen to make a stunning overtake through the Tamburello chicane, resulting in the World Champion going on to build a lead in the laps that followed.

Piastri then joined a number of drivers who made an early pit stop, having stopped for the hard compound on Lap 14, but the call did not seem to work out for the Australian, with Verstappen staying out on track to further extend his advantage in first place.

As questions persisted over whether a one-stop or two-stop strategy was the way forward – with around half of the field remaining out following that earlier flurry of action in the pits for the other half – the picture was turned on its head when a Virtual Safety Car was called on Lap 29 after Esteban Ocon pulled onto the grass in the Haas.

Race results

This allowed for those who had yet to stop to visit the pits without losing much time – and this most crucially included Verstappen, who pitted before emerging back on track with a staggering lead of around 20s from Norris in P2.

But there was more drama to come later on when a Safety Car was deployed owing to Kimi Antonelli pulling off track on Lap 46 due to an issue with his Mercedes, allowing Verstappen to stop again – as did Norris, while the other McLaren of Piastri did not, raising questions over whether the papaya team would opt to let the Briton move ahead of his team mate upon the restart.

The restart was executed flawlessly by Verstappen, who went on to clinch a fourth consecutive win at Imola in Red Bull's 400th Grand Prix start – while, six seconds behind him, Norris had overtaken Piastri for P2, with the Australian then doing enough to hold off Lewis Hamilton behind him in fourth following a solid recovery drive for Ferrari after their Qualifying woes.

Alex Albon continued a good run for Williams by taking P5, having won out in a feisty late-race battle with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc that left the Monegasque in P6. George Russell, meanwhile, took P7 as the sole Mercedes finisher following Antonelli's retirement, while Carlos Sainz added to William's tally in P8.

Piastri was amongst those to make an early pit stop in the race

Isack Hadjar was ninth for Racing Bulls in another notable performance from the rookie, with Yuki Tsunoda climbing his way up to 10th to claim the final point on offer, perhaps bringing some solace to the Red Bull driver after his dramatic crash in Saturday's Qualifying.

Fernando Alonso again missed out on points in P11 on a day where Aston Martin looked to be slipping backwards, with Nico Hulkenberg also losing out on a potential top-10 finish in P12. Pierre Gasly followed in P13 for Alpine, ahead of Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson and Aston Martin's Lance Stroll.

Franco Colapinto crossed the line in 16th on his first race at the wheel of the Alpine, while Ollie Bearman in the Haas and Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto rounded out the classified runners in 17th and 18th respectively, with Ocon and Antonelli the two retirees at Imola.

Race Highlights: 2025 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix

One day on from an action-packed Qualifying session – which saw championship leader Piastri claim his third pole position of the season ahead of Verstappen and Russell – it was finally time for the paddock to switch their attentions to the main event, the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix.

Two changes had been made to the starting order prior to the 63-lap race getting underway, with Colapinto receiving a one-place grid penalty for a rule breach during Qualifying, having entered the fast lane of the pit lane before a session restart time had been confirmed following a red flag in Q1.

This meant that the Argentinian – in his first event back on the F1 grid since his nine-race stint as a substitute for Williams in 2024 – would line up in P16 for Alpine, with the returning driver surely hoping for a better Sunday after ultimately crashing out of Qualifying.

Tsunoda, meanwhile, was set to start from the pit lane. Having suffered a dramatic incident on Saturday that saw his car spin into the gravel and flip over during the early stages of Q1, the Red Bull team subsequently made changes to the Japanese driver's RB21 under parc ferme conditions.

Once the cars had assembled on the grid as the time for lights out neared, it was confirmed after the tyre blankets had been removed that the majority of the field would start on the medium compound, with Hamilton, Antonelli, Hulkenberg, Bearman and Tsunoda the exceptions on the hard rubber.

There was a thrilling start to the race as Verstappen took the fight to Piastri

After the formation lap had been completed and the race kicked off at 1500 local time in warm and dry conditions, Piastri initially launched away strongly – but Verstappen was not to be deterred and the World Champion pulled off an incredible overtake by squeezing through the Tamburello chicane to snatch the lead.

Behind them Russell had a solid start before having to fend off a chasing Norris, while Leclerc had gained a position to move up into P10. And as the action settled following the first couple of laps, the Monegasque looked to be in a fighting mood following Ferrari's disappointing Saturday as he scrapped with Gasly, resulting in the Alpine running wide through the gravel.

Elsewhere Hamilton was also looking racy as he tried to find a way past Antonelli in a duel for P11, with the Mercedes ultimately holding the position. Up front, meanwhile, Verstappen had built a lead of 1.6s from Piastri by Lap 5, the pair followed by Russell, Norris, Alonso, Sainz, Albon, Stroll, Leclerc and Hadjar.

While Imola might be a tricky circuit to overtake on, there were plenty of drivers trying to pressure their opponents in battles across the pack. Norris was hot on the tail of Russell in the scrap for third, while Alonso had a chasing Sainz behind him.

That fight between Russell and Norris continued to heat up, leading to Norris trying to make a move on Lap 9 before an attempt one tour later saw the McLaren briefly dip his wheels onto the grass. “I'm not sure how I'm going to make it to the target lap, pushing like this,” Russell radioed in, voicing concerns about his tyre life.

This was perhaps music to the ears of Alonso, with the back and forth between the Mercedes and McLaren cars allowing the Spaniard to close in. However, it did not take long for Norris to pass Russell through the chicane on Lap 11, meaning that the Briton now faced the challenge of closing the gap to Piastri six seconds up ahead.

After all of this, Russell dived into the pit lane to swap his medium tyres for a set of the hards, with a flurry of pit stops suddenly taking place a little earlier than had been expected. Alonso was amongst those also to stop, sparking a moment of drama when flames appeared from the front brakes of the Aston Martin as he exited the pit lane.

Piastri opted to pit for the hard rubber on Lap 14 – but the stop proved to be a fairly slow one at 3.6s. Leclerc, meanwhile, looked to have gained during the pit stops phase, the Ferrari driver finding himself ahead of Russell, Sainz and Alonso on the road after all of this group had pitted.

Verstappen, meanwhile, had stayed out on track with a 10-second lead over Norris – who was also yet to pit – while the Dutchman's team mate Tsunoda tried to make Piastri's life more difficult as the Australian tried to overtake him for P10, the Japanese racer putting up a good fight before the McLaren ultimately made a successful move.

As Piastri gained further positions by picking off more cars that had yet to stop – that being Bearman and Colapinto – Leclerc continued his own ascent by clinching P11 from Tsunoda. And up at the front, Norris was told by his engineer: “The key for us is free air and going long.” Would a one-stop work for those extending their opening stints?

2025 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix: Norris battles past Russell take P3

Strategy was proving a key topic of discussion throughout the pack, with Sainz – who had already made a stop while team mate Albon had not – suggesting that a one-stop was the way to go. Hamilton, meanwhile, was also on a split strategy to the other Ferrari and debated whether an undercut could be effective, only to be told that there was too much traffic around him.

By Lap 25, Verstappen remained nine seconds clear of Norris up front, followed by Albon, Hadjar, Antonelli, Hamilton, Piastri, Hulkenberg, Leclerc and Bearman, with Piastri and Leclerc the only two in that top 10 to have made a pit stop.

It did not take long for that order to change as Piastri swept past Hamilton for sixth place, meaning that Antonelli was next in his sights. Having to carve through this traffic was not helping the championship leader out, with the gamble to pit him early seemingly not paying off.

Norris peeled into the pits on Lap 29, the Briton emerging back on track in P7 on the hard tyres – and just as he returned to the circuit, the yellow flags were flying due to Ocon having pulled onto the grass due to an issue with his Haas.

As a Virtual Safety Car was subsequently called, this worked out perfectly for Verstappen, who dived into the pit lane for his stop and returned to the track in the lead. Others also seized the opportunity to make their own stops, with all of those who had yet to pit taking the chance to do so.

Verstappen was able to make a perfectly-timed pit stop when a Virtual Safety Car was called

Several early-stopping cars also pitted for a second time under the VSC, including Leclerc, who voiced his frustrations about the timing over the radio. Piastri also made a second stop, bringing him back out into P4, while some potential unsafe releases looked to have occurred during those busy few minutes in the pit lane.

After all of this had shaken out and the VSC period had come to an end, the order on Lap 33 stood as Verstappen – now holding a whopping lead of 19 seconds – from Norris, Albon, Piastri, Hadjar, Antonelli, Hamilton, Leclerc, Alonso and Stroll.

While things looked to be working out well for Albon, his team mate Sainz was in the wars as he fought with Tsunoda for P13, the pair making contact as the Spaniard squeezed past. Hamilton, meanwhile, looked to be in dynamic form after benefitting from a stop during the VSC phase, the seven-time World Champion taking P6 from Antonelli before surging ahead of Hadjar for P5.

Elsewhere, Piastri had closed the gap down to Albon in a duel for the final spot on the podium – and the papaya car was soon through into Turn 2. And at the other end of the top 10, Alonso had lost out on 10th place to Hulkenberg, the Aston Martins seemingly slipping back after a promising performance in Qualifying.

In contrast to the British team's struggles, Ferrari looked resurgent following a challenging Saturday, with Leclerc clearing Hadjar to take P6. Hamilton was running 1.6s up the road in P5 – but with the latter having to nurse the medium tyres, could the squad potentially be faced with a team orders call should Leclerc close in?

Hamilton was looking racy as he put in a strong recovery drive in front of Ferrari's home crowd

Speaking of squad strategy decisions, Gasly voiced his gratitude as the Frenchman was allowed through on new team mate Colapinto to move up into P15, giving the opportunity to chase down Stroll up ahead. Alonso, meanwhile, labelled himself as the “unluckiest driver in the world” as he continued to slide backwards.

Another person not experiencing much luck was home favourite Antonelli, who pulled off onto the grass at Turn 8 on Lap 46 due to an issue with his Mercedes. A full Safety Car was then deployed – and Verstappen took the opportunity to pit again, having been placed well on track to make the stop.

Norris also visited the pits but suffered a slightly slow stop, bringing the Briton out in third behind Piastri who had not pitted again. Albon also made another stop before emerging back on track in fifth, with the top 10 now standing as Verstappen, Piastri, Norris, Leclerc, Albon, Russell, Hamilton, Sainz, Hadjar and Hulkenberg.

There looked to be concerns about tyre life ahead of the restart, with Leclerc questioning whether he could remain in the points on his older rubber while Norris pointed out that Piastri's 18-lap-old hard tyres may not hold out well – in contrast to his own fresher rubber. Would McLaren have a decision to make here?

As the stricken Mercedes of Antonelli was removed from the circuit, anticipation was building over when the action would resume – and the answer came when the Safety Car peeled into the pits at the end of Lap 53, allowing Verstappen to execute a strong restart and hold the lead ahead of a 10-lap sprint to the finish.

The race took another dramatic turn when the Safety Car was deployed

While the Dutchman was already 1.5s clear one tour down, Norris had closed to within one second of Piastri in what could prove to be a quandary for McLaren. Elsewhere Albon was hot on the tail of Leclerc – the Williams on much fresher tyres – while Hamilton looked to be all over the back of Russell and Tsunoda had picked off Hulkenberg for P10.

Hamilton had soon overtaken his former team mate to move up into sixth, just as Norris was getting ever closer to fellow McLaren driver Piastri. As the pair went side-by-side into Turn 2, Norris slipped through to grab second place.

Behind them, Albon was fighting hard to get past Leclerc, only for the Monegasque to defend against him. Things got incredibly close on Lap 60, with the two cars getting nail-bitingly close – resulting in Albon running through the gravel and dropping back down to sixth.

This allowed Hamilton to move up into fifth – before subsequently snatching fourth from his team mate and surging ahead of his fresher rubber. Albon then managed to close back in on Leclerc – but would he be able to make a move stick this time?

As the stewards opted to investigate that previous Albon and Leclerc incident, the Williams ultimately found a way past the Ferrari on the final lap of the race, leading Leclerc to ponder over the radio: ""What did I do wrong?""

Albon had an eventful afternoon at Imola

Up ahead, Verstappen crossed the line to seal a 65th career victory some 6.109s ahead of Norris in second, while Piastri followed by a similar margin to his team mate in third. Hamilton ended his first Italian race as a Ferrari driver in fourth, with the Briton dedicating his result to the Tifosi.

Albon held onto fifth ahead of Leclerc, while Russell took some valuable points for Mercedes in seventh on a day where only one of their cars made the finish. Sainz claimed P8 in the Williams, followed by Hadjar in ninth and Tsunoda in the final points-paying position of 10th.

Alonso ended the event in P11, marking a disappointing outing for Aston Martin, with Hulkenberg behind in P12, Gasly in P13 and Lawson in a quiet P14 for Racing Bulls.

Stroll claimed 15th place, while Colapinto was 16th on his return to the F1 grid for Alpine and Bearman and Bortoleto completed the order in 17th and 18th places. Antonelli and Ocon both recorded a DNF at Imola, with each having to pull off the track owing to an issue on their respective cars.

The end result of the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix means that Piastri continues to lead the Drivers' Championship on 146 points, 13 points clear of Norris in second – but Verstappen has now closed the gap down to just nine points behind Norris in third place.

Verstappen recorded his 65th career victory with his latest triumph at Imola

""The start itself wasn't particularly great, but then I was still on the outside line, basically the normal line, and I was like, ‘Well, I'm just going to try and send it around the outside',"" said Verstappen. ""It worked really well! That of course then unleased our pace, because once we were in the lead, the car was good. I could look after my tyres and we had very good pace today.

""Again, a massive improvement from Friday, and I'm very pleased for that. That VSC was quite handy to pit, and even then, even on the hard compound, I think our pace was very strong. Then of course there was the Safety Car, so the field was all back together. But even then on the restart, I think we managed it all really well and brought it home. I'm incredibly proud of everyone. It's been a very important week for us, the car has performed really well, and also I think the whole execution of the whole race, when to pit, the pit stops themselves, were all very good.""

Oscar Piastri has admitted that he ""braked too early"" allowing Max Verstappen to snatch the lead from the McLaren driver on the opening lap of the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, with the Red Bull driver going on to take a dominant victory.

The Australian started on pole for Sunday's race and held the lead off the line on the run to the first braking zone at the Tamburello chicane, with fellow front-row starter Verstappen side-by-side with P3-starter George Russell.

But sensationally, Verstappen sent his Red Bull to the outside of Piastri into the braking zone, squeezing the McLaren driver to the apex of the left turn before jumping into the lead through the following right.

""I just braked too early, it was a good move by Max as well,"" said Piastri after finishing third, cutting his Drivers' Championship lead to just 13 points over team mate Lando Norris.

""It's disappointing obviously, but I think we made a few wrong calls after that anyway. Not our best Sunday, so definitely a lot of things to look at and review from that one.

""Well done to Max and Red Bull. It was a good move, but also they had pace today. We'll look back on that one and see what we can do a bit better.""

Piastri circulated in second during the opening phase of the race having dropped back from Verstappen and was called into the pits to switch from the medium Pirelli tyre to the hard compound but found himself mired in the pack, requiring him to make several overtakes.

Piastri lost further ground to Verstappen as Esteban Ocon's stranded Haas brought out the Virtual Safety Car just before the halfway point, allowing the reigning World Champion a free pit stop which meant he rejoined with an extended lead.

A Safety Car to retrieve Kimi Antonelli's stranded Mercedes also left a 10-lap sprint for all the drivers at the end, but Piastri's older Pirelli hard tyres meant he was never able to challenge Verstappen at the restart on a day when Red Bull's pace matched McLaren.

Piastri also lost second to Norris late in the race

""Obviously the VSC was perfectly timed for Max and Lando, and then [under the Safety Car] I'd obviously used both my tyres at that point, both my hard tyres, so it made the last restart pretty tricky,"" Piastri explained.

""I tried my best to hang onto second, but I just had nowhere near enough grip, so third it is.""

Piastri lost second to team mate Norris late on as the Briton was able to use his fresher tyres, having pitted under the Safety Car, and DRS into the opening chicane to surge ahead, with the pair almost making contact.

""It was tricky, I tried my best to hang on, but I just didn't have the grip,"" said Piastri about the move.

""I tried my best and it was inevitable I think that he was going to get past, but I wasn't going to give up without a fight.""

Springsteen doubled down on criticism of the Trump administration Saturday night, after the U.S. president called him ""dumb as a rock"" and a ""dried out 'prune.'""


													By
												

	Ashley Iasimone



	Bruce Springsteen resumed denouncing Donald Trump from the stage of his Land of Hopes and Dreams Tour Saturday night (May 17) in Manchester, England.


	The Los Angeles Times reports the Boss didn't back down from his stance on Trump this weekend, after the U.S. president called Springsteen “highly overrated,” “dumb as a rock” and a “dried out ‘prune' of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!)” in a post on Truth Social. The rant was Trump's reaction to the musician calling out the president's “corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration” at his tour opener earlier in the week.

	











	“Things are happening right now that are altering the very nature of our country's democracy, and they're too important to ignore,” Springsteen said to the crowd in a three-minute speech on Manchester's Co-op Live stage on Saturday, as heard in a video posted by the L.A. Times.


	“In my home, they're persecuting people for their right to free speech and voicing their dissent. That's happening now,” Springsteen said, echoing what he'd spoken about at his May 14 show. “In America, the richest men are taking satisfaction in abandoning the world's poorest children to sickness and death. That's happening now. In my country, they're taking sadistic pleasure in the pain they inflict on loyal American workers.”


	Springsteen continued, “They are removing residents off American streets without due process of law and deploying them to foreign detention centers as prisoners. That's happening now. The majority of our elected representatives have utterly failed to protect the American people from the abuses of an unfit president and a rogue government. They have no concern or idea of what it means to be deeply American.”


	On a note of optimism that quoted novelist and civil rights activist James Baldwin, he added, “The America I've sung to you about for 50 years is real, and regardless of its many faults, it's a great country with a great people, and we will survive this moment. Well, I have hope, because I believe in the truth of what the great American writer James Baldwin said. He said, ‘In this world, there isn't as much humanity as one would like, but there's enough.'”


	On Friday, after Springsteen had shared similar thoughts from the stage on opening night of his tour, Trump responded on Truth Social, writing: “I see that Highly Overrated Bruce Springsteen goes to a Foreign Country to speak badly about the President of the United States. Never liked him, never liked his music, or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he's not a talented guy — Just a pushy, obnoxious JERK, who fervently supported Crooked Joe Biden, a mentally incompetent FOOL, and our WORST EVER President, who came close to destroying our Country. Sleepy Joe didn't have a clue as to what he was doing, but Springsteen is ‘dumb as a rock,' and couldn't see what was going on, or could he (which is even worse!)? This dried out ‘prune' of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that's just ‘standard fare.' Then we'll all see how it goes for him!”

	











	The “Born in the U.S.A.” singer, who's performing across the U.K., France, Spain, Germany and Italy from now through early July, endorsed Trump's opponent Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.

					By Andreas Wiseman 

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: In one of the bigger deals being thrashed out during the Cannes market, we hear that Focus Features is working on a domestic pact in the $11M range for Paul Greengrass‘ peasant revolt movie The Rage.


	Two-time Oscar nominee Andrew Garfield is now in active negotiations to join the movie in the lead role, taking over from Matthew McConaughey.


	The film is set during the Peasants' Revolt, a major uprising that took part across large parts of England in 1381 in response to socio-economic and political tensions and high taxation. Should a deal get done, which we understand is likely, Garfield would play a farmer who becomes the leader of the revolt. It has been speculated that the character could be based on the legendary Wat Tyler, who led the uprising before being killed by forces loyal to King Richard, though this is unconfirmed.

	











	Garfield's English background (the dual UK-U.S. national was raised in the UK) makes him a good fit for the project. Between Spider-Man and Hacksaw Ridge, The Social Network and tick tick…BOOM! he has long proven able to mix it between action and prestige roles that connect with audiences and garner significant box office. He is coming off romantic drama We Live in Time, which took close to $60M worldwide, and next will be seen opposite Julia Roberts in Luca Guadagnino's After the Hunt.

	Oscar nominee Greengrass, well known for the Bourne franchise and such movies as Captain Phillips and United 93, is scripting the project. Jason Blum is producing through Blumhouse Productions, with Greg Goodman, Joanna Kaye and Greengrass. CAA Media Finance is repping domestic. FilmNation is selling international. Focus has been into the project for a while and began talks at EFM.


	Blum and Goodman recently teamed on Greengrass' upcoming movie The Lost Bus for Apple. 


	Focus is coming off a busy and lucrative awards season thanks to Conclave and Nosferatu. It's at the Cannes Film Festival with Wes Anderson's Phoenician Scheme and The History of Sound and there are high hopes later this year for movies such as Hamnet, Bugonia and the next Downton Abbey installment.

EXCLUSIVE: Brazilian director Kleber Mendonça Filho is back in Competition in Cannes for the third time with 1977-set thriller The Secret Agent, and Deadline can reveal a first clip.


	Wagner Maura (Civil War, Narcos: Mexico) stars as a technology expert in his early 40s, is on the run.


	He travels to Brazil's northeastern port city of Recife during carnival week, hoping to reunite with his son but soon realizes that the city is far from being the non-violent refuge he seeks.


	Like Walter Salles' recent Oscar winner I'm Still Here, the drama is set against the backdrop of Brazil's the military dictatorship, which lasted from 1964 to 1985. However, Filho, who hails from Recife, says his film takes a different approach to that period.

	“Every time I told people the film would be set in 1977, the first word that comes out is ‘dictatorship'. Which is fine, but in Brazilian cinema, and Argentinian cinema as well, there is a sub-genre of the dictatorship movie,” says Filho.


	“The challenge was to make a film about the logic of that time without ticking all the boxes of the dictatorship movie. I'm not against those films. In fact, we just had a very strong and beautiful film in Brazilian cinema, I'm Still Here, by Walter Salles, which did wonders for many young people who were not even aware of that moment in history. But with this film, it's very much about the atmosphere, the fumes.”


	The Brazilian, French, German and Netherlands Film is produced by Cinemascópio, MK Productions, Lemming Film, One Two Films. Paris-based mk2 films is handling international sales.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


	There were jokes about cast member Sarah Sherman leaving and Weekend Update‘s Colin Jost replacing Saturday Night Live boss Lorne Michaels, there were long hugs during the curtain call but no real indications of the changes to come during the Season 50 finale of the venerable NBC sketch comedy series.


	And changes are likely to come with a 17-member cast that features six veterans who have been on the show for seven or more seasons: Jost, Michael Che, Mikey Day, Heidi Gardner, Ego Nwodim as well as Kenan Thompson, the longest-tenured SNL cast member in history at 22 years.


Saturday Night Live stopped giving longtime cast members sendoffs in the season finale like the star-studded goodbye Kristen Wiig received in May 2012 after seven years on the show. There were flowers during tonight's curtain call, but they were from Jost to the finale's host, his wife Scarlett Johansson. (You can watch it below.)

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Of the current longtimers, only Che has said publicly that they would be leaving after this season, but it was during a stand-up performance, and he has also said that in the past. He didn't give any hints of a pending exit in tonight's closer.


	Several other veteran SNL cast members have alluded in interviews and social media posts that they may leave but there were no signs of that in the finale either, like the way Kate McKinnon got choked up in her final episode.


RELATED: Weekend Update Joke Swap Sees Michael Che Atone For Scarlett Johansson Joke As Colin Jost Comes For Lorne Michaels' Throne: “Retire B*tch”


	It was largely business as usual. And, surprisingly, it was one of the busiest current cast members from the more recent SNL additions, Sarah Sherman, who was called out by Johansson in her opening monologue. 


	“It's been a great season / and Sarah is leaving / we're all gonna miss you next year,” Johansson sang, to which shocked Sherman responded, “Wait, what? Did you guys hear something? What do you mean leaving?”


	It was a joke; Sherman likely was picked because she is not a departure suspect. During the curtain call at the end of the episode, Sherman was one of two cast members Bowen Yang was seen giving lengthy embraces to, along with Nwodim. While he has been an SNL cast member for six seasons, Yang has been on the show for seven, having started as a writer. And he has seen his feature career explode, opening new opportunities for one of SNL‘s MVPs.

	











	The finale also addressed wide spread speculation that Jost is among the top contenders to succeed Michaels at the helm of SNL when he retires. Michaels had suggested that would leave after the show's milestone 50th anniversary but subsequently walked that back, saying that there was “no immediate plan” for him to step down.

	In the latest edition of Weekend Update‘s infamous — and hugely popular — semi-annual Joke Swap between Che and Jost, the latter had to open with this line he was made to read: 


	“It's SNL‘s 50th season, so I want to take a moment to say something to our boss, Lorne Michaels. Lorne, retire b*tch! Let me run the show.”


	Jost had to revisit the subject at the end of the segment when he was prompted to put on red lipstick before saying another line written for him by Che, “Lorne, I'll do anything to run this show.”


	Later, during the curtain call, Jost's wife, Johansson, gave Michaels a shoutout, congratulating him on SNL‘s 50-year run. “You are a singular man, we love you and thank you,” she said.


	It is unclear when we will get news on departing SNL cast members. Traditionally, veterans who decide to leave make the announcement in the weeks following the season finale. After taking some time off, Michaels gets back to it by July, with decisions who would not be asked back usually made in August-early September. 

Thank you, Scarlett Johansson, Bad Bunny, Mike Myers, and RaiNao! Goodnight! pic.twitter.com/fTy9bl5fN9

					By Baz Bamigboye 

Columnist/International Editor At Large


	Over coffee in Soho, Antonia Desplat is describing her journey to Wes Anderson's set for The Phoenician Scheme — the espionage drama that marks his fourth picture to compete for the Palme d'Or.


	Desplat was working on French TV drama Made in France when the email arrived: “Wes wants to know if you want to come to Potsdam next week to play one of Benicio del Toro's dead wives.”


	One year before being beckoned to Germany by Anderson, Desplat had played the female lead in Johnny Depp's Modi: Three Days on the Wing of Madness, opening in June, which chronicles Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani's rampage through pre-World War I Paris. Desplat plays Modigliani's lover, the formidable writer and poet Beatrice Hastings.

	











	In response to that email request, Desplat says, “I literally just jumped on a plane, went to Potsdam, then next to Berlin, and had two days on set with these geniuses. I had dinner with Bill Murray, Benicio del Toro, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Mia Threapleton and I was just like, ‘What?' I mean, it never gets normal because Wes is a genius. So, seeing him at work is incredible.”




			Watch on Deadline		







RELATED: Neon's Palme D'Or Whisperer Tom Quinn Reveals Keys To Cannes And Oscar Success: “I'm Happy To Share A Playbook”


	As Desplat points out, “Everybody wants to be in a Wes Anderson.” She herself is there as “a glorified extra”, she says. “I don't even have a line, but I'm just happy to be there. And I think Charlotte Gainsbourg has one line.”


	One of Anderson's signatures is his precision. “Your costumes are magnificent,” Desplat says. “Milena Canonero, the costume designer, she makes every single costume by hand, even for one frame. It's unbelievable; every little detail. And it's wonderful just to be part of it.”


	Breathlessly, she reels off a few more of the cast: Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Rupert Friend, Bryan Cranston, Jeffrey Wright, Michael Cera, Richard Ayoade, Riz Ahmed, Hope Davis, Mathieu Amalric, Jason Watkins and Alex Jennings. “There's 30-plus ridiculously talented, famous actors on this cast, minimum. It's nuts,” she says. Desplat did her scenes with Del Toro, Gainsbourg and Threapleton.

	











	Murray was hanging about too. “I was having breakfast, and I was done, and he came to my table. He was like, ‘Hi, good morning,' and he just started taking my plate away! He crumbed my table and just walked off. And I was like, ‘What the f*ck just happened?'” she says, laughing. 


RELATED: ‘Eddington' Cannes Film Festival Premiere Photos: Joaquin Phoenix, Pedro Pascal, Emma Stone, Austin Butler & More


	She already knew some of Anderson's crew, including Sanjay Sami, a grip who worked on the Apple TV+ drama Shantaram, for which she spent four months in India. She describes the experience on Anderson's set as feeling “like a family”.


	“Family” is the key word here. Her father is the composer Alexandre Desplat, who won Oscars for Guillermo del Toro's The Shape of Water and for Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel. The Phoenician Scheme marks the sixth film Desplat pére has scored for the director.


RELATED: ‘Sound Of Falling' Review: Mascha Schilinski's Superb Feature Is A Masterclass In Ethereal, Unnerving Brilliance – Cannes Film Festival


	“I've known Wes since I'm a little girl, all the way back to The Fantastic Mr. Fox,” Desplat says. “My dad used to have his studio in our house so the directors would come and listen.”


	Desplat doesn't for a minute feel sorry for herself but, when pushed, will admit to having had “quite a hard time with being the daughter of someone,”  but nowadays, “with the nepo baby thing,” she feels “I've actually come to peace with it, whereas when I was younger, particularly in France, there's such a thing with the daughter of and son of. I think I came here [to the U.K.] to really be my own person.”


	Desplat studied acting and contemporary theater at the East 15 school in Essex, and at The Drama Centre, where she startled passersby in a park while practicing writhing around like a lizard, then afterward went to her Shakespeare class caked in mud. “It's so very much about the craft and where you've trained and not who you know, and by doing that I created my own thing,” she says.


	After Depp saw her audition tape for Modi, he was struck by her perfect British accent, and by the fact that she was smoking a “brown rollie” — a hand-rolled cigarette with liquorice paper — a passion both share. Depp met her on Zoom to tell her she had the part.


	Now she's more comfortable with the idea of doing a film where her father is also working on the score. “That's fine,” she says, “I think my work speaks for itself.”


	And then she's off, riding her Lime electric bike to her next adventure.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


Saturday Night Live opened its Season 50 finale with the show's Donald Trump (James Austin Johnson) taking his seat in the audience and saying farewell until the fall.


	“After tonight, you won't be seeing me here for a while,” said Johnson's Trump. “Well, not the fake, fun version of me that makes you smile. The real one will still be omnipresent. You can't escape me, right? I'm everywhere, even in your dreams, like the late, great Freddy Krueger.”


	Johnson was right: the real president has been posting on Truth Social throughout the evening, including an attack on ABC News for its report that he is planning to accept a $400 million plane from Qatar, to be used as Air Force One and later for his presidential library.

	











	That gift of a 747 was the subject of some of the quips earlier in the sketch, as Trump, speaking to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, relished in his deal-making trip to the Middle East and all the love and affection shown to him.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“The Qataris gave me a $400 million plane, can you believe that? And people said that it was some sort of a bribe. Not true, not true. Because they haven't asked for anything in return.”


	The crown prince chimed in, “Well, not yet.”


	Trump responded, “So it's a pre-bribe. But now people are saying I should really be flying in an American plane. Ah, no thanks, sonny. Have you seen what is going on with our planes?”


	About an hour before SNL, the real Trump was insisting this evening that the plane was not a gift to him personally. In a Truth Social post, he again appeared to be threatening ABC News, which broke the story on Sunday.


	The real Trump wrote, “Everyone, including their lawyers, has been told that ABC must not say that Qatar is giving ME a FREE Boeing 747 Airplane, because they are not. Instead, and as Fake News ABC fully knows and understands, this highly respected country is donating the plane to the United States Air Force/ Defense Department, AND NOT TO ME. By so doing, they are saving our country, and the American Taxpayer, hundreds of millions of dollars. ABC Fake News is one of the WORST.”


	The Qatar gift has drawn criticism not just from Democrats, but from some Republicans and those who have otherwise defended the president. 


	In his weeklong trip in the Middle East, Trump also showered praise on MBS, even though U.S. intelligence concluded that he approved the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist for The Washington Post.

	











	“I didn't make this trip for myself,” SNL‘s Trump told MBS. “I want to make that clear. I did this for the American people, and in many ways myself, my personal enrichment. I did that too.”

					By Pete Hammond 

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


	Brazilian filmmaker Kleber Mendonca Filho is no stranger to Cannes, having debuted two previous films in Competition beginning with Aquarius in 2016 starring Sonia Braga, so effective as a woman determined not to lose her condo to a demolition, and then grabbing the Jury Prize in 2019 for the surreal western Bacurau (again with Braga), in which a whole village seemingly is disappeared from satellite maps and must fight for its existence. Both of those movies deal thematically with people threatened with losing their way of life, being displaced.


	Now his third film in Competition and biggest production yet, The Secret Agent, also might fit into that theme (and no, it is not some James Bond ripoff) as it centers on a man coming back to a small city in order to get closer to his young son after losing his wife to pneumonia. What he discovers in the film set in 1977 Recife is a town under siege at Carnival time by criminal elements in the country, which is being run by a dictatorship and losing the chance for a better life under the ruling class.

	











	Unlike the 1970-set Walter Salles film I'm Still Here, which won the Best International Film Oscar in March and is explicitly about being disappeared under the harsh military torture tactics, this film is really in the thriller mode. It focuses more explicitly on the individual story of Marcel (Wagner Maura), a somewhat mysterious tech guy who drives back to Recife looking for a change and second chance at life but immediately finds some strange vibes at the gas station just outside of town, where a dead body lies there covered by a blanket and abandoned. He is confronted by two military types who put him through the ringer with questions and checking out his car. He just wants to continue on and gets his first taste of the new corruption there by paying them off to stop the makeshift “interrogation.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Once he gets back on somewhat familiar ground he finds a familiar face at the building where his son lives, the wise owner Tereza Victoria (a charming Isabel  Zuaa) who immediately tries to set him up with the upstairs neighbor, Claudia (Aerrula Guedes). He also engages with his boy who is more interested in drawings he is creating of the shark from Jaws, a movie Marcel is determined not to let his son see at the local cinema where grandpa runs the projector and seems more willing to show the kid the Spielberg classic (this interaction will all be paid off at film's end when the action flash forwards to 2025).

	











	Meanwhile at his new job at a firm dealing with identity cards and research the locals are curious about his single or married status, while newspapers run the story of a man's leg being discovered in a great white shark which  was washed up and now made its way to a lab for a police investigation. Eventually the “hairy leg” story takes on a life of its own, with even a fantasy sequence in which it attacks men engaging in sexual activity in a gay park, something meant as a metaphor for the secret police and authorities cracking down.


	There is a complicated path with many shady characters being weaved in and out, a body count nearing 100 unexplained deaths  at Carnaval, and a extremist rival of Marcel's from his University days determined to oust smart colleagues by hiring a pair of daunting hit men who we first meet dumping one of their “hits” off a bridge, and now hired to track down Marcel and “shoot him in the mouth”. They are also connected to that mystery leg to boot. And here is where we learn Marcel may not be Marcel  at all, but rather Armando. Hmmmm.  In one of the best sequences, certainly the most violent, the hit men hire another hit man to actually do the deed putting Marcel/Armando  in real danger in a town where he is getting a lot more than he bargained for. 


	Maura (Elite Squad, Narcos, Dope Thief) plays the unsuspecting “newbie” in town with conviction and slow reveal that he is hiding more than he lets on. The very large supporting cast including Filha regular Udo Kier fill in all the blanks in this overlong – at 158 minutes – sometimes rambling scenario that Filha has nevertheless managed to infuse with style and wide screen excitement. It also has a key subplot set a half century later with two women transcribing audio cassette tapes from the archive, one of them a taped conversation with Armando which holds great fascination and curiosity for one of the women, Flavia (Laura Lufesi) and could be a key to unlocking all the mystery. 


	Producer is Emilie Lesclaux.

In his 2023 essay film “Pictures of Ghosts,” a haunted cine-memoir that uses Recife's once-glorious movie palaces as a lens through which to examine — and to mourn — the cultural amnesia of a country so determined to forget itself, Brazilian auteur Kleber Mendonça Filho somewhat counterintuitively observes that “Fiction films are the best documentaries.” If Filho had to make a documentary in order to illustrate that idea, the sober but gripping thriller that it inspired him to shoot next proves the point with gusto. 

Born from the process of researching “Pictures of Ghosts” (a fact that becomes rewardingly self-evident over the course of its 158-minute runtime), “The Secret Agent” recreates 1977 Recife with even more vivid detail than Filho's documentary was able to restore his childhood vision of the city through archival video and photographs alone. Focused but sprawling, the director's first true period piece is absolutely teeming with the music, color, and style of the “Brazilian Miracle” that marked the height of the country's military dictatorship, and yet all of those signifiers — along with most direct evidence of the military dictatorship itself — are sublimated into the movie's pervasive sense of mischief. 

 








Related Stories ‘My Father's Shadow' Review: The First Nigerian Film to Premiere at Cannes Is a Beautifully Remembered Drama About a Fateful Day Trip Into Lagos ‘Peak Everything' Review: A Light Comedy About the End of the World 

That's the word Filho uses to identify the time period in the film's opening title card, and it accurately sets the scene for a story less rooted in the terror of Walter Salles' “I'm Still Here” than in the wistful barbarity of Wes Anderson's “The Grand Budapest Hotel.” Of course, those movies both hinge on the tragic poignancy of their stolen pasts, and this one does too — but slowly, and with a much softer approach to the way that memory persists in spite of the gangsters who might work to erase it. 

Far from the high-octane spy picture that might be suggested by its title (a title that's easy to imagine written in giant letters across the marquee of Recife's São Luiz Cinema), “The Secret Agent” only bumps into espionage tropes as if by accident, and its protagonist seems to be as confused by them as we are. Filho's movie operates at the pace and tenor of a drama in exile, albeit one that's fringed with B-movie fun and stalked by a pair of unscrupulous hitmen. 

 










The film's story begins in media res, and while the plot couldn't be easier to follow, it fittingly requires the audience to earn every morsel of the context they'll need to appreciate its power. A middle-aged man who marries the quiet confidence of a cowboy with the “I don't want any trouble, here” demeanor of an extra who just wants to survive the trigger-happy Western around him, Marcelo could be an anti-military Communist, but he could just as easily be a tech researcher who has personal business in Recife. 

That duality is at the heart of Wagner Moura's deceptively recessive lead performance — a performance that Filho mines for its errant sense of mystery from the movie's opening scene, in which Marcelo smooth talks a dirty cop at a highway gas station where a corpse has been rotting in the sun for several days. “I'm almost getting used to this shit,” the station owner spits, alarmed at how fast he's adjusted to the reality of doing whatever business he can with a dog-eaten body lying next to the pump. Change comes fast in Filho's Brazil, and it's hard to blame people for doing their best to roll with the punches.

Marcelo eventually arrives in Recife at the height of Carnival (“91 Dead!” the newspapers exclaim, with plenty more to come), where he moves into an apartment complex run by a feisty 77-year-old woman who shelters dissidents in need of a place to stay as they look for a way out of the country. The space also provides a home to the parents of Marcelo's late wife, and to the young son they shared before she died. It even comes with a covert job of sorts, though we learn very little about the specifics of the counterintelligence network that lands Marcelo a gig at the government office that mints government identification cards. (Certain vagaries are essential to this film about filling in the blanks, while others merely chip away at our understanding of what's at stake.) 

 










It's also the building whose archives might contain the only documented proof that his mother — disappeared from the Earth long before this story begins — ever existed in the first place, and Marcelo is determined to find it before he makes a break for the border. Alas, time will be of the essence here, as a bureaucrat who Marcelo crossed up north has dispatched a pair of contract killers to “shoot a hole into his mouth.” And if they don't get him, Recife's shit-eating chief of police (Roberio Diogenes as Euclides) and his fascist deputies probably will, though he takes a shine to Marcelo that could prove useful in a pinch.

Including Marcelo and his kid, all three of the film's rival factions are father-son teams, a choice that highlights Filho's gentle emphasis on the relationship between lineage and identity — and the defiant notion that history is as hard to erase as DNA. “Can I see my blood?” someone asks while in the process of getting it drawn, a simple aside that captures so much of what Marcelo is hoping to accomplish in this story, to say nothing of what has motivated Filho, whose mother was a historian, to excavate the memories of his hometown in films like “Neighboring Sounds” and “Aquarius.” 

“The Secret Agent” doesn't really tie a bow on that motif until the final minutes, which are set within one of the jarringly sterile flash-forwards that are littered across this story, but Filho tends to prefer crisp texture over clear point-scoring (as fans of his more fun and anarchic “Bacurau” could attest), and this vibrant memory palace of a movie isn't in much of a hurry to get to its punchline. That's mostly to its benefit, as the movie — always compelling, but sometimes more sedate than its material demands — is often at its most alive during its detours. 

 










A scene featuring an agitated Udo Kier as a bullet-scarred Jewish tailor stands out for the contrast it draws between the permanence of scars and the mutability of the conclusions that people draw from them, while a loaded subplot about a disembodied leg evolves from a literary device to a full-blown Quentin Dupieux gag as Filho uses it to kick a hole into the fence between awful facts and urban legends. We also meet a cat with two heads, but I can't pretend to have a clear read on the meaning behind that just yet. 

The cat-and-mouse chase that's fueling the plot does boil over into a gnarly shootout (Filho's approach to gore continues to be a thing of beauty), but, to the potential disappointment of anyone hoping for another hit of that “Bacurau” high, “The Secret Agent” is consistently less interested in action than consequence, and less interested in scene than scenery. You can feel the filmmaker's dream-come-true ecstasy at being able to recreate the golden age of Recife's cinemas, which backdrop several key moments and tee up a recurring obsession with “Jaws.” Ditto the joy he gets from rendering the city's streets in magnificent widescreen, and filling them with punch-buggies, bell-bottoms, and so many great Tropicália-accented songs that the critic sitting next to me spent the entire movie Shazam-ing every scene. I obviously stabbed him to death with my pen at a certain point, but I made sure to steal his phone for reference when the screening was over. 

 










That joy is contagious enough to feed into the bittersweet story Filho wrote as a conduit for it, and to deepen the ultimate impact of its argument that movies can manufacture a meaningful history of their own — one powerful enough to cut through the erosion of truth, and the official record of a country that might be too ashamed of its own reflection to honestly look itself in the mirror. With “The Secret Agent,” Filho exhumes the past as the basis for a purely fictional story, and in doing so articulates how fiction can be even more valuable as a vehicle for truth than it is as a tool for covering it up. 

“The Secret Agent” premiered in Competition at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

June 24, 1993 will become known as one of the most consequential days in the brief history of post-colonial Nigeria, but — for the two young boys at the heart of Akinola Davies Jr.'s semi-autobiographical drama “My Father's Shadow” — that date is destined to be remembered for considerably more personal reasons. 

It was on June 24, 1993 that Major General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, refusing to accept that the citizens of Nigeria had overwhelmingly voted for the people's champion MKO Abiola, annulled the results of the country's first democratic election since the military coup 10 years earlier. It was also, this poignant and vividly realized film invites us to imagine, on June 24, 1993 that brothers Akin and Remi were invited on a rare trip to Lagos with their dad, Folarin, a strong but mysterious figure in their lives who was often away from their family for months at a time.

Over the course of their wistful and chaotic journey into the big city (a two-hour drive from Ibadan that becomes an odyssey unto itself, thanks to Nigeria's petrol shortage), the boys will come to see their father in a brilliant new light — one that will light up their dreams for decades to come. 

Set at a moment when Nigeria seemed to be on the precipice of a new dawn, “My Father's Shadow” tempers a nascent sense of hope with a lingering air of hauntedness. The horrors of a recent massacre are splashed across newspaper headlines, but men like Folarin (“Gangs of London” star Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù, entrancingly tough and tender all at once) are eager to move forward and invest in their children's future — to steal it back from the military. 

“If you die for Nigeria, you die for nothing,” someone says. Folarin would prefer to stay alive. 

His kids barely know him, but — like most fathers, and absent fathers in particular — he looms over their lives like the sky itself, and the boys would struggle to conceive of a world without him in it. And yet, Davies, who naturally co-wrote the movie with his brother Wale, shoots Folarin as if he's already halfway gone. Despite the basic and tangible need that motivates his trip into Lagos that day (Folarin hasn't received a paycheck for his last six months of work, and the time has come to collect), there are stretches of this film in which he seems to be a spectral projection of some kind, if only because his sons have never seen him in this context before. 

 










For the time being, Akin and Remi's imaginations are limited to the WWF matches they stage with paper dolls, and to whatever TV shows they're able to watch in their mother's carpet fortress of a living room; the production design by Jennifer Boyd and Pablo Bruhn is fantastically transportive without ever calling undue attention to itself, just as PC Williams' costumes manage to capture the beauty of Nigeria's people even in the heart of a crisis. The boys are simply thrilled to get out of the house, and the simple adventure of a trip into the city is enough to make Aki — the younger and more precious of the two — giddy with excitement. 

But Aki is also more unforgiving of his dad's long work absences, and he resents Folarin for making his mother so upset. Played by real-life brothers Godwin (Aki) and Chibuike (Remi) Egbo, both of whom bring an unmistakably lived-in quality to their sibling dynamic, the kids are watchful in the way that children only can be around their parents, and Folarin responds to that attention by performing a mottled kind of masculinity for them to follow. 

Dìrísù's beautiful performance is tough but sweet; it's a profoundly stressful day for his character, but his frustration never spills over into the kind of anger that we've come to expect from similar films about distant and commanding men. In part, that's because the Davies brothers' episodic script — which can be opaque one moment and overly instructive the next, in the way of so many debut features — knows to reserve Folarin's rage for the fight to come when the sun goes down. And in part that's because Dìrísù's manner is tinged with resignation from the start, as if he's already convinced that his sons will only ever know him in their dreams. 

 










“The memories that cause you pain when someone leaves are the same ones that will comfort you later,” he tells the boys before letting them run loose in an empty amusement park. Like so many of the locations in this film (i.e. a beached ship, a bar with secrets), it feels like a place that's already been gutted of everything but the memory of it. 

And so “My Father's Shadow” resolves as a movie less about a father than it is about the absence of one — a vibrant, deeply felt love letter to Lagos, written in blood. Spotty as the storytelling can be in the space between heart-to-heart conversations and pre-crystalized lines of dialogue (“Everything is sacrifice, you just have to pray you don't sacrifice the wrong thing”), the slack that Davies creates between Folarin and his children is so well-measured that it hurts just to think that something might sever their relationship completely. What could be worth such a loss, and how might a country hope to survive it? 

“Nigeria is hard,” Folarin laments, but he's resolved to do whatever he can to make it easier for his sons, and also somehow lighter by the grace of his shadow. This heartfelt debut keeps it all in the family, and by the time the film arrives at its touching final moments we're left with the simple truth that — whatever his flaws as a father — Folarin cared deeply about his children's future, and in doing so gave them all the reason they needed to cherish their memories of the past. 

 










“My Father's Shadow” premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. MUBI will release it in the United States.

A movie called “Peak Everything” might seem to imply a certain measure of maximalism, but Anne Émond's disarmingly low-key romance — its title alluding to the strain that the 21st century has placed on all of the world's resources at once — prefers to vibe off the emotional paralysis of living at the end of the world. To borrow a word that the film doesn't bother to define (we know what it means even if we don't know what it means), this twee French-Canadian love story is steeped in the heartache of “solastalgia,” or the existential distress caused by a change to one's home environment. The sea levels rise and the moon glows red, but “Peak Everything” remains at the pitch of a self-help tape as it strains to find a ray of light in the storm clouds of what's coming.

Be that as it may, the apocalypse is as real to Émond's protagonist as it was to the characters in spiritual forebears like “Miracle Mile” or “Seeking a Friend for the End of the World.” Kind-hearted kennel-owner Adam (Patrick Hivon) is simply too overwhelmed by anxiety to panic or to partner up. His mother is dead, his boorish father doesn't believe that men should have feelings, and his psychiatrist just starts doodling whenever he goes on one of his usual rants about ecological collapse. By the time we first meet him, Adam's only recourse is to order a Polar Lux light therapy lamp on Amazon. 

The sound of the delivery person scanning the package is the first thing we hear at the start of the film, and it's distressing how perfectly that beep meep BEEP! — so recognizable from the ambient noise of our own lives — articulates that Adam's world is on the brink of ruin. The lamp doesn't work, but when Adam phones the customer service line for help, the upbeat voice on the other end of the line suddenly fills him with hope and possibility in the face of catastrophe. The feeling is mutual; Tina (Piper Perabo) is as stirred by Adam's naked unease as he is by her immaculate cheer. They don't know anything about each other, but — at a time when the fate of humanity is as clear and inflexible as scientific data — the unknown might be the last place that either of these people can still look for salvation.

Set to be released as “Amour Apocalypse” in French, “Peak Everything” is a cute and winsome little movie that often suffers from the same paralysis as its cute and winsome hero, whose permanent hangdog expression makes his high cheekbones feel like some kind of cosmic joke. Kooky in a way that it always embraces but never admits to, Émond's wryly neurotic script isn't just rooted in Adam's anxiety, it's flattened by it as well. 

 










The sociopathic Gen-Z girl who Adam employs at the kennel — she hates work, but loves torturing her boss with unsolicited handjobs — is slightly amusing in a very different way than his 40-something friend who's obsessed with putting hot dogs into his macaroni and cheese, but Adam feels equally alienated from them both (how can they be so asinine at a time like this!?), so the film treats them with the same deadpan confusion. It's normal that nothing makes sense to him, and “Peak Everything” is so determined to maintain that steady tone of disconnection that it seldom dares to swing for bigger laughs or strike at a deeper kind of pathos. The scale of the story ramps up once Adam resolves to drive across Ontario and find Tina in the flesh, and the film readily expands to make room for a handful of overlapping genres, but Émond is reluctant to risk as much as her main character; everything gets mixed up, but little of it is meaningfully entwined. 

That includes Adam and Tina, two “young old people” (as Émond describes them in the film's press notes) who literally create a kind of call-and-response between the pervasive dread of being alive right now and the pleasures of being pure at heart. Which isn't to say that Adam is just depression personified, and Tina the cure for what ails him; she has a massive weight around her shoulders as well, but the leap of faith that Adam takes in finding her gives Tina the push she needs to make a similar jump of her own. 

 










That's the only level on which these strangers really connect with each other (that and their mutual love of snow), and the fact that they don't share the same first language further underlines the reality that they come from different worlds, but it's enough for them to ride out the end of the world together. 

Still, in a movie so concerned with the lack of communication between people, that the movie isn't particularly capable of communicating anything of its own is a problem. It's difficult to render depression in a way that allows for fun or catharsis, and “Peak Everything” struggles with that dilemma as it crescendos towards the apocalypse. It's clear the film is rooted in a real understanding of the conditions at hand (just as it's clear that Émond has wrested this story from a place of personal heartache), and the rawness of it all tends to bleed through some of the cutesier attempts at comedy. 

“I wish I could understand the world better,” Adam sighs at one point, his voice already heavy with the weight of it ending. But this is nothing if not a light comedy, and “Peak Everything” is content to remind Adam that at least it hasn't ended yet.

“Peak Everything” premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Dick-sucking, boot-licking, and ball-gagging are de rigueur for a movie like writer/director Harry Lighton's wildly graphic and strangely moving BDSM romance, “Pillion.” But for a British queer film that puts the particulars of a gay dominant-submissive affair (or arrangement, better yet) up front and up close, actors Alexander Skarsgård and Harry Melling find the sweet center of a story marked by clamps, cages, and assless unitards. No doubt comparisons will arise to another A24 movie, “Babygirl,” which last year put Nicole Kidman on all fours, crying out to Harris Dickinson that “I'm gonna pee!” when actually she was just having an orgasm with another person for the first time.

Lighton, adapting Adam Mars-Jones' book “Box Hill,” really does take us there in the delightful “Pillion,” with Skarsgård getting more emotionally naked than ever and almost physically more than he ever got as Eric Northman on TV's “True Blood.” But not without, at first, this leather-clad biker, who seeks a submissive with seemingly disinterested vibes, radiating aloof energy when he first meets barbershop quartet singer Colin (Melling, in a truly special and wonderful breakout performance). A parking garage attendant by day and dandied-up singer by night who's just a bit too old to still be living with his parents — though his mum (Lesley Sharp) is dying of cancer, which in part keeps him home — Colin isn't so much looking for love or companionship or sex as much as he finally happens to fall into it when on Christmas Eve he's asked for a date, of sorts, by Ray (Skarsgård, who looks and sounds more and more like his father with each day).

Ray is an enigma and a mystery, a man who zips into town on a motorbike like a phantom and could just as easily evaporate at any minute. He's not at all giving of emotion toward Colin as their courtship — again, if we can call it that — turns into a serious but never sinister game of domination and submission. When Ray eventually brings Colin back to his ascetically composed apartment, he refuses to let Colin hang up his coat. He refuses Colin to have much volition at all. Ray also has a tattoo in the middle of his chest, inked with the names “Ellen Wendy Rosie” for reasons never explained but all the more to add to his impenetrable allure.

 










It's penetrating Colin — physically, psychically — that he eventually gets around to after some toying and coying. He won't let Colin sleep next to him, keeping him on the floor like a dog at the foot of the bed. Here's the kind of guy for whom Karl Ove Knausgård ‘s “My Struggle” is light bedtime reading. Colin's mother is shocked when Ray makes him buy the groceries and cook his own birthday dinner. “You couldn't upset me if you tried,” Ray, ever the implacable and gorgeous dominator, tells Colin at one point. What makes “Pillion” so thrustingly good is how much the movie teases and tantalizes us, getting off on withholding, until finally unleashing in all its graphicness once Colin is face down, plunging his mouth on Ray's quite large, pierced cock, plunging ever deeper into Ray's expansive kinky social world. Scissor Sisters lead Jake Shears makes his acting entrance as one of the submissives orbiting Ray — and he ends up one of the stars of a very hot group sex scene splayed out over a picnic table, in which Ray fucks Colin face to face, eyes locked on eyes, for the first time.

It warms the cockles of my heart still to think about Colin, having shaved his head and totally turned himself over to acts of devotion and in service of his master, wearing a locked chain around his neck, with Ray wearing the key around his own. “Next to you, I'm nothing. When I'm yours, I'm the same,” Colin tells Ray, which sounds like the debased line of someone being desperately exploited by a partner. But Colin says it with the cadence of love, which his mother in her dying days simply cannot understand. Colin willingly puts himself in an abject position because what's happening between him and Ray is love, for him at least, even if that version of love doesn't comfortably conform to our understanding of what love is supposed to be, a system of back-and-forth flow in mutual directions. Colin craves Ray's command, and Ray would be lying if he said he wasn't feeling feelings about his boytoy, too.

 










Which is when “Pillion” takes an unexpected direction, Colin finally assuming more control over the relationship and becoming the emotional power bottom he was destined to be in their dynamic. What makes “Pillion” work so well is that the film finally does give way to a big emotional release after so much cockteasing and edging of the audience and of Colin. Cinematographer Nick Morris has an eye for both sweaty intimacy in its hottest moments and the pooling reserves of desire and reined-in emotion that require a certain detachment. Until we are snapped back into what is ultimately a deeply moving love story, one where we become the submissives to Lighton's strange, beautiful, and sexy vision. It also never hurts to be anchored by two actors who are totally game and committed to that vision, and willing to go there, chains, gags, assless chaps and all.

“Pillion” premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. A24 will release the film at a later date.

Kristen Stewart has been “wanting to make movies since I was nine or 10 years old,” she told me on her fourth trip to Cannes in 2017, for the short “Come Swim.” She's been a fixture at the festival ever since her maiden voyage in 2012 with Walter Salles' “On the Road,” followed by Woody Allen's “Cafe Society,” Olivier Assayas' “Clouds of Sils Maria” and “Personal Shopper,” and David Cronenberg's “Crimes of the Future.” She also served on Cate Blanchett's Competition jury in 2018.

Stewart's audacious debut, the Un Certain Regard entry “The Chronology of Water,” was well-received. After eight years of development, Scott Free financed the mood poem about swimming and writing for survival amid personal trauma. Stewart is ebullient after having talked about making her first feature for so long. Back in 2022, she announced that she was adapting (with Andy Mingo) Lidia Yuknavitch's frank 2011 memoir. Stewart resonated with her hardscrabble story about a woman (Imogen Poots) coping with her teenage sexual abuse by her father via sex, anger, competitive swimming, addiction, and creative writing.

Stewart and I talked on a balcony at the Majestic Hotel. The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. 

Anne Thompson: What made you so clear that you should turn this material into your first feature? You went for it. 

Kristen Stewart: It's not a movie about the things that actually happened to Lidia. It's about the things that happened to all of us, and then how to take those things into your body. [They] might not be equivalent or exactly like the experience and abuse specifically that she had. Her plight might not be everyone's, but it's similar. There's thievery and violence in the fucking female experience right now, with the imagery that's thrust at us and the conversations that are had outside of our bodies and what they do to our inner voices, when we go: “I don't think you should do that. Don't say it, keep it a secret. Don't tell anyone you're in pain. Don't tell anyone that that wasn't OK with you. Keep it to yourself. Oh, don't vouch for yourself. Don't fight for that. Oh, don't speak too loud; they won't hear you.” Measure, measure, measure. Shame, shame, shame. And so it was not possible to pull back, because the whole movie is about getting that feeling out. I've never felt like a provocateur. I never was trying to push buttons.

 










It doesn't feel like that. It feels like you're expressing yourself in every fiber of your being. 

It is the truth. There was never a point where I ever questioned it, because there was no way that I was alone in this. The book is such a lifeboat. It's like a flotation device. It's such a good place to start. It's very meta to make a movie about how hard it is to say something that's exactly what I was experiencing. 

Over your career, you've taken control of your choices. You've often taken the indie route. 

Absolutely. This was not without help. I needed to have a couple of public temper tantrums in order to get the right people to listen. I have this stunning collaborator in Charles Gillibert, who [produced] “On the Road,” “Personal Shopper,” and “Clouds of Sils Maria.” He understands that [women] need help and we need a fucking leg up. It took a long time to get this made. Yeah. It took forever.

What hurdles did you face? 

The book is not about the things that happened to her, but about how she processes those things, and about how art can save you. And there was no way to sell the movie as an idea. It was impossible to say to people that I wanted to make a DMT trip experience, a life flashing before your eyes, in the way that your memory feels neurological and physical to you. It's different from the book. It's a faithful adaptation, but it is not the same experience. There was no way for me to tell people that I needed to go make so many puzzle pieces that I could come home and find authentic, emotional connective tissue, because you cannot plan for things like this. You can't plan for the ephemeral. You have to go catch it. You have to go create an environment in which things can sprawl and people can explore and learn things. And so therefore, the movie had to have a life in order for it to have its own memory. It couldn't be exacting, controlled. My hands and my fingerprints are all over it, but I'm not strangling the movie, because the movie had such volition, it had such its own life, that it was telling me what it wanted every day.

 










Was the movie finished when you brought it to Cannes? Would you go back to the editing room? 

The picture is pretty final, it's color-corrected. I'm not going to cut it, OK? It deserves space. It's not like the normal success story that has a three-act structure in the terms that we're used to. Audience are trained, everybody is, because you could not be, to have a certain capacity and a certain expectation for a rhythm and a time code: “I'm supposed to get this now. I want it. Where is it?” Quite often in the movie, there's so many false wins and starts and hard crashes. And there's an undulation that resembles a female orgasm that steps away from this 1-2-3, punch of the climax and a sigh of relief in the last five minutes, and the movie's over. You think you're there, you think you're there, you're not sure. Then you kill it, then you pull back, and then you're: “Why am I still here?” And it's frustrating at times, probably. Three-quarters of the way through, you might think to yourself, “Where are we going?” It is intentional.

Imogen Poots anchors it. 

She's the reason why you can get away with all the rest of it, because you never want to stop hanging out with her. Unless we had somebody who really kept you on a line, we were dead in the water.

How did you know she was the right one?
 










She's a walking motif. Look at her eyes. Visually, I was taken aback when her face filled my Zoom screen in which we did a pseudo audition, aah, I started getting this feeling: “Oh, my God, the movie might exist.” Because without Lidia — her body is our movie.

You do not shy away from all the orifices and aspects of a woman's body, and you show a lot of blood.

The second shot of the film is intentional. Fifty percent of the population is not going to wonder where that blood came from. It didn't come from a wound. It's textured and chunky, and it's being sucked down a drain. She also comes into her hand so hard that it's dripping from her fingers, and she smells it before getting her mind blown by the sheer capability of her own body. And then the hymen breaking, all of the times that she was aching and itching and bleeding. How often have you ached or itched or bled in public and just been: “No, you never, that's an alone experience, no matter what.” It's isolating. I hate walking around not telling people what's going on with me.

It happens to everyone. Women will respond to this. It's all about the physical.

Yes — the movie takes place on the surface of this woman's skin. We would arrange rocks on the sand in the same configuration as my favorite pattern of moles on her stomach, just to make sure that we related her to organic material, to imply that she grew here. She did not choose the things that happened to her. We are gouged out. Our desires are given to us. We experience things that we don't choose, and then they define us for the rest of our lives. [It's] a book about revering words, and the life-saving significance and importance of words. I also wanted to stay outside of any word, inside the unnamed wet, because we don't have to take credit for all the shit that comes out of us, but we can turn it into something that is pleasure and pain at once and have that be something that you can decide whether or not it hurts or it feels good.

 










It must have felt good for you. You're a director now.

Oh man, it felt so good. I'm dying.

You're going to do it again.

I can't wait.

Have you got things in the hopper? Now they'll give it to you easily. 

Yeah, several. It's going to be a lot easier this time. I've always said that as long as I can make another movie after my first one, that I don't need to be precious or clever about it at all. It just needs to feel pure. I've earned the right to try one more time. I never want to make the same movie twice. So whatever comes out next is going to not be anything like this. I can't fucking wait.

Jim Belushi is brilliant as Lidia's writing mentor, Ken Kesey. 

He brought pages to our pages. He's a movie star: He did so much research. He was the person that we needed to come pat us on the back and remind us that it's okay to want approval from a male figurehead, it's not weird, and it's not anti-feminist. You're not a bad feminist if you want someone like Jim Belushi to pat you on the back and tell you that you're a good girl.Why did you shoot in 16 millimeter?

Because I didn't want to record this. I wanted to take pictures so I could slice them up, and I wanted it to feel like a dream, and I needed it to flash before your eyes. And there's just too much information in a digital image. You can't put yourself into it, and it also doesn't speak to time in the way that the movie needs to. The movie needs to fracture. You can't fracture a recorded image. There's no break. You get all the information. [The movie] is a completely and utterly inundating experience. But for us, we only have 24 pictures every second, and sometimes less because we've pulled them out. And so we really fuck with the experience of literal time, and we put it back into the body, and we can span four decades fluidly, because we shot on film. And also, it does something to people on set. You realize your camera has a heartbeat, you can hear it when the camera starts running — whir — everyone stands at attention. It infuses an immediacy and a sort of honor.

“The Chronology of Water” premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Jennifer Lawrence gives one of her most all-consuming and risky performances as a writer crashing down badly from postpartum in the countryside in Lynne Ramsay's “Die My Love.” The Cannes Competition premiere is an adaptation of Ariana Harwicz's 2017 novel, which Lawrence and her Excellent Cadaver production team sent to Ramsay a couple of years ago, hoping the “We Need to Talk About Kevin” filmmaker would want to direct it. The dark, intensely subjective drama is Ramsay's first film since 2017 Cannes screenplay winner “You Were Never Really Here,” and it's looking for a distributor.

 










“There's not really anything like postpartum. It's extremely isolating,” Lawrence said at Sunday's Cannes press conference when asked about her character, Grace. “Lynne moves this couple into Montana. She doesn't have a community. She doesn't have her people, but the truth is, extreme anxiety and extreme depression [are] isolating no matter where you are. You feel like an alien. So it deeply moved me. I wanted to work with Lynne Ramsay since I saw ‘Ratcatcher,' and I was just like, there's no way. But we took a chance and we sent it to her, and I really cannot believe that I'm here.”

Lawrence, who'd just had her firstborn when she read the book, added, “As a mother, it was really hard to separate what I would do as opposed to what [the character] would do, and it was just heartbreaking when I first read the book.” 

Lawrence had her second child earlier this year. In “Die My Love,” her protagonist is engulfed by depression and madness after giving birth to a child with her boyfriend, Jackson (Robert Pattinson), who doesn't know how to help her. Sissy Spacek, LaKeith Stanfield, and Nick Nolte co-star.

“I'm not really an actor who brings my work home,” Lawrence said when asked if it was hard to wash off the role after shooting in rural Calgary last year. “Part of what she's going through is the hormonal imbalance that comes from postpartum. She's also having an identity crisis. Who am I as a mother? Who am I as a wife? Who am I as a sexual person to my husband? Who am I as a creative? She's plagued with this feeling that she's disappearing. For me, I was four and a half, five months pregnant when we shot. I had great hormones! I was feeling great, which is the only way I would be able to dip into this emotion…also in terms of answering any question about my acting or performance at all, I had Lynne Ramsay as my director, so that kind of is it.”

 










She added, “Having children changes everything, it changes your whole life, it's brutal and incredible… They've changed my life obviously for the best, and they've changed me creatively.” She laughed, “I highly recommend having kids if you want to be an actor.”

Lawrence and Pattinson were inevitably asked about the hardest day on set for a movie that demands a lot of its actors, and in emotional distress as Lawrence's character Grace is at one moment a doting mother, the next a psychosexually crazed housewife, the next throwing herself through a glass door just to feel something.

“I didn't find anything particularly hard. I really just kind of, there's someone I've always wanted to work with. You create an atmosphere on set; I wouldn't describe it as hard or easy,” Pattinson said to Ramsay. “It is just quite an unusual environment… Some of the stuff we're doing… there's one scene where there were three or four pages of dialogue, and we turn up and Lynne says, ‘I think I'm just going to do it with no dialogue.' It's kind of scary, but it's very, very exciting. It makes you feel very alive.”

Lawrence said that showing up to the first day on set, Ramsay gave very specific direction for an early scene in the movie in which Grace and Jackson are writhing around on the floor and on top of each other in a naked sexual frenzy.

 










“The day before our first day, Lynne showed Rob and I a scene from ‘If,'” Lawrence said, referring to Lindsay Anderson's 1968 British classic starring Malcolm McDowell as a prep school student heading up a revolt against his peers. “It was these actors, and they're attacking each other like tigers, and we were like, ‘OK, yeah,' and she was like, ‘Can you do it naked, yeah?' [imitating Ramsay's Scottish accent]. We were like, ‘Oh, OK,' and that was the first day on set, so that's my answer.”

Instead of a family Bible, Anna McGarrigle once reckoned, the McGarrigle children had their father Frank's old arch-top Gibson guitar. It was one of the few possessions he brought into his marriage to Gaby Latrémouille in 1935. The French Canadian Irish couple inscribed the body of the instrument with the names of their friends as well as landmark milestones. Their daughters evolved the tradition. Their eldest, Janie, added the names of her friends, but also, as a child of the fledgling rock'n'roll era, “ELVIS.” The second, Anna, added her own icon, although misspelled: “DOUANE” as in Eddy, but also as in import “customs” in French, her first written language.

It was on this instrument that trailblazer Jane, cautious Anna, and the youngest, willful Kate, learned their first chords from Frank, Anna writes in Mountain City Girls, a memoir co-authored with Jane after Kate's death in 2010. Born in 1899, their father expected them to be able to play for company on the family's 11 beat-up instruments, among them an accordion left as penance by a local drunk whom Frank brought home one night, to Gaby's displeasure. He would bribe them a nickel to learn a song by the Gershwins, or the Romantic parlor songwriter Stephen Foster, or Hoagy Carmichael. Gaby kept sheet music for popular ballads and showtunes. The French Catholic nuns at convent school in Saint-Saveur-des-Monts, in the Laurentians north of Montreal, taught them solfège and chorales, and Jane drilled them all in harmony. The girls discovered the Everly Brothers and Joan Baez and, later, blues pioneer Ma Rainey and Bahamian guitarist Joseph Spence. Baez, in particular, became their role model, showing Kate and Anna—a natural double act born just 14 months apart—that a girl's place in music wasn't limited to buying the boy rockers Cokes after watching them play. She also imbued them with particular standards for their first instruments. Gifted brand new guitars on Christmas 1961, the teenagers turned up their noses and exchanged them for the cheap nylon-stringed versions that Baez favored.

From there came their first vocal trio, with a girl who'd heard Kate singing at their new school after the family moved to Montreal. Soon after, Kate and Anna became part of the Mountain City Four, a folk outfit that sometimes had up to 10 members. While their stage presence was sloppy, the other members were dead serious about developing their interpretations, playing songs learned from the Library of Congress and Folkways, or those of Bob Dylan. When he went electric, so did they. (Anna was at Newport in 1965, and loved it.) If such great songs already existed, these purists reasoned, there was no need to write more, even—or perhaps especially—if Dylan was turning out new standards at a clip. But when Kate moved to New York City in 1969, as part of a duo with guitarist Roma Baran, she hit the Gaslight and Gurdy's Folk City and various hootenannies, and discovered singer-songwriters showing off original material. She phoned Anna: We could do this too!

That eager call ensured that Kate and Anna McGarrigle's names would be inscribed in legend. Anna, at home in Saint-Sauveur with Gaby, sat straight down at the family piano—usually so in demand it was hard for her to get a look in—and wrote her very first song, “A Heart Is Like a Wheel,” about a recent heartbreak. Five years later, the desolate number would become a hit for Linda Ronstadt, and the title track of her album of the same name. But perhaps more significantly, wrote Anna: “Being able to voice my sorrow at that time saved my life.” Though they embraced it casually, the two sisters found a lifeline in songwriting at just the right time. At the Gaslight, Kate hadn't just discovered songwriting but Loudon Wainwright III, forging the start of a tumultuous, painful relationship that inspired many of her early songs. “He's the only person I've gone up to and said, ‘I really like your music,'” she told Melody Maker in 1976, after their marriage had ended for the last time. “Needless to say, I won't do it again.”

You could also say that songwriting found a lifeline (not to mention a bloodline) in these two sisters. Their 1976 debut, Kate & Anna McGarrigle, revealed them to be masters of unaffected, direct, desirous lyricism, alive with action and motion. (Melody Maker's writer wondered if they were “perhaps the Lennon and McCartney of a burgeoning generation of women songwriters.”) The album's rapturous reception, particularly in the British music press, often characterized it as a record of domesticity. Its rich, weathered but vigorous blend of French and Irish folk, blues, and balladry certainly reflected their music-steeped childhoods, and Joe Boyd and Greg Prestopino's production made the record glow with all the invitation and protection of a warm hearth. The sisters' naturally classic way with melody made it seem like families had sung these songs around the piano for centuries already. Their harmonies were so innate that Boyd initially thought that Kate had just multitracked her own vocals on some early demos, and the pair took a nonchalant approach to success, always putting family first. The album's sleeve thanks the recording studio superintendent for looking after Kate and Loudon's “little Rufus” (as in, Rufus Wainwright, future dynastic star) during the sessions in 1974 and '75. Her subsequent pregnancy with Martha (ditto) led them to cancel a tour promoting the album. “I don't remember us giving much thought to ‘the record,'” Anna wrote, bemused by the idea.

But something about the focus on “domesticity” suggests a shelteredness and dutiful femininity that couldn't be further from the reality of this expansive album, one that travels far to work out what it means to be home. Kate, said Anna, was “the great escape artist,” someone who saw herself as “one of those people who had to move on, to get out,” who left for NYC to become “the character she wanted to be.” Her early attempts at making it as a solo artist went nowhere—a showcase didn't work out; Clive Davis passed on her; a dog once invaded her stage during a pitifully attended set—but she managed to get her demo tape in front of Prestopino, who passed it to Boyd and Warner exec Lenny Waronker in Los Angeles. They asked her to play one of the songs from her demo tape on the piano, and couldn't understand why she didn't know the chords. Because it was by Anna, she said. Struck by the novelty of two songwriting sisters of apparently comparable talent, they asked them both to come out and record. Kate was bored singing alone and figured it “beats working in an office.” She convinced Anna to quit her job and come to LA. Anna brought her red accordion, and they lived on and off at the Chateau Marmont for nine months, the latest stop on their roaming.

The beauty of the songwriting on Kate & Anna McGarrigle is in how they capture the speed at which love can transform or undo a place, make you feel you belong or spit you out just as fast. The album opens with Kate's “Kiss and Say Goodbye,” a rollicking tangle of guitar and sax that groove and joust as the youngest McGarrigle obsesses over a prospective lover coming to town. The tune bounces as if she were skipping down the sidewalk, a carnival of one high on hope. She doesn't know when her man will arrive, but that doesn't stop her setting the terms. He's coming her way, not the other way around. He's only to call her if he's alone. She knows his type. “I know you like to think you've got taste,” she teases, “so I'm gonna let you choose the time and place.” It's only desire that she can't bend to her whim. “And I don't know where it's coming from/But I want to kiss you 'till my mouth gets numb!” Who needs to see “some foreign film from gay Paris” when Kate McGarrigle can turn a flirty reverie into a full-blown movie? (Yet the Village Voice called the sisters “genteel,” NME called them “spinsters” and Rolling Stone commented on their “puritanical sensibility” and lack of “sexual overtones”: Even glowing reviews could only stand to see these free-thinking women, who freely discussed which other members of their band they had slept with, in half shadow.)

If “Kiss and Say Goodbye” overspills with potential, the next song, Anna's “My Town,” has been gutted of it. It's a quivering waltz of piano and mandolin with shades of “Moon River,” stoic and swooping as Anna reckons with heartbreak stealing her home away. “It's my town but I had to leave it,” she sings with painfully bright acceptance, though she doesn't spare the cad that loved her under false pretenses. One night, she walks past his house. “The lights were on to ward off thieves/While you stayed out all night/But it was you who stole my heart/When you hadn't any right,” she sings, and a harmonica turns her tapering line into an old-timey lament. Kate's harmonies cushion her words, but nothing can soften their brutal economy.

It's funny that “Heart Like a Wheel” is the best-known track from this album. Anna mixes her metaphors—love is also “like a sinking ship”—and later called it “an awkward little song,” although its pearlescent tragedy, featuring organ by Janie, is anything but. The sisters' real lyrical stock-in-trade is fierce straightforwardness without sentimentality: a marvel, considering the difficult background to Kate's songs. 1971 proved a dismal year. She was married to Loudon, who was unfaithful. (He claimed that neither of them were “domestic.”) She cried while recording “Go Leave,” just like Anna and their friends back in Montreal had cried listening to her demo. Even the finished recording is the starkest ballad, one of curtains-drawn insularity: just her nylon-stringed guitar, heavily thumbed, offering a slight foundation for a vocal performance of the purest poise, as defeat—“she's better than me”—begets defiance. She holds the elegant vibrato that prolongs the end of some lines like a meditation, a precise focal point to keep darker feelings from intruding. But for all her resolve, she can't avoid one nagging question: “But could it be that you are stalling?/Hearts have a way of calling when they've been true.” There are few songs more incisive on the hope you're willing to invest in somebody who has already squandered a great deal of it.

Kate's year would worsen. Loudon did stall, and soon they were living in London and expecting a child. She miscarried around six months, a boy named Jack. “The infant boy had made a little squawk then been whisked away,” Jane wrote. Loudon left Kate again, leaving an expensive blue Volvo and a banjo as penance. In “Tell My Sister,” home shifts once again, from “England in the pouring rain” back to Montreal. She can't bring herself to tell Gaby she's coming back, so instructs Anna to do it, pulling baby-sister rank. The lilting woodwinds sidle around her furtive verses, as if a little shame-faced. It takes halfway through the song for the instruments to spill over into easy ceremony, giving in to welcome without question and finding at least one definition of home. A few bawdy brass refrains hint at her desire to break free again: “But until then, tie me to the ground,” she sings, knowing she can't be trusted to act in her best interests. “I've got to let these weary bones rest/From all that runnin' around.”

She would run again. Kate met a fisherman and fiddler named George “Smoke” Dawson. He taught her how to play in a droning style, and they got together for a time and drove out west. And yet “Talk to Me of Mendocino,” his California home, is almost as devastating as “Go Leave.” There is something of “Both Sides Now” to its grievous serenity, as it becomes an elegy for the dream of stability: “Let the sun rise over the redwoods/I'll rise with it 'till I rise no more”—a vision that you can tell feels impossible as she sings it. Kate's lower voice is crushed. Anna's hymnal brightness lends her dignity. A distant accordion doubling their melody takes over to carry their lament. Loudon came back.

Maybe Kate & Anna McGarrigle has taken on its domestic reputation because—like Carole King's Tapestry, a record it fairly equals—it feels like a place where anyone can go to recover from their troubles. The instrumentation swells with care, warmth, wisdom—the great weft of influence, experience, history that makes up a life, that reassures you that you're never the first to feel this way. (As teenagers exploring the new folk pop scene, Kate and Anna were more interested in searching out the source material that inspired these new stars: For the sisters, with their familial legacy, these traditions seemed eminently present.) For all the romantic desolation in its lyrics, Kate & Anna McGarrigle is ecstatic about its influences. It travels even further than its protagonists do, from the clarinet-led New Orleans blues of “Blues in D,” in which Kate gives in once again to a returning Loudon, to the Cajun fiddle and accordion fleck of “Complainte Pour Ste Catherine,” Anna's in-jokey portrait of the morés of Montreal's main street. “La gloire, c'est pas mal inutile,” they sing: Fame is pretty useless. Their rambunctious French singing and downhome pride almost evokes the Raincoats' glorious raggedness; the song even climaxes in a brassy, funky precursor to punky reggae.

The closing song is an interpretation of the Bahamian spiritual “Travelling on for Jesus,” which might feel a bit out of place: The sisters' songs never look to God for succor, and the adult Kate once suggested a school nun who reached out to make amends should “go fuck herself.” But its message of forgiveness and knowing one's own mind as the keys to carrying on rings true, and its inclusion feels characteristically wry. (It's a more openhearted version of the message than their cover of Loudon's “Swimming Song,” an appealingly brisk fiddle and banjo number about staying afloat in life out of sheer spite, and cannon balling to splash the haters while you're at it.) Kate & Anna McGarrigle carries a strong sense of what matters: family; home; love, no matter how many take its name in vain. “Foolish You,” a song by local musician Wade Hemsworth that they covered in the Mountain City Four, rebukes a lover for going away, “seeking fortune's favor on your own.” What makes it worth leaving? Why do something alone when you could do it together and be “interlocking pieces,” as Anna puts it, in her lovely “Jigsaw Puzzle of Life”? (You could write a whole essay on how they make an art form of the word “fool,” about themselves and others, buoyant with understated disappointment. Loudon wrote “Red Guitar” about him smashing and burning his Gibson in the Saratoga Springs flat he shared with Kate in 1970: “It burned until all that was left was six pegs and six strings/Kate, she said, ‘You are a fool, you've done a foolish thing.'”)

The integrity of Kate and Anna's debut bore out in their refusal to capitalize on critical acclaim, or to trade on their values. The Village Voice's Geoffrey Stokes, commenting in a “Fifth Estate” news report, got it dead wrong, saying that their “familial, sloppy, warmhearted, gummy” act “may not make it in a time when one is used to dry ice and proper rhythms.” It was voted Melody Maker's album of the year, The New York Times' No. 2 behind Songs in the Key of Life; it reached No. 5 in the Pazz and Jop critics' poll, and Boyd later called it one of the best albums he had ever worked on. Even the “skin magazines” wanted in: The sisters turned down Playboy and Gallery, although Anna was tickled by the idea they might make the latter's centerfold, “bound in 16-track tape!” Kate even surmised that Loudon's final exit, in 1976—for Suzzy Roche of the Roches; you might say he had a type, at least musically—was born of jealousy for their success. “He was at a point in his career when he was frustrated, while my sister and I had made a record that was being touted as the best thing since sliced bread,” she told The Sunday Times in 2004. (Rufus has said his first memory is his mother packing the car to return to Montreal after their final parting.)

Not that they seemed affected by the praise. A single date in London won raves for their endearingly shambolic performance. Still, they canceled a U.S. tour not just owing to Kate's pregnancy with Martha, but because of their anxiety over having to put together a professional touring band (the label's suggestion that they wear long skirts and frilly shirts was laughed off). “If people from the record company, or the agency, or whatever, try to get us to be tighter, I don't think they're gonna get it,” said Kate. “That doesn't mean we don't give our best, but what people seem to like about us is our kind of simplicity, and that's not artificial—it exists.”

As girls, Kate and Anna had been captivated by George du Maurier's Trilby books, about a young model taught to sing by Svengali, the manipulative and exploitative mind controller whose name became a music-industry boogeyman. The idea of contorting oneself for success couldn't have been further from how Frank and Gaby raised their daughters to joyfully embody their experiences through song. (Frank died before their debut was released, and the album was dedicated to “the coach on the piano bench who would have been happy to see his girls get so far.”) The McGarrigle sisters made music for living, rather than living for music. Their unwavering stance would produce several decades' worth of rare, beautiful albums documenting their idiosyncratic family life. The steadfast, singular heartsong of Kate and Anna McGarrigle was the first chapter in its gospel.

	No, Qatar‘s royal family gifting a $400 million Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet known as a “flying palace” to the government that will reportedly then go to Donald Trump‘s presidential library is not the same as France giving the Statue of Liberty to the American people. But that is what Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to claim on Sunday.


	“Even if Qatar isn't asking for anything in return now for the jet, I mean, that's a bill that could come due,” Jake Tapper, host of CNN's State of the Union said to Bessent. “Nobody… just gives a $400 million jet just to be nice.”


	“Well, I don't know, Jake,” Bessent said. “The French gave us the Statue of Liberty. The British gave us the Resolute Desk. I'm not sure they asked for anything in advance.”


	“The more important airplane deal was, there's $100 billion of orders from Qatari airlines to Boeing. … So I think that that plane deal is much more important than this other one,” Bessent added. 


	“Well, I will just say about the Statue of Liberty, I mean, that was authorized by Congress and it belongs to the American people,” Tapper said. It doesn't belong to whoever was president at the time.”

	Bessent's argument echoes conservative influencers like Ann Coulter, whose X post making the comparison was fact checked in a community note that pointed out that, unlike the plane, Congress authorized the acceptance of the Statue of Liberty. 


	Further, the people of France gave the statue to the American people, and it became a public monument that the public can access. The plane from Qatar, however, will be transferred from the U.S. Air Force to Trump's presidential library, Trump has said. What that means exactly, remains to be seen. Will Trump continue to use the plane post-presidency? Will the public have access to it at the library? These details are not yet clear, although Trump has claimed he will not use it once he leaves office.


	What is clear is that Trump himself has apparently made a promise to “protect” Qatar, a government that has helped to fund Hamas and has a history of buying political influence with its vast wealth.

	“We have never had a relationship with Qatar as strong as it is now,” Trump said on his recent Middle East trip. “We are going to protect you.”

	











	“We are going to protect this country,” he added. “It's a very special place, with a special royal family. … They are great people and they are going to be protected by the United States of America.”


	Constitutional experts have concerns about the gift potentially violating the emoluments clause, which states that federal officeholders cannot “accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State” without congressional approval.


	“The gift of this particular plane, the principal enjoyment of which both during the next three and a half years… and then for the rest of his life would accrue only to Donald Trump,” University of Missouri law professor Frank Bowman told PolitiFact. “That's an emolument, any way you slice it, because the benefit goes to one person.”


	Bowman added that because ownership of the plane will reportedly transfer from the Air Force to Trump's library, it “blows the notion that this is a gift to the country completely out of the water.”


	“Acceptance of the Qatari aircraft would require the consent of Congress under the express terms of the Constitution,” Stanley Brand, Penn State-Dickinson Law School distinguished fellow in law and government, told PolitiFact.

	National security experts also have raised potential issues with accepting the plane.


	“I'm not accusing the Qatari government of anything. But on the other hand, you can't rule out the presence of bad actors in this whole process, inserting listening devices,” aviation analyst and managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory Richard Aboulafia told NPR.


	The jet is not the only gift going to Trump's presidential library. Excess donations from Trump's inaugural committee will also be transferred to the library, according to a Wall Street Journal source. Funds from Trump's $22 million settlement with Meta (which owns Facebook) and $15 million settlement with Disney (which owns ABC News) will also go to Trump's presidential library foundation. There is no indication how those funds will be used.


	Trump attacked ABC News in a Truth Social post on Saturday night. ABC first reported the news of the plane from Qatar. 


	“Why doesn't Chairman Bob Iger do something about ABC Fake News, especially since I just won $16,000,000 based on the Fake and Defamatory reporting of Liddle' George Slopadopolus,” Trump wrote.

	“Everyone, including their lawyers, has been told that ABC must not say that Qatar is giving ME a FREE Boeing 747 Airplane, because they are not,” Trump continued. “Instead, and as Fake News ABC fully knows and understands, this highly respected country is donating the plane to the United States Air Force/ Defense Department, AND NOT TO ME. By so doing, they are saving our country, and the American Taxpayer, hundreds of millions of dollars. ABC Fake News is one of the WORST.”

Saturday Night Live‘s Donald Trump, appearing in the show's cold open yet another time, walked out of the season 50 finale's first sketch to flirt with women in the audience and to formally sign off until September–“if we still have a country.”


	Trump (James Austin Johnson) began by proclaiming how much he enjoyed his three-country tour through the Middle East. 


	“It was very much a boys trip,” he said alongside Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (Emil Wakim). “I don't think I saw a single woman. What's up with that, huh? All the time just walking into a roomful of boys. ‘Hi, boys.' ‘Boys again!' The women are all hiding. It's like a nation of Melanias.”


	When the heir to the Saudi throne invited Trump to build a palace next to his and stay, Trump declined.


	“Sadly, I can't. I have to get back home,” he said. “Luckily, we have our own little slice of Saudi Arabia in America: a dry desert area filled with people who are way too into their religion. We call ours Utah, and I do very well there. So I can't stay here in the Middle East. In fact, you know what? I can't even stay in this sketch much longer.” 

	











	“Because it's the SNL finale. Season 50–worst one yet!” he joked, walking off the stage towards the audience.


	Trump then instructed a man in the front row to get up and “go eat Sun Chips in the hallway” so he could take his seat.


	“I'm here to break the fourth wall,” he announced, before turning to the women seated around him. 


	“Oh, it's nice here with all the young, pretty people,” he went on. “Look at her, wow. Sevens or more. Sevens or more, sit on the floor, six and below, to the bleachers you go!”“That's like a Gutfeld joke–kind of rhymed,” he added, referring to Fox News host Greg Gutfeld. 


SNL‘s Trump concluded by noting that while he will be gone for the summer, the real president is unfortunately inescapable.

	“Since it's the finale, that means after tonight you won't be seeing here here for a while,” he said. “Well, not the fake, fun version of me that makes you smile. The real one will still be on. You can't escape me, right? I'm everywhere. Even in your dreams, like the late, great Freddy Krueger.”


	“So, see you again in the fall–if we still have a country, right?” he said. “It's a coin toss.”

Saturday Night Live‘s Weekend Update had their traditional joke swap in the season 50 season finale, with co-anchor Michael Che making amends with SNL host Scarlett Johansson for delivering a certain line about her during last December's joke swap.


	“I want to take this opportunity to apologize to someone I hurt. Scarlett, can you come out here?” Che said midway through the joke swap, meaning his words were Colin Jost‘s.


	After explaining the context– “I made Colin do some tasteless jokes comparing your vagina to Costco roast beef”–Che said he was just “lashing out.” 


	“Because I'm jealous,” he said. “I've never even seen a human vagina. And notice I said human, because I once spent the summer on a farm. You feel me? Maybe I'm just embarrassed about my own body. I can't even take my hoodie off during sex because I have more nipples than a pregnant dog.” 


	Johansson, Jost's wife, reacted: “Yes, I have heard that about you.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Che then said he was sorry to Jost as well.

	











	“I owe you everything,” he said. “When Colin discovered me, I was selling crack outside the Bronx Zoo. Now look at me: selling crack outside the American Girl store. I've told thousands of jokes on Update and gotten dozens of laughs, but I've never said the three most important words of all: ‘I love you.'”


	The joke swap–once again–had plenty of race-oriented lines designed to embarrass Jost.

	“CBS has premiered the first hour-long daytime soap opera with a predominantly Black cast. It will air when Black people are home from work: 24 hours a day,” Jost joked.


	“A new study finds that the hoots and grunts of bonobos show signs of complex thoughts similar to human language,” he said moments later. “Oh, so like that awful halftime show?”

	The first week of Sean “Diddy” Combs' criminal sex-trafficking and racketeering conspiracy trial began with Casandra “Cassie” Ventura giving graphic and explicit testimony about the “humiliating” freak-offs she claimed she was made to endure over her decade-long relationship with Combs.


	The sexual encounters are at the center of the criminal charges against Combs. Ventura spent more than 20 hours recounting to Southern District of New York prosecutors and Combs' attorneys embarrassing and graphic details about freak-offs that allegedly began early on in the R&B singer's romance with her older Bad Boy Records label boss. 


	“He brought the concept to me when I was 22, and I would do absolutely anything for him, and I did,” Ventura told the courtroom. “And it never stopped our whole relationship. And it was expected of me, and it made me feel horrible about myself.” 


	But the defense painted Ventura as a willing participant in the couple's unorthodox sex life, displaying several messages where Ventura told Combs that she was open to the days-long sexual encounters. “I don't want to freak off for a last time,” Ventura wrote in a message to Combs in September 2012. “I want it to be [the] first time for the rest of our lives.” 

	











	Throughout the first week, the one-time billionaire was actively involved in his case's legal strategy, feverishly jotting down notes on a legal pad, passing over sticky notes to his attorneys, and shaking his head at the narrative prosecutors put forth. 


	While he maintained a neutral expression throughout much of Ventura's testimony, he scowled at male escort Daniel Phillip, who told jurors he was concerned for Ventura's well-being after he saw Combs hurl a liquor bottle in her direction. Phillip testified he saw Combs drag Ventura back into a bedroom by her hair during a freak-off because she asked Combs to wait a minute when he beckoned her. Midway through Phillip's sexually explicit testimony, Combs' three teenage daughters briefly left the courtroom before re-entering to grab their items and leave for the rest of the day.

	Combs is facing 15 years to life in prison if convicted of the five federal charges against him. He has pleaded not guilty and had been working to secure his release as soon as possible — rejecting a plea deal and moving for a speedy trial. (Earlier this week, Rolling Stone confirmed that several Combs allies have already laid the groundwork with President Trump officials for a possible pardon if Combs is convicted.)

	











	The high-profile trial, which is expected to last seven more weeks, brought out a crowd of more than 100 people, as members of the press, lawyers, Combs supporters wearing “Free Diddy” T-shirts, content creators, and podcasters, including Rotten Mango's Stephanie Soo and Fresh and Fit's Myron Gaines, camped out overnight outside of the Manhattan federal courthouse in hopes of getting inside the courtroom.


	Here are the key moments from the trial's first week: 


	The government's star witness strode confidently into the courtroom on Tuesday morning, facing the man she claimed essentially turned her into a “sex worker.” 


	The so-called “freak-offs” are at the heart of the sex-trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution charges against Combs, as prosecutors allege that Combs forced his younger girlfriend Ventura to have sex with hired male escorts through “force, fraud, and coercion.” 


Over four days of direct testimony and grueling cross-examination, Ventura only cried twice when explaining the anguish she suffered as a result of being allegedly forced into freak-offs with dozens of strangers. “I'd give that money back if it meant I never had to have freak-offs,” Ventura said through tears about her $20 million settlement with Combs. “If I never had to have freak-offs, I would have agency and autonomy. I wouldn't have to work so hard to get it back.”

	Ventura alleged that after entering into a relationship with Combs as a “naive” and sexually inexperienced 21-year-old in 2007 — shortly after signing to Combs' record label Bad Boy Records — the music executive opened her up to a different kind of world. Gradually, Ventura alleged that her one-time promising music career took a detrimental backseat to constantly preparing and recovering from the days-long, drug-fueled freak-offs. 


	Remaining calm and poised, Ventura gave graphic details of what Combs expected during the sexual encounters. Combs “controlled” and “choreographed” everything surrounding the freak-offs, Ventura testified, even down to demanding Ventura have a fresh bikini wax, her nails painted white, and approving the lingerie she'd be wearing. 


	The pair always took Ecstasy or MDMA beforehand, Ventura alleged, and Combs would direct Ventura and the male escort to perform erotic acts leading up to intercourse. The sessions almost always began, Ventura said, by rubbing baby oil on her body until she was “glistening,” going through 10 bottles a night. 

	











	The intense sexual encounters would last until Combs determined they were over, Ventura testified, and that she paid the male escorts thousands of dollars in cash after sex, which Combs provided. 


	While Ventura said she tried to gently broach the topic of not wanting to do freak-offs, she testified that she was fearful of Combs' flashes of rage and physical beatings, which occurred inside and outside of the sexual encounters. “I worried for my safety; I worried for my career,” Ventura said, explaining why she was scared of telling Combs no. “But I also was in love with him, so I worried that he wouldn't want to be with me anymore.” 


	When Ventura began cooperating with Southern District of New York prosecutors, she handed over several electronic devices, including iPads, cell phones, and computers, that contained thousands of texts and emails between the former couple. 


	Defense attorney Anna Estevao pulled up numerous emails and text exchanges where Ventura talks in an explicit sexual nature about freak-offs and seemingly expresses an openness to continue the sexual encounters. “I'm always ready to freak off,” Ventura wrote in one message to Combs in August 2009. 


	“I don't want a freak-off for one last time; I want it to be the first time for the rest of our lives,” Ventura told Combs in 2012. 


	Estevao questioned why Ventura directly never said no to Combs when they began to arrange for a freak-off. She also suggested Ventura was an “insanely” jealous girlfriend, desperate to remain in a relationship with the high-powered Combs by any means.


	“You participated in the freak-offs because you wanted to make him happy, right,” Estevao asked Ventura. 


	“Part of the reason, yeah,” she replied.


	“You knew that this was the kind of sex that he wanted to have, right?” Estevao followed up. “And you believed that you were special in his life because you were able to give him that, right?” 


	Yet, some emails and messages seem to show Ventura gently pushing back on the idea of continuing freak-offs, expressing concern that that was the only aspect of their relationship. “The last time was a mistake, but since has made me feel a little dirty and grimy as opposed to sensual and spontaneous,” Ventura wrote Combs in December 2009. 


	“That's the only reason why I go back and forth in my mind with wanting and not wanting to do it. When we used to freak-off when we were so in love, there were no questions asked, it felt right, like it literally made sense for the next step in our sex life together. I get nervous that I'm just becoming the girlfriend that you get your fantasies off with and that's it. I don't get the other part… anymore at least.” 

	











	During her direct examination, Ventura identified at least a dozen male escorts that she said were frequently used in the “hundreds” of freak-offs she and Combs had throughout their decade-long relationship. 


	As she confirmed the identity of the men — some of whom allegedly traveled across the United States to meet up for the sexual encounters — she identified a man she knew as “Jonathan,” who was frequently used in Miami.


	During her cross-examination, Ventura said the couple stopped using the male escort, whose full name is Jonathan Oddi, after she caught him secretly recording one of the sexual encounters. “You understood that Mr. Combs spent a great deal of time [and] money to make sure that that video went away, right,” Estevao asked.


	The exchange confirmed a long-circulating allegation from Oddi, who was arrested in May 2018 for ranting against President Donald Trump and opening fire on police at Trump's National Doral golf club in Miami. During his arrest, Oddi claimed that he was Combs and Ventura's “sex slave,” giving details of freak-offs that he was involved in. But his seemingly fantastical claims were largely dismissed at the time — until Ventura's lawsuit was filed. 


	Ventura also confirmed the identity of a man named “Ash,” whom she said she hired through the escort service Cowboys 4 Angels. The photo of Ash displayed on the screen in court resembled Ash Armand (real name Akshaya Kubiak), who was part of the Showtime reality show Gigolos, which followed the men who worked for the escort company. 


	In July 2020, Kubiak was arrested for beating to death Herleen Dulai, claiming he took psychedelic mushrooms and “temporarily lost my mind.” He pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and mayhem and is currently serving an eight-to-20-year sentence in a Nevada prison.


	In an interview with Rolling Stone from prison in January 2024 — before his name was publicly connected to Ventura and Combs — Kubiak confirmed he had met the couple at a party but denied being hired for freak-offs. “I've always been super respectful towards my clients,” he said, uncomfortable discussing the topic further. “It just all becomes tricky once the privacy is violated. Nobody will feel comfortable using the nature of the business.” (Rolling Stone was unable to reach Kubiak for further comment this week.)


	Following Combs' arrest at the Park Hyatt Hotel last September, special agents conducted a sweep of his hotel room. Homeland Security Investigations special agent Yasin Binda testified that agents found numerous bottles of Johnson's baby oil and Astroglide lubricant stashed around the hotel suite.

	











	Several bottles were packed into a large Ziploc baggie inside a hallway closet, while others were found inside Combs' nightstand table. A cluster of five bottles of baby oil and lube were neatly arranged at the bottom of Combs' bathtub. 


	Special agent Binda also said that a Clonazepam prescription for “Frank Black” — a pseudonym that Ventura testified that Combs often used — was also found in Combs' room, as well as two baggies of a pink powder that tested positive for ketamine and MDMA. A black fanny pack was slung over the edge of the bed was discovered to contain $9,000 in “bulk” cash, which was seized during the hotel search. 


	Combs' lead defense attorney, Marc Agnifilo, previously told the court that Combs was coming to trial as a changed man and had previously sought out professional help by going to rehab years before addressing his substance use issues. “He has done tremendous things to try to change as a person since then,” Agnifilo told a judge shortly after Combs' arrest last September. “He's not the same person he was then.”


	“It's bullshit,” “Nathan,” a sex worker who claimed he was hired for several of Combs' freak-offs, told Rolling Stone as part of a recent investigation into Combs' behavior following his split from Ventura. “He's not reformed. He just wanted to get out of jail. He's the same person.” 


	Prosecutors did not link the bottles of baby oil, drugs, and cash to any specific allegation. However, as Rolling Stone reported, Combs had a woman staying with him at the hotel room.(On Friday, Combs' attorney Teny Geragos confirmed a woman was sharing the room with him.)  


	Combs was animated during Ventura's cross-examination, appearing somewhat frustrated with the tedious, slow pace that his attorney was taking when quizzing Ventura. 


	He took feverish notes, jumped up to look at the evidence screen, handed several sticky notes to his attorneys, and during a brief break towards the end of the day, clasped his hands in a pleading motion to Estevao, who was questioning Ventura. 


	When they resumed, Estevao focused on a long text exchange between Combs and Ventura right before the March 2016 freak-off, where Ventura appeared to be the one to propose a freak-off that day. Combs was seen nodding his head in approval as Ventura confirmed what she had texted.


	Following Ventura's cross-examination, Combs' mood drastically shifted. He was all smiles and hugged Estevao at least twice, appearing confident the cross had been successful.

	











	At the close of Friday's proceedings, former Danity Kane and Diddy-Dirty Money singer Dawn Richard entered the courtroom, avoiding eye contact with Combs. 


	When Richard mistakenly said the wrong color of Combs' sweater — white instead of cream — while pointing out Combs for the court, he teasingly put up both of his hands to identify himself.


	Richard testified she had “never seen” anything like one instance of alleged physical violence where she testified Combs physically abused Ventura in 2009 over a batch of eggs. “He came downstairs screaming, belligerent, asking where his food was, and proceeded to hit her over the head, kicked her and beat her to the ground in front of us,” Richard told jurors. (Richard said her fellow Diddy-Dirty Money bandmate Kalenna Harper was present for the alleged assault.)

	Richard is expected to continue testifying on Monday. Ventura's mother and Kerry Morgan, Ventura's former best friend of 17 years, are also expected to testify next week.


	Morgan has been mentioned several times throughout the first week of trial. Ventura alleged Morgan was present for many incidents involving Combs. Ventura testified that their friendship ended when Combs allegedly struck Morgan over the head with a wooden hanger in 2018.

	Twenty years after an infamous television moment involving Kanye West and Mike Myers, Saturday Night Live spoofed the incident on their Season 50 finale, with Myers portraying himself alongside Kenan Thompson's Ye.


	In 2005, during a televised fundraiser for Hurricane Katrina, West went off-script on live TV by declaring that then-president George W. Bush “doesn't care about Black people,” all while he stood next to a mortified Myers.


	A lot has changed with the rapper in the past two decades, as it is quickly made clear in SNL's “Mike Myers Elevator Ride” sketch. After initially going up with a couple of adoring fans (including host Scarlett Johansson), Thompson's now-Ye comes strolling onto the lift, resulting in an awkward reunion between the Austin Powers star and the rapper.


	After Myers greets West, the rapper tells him that they haven't seen each other since “that Hurricane Katrina Benefit where I said George Bush doesn't care about Black people and you just had to stand there looking stupid.”

	











	Myers then small-talks with West, asking what he's been up to. “I'm in the KKK now,” the rapper responds, later asking if Myers is a Jewish last name. “Protestant,” Myers answered.

	The sketch also poked fun at West's alleged nitrous abuse as well as the rapper's incestuous new single “Cousins,” with the rapper proclaiming that his next song is called “Squeezin' on My Grandpa's Booty.”


	After Myers abruptly exits the elevator on the wrong floor, West calls out to him, “Take care of yourself, Shrek!”

Saturday Night Live seven-time host Scarlett Johansson portrayed a newscaster bringing an edgy approach to how she presented stories of the day–much to her pun-loving colleagues' disapproval. 


	Whereas those behind the morning anchors desk at Channel 4 New York deployed tame wordplay about lighthearted stories, fill-in nightly news host Denise (Johansson) applied the same technique to reports about gruesome crimes.


	Co-host Tommy (Kenan Thompson) began with a story about astroturf being installed at a dog park, calling it a “doggone miracle.” 


	Susan (Ashley Padilla) followed that up with: “Later, we tip our cap-puccino to the coffee shop that donates all their leftover pastries to a homeless shelter.”


	Denise, noting that those sorts of puns don't happen on the nightly news, decided to take a stab at one.


	“Next up: the hospital,” she said. “Last night, a woman was assaulted on the train.”


	Tommy, not a fan of her choice of words, provided another example of what he deemed appropriate: “Life is like a box of chocolates: an Elmhurst candy store celebrates 100 years in business.”

	











	But his advice didn't take. 


	“I'll have what she's having,” Denise said. “A Queens couple dies in an apparent murder-suicide.”


	After three more in rapid succession and a brief weather break–“This week, it's going to be sunny–Denise was back at it.

Farewell to Vatican Silence - A Secret UFO Document Falls into the Hands of Pope Leo XIV, Recounting Unexplained Phenomena

The history of humanity is, almost entirely, stored in the Vatican Apostolic Archives, libraries with over 80 kilometres of shelves holding documents that are more than 800 years old… Far from conspiracy theories, these archives contain official documents of the Catholic Church and the Holy See, letters from kings and historical figures, trial records, and much more. Now, with the new Pope, Leo XIV, all the mystery surrounding these documents has resurfaced after he was presented with a chest containing a document titled “UFO”. We'll tell you everything happening in the Vatican, so you won't have any doubts!

Careful, secret does not mean “hidden”; they are called that because these documents were only for the Pope's eyes. Of course, the interpretation of “hidden” or “secret” opened the door to misunderstandings, so Pope Francis changed the name to Vatican Apostolic Archives in 2019 to avoid this kind of speculation.

Unfortunately, they are not public, nor are they a regular library, but accredited researchers can access them under strict security rules.

Although talking about extraterrestrials in the context of the Church might seem crazy, the truth is that several scholars claim that Vatican texts contain historical accounts of flying objects, mysterious lights, and beings of non-earthly appearance. This is exactly what Diana Walsh Pasulka, a religious studies scholar from the University of North Carolina, has been investigating.

This professor is one of the most active voices calling for the Vatican's “Secret Archives” to be opened to the public.

In her book American Cosmic, Pasulka details how, while researching texts on purgatory between the 14th and 19th centuries, she came across mentions of “orbs of light, flames passing through walls, luminous beings, and disk-shaped objects”.

Of course, Pasulka and other experts in the field do not believe these descriptions are merely religious metaphors but testimonies of paranormal phenomena documented by the Church over centuries while “hiding” them.

Among the most enigmatic episodes is that of Sister María de Ágreda, a 17th-century nun who claimed to have bilocated, that is, to have been in two places at the same time, interesting, uh? She insisted she had visited New Mexico without ever leaving Spain!!

This might sound even stranger to the more sceptical, but indigenous writings from that time describe a “lady in blue” who taught them Christian doctrine long before the arrival of the first missionaries.

Pasulka warns that these writings could “mysteriously” disappear, erasing descriptions of this nun's mystical journeys.

This year marks the Roman Jubilee of 2025, and thousands of pilgrims are expected to gather at St. Peter's Basilica. Even more so now that we have a new Pope, Leo XIV, who will likely steal the spotlight.

Indeed, though it may seem like an archaic institution, the Vatican has begun digitizing all its documents. However, there is no doubt that these documents will not be made public despite being digitized, and many researchers fear this “UFO” information might disappear “discreetly” hiding records of great historical and mystical value. Will we see the declassification of the UFO archives?

This is the question we've been asking for years. Will the new pontiff give in to media pressure and release these documents for the public to read? Maybe yes, maybe no…

What we do know is that publishing them could cause an earthquake within the Catholic religion. What do you think about it? Should those documents be published, or is it essential to keep them hidden?

SAN ANTONIO — Paranormal enthusiasts in San Antonio have the chance to see the allegedly haunted doll, Annabelle, this weekend.



The doll, which has inspired several TV shows and its own movie series, is believed to be possessed by a demon.

Annabelle is currently on a nationwide tour, allowing fans of the paranormal to view her in person. Today, she was on display at the Victoria's Black Swan Inn on the northeast side as part of the Psychic and Spirit Fest. 

The Black Swan Inn, itself a subject of paranormal interest, is reputed to be haunted by the spirit of a Confederate soldier and has been featured in several paranormal TV series. 

Annabelle, along with two other haunted items, will be on display again tomorrow from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","This Wild 'Supernatural' Episode Proved That the Show Still Had Something New To Offer","https://collider.com/supernatural-season-8-hunteri-heroici/","Sun, 18 May 2025 15:20:00 GMT","

With over 300 to choose from, there's a Supernatural episode out there for everybody. Whether you're a longtime fan or still working your way through the 15-season show, there's one episode of the horror-turned-fantasy series that proved it still had some life left in it when many had written it off. If you're a fan of classic cartoons like Looney Tunes and you haven't seen the Season 8 Supernatural episode ""Hunteri Heroici,"" then what are you waiting for?

 After a tough batch of episodes in Season 7, Supernatural's eighth season took things back to the show's roots. Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles) were back on the road, demons (and some angels) were the main opponents, and the brothers struggled to work through their crap, per usual. But after the return of Castiel (Misha Collins), the three go on their first hunt together (okay, their first non-mythology hunt) in ""Hunteri Heroici.""

After Castiel finds a case involving explosive hearts, the trio set off for Oklahoma City, only to discover that the physics of Saturday morning cartoons have become reality, at least in certain locations for a brief period of time. That means anvils are dropped on heads, love-lorn hearts burst out of chests, and one may even float in midair for a moment before plummeting to their death. Everything gets a bit wackier when Sam and Dean realize that the man responsible is actually an old family friend named Fred Jones (Mike Farrell) — and yes, his name is clearly a nod to the Scooby-Doo character of the same name.

Five seasons before Season 13's iconic ""Scoobynatural"" episode, where the Winchesters are pulled into the world of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?, cartoons came to life in the real world in ""Hunteri Heroici."" Having lost his mental faculties over the years, Fred Jones, a psychokinetic, is unknowingly projecting cartoon reality into the real world — an effect that his doctor, Dwight Mahoney (Greg Webb), uses to his advantage. It turns out that Mahoney has been robbing those living in the nursing home by drawing black holes on the wall, stepping through them, and stealing from banks, homes, and other hiding places. It's quite a gambit, and he would've gotten away with it too if not for the meddling hunters getting into his business. A great Supernatural episode, written by future showrunner Andrew Dabb, ""Hunteri Heroici"" is loads of fun because you never know what's going to happen next. Action sequences turn into big gags, and the mystery itself is quite enticing. Of course, it's Supernatural, so the ending is a bit of a downer compared to some Looney Tunes episodes, but hey, what else would you expect from a horror show?

 Part of what has always drawn many fans to Supernatural was how weird and strange the show could be. From its earliest seasons, the Winchesters have been involved in highly comedic horror shows that proved that horror and comedy go together quite well. ""Hollywood Babylon"" comes to mind as one of the earliest examples, parodying the film industry itself. ""Hunter Heroici"" feels cut from the same cloth in that it takes cartoon logic and circumstances and tosses them into Sam, Dean, and Castiel's path. The results speak for themselves. Although ""Scoobynatural"" may be a better example of this idea brought to life, it reverses the idea that Andrew Dabb displays here, namely that cartoons can become reality rather than the other way around. What makes ""Hunteri Heroici"" work so well is that it commits to the cartoon gag when it can, but feels like a standard Supernatural episode/case when that element takes a backseat.

 Compared to the rest of the eighth season, this episode stands out as one of the wackiest, and that's part of why it was so well-received. It also helps that it's peppered with references to other classic cartoons. Fred Jones may be obvious as a Scooby-Doo reference, but his name also connects to Fred Quimby and Chuck Jones, two animation powerhouses responsible for Tom & Jerry and Looney Tunes adventures. The episode also name-drops Woody Woodpecker and Bugs Bunny (who Castiel believes is a giant insect-rabbit mutant), and the first victim, Gary Freleng (Andrew Zachar), is a direct reference to Friz Freleng, a longtime animator and co-creator of Bugs Bunny himself. Dean even offers a ""What's up, Doc?"" when confronting the villain. Sure, some of it's a bit cheesy, but that's kind of the point of many of the original cartoons. In that sense, ""Hunteri Heroici"" honors them well.

Not every monster-of-the-week hit the mark.

If anything, the cartoon idea proved that Supernatural still had some gas in the tank. Season 7 was a major let-down for many who loved the show's earliest seasons. Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver) was killed off, Dick Roman (James Patrick Stuart) wasn't quite the compelling antagonist that fans had come to expect, and Castiel's entire arc was, well, strange. That's not to mention that the Impala is MIA for a handful of episodes, making much of the season feel a bit alien by comparison. The two seasons where Sera Gamble served as showrunner (Seasons 6 and 7, aka ""the Gamble Era"") were full of great standalone episodes but struggled to maintain a consistent or engaging plot. When Jeremy Carver took over in Season 8, that began to change, and eventually, ""Hunteri Heroici"" was a result.

Admittedly, the weakest points in ""Hunter Heroici"" are the scenes that connect to the show's larger mythology. Sam's flashbacks to his time with Amelia Richardson (Liane Balaban) and Castiel's talks with Naomi (Amanda Tapping) feel like weird interludes in an episode that would've soared even higher without them. They don't fit in naturally, and each time the episode cuts to them, it feels like it's done by force. Frankly, these scenes can pull the audience out of what makes this episode so grand, but if you can ignore (or skip) those moments, this is one case you won't want to miss. Sam, Dean, and Castiel have had plenty of zany adventures on Supernatural (and hopefully will have some more in the future), but none quite like this.

The 'Suits' spinoff was missing a few key elements that made the original series such a great watch.

We are very worried about these characters!

The Bondsman will not return for a second season. Prime Video has canceled the supernatural drama after one season, which premiered with all eight episodes available on April 3rd.



Kevin Bacon, Jennifer Nettles, Damon Herriman, Beth Grant, Maxwell Jenkins, and Jolene Purdy star in the series, which follows a bounty hunter who is brought back to life to bring demons back to hell.

Deadline shared the following about the cancellation of The Bondsman:

“In a promising sign, The Bondsman made the Nielsen Top 10 streaming rankings in its premiere week, coming in at #9 on the Originals chart with 563 million minutes of viewing.

By its second week, The Bondsman had dropped off the Nielsen ranks. It has remained on Prime Video's platform Top 10 list, currently at #5 in the U.S. It also has scored high with critics and viewers, averaging 83% on Rotten Tomatoes but has failed to generate buzz on social media.”

What do you think? Did you watch this Prime Video series? Were you hoping for a second season?

I actually liked this show. It's disappointing that every time you find a decent show it gets canceled.

TV personality and psychic medium, Tyler Henry recently underwent surgery for rare brain tumor.

Famed celebrity psychic medium Tyler Henry took to Instagram to share a health update with fans after undergoing brain surgery. 

On Wednesday, the “Hollywood Medium” star, 29, revealed in a post that he'd been diagnosed with a colloid tumor near the center of his brain. This required surgery to remove.

The post featured Henry in a hospital bed smiling, with medical tape over the top of his head. 

“Brain surgery was a success! Great prognosis, incredible staff, and I feel so thankful to be surrounded by my family,” he captioned the post. “I'll be on bedrest for a month and look forward to getting back to doing readings.”

Fortunately, the star added that not much will change for people who meet him virtually for private and group readings while on the mend. 

“For those curious, I had a colloid tumor near the center of my brain and thankfully most of it has been removed! (The tumor, not my brain… that is. ),” Henry joked.

“This isn't my first rodeo with this,” he continued. “And I have so much to be thankful for - I'll see ya'll very soon with lots of thought-provoking subjects and of course, readings.” 

“Thank you all so much for your support,” he added. 

According to the National Institutes of Health, “Colloid brain cysts are benign [non-cancerous], slow-growing lesions typically found in the brain's third ventricle,” that contain “gelatinous material composed of mucin, old blood, cholesterol, and ions—and often present diagnostic and management challenges.”

If large enough, colloid cysts can obstruct cerebrospinal fluid movement, which can cause a buildup of the fluid in the brain and elevate brain pressure.

Symptoms of colloid cysts can include headaches that are most severe in the morning upon waking, nausea, vomiting and blurry vision, according to Columbia Neurosurgery.

Also among the symptoms are changes to a person's gait and personality, memory loss and double vision, according to Columbia Neurosurgery.

But to remove the cysts, brain surgery is usually the first step of treatment, according to Columbia.

This isn't the first time Henry has undergone brain surgery. 

In an August 2023 Instagram post, he revealed undergoing an operation right after his 18th birthday when “an MRI [scan] revealed a congenital brain cyst that [led] to emergency surgery after weeks of headaches. 

“A mass I was born with was only now causing a life-threatening situation as my adult life was just beginning,” he captioned alongside photo taken one month after turning 18. He shared with fans that a doctor had discovered the cyst a week after the pictures was taken.

Donald Trump has made thousands of false claims about his political opponents across his two terms in office while threatening his critics.

Among a litany of social media posts shared by Donald Trump on Saturday, the sitting president dredged up a 2016 video rehashing old, false claims implying that former president Bill Clinton and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton are tied to several deaths.

Trump has made thousands of false or misleading statements about his political opponents across his two terms in office, and he has repeatedly vowed to use the power of the federal government to punish his foes. Democrats have long warned that such baseless rhetoric could lead to violence.

The video, overlaid with the caption, “THE VIDEO HILLARY CLINTON DOES NOT WANT YOU TO SEE,” perpetuates the long-standing “Clinton body count” conspiracy theory, which claims that the Clintons are responsible for the deaths of several individuals who could be seen as political opponents. The claims, however, are false.

A narrator in the video that Trump shared points out that John F. Kennedy Jr. died in a plane crash while seen as the Democratic front-runner in a New York Senate race, which Hillary Clinton eventually won.

The video also refers to the killing of Clinton White House intern Mary Mahoney, who was shot during an attempted robbery at a Washington Starbucks when she tried to grab the shooter's gun, according to the shooter's testimony. The false implication of the video shared by Trump, by contrast, is that the Clintons were somehow involved.

Trump presidency

At another point in the video, the narrator says that Vince Foster, a deputy White House counsel in the Clinton administration, “supposedly killed himself.” Trump has called Foster's 1993 death “very fishy” and said he thinks he was murdered, but none of the five investigations into his death found evidence of that.

Whitewater investigation witness James McDougal suspiciously “suffered a heart attack” before he was able to testify to a grand jury, the narrator claims. However, The Washington Post reported at the time of his death that McDougal had already provided testimony in previous months and was unlikely to have been called as a witness in any public proceedings.

The video also dredges up the bogus conspiracy theory that Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich, who was shot dead near his Washington home in 2016, leaked thousands of committee emails to WikiLeaks during the 2016 presidential campaign. U.S. intelligence indicates that Russia was behind the WikiLeaks email dump that damaged Hillary Clinton's campaign. Rich's parents also reached a settlement with Fox News after they sued the network for emotional distress over a false story  claiming that investigators had found evidence that Rich was the leaker.

As of Saturday afternoon, the video had been shared more than 6,000 times from Trump's Truth Social account. It was also shared by the official X account for Trump's political operation.

Representatives for Trump, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton did not  respond to requests for comment.

This isn't the first time Trump has tried to tie the Clintons to baseless murder theories.

In 2019, for example, Trump spread an unfounded theory on social media suggesting that financier Jeffrey Epstein's death might be tied to Bill Clinton. Trump's Justice Department announced that Epstein died by “apparent suicide” while held in a federal  detention center in New York.

Tariffs and the economy: China and the United States agreed to lower tariffs on goods from each other's countries for 90 days. Trump's 10 percent “universal” tariff on all imports is still in place. Here's what led to the decision to ease tariffs on China.

First 100 days: Trump is facing growing opposition to his ambitious and controversial agenda, with his approval rating in decline, according to a Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll. But inside the White House, Trump's team isn't dissuaded. Here's a look at Trump's first 100 days in 10 charts.

Harvard feud: The Trump administration terminated $450 million in federal funding to Harvard University, the latest round in the battle between the administration and the Ivy League university. Harvard sued the Trump administration after it froze more than $2 billion in federal funding after the school refused to make sweeping changes to its governance, admissions and hiring practices.

Federal workers: The Trump administration continues to work to downsize the federal government, eliminating thousands of jobs at agencies including the Department of Health and Human Services, USAID, the IRS, the Social Security Administration, the Education Department, the Defense Department, the National Weather Service, and the National Park Service.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}","other"

Tech giants like Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Tesla Inc. are still down. 

For most of the past decade, a handful of high-flying technology companies have pushed the US stock market to record highs and become cornerstones of investment portfolios. But that's collapsed this year.

Despite the S&P 500 Index clawing back into the green for 2025 after being whipsawed by President Donald Trump's vacillating trade policies, tech giants like Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Tesla Inc. are still down. The Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index — which includes those companies as well as Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. — is underperforming the S&P 500, and if that holds through Dec. 31, it would make this just the second year in the last 10 where that's happened.

Scott Bessent claims he received assurance in a personal call with company's chief executive

The US retail giant Walmart will “eat some of the tariffs” in line with Donald Trump's demands, the president's treasury secretary Scott Bessent insisted on Sunday, claiming he received the assurance in a personal phone call with the company's chief executive, Doug McMillon.

A spokesperson for Walmart said the company would not comment on conversations between its executives and administration officials. However, a source familiar with the conversation said the phone call between Bessent and McMillon was arranged many days prior to Trump's post – and that the company's position had not changed.

Walmart said this week it had no alternative to raising prices for consumers beginning later this month because it could not absorb the cost of the president's tariffs on international trade, which have caused turmoil in international markets.

The statement provoked an angry response from Trump, who posted a rant to his Truth Social network on Saturday saying the company should “eat the tariffs and not charge valued customers anything”.

According to Bessent, speaking on Sunday to NBC's Meet the Press, Walmart is now promising exactly that.

“I was on the phone with Doug McMillon, the CEO of Walmart, yesterday. And Walmart is, in fact, going to, as you describe it, eat some of the tariffs, just as they did in ‘18, ‘19, and ‘20,” Bessent said after host Kristen Welker asked if the president was asking American companies to be less profitable.

“What you're describing was Walmart's earnings call. The other thing the companies have to do – they have to give the worst case scenario so that they're not sued.”

On Thursday, McMillon said in the earnings call that his company, a bellwether of US consumer health, was moving to protect itself against the impacts of Trump's tariffs, despite the president's administration announcing a pause in its trade war with China that analysts called “capitulation day”.

“We will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible but given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren't able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,” he said.

Walmart's chief financial officer, John Rainey, told CNBC that the company, which has thousands of stores across the US, was “wired for everyday low prices”. But he said the tariffs were “more than any retailer can absorb” – and that consumers would begin to see higher prices towards the end of May and “certainly much more in June”.

Trump announced plans for an unprecedented barrage of tariffs against numerous countries on 2 April, a date he called “liberation day”.

For too long, he said, the US had been “looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far”, and he presented a list of countries and territories that would receive tariffs, ranging from numerous US allies and longtime trade partners to barren, remote islands near Antarctica occupied only by penguins.

The president's strategy, which he insisted would lead to negotiations and trade deals with at least 150 countries, was variously ridiculed and condemned as flawed and unworkable. And it created an ongoing six weeks of chaos with higher prices, crashing stock markets and slowing economic growth.

He has since attempted to walk back many of the excesses of the policy, including this week's announcement that, for an initial 90-day period, tariffs on China – a dominant supplier to Walmart and myriad other US companies – would be cut from 145% to 30%.

The White House called it a “total reset” in trade relations and followed up on Friday by announcing that it would not, after all, negotiate with many of the countries, but instead unilaterally impose new tariff rates.

“[It is] not possible to meet the number of people that want to see us,” Trump told a meeting of business leaders in the United Arab Emirates during his tour of Gulf states.

“We have 150 countries that want to make a deal, but you're not able to see that many countries.”

Bessent told CNN's State of the Union in a later appearance on Sunday that the US was focused on its “18 most important trading relationships” – and that he expected trade talks to continue with a number of countries leading to a series of regional deals.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

China has been escalating its military and political pressure on Taiwan for many years, but should reflect on this strategy and think about what is really in its best interest, President William Lai (賴清德) said. 

Lai made the remark in a YouTube interview with Mindi World News that was broadcast on Saturday, ahead of the first anniversary of his presidential inauguration tomorrow. 

The US has clearly stated that China is its biggest challenge and threat, with US President Donald Trump and US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth repeatedly saying that the US should increase its forces in the Indo-Pacific region to deter Chinese expansion, Lai said.

Lai questioned if this outcome is really in China's best interests and suggested it reconsider its approach. 

“Taiwan is a friendly and well-intentioned society; China should re-evaluate its policies,” Lai said. 

Taiwan-US relations have continued to deepen since Trump took office, he said. 

While Trump has criticisms of former US president Joe Biden, “his policy toward Taiwan has not changed, and has even continued to strengthen,” Lai said. 

Discussing the potential of Trump issuing a “reciprocal” tariff of more than 10 percent against Taiwan, Lai said ongoing negotiations with the US are meant to prevent this from happening. 

He said he must be confident in this regard, because a high tariff would greatly impact Taiwan's economy and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. 

Trump and his Cabinet have repeatedly emphasized the importance of the Indo-Pacific region, where Taiwan plays a very important role, Lai said, adding that “we are determined to achieve the best for our country.” 

Over the past few decades, China's military spending has not decreased at all, even when former president Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) of the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) was in office, and Beijing deploys more missiles each year, Lai of the Democratic Progressive Party said. 

This shows China's true objective: advancing its position in the Western Pacific to compete with the US and change the international world order, Lai said. 

China joined the WTO with US support, and at that time the US viewed China as a partner, he said. 

However, their relationship has shifted to a competitive one, with the US viewing China as a threat, he added. 

China should face Taiwan's existence and respect Taiwanese's pursuit of democracy, liberty and human rights, he said. 

Comparing China to a big company and Taiwan to a small one, Lai said that it is unreasonable for the bigger company to require the smaller one to merge with it to conduct business. 

“Taiwan is a democratic society, and the citizens rule the country,” Lai said. 

KMT spokeswoman Yang Chih-yu yesterday said Lai treated national sovereignty like a commodity to be bargained over by using this metaphor. 

“Is Lai inviting China to propose a merger and acquisition plan?” Yang asked. 

In the context of international politics, Lai's use of the metaphor suggests that Taiwan is willing to be annexed if the right conditions are met, Yang said, adding that national sovereignty is not a commodity, nor is it like stocks that can be bargained over. 

This contradicts Lai's self-proclaimed “pragmatic Taiwan independence” stance and raises serious doubts internationally regarding his cross-strait policy, Yang said.

FALSE DOCUMENTS? 
                                        Actor William Liao said he was ‘voluntarily cooperating' with police after a suspect was accused of helping to produce false medical certificates                                        Police yesterday questioned at least six entertainers amid allegations of evasion of compulsory military service, with Lee Chuan (李銓), a member of boy band Choc7 (超克7), and actor Daniel Chen (陳大天) among those summoned.
The New Taipei City District Prosecutors' Office in January launched an investigation into a group that was allegedly helping men dodge compulsory military service using falsified medical documents.
Actor Darren Wang (王大陸) has been accused of being one of the group's clients.
As the investigation expanded, investigators at New Taipei City's Yonghe Precinct said that other entertainers commissioned the group to obtain false documents.

During an interview with the Plain Law Movement (法律白話文) podcast, Cho said that housing prices cannot be brought down overnight without affecting banks and mortgages.
Therefore, the government is focusing on providing more aid for young people by taking 3 to 5 percent of urban renewal projects and zone expropriations and using that land for social housing, he said.
Single people living in social housing who get married and become parents could obtain 50 percent more                                    


DEMOGRAPHICS: 
                                        Robotics is the most promising answer to looming labor woes, the long-term care system and national contingency response, an official said                                        Taiwan is to launch a five-year plan to boost the robotics industry in a bid to address labor shortages stemming from a declining and aging population, the Executive Yuan said yesterday.
The government approved the initiative, dubbed the Smart Robotics Industry Promotion Plan, via executive order, senior officials told a post-Cabinet meeting news conference in Taipei.
Taiwan's population decline would strain the economy and the nation's ability to care for vulnerable and elderly people, said Peter Hong (洪樂文), who heads the National Science and Technology Council's (NSTC) Department of Engineering and Technologies.

“Taiwan's security is essential to regional stability and to defending democratic values amid mounting authoritarianism,” Tsai said at the annual forum in the Danish capital.
Noting a “new geopolitical landscape” in which global trade and security face “uncertainty and unpredictability,” Tsai said that democracies must remain united and be more committed to building up resilience together in the face of challenges.
Resilience “allows us to absorb shocks, adapt under                                    ","{'href': 'https://www.taipeitimes.com', 'title': 'Taipei Times'}","world"
