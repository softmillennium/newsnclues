                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The NWSL acknowledged that last week's game between Angel City FC and the Utah Royals should have been suspended after Savy King required emergency medical treatment on the field. "Having reviewed our protocols and how they were implemented, and in listening to feedback from our stakeholders, the Angel City vs Utah game last Friday night should not have continued and we regret that it did," read the statement. King underwent successful surgery on Tuesday for what Angel City called "a heart abnormality," with the club calling her prognosis after that procedure "excellent." Utah head coach Jimmy Coenraets said that playing on was "not the right situation to be in, while U.S. women's national team star Trinity Rodman criticized the decision to continue the match. In a statement last Saturday offering an update on King's condition, the NWSL said that "league protocols were followed from both a medical and game operations perspective." While the NWSLPA did not dispute that league rules were followed, it called for those protocols to be revised on Tuesday. "These moments demand humanity, sound judgment, and restraint," read an NWSLPA statement. "Any medical emergency that requires the administration of life-saving care should bring play to an end. Our members are elite, world class competitors who have proven they can perform under unimaginable conditions. That does not mean they should have to." That process is underway, and will include necessary revisions that prioritize the consideration of player, staff and fan well-being." King was transported to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles for evaluation, and underwent surgery to address "a heart abnormality." The California native "is now resting and recovering surrounded by her family, and her prognosis is excellent," per a team statement. Players on both teams could be seen in tears during the roughly eight-minute delay, but the only discussions involving the referees or league match observer that could be seen was a brief interaction between referee Alex Billeter and Press. Both teams, including staff, gathered at midfield for a prayer circle lead by Utah's Alex Loera (a teammate of King's in 2024 at Bay FC). Even after that gathering, the emotional scene continued, with longtime USWNT forward Christen Press admitting that her only thoughts were on King's status in a post-game interview with Paramount+. "All of us are praying for Savy, our teammate," the Angel City forward said. "We know that she's with her moms...we are praying, and she is on our hearts and minds and that's really all I can think about right now." “You're emotionally — not only [Angel City], but also our players were just scared," said Coenraets. That's the decision other people are making, which is fine.</p>

The Gunners all-but cemented second place in the Premier League for a third season running thanks to a narrow victory over the Magpies

Arsenal booked their place in next season's Champions League thanks to a 1-0 win at home to Newcastle on Sunday, locking down Champions League qualification from the Premier League in the process. The Magpies would have leapfrogged the Gunners to second in the standings had they taken the three points, but ultimately came up short as Mikel Arteta's men emerged triumphant.

The hosts played themselves into trouble early on when David Raya's low kick was cut out by Sandro Tonali. The Italian slipped in Callum Wilson, whose cutback was aimed goal-wards by Bruno Guimaraes, but he was denied by two scrambling saves from the apologetic Spaniard between the sticks.

Raya then had to be at his best to tip behind a deflected drive from Harvey Barnes, and the Gunners survived an almighty goalmouth scramble which saw their goalkeeper keep out Dan Burn and Sven Botman from a troublesome corner.

Despite that testing first half, Arsenal went in front shortly after the restart. Bukayo Saka won possession high up the pitch and tiptoed away from two defenders before passing to Martin Odegaard, who cut the ball back for Declan Rice to sweep home from the edge of the box - the Gunners' first goal against Newcastle this season after 52 shots across four games.

Newcastle were without in-demand striker Alexander Isak but they threw all they had remaining at Arsenal in search of an equaliser, though that wasn't enough to really trouble Arteta's side and Rice's goal proved to be the only one in north London after nearly 100 minutes of action.

GOAL rates Arsenal's players from the Emirates Stadium...</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kevin De Bruyne has revealed he “probably won't play” for Manchester City in this summer's Club World Cup, with the Belgian critical of Fifa for staging the competition when contracts are on the verge of running out. City's decision not to offer De Bruyne fresh terms means Bournemouth's visit to the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday and Sunday's trip to Fulham on the final day of the Premier League season will be his final games for the club he joined 10 years ago. City play their three Club World Cup Group G games in June and De Bruyne's deal finishes at the end of that month, so he could participate. “It doesn't make any sense,” said De Bruyne following City's defeat to Crystal Palace in Saturday's FA Cup final. Nobody's going to take care of me at that point. So there's a big chance I probably won't play it. De Bruyne is considering whether to play on at the highest level. “I want to finish these two games and make a decision, but it's not that easy. I have to take care of my family. I've got three kids, my wife, it's not an easy process at this time.” The 33-year-old was asked if signing for another Premier League club, joining a Spanish or Italian club or playing for a team in an emerging league was the preference.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>De Bruyne will leave City after 10 years when his contract expires in the close-season, but there has been speculation he could sign a short-term deal to remain with Pep Guardiola's side for the Club World Cup. The first of two summer transfer windows is an additional registration period created by FIFA for teams involved in the Club World Cup, effectively allowing players in De Bruyne's situation to stay on for the tournament. City's opening game is against Moroccan club Wydad AC in Philadelphia on June 18th. However, the 33-year-old is unlikely to be involved given his future plans are unresolved at present. Nobody's going to take care of me at that point, so there's a big chance I probably won't play it, but I don't know, maybe yes." But what is likely to be his last showpiece occasion with City ended in disappointment as Crystal Palace won 1-0 in Saturday's FA Cup final at Wembley. The Belgium midfielder is not in a rush to make a decision about his future, but did not rule out a move to another Premier League club and admitted he has already had conversations with some suitors. Asked after the FA Cup final if he ideally wants to stay in the English top-flight, De Bruyne said: "I don't know. When I was 20 years old and by myself, I could make a decision that was very easy, but now it's a bit more complex." De Bruyne's inconsistent display in the Cup final underlined why Guardiola was willing to part ways with a City icon whose career has been ravaged by injuries over the last two years. Pressed on whether or not his next employers could be in the Premier League, De Bruyne replied: "Maybe." After four successive titles prior to this season, it has been a dismal campaign by City's high standards. "Of course it's not been the season we wanted. "I think comparing to a lot of players, I've won way more than others, so I will be forever happy and grateful for what we have done as a team, what they have given me."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cristiano Ronaldo has received a "tempting" offer to leave Al Nassr after contract negotiations came to a halt with the struggling Saudi Pro League side. Out of contract in the summer, Ronaldo had reportedly been in talks over a two-year contract extension with Al Nassr but those discussions have been halted amid a poor run of form which has seen them slip to fourth in the SPL. Jose Felix Diaz of MARCA claims that Ronaldo and his entourage have received a "significant" offer from  an unnamed Brazilian club who want give the Portuguese superstar one last big move before he hangs up his boots. The proposal is described as an "off-market offer" which would be partly funded by contributions from outside investors. According to the report, Ronaldo is now in a "dilemma" about what his next step should be as the offer presented is a "tempting one". It is claimed that Al Nassr had "almost sealed" a contract renewal for Ronaldo but it is now "evaporating by the minute" - opening up the possibility of a final career switch to South America for the 40-year-old. Though no exact club has been named in Brazil, it is mentioned that a move could open up the door for an appearance in this summer's Club World Cup in the United States. In the revamped, 32-team tournament, Palmeiras, Flamengo, Fluminense, and Botafogo are all representing Brazil. Josh is a sports journalist who specialises in football and WWE.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SoccerToday features original articles with exclusive interviews plus influential columnists covering youth and professional soccer, coaching, nutrition, and the wonderful soccer life. Explore the leadership timeline of the National Women's Soccer League, from its founding in 2013 to today's reforms under Commissioner Jessica Berman. Since its launch in 2013, the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) has undergone a transformation—from a startup supported by U.S. Soccer to an expanding, independently-run league with record attendance and international acclaim. Here's a look at the key figures who have led the NWSL and how each era has influenced the league's identity. Editor's Note: The title of “commissioner” did not yet exist in the NWSL's original structure. In 2022, Plush came under scrutiny and reproach after the Yates report accused him of failing to act on abuse allegations during his time with the league—raising questions about the league leadership's accountability. As the NWSL continues to evolve—adding new franchises, setting attendance records, and growing global interest—its leadership remains central to its integrity and future. From foundational figures like Cheryl Bailey to reformers like Jessica Berman, each phase of NWSL leadership tells part of the league's larger story: one of resilience, progress, and accountability.

Live Fantasy Analysis of the 2025 NFL Draft Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne has said he is unlikely to play in this summer's Club World Cup with the club. De Bruyne announced in April that he would leave City after 10 years at the Etihad that saw him win six Premier League titles, as well as the club's maiden Champions League in 2023. De Bruyne said that no decision has been made on his participation at the tournament, but said it is likely that he will not be part of the travelling squad and added that the situation “makes no sense”. “It doesn't make any sense, but I think that happens when you push in new tournaments in the middle of this contract situation,” De Bruyne said after City's FA Cup final defeat against Crystal Palace on Saturday. Nobody's going to take care of me at that point. So there's a big chance probably that I won't play it, but I don't know, maybe yes. De Bruyne also said that it would “probably” be up to both him and the club on whether he plays at the competition and that he has not made a decision on his next club yet. “I don't care about status,” he said. “I want to be happy and play good football. I just want to enjoy and still play some football in the future and status can come whenever I'm done and I can enjoy my life.” De Bruyne has made 420 appearances for City in all competitions, scoring 108 goals and providing 177 assists.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are many projects in Saudi Arabia, most of them ambitious, and many of them designed to disrupt the status quo. One such project is NEOM SC, a soccer club owned by the Public Investment Fund — the same sovereign wealth fund that owns Premier League club Newcastle United — and which is being fast-tracked to become one of the biggest in the world. In this extract from the book Engulfed: How Saudi Arabia Bought Sport, and the World, which explores ambition, family rivalries, extreme wealth, power, murder and disinformation behind the kingdom's use of sport as a geopolitical tool, James Montague visited the remote city of Tabuk to find out more about the so-far secretive club… Women in black abayas with niqabs covering their faces worked as volunteers, pointing fans towards the tight security at the stadium entrance. Groups of excitable teenage boys waited their turn to play EA FC on a bank of massive flat screen TVs. It was Tuesday night and it felt more like a low-key music festival than the build-up to a football match. The match against Al Jandal was officially a 10,000 sell-out, something that had not happened before, in part because there had not been much success for the fans to get excited about. Al Suqoor, ‘The Falcons' in Arabic, was founded in 1965 and had spent almost all of its six-decade history bouncing between the third and fourth tier of Saudi football. They had never played in Saudi Arabia's elite league. In the past, Al Suqoor would be lucky if a few dozen fans attended. But the team was no longer called Al Suqoor and no longer wore their traditional gold, black and white shirts. They were now known as NEOM Sports Club, named after their new owners, the $1.5trillion real estate mega project being built in virtual secrecy down the road. NEOM was entirely owned by the Public Investment Fund. It was a project of breathless ambition, or hubris, depending on who you spoke to. Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) announced it in 2017, a high-tech series of developments covering 27,000 square kilometres of Tabuk province bordering on Saudi Arabia's pristine and undeveloped Red Sea coastline. At its centre was The Line, a proposed 170-kilometre-long ‘cognitive city', built — in the spirit of nominative determinism — in a straight line. There would be no roads or currency and the project would be staffed by robot servants and flying cars. The whole NEOM mega project had become one of the most important elements of MBS's economic and social revolution, as well as Saudi Arabia's bid to host the 2034 World Cup, which would be rubber-stamped by FIFA a few months from now. It looked like an arena a player might be able to choose in Rocket League. The most efficient way of achieving that was to find a club that had already been established and one that inhabited a sort of Goldilocks zone: not too big so that the existing fans would complain about the eradication of its history, but not too small, otherwise it would take too long to reach the top of the Saudi football pyramid. And NEOM was on a tight timeline. The club's old badge – a falcon in profile – was replaced by NEOM's corporate logo. Outside the stadium, volunteers handed out hundreds of NEOM SC's blue flags and scarves, the club's new corporate brand-aligned colours. NEOM had an entire sports division, with diverse investments in Formula E and Indian Premier League cricket, among others. NEOM's corporate symbol and colour palette was everywhere. “We are here to cheer,” said Faris, a former youth player of Al Suqoor who, at 18, had given up on his dream of playing football. He was part of ‘The NEOM Unit' – previously known as ‘Al Suqoor Unit' — a group of eight friends who would lead the chants in the crowd with their songs and tabla hand drums. They gathered around with their instruments as Faris spoke. “I was a player for Al Suqoor, and when they got bought by NEOM, I switched to being a fan. This is the best thing I can do for my team to be better. A whole new management structure was brought in as the club signed top Saudi and international players, who had no business playing in the second tier of Saudi football for a rebranded team in a remote corner of the country. Egypt international and Al Ittihad captain Ahmed Hegazy was persuaded to join him. Brazilian coach Pericles Chamusca had been in charge of Saudi Pro League side Al Taawoun FC, before he too was convinced to sign for NEOM SC. Pericles had been coaching in Saudi since 2018 and had acclimatised well to the Kingdom, which might have explained why he wore a blazer and tie in the stifling heat as he ran the players through their final warm-up routine on the pitch. The building site itself was inaccessible thanks to its remote location, but also by design. There had been several bad news stories in recent years. It was nearly impossible to visit the site and NEOM Sports Club shared some of that secrecy, at least initially. There was no phone number or other contact details on the club's website. Once in the stadium, an official quickly grabbed me and asked who I was and what I was doing. They escorted me out to the car park. At first, I thought I was being thrown out, but they instead politely showed me into a lift. When the doors opened, I was standing in NEOM Sports Club's VVIP room. A lavish buffet of Arabic food, dates and chocolate cakes skirted the room. Waiters weaved around, serving cardamom-scented Arabic coffee in tiny porcelain cups. The deputy governor of Tabuk, a member of the Saud royal family, had just arrived, as had Olympiacos sporting director and 1998 World Cup winner Christian Karembeu. He was wearing a NEOM-branded polo shirt and was the guest of Kyriakos Dourekas, NEOM SC's new sporting director, who had been poached from Nottingham Forest, whose billionaire owner Evangelos Marinakis also owned Olympiacos. Moaath Alohali strode forward and warmly introduced himself. Moaath was the acting CEO of NEOM SC, although I recognised him from somewhere else. He once held the same position at Al Ettifaq, a Saudi Pro League team from Dammam, his home city on the country's oil-rich Persian Gulf coast. Famously, he had recruited Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard as coach. Moaath was in the photos, in a white thobe, smiling as the players signed their lucrative new contracts. He was in Tabuk with his boss, Meshari al Motairi, the chairman of NEOM SC. Meshari al Motairi was a man of influence. It highlighted just how important those in charge viewed the football club to NEOM's future. “This is part of the revolution led by His Royal Highness (Mohammed bin Salman),” he explained when we finally spoke. Al Motairi had never given an interview to a Western journalist before. He made it clear this was very much out of choice. But once we began to talk, he was open about why NEOM had bought what was then a third division football club. The players and staff, he said, had not just been attracted by the money to play in Tabuk, but NEOM's vision. “I think the most important thing that attracted all of them is NEOM, NEOM as a project,” he said. The club was on a tight schedule. Promotion to the SPL this year was a necessity, followed by the league and continental titles in subsequent seasons. Where do you see NEOM SC in five years, I asked. The NEOM Unit had already been singing for over an hour when the match kicked off, a swirling, joyous noise that pulsed and swelled like the waves of a gentle sea. Pericles Chamusca's side dismantled Al Jandal with ease. Romarinho, a Brazilian player who was considered one of the best in the SPL last season, scored twice as they won 4-0. “It's clear in our strategy that we will be there within 10 years, max,” Moaath said of NEOM SC's move to the state-of-the-art World Cup stadium that was going to be built on top of The Line, a brand-new old club on old-brand-new land.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Juventus, Inter Milan, and Napoli are all ready to go head-to-head for the signature of striker Jonathan David this summer. This according to Italian broadcaster Sky Sport Italia, via FCInterNews. They report that Juventus have made yet another approach for the Canadian, but that Inter and Napoli are still very much in the race. The 25-year-old will leave Lille after five seasons when his contract expires. Therefore, there are a number of clubs keeping tabs on David. Inter Milan have already made their offer to the Canadian international. Meanwhile, Arsenal and Bayern Munich have also already sounded out David's agents. Napoli have also recently met with representatives of the Canadian. The Bianconeri do indeed see David as one of their major targets in attack. Therefore, they are taking steps to get a deal for the Canadian done. However, Juventus have not yet taken a decisive advantage in the race for David's signature. Sky confirm that Inter and Napoli are still very much candidates to sign the 25-year-old. Therefore, all three Italian heavy-hitters will certainly vie for David's signature in the coming weeks.</p>
