                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Belgian scientists from VIB and Ghent University (UGent), together with Danish collaborators, have uncovered compelling evidence that early-infancy infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) significantly increases the risk of developing childhood asthma-especially in children with a family history of allergy or asthma. Across Europe, 5–15% of children live with asthma-a chronic condition that affects quality of life, can burden families for years, and generates considerable societal costs. Identifying ways to prevent asthma before it develops is therefore a major public health priority. Childhood asthma is a complex disease with many contributing factors. We found that early-life RSV infection and genetic allergy risk interact in a very specific way that pushes the immune system toward asthma. The encouraging news is that this process can be prevented." Prof. Bart Lambrecht (VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research), senior author of the study By combining population-wide health registry data from all Danish children and their parents with controlled laboratory experiments, the researchers uncovered how early viral infection and inherited allergy risk amplify one another. Infants who experience severe RSV infections in the first months of life show an increased likelihood of immune cells overreacting to common allergens, such as house dust mites. This effect is dramatically intensified when asthma or allergy runs in the family, as allergen-specific antibodies passed from parents to the newborn further heighten sensitivity. Importantly, the team found that when newborns were protected from RSV in experimental models, these harmful immune shifts did not occur-and asthma development was prevented. "With RSV prevention now becoming widely accessible, we have an opportunity to improve long-term respiratory health, not just prevent RSV hospitalizations," says Prof. Hamida Hammad (VIB-UGent), co–senior author. It's a message that should help parents choose RSV prevention with confidence." Yet despite their strong ability to prevent RSV hospitalizations, uptake remains inconsistent. "This is a moment where policy, science, and pediatricians can come together," adds Lambrecht. "If preventing RSV infection also reduces asthma risk, the benefits for families and health systems could be enormous." Maternal allergy and neonatal RSV infection synergize via FcR-mediated allergen uptake to promote the development of asthma in early life.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Long-term exposure to toxic air can substantially weaken the health benefits of regular exercise, suggests a new study by an international team including UCL (University College London) researchers. The team found that the protective effect of regular exercise on people's risk of dying over a specific period – from any cause and from cancer and heart disease specifically – appeared to be reduced, but not eliminated, for those who lived in high pollution areas. The researchers looked at levels of fine particulate matter – tiny particles known as PM2.5s with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers across. Nearly half (46%) of the world's population live in areas exceeding this threshold. Our findings emphasize that exercise remains beneficial even in polluted environments. However, improving air quality can greatly enhance these health gains." Po-Wen Ku, Lead Researcher, Professor, National Chung Hsing University, Taiwan Co-author Professor Andrew Steptoe, from UCL's Department of Behavioural Science & Health, said: "Our study shows that toxic air can to some extent block the benefits of exercise, although not eliminate them. "We believe clean air and physical activity are both important for healthy aging and so we encourage greater efforts to curb health-harming pollution levels." For the study, the research team looked at data from seven existing studies, including three that were unpublished, combining the summary statistics from each study into one overall analysis. Combining the data from seven studies, they found that people who did at least two and a half hours of moderate or vigorous exercise a week had a 30% lower risk of dying during the study period than those who did not meet this exercise threshold. At higher levels of fine particle pollution, above 35 μg/m³, the benefits of exercise weakened further, particularly for risk of death from cancer, where the benefits were no longer robust. About a third of the world's population (36%) live in areas whose yearly average PM2.5 levels exceed 35 μg/m³. However, levels of fine particle pollution vary a lot and spikes in pollution in UK cities do exceed 25 μg/m³, the critical threshold identified in the study, mainly during the winter months. Co-author Professor Paola Zaninotto, from UCL's Department of Epidemiology & Public Health, said: "We don't want to discourage people from exercising outdoors. Checking air quality, choosing cleaner routes, or easing off intensity on polluted days can help you get the most health benefits from your exercise." In their section on limitations, the authors noted that the study was mostly conducted in high-income countries, so the findings might not apply to low-income countries where fine particle pollution is higher, often exceeding 50 μg/m³. However, a wide variety of other factors were accounted for, including income and education levels, health behaviors such as smoking, and the presence or not of existing chronic diseases.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over the course of life, a specific form of epigenetic aging - known as ACCA drift - accumulates in intestinal stem cells. This leads to the shutdown of key genes through hypermethylation. The drift spreads across the intestinal crypts and is caused by a combination of age-related inflammation, weakened Wnt signaling, and impaired iron metabolism, which affects the activity of DNA-modifying enzymes. The findings provide new explanations for why the risk of colorectal cancer increases with age and which molecular processes are involved. The human gut renews itself faster than any other tissue: every few days, new cells are created from specialized stem cells. However, as we get older, epigenetic changes build up in these stem cells. These are chemical markers on the DNA that act like switches, determining which genes remain active.The study, recently published in Nature Aging, was conducted by an international team led by Prof. Francesco Neri from the University of Turin, Italy, and shows that changes in the gut do not occur randomly. Rather, a specific pattern develops over the course of aging, which the researchers refer to as ACCA (Aging- and Colon Cancer-Associated) drift. "We observe an epigenetic pattern that becomes increasingly apparent with age," explains Prof. Neri, former group leader at the Leibniz Institute on Aging - Fritz Lipmann Institute in Jena.Genes that maintain the balance in healthy tissue are particularly affected, including those that control the renewal of the intestinal epithelium via the Wnt signaling pathway. The changes described as "drifting" can be detected not only in the aging gut, but also in almost all colon cancer samples examined. This suggests that the aging of stem cells creates an environment that promotes the development of cancer. Each intestinal crypt - a small, tubular section of the intestinal mucosa - originates from a single stem cell. Dr. Anna Krepelova explains the process as follows: "Over time, more and more areas with an older epigenetic profile develop in the tissue. Through the natural process of crypt division, these regions continuously enlarge and can continue to grow over many years. "This explains why the intestines of older people contain a veritable patchwork of crypts that have remained young and others that have aged significantly, and why certain regions are particularly susceptible to producing more degenerated cells, which promotes cancer growth. Researchers have shown that older intestinal cells absorb less iron but release more iron at the same time. These enzymes normally protect from the excess DNA methylations, but if the cell doesn't have enough iron, they can't do their job properly. Excess DNA methylations are no longer broken down. And the cells lose their ability to remove these markings." This has a kind of domino effect: as the TET activity decreases, more and more DNA methylations accumulate, and important genes are switched off; they "fall silent." The research team was also able to demonstrate that mild inflammatory processes in the gut associated with aging further reinforce this mechanism. At the same time, Wnt signaling also weakens - a signaling pathway that is important for keeping stem cells active and functional.This combination of iron deficiency, inflammation, and Wnt signaling loss acts as an "accelerator" of epigenetic drift. As a result, the aging process in the intestine can begin earlier and spread faster than previously thought. The researchers succeeded in slowing down or partially reversing epigenetic drift in organoid cultures - miniature intestinal models grown from intestinal stem cells - by restoring iron import or specifically activating the Wnt signaling pathway.Both measures led to the TET enzymes becoming more active again and the cells starting to break down the methylations once more. "This means that epigenetic aging does not have to be a fixed, final state," emphasizes Dr. Anna Krepelova. Iron homeostasis and cell clonality drive cancer-associated intestinal DNA methylation drift in aging.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chronic muscle tension is a common underlying factor in many pain disorders, causing reduced arterial blood flow, tissue hypoxia, and the release of inflammatory mediators. These physiological changes trigger pain signaling through sensory neurons. Existing treatments such as anesthetics and anti-inflammatory drugs, typically aim to block pain perception or reduce inflammation temporarily, without addressing the muscle-driven origin. As a result, symptoms often recur and treatment outcomes vary widely. Due to these challenges, there is a need for approaches that directly target muscle tension and restore local blood supply to achieve sustained pain relief.The author from Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine reports new theoretical and practical insights into Fu's subcutaneous needling (FSN), a technique that integrates traditional acupuncture principles with modern myology. The study, published (DOI: 10.1016/j.jtcms.2025.09.008) in the Journal of Traditional Chinese Medical Sciences in 2025, explains how FSN relaxes tightened muscle fibers, restores arterial blood flow, and prevents abnormal ATP release that activates pain pathways. The findings demonstrate FSN's value as a non-pharmacological therapy for muscle-related pain and support its broader development in clinical practice.The study outlines the evolution of FSN as a technique that inserts a specialized needle into the subcutaneous layer rather than deep muscle layers. A signature "swaying movement" is applied to mechanically release muscle tension. Clinically, FSN has shown immediate pain relief in conditions ranging from neck and shoulder stiffness to knee osteoarthritis and visceral pain. Chronic contraction compresses surrounding arteries, reducing oxygen supply and damaging mitochondria, which in turn causes the leakage of intracellular ATP. By releasing muscle tension, FSN restores blood flow, stops pathological ATP leakage, and interrupts pain transmission at its origin. The technique adheres to the "Keep It Simple, Stupid" principle by using a single, clearly defined target tissue and reproducible operation steps. It also avoids drug side effects and deep-tissue risks, offering a safe, efficient alternative to conventional pain treatments. "We are shifting the understanding of pain from nerve-centered theories toward a muscle-centered model," said the study's author. "Chronic muscle tension is not simply a symptom but a driver of ischemia, cellular stress, and pain signaling. "FSN offers a promising treatment option for patients with chronic pain who cannot tolerate medications or have not responded to conventional therapies. Its simplicity and safety mean it may be applied across community clinics, rehabilitation centers, and integrated medicine settings. By centering muscle physiology in pain treatment, FSN may serve as a foundation for new therapeutics that improve patient outcomes while reducing reliance on pharmaceutical pain control.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study describes a key molecular mechanism that explains how cells exchange information through extracellular vesicles (EVs), small particles with great therapeutic potential. This finding sheds light on the process of intercellular communication, which is fundamental to the development of new therapies and diagnostic tools. Carles Enrich, professor at the same faculty (IDIBAPS-UB), also participated. According to Albert Lu, "understanding how receptor cells capture and process extracellular vesicles is essential to understanding how our body communicates at the molecular level." "Furthermore  -  he continues  -  this knowledge is key to harnessing the therapeutic and diagnostic potential of these vesicles, since their effectiveness depends on being able to direct them and have them captured by the appropriate target cells." Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanoparticles secreted by all cells that act as biological messengers: they transport proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. To identify the molecular mechanisms that direct their uptake and internalization in the cell, researchers have used an innovative methodological approach consisting of applying massive genomic screening based on CRISPR-Cas9 technology. This tool allows researchers to deactivate each of the more than 20,000 human genes one by one, to analyse their role in the process. The cells were then exposed to EVs labelled with a fluorescent dye and, using flow cytometry, the cells that captured more or fewer vesicles were measured. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was then used to separate the cells with higher or lower uptake capacity. The deactivated genes in each group were subsequently identified using mass sequencing. This systematic and unbiased approach allows us to discover new regulators without relying on prior hypotheses, unlike traditional techniques that focus on specific candidates." Professor Albert Lu, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of the UB and the CELLEX Biomedical Research Centre (IDIBAPS-UB) The results indicate that the Commander endosomal recycling complex, formed by various proteins, acts as a fundamental and general regulator of vesicle uptake. Understanding this process has important therapeutic implications, since the ability of these vesicles to cross membranes and reach specific tissues makes them potential natural vehicles for transporting drugs or therapeutic molecules. "Understanding how their entry, intracellular trafficking and delivery of their molecular cargo are regulated opens the door to designing EVs with controlled directionality, improving their efficacy in regenerative, oncological or anti-inflammatory therapies," Lu points out. Researchers are currently working to gain a more detailed understanding of the role of the Commander complex in controlling the uptake and intracellular fate of these vesicles, as well as to determine whether this mechanism is maintained in other types of cells or tissues.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>High-intensity interval training boosts fitness and muscle endurance more effectively than traditional home exercise programmes in people recently diagnosed with inflammatory muscle disease. That is the conclusion of a new study from Karolinska Institutet, published in eBioMedicine. Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are a group of rare autoimmune diseases that cause muscle weakness and fatigue. Standard treatment usually combines medication with light to moderate home exercise. However, the impact on aerobic fitness has been limited. Researchers at Karolinska Institutet have now investigated whether high-intensity interval training (HIIT) could deliver better results.The study involved 23 patients who had recently developed IIM. The researchers assessed aerobic capacity, muscle endurance and markers of disease activity before and after the training period. Results showed that the HIIT group improved their aerobic capacity by an average of 16 percent, compared with 1.8 percent in the home exercise group. Muscle endurance also increased more with HIIT, and muscle samples revealed signs of enhanced mitochondrial function, which is crucial for the cells' energy production. At the same time, disease activity remained stable in both groups, suggesting that intensive training is safe. There were no signs that exercise increased inflammation or muscle damage. Common symptoms of IIM include muscle weakness and reduced endurance. Better fitness can lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, while patients gain more stamina and independence. This could become an important complement to medication in improving physical capacity and quality of life."
