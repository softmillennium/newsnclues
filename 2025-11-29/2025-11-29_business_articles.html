                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that the airspace above and surrounding Venezuela is to be closed in its entirety. Trump, in a Truth Social post said: "To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY." Last week, the U.S. aviation regulator warned major airlines of a "potentially hazardous situation" when flying over Venezuela due to a "worsening security situation and heightened military activity in or around" the country. Venezuela revoked operating rights for six major international airlines that had suspended flights to the country following a warning from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. The Trump administration has accused Maduro of involvement in drug trafficking, a charge he has denied. Maduro, in power since 2013, has said that Trump is seeking to oust him and that Venezuelan citizens and the military will resist any such attempt. U.S. forces in the region have so far focused on counter-narcotic operations, although the assembled firepower far outweighs anything needed for them. They have carried out at least 21 strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific since September, killing at least 83 people. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Airlines across the world are working to repair a software glitch affecting thousands of Airbus A320 jets this weekend. "Our teams are working around the clock to support our operators and ensure these updates are deployed as swiftly as possible to get planes back in the sky and resume normal operations," he said. Airbus issued a major recall on Friday after it said it had discovered a potential data corruption issue on many of its A320 jets. In a statement, the company said that "intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls" and that "a significant number of A320 Family aircraft" needed immediate updates as a result. A spokesperson for Airbus told Business Insider via email that the issue is tied to a "specific software version carried by A320 Family aircraft, some of which are operating in the US." More than 1,600 aircraft from the A320 family are in service in the US, including many operated by Delta, American Airlines, United, JetBlue, Frontier, and Spirit, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics company. Around 6,000 A320s globally are expected to require the software fix. American Airlines said in an updated statement Friday night that 209 aircraft were affected, down from the more than 340 that were initially identified. The company said it only had about 150 aircraft left to update as of 7 p.m. American Airlines told Business Insider earlier on Friday that it expected the updates to take about two hours per aircraft. Delta said the issue should only affect a "small portion" of its A321neo aircraft, fewer than 50 planes. Delta told Business Insider the work would be done "by Saturday morning through already planned aircraft maintenance touchpoints." A spokesperson from United Airlines said six of its aircraft would need an update and that the carrier expected "minor disruption to a few flights." Spokespeople from JetBlue and Spirit did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The recall comes during one of the peak holiday travel weekends, which could complicate schedules if aircraft need additional downtime. It adds to what's already been a difficult stretch for airlines and travelers.</p>

It was hard to tell who'd known each other for years and who'd just met that morning — the laughter started even before the food arrived. It was a sunny Wednesday afternoon in September, and I was joining a group of 50 retirees for lunch in Malaysia. They'd been brought together by an expat community that began with one man's efforts to connect people across the country. They greeted me with a few curious looks; someone joked that he wanted to know who my surgeon was. The state comprises both Penang Island and a stretch of mainland Malaysia known as Seberang Perai, connected by two bridges. As of July, it's home to about 1.8 million people, including around 179,900 foreigners. Nearly everyone I met, including Spencer, said they were on the Malaysia My Second Home (MM2H) visa program, which was first introduced by the government in 2002 to attract foreigners. Depending on the category of visa, applicants are required to have a minimum bank deposit of between $150,000 and $1 million and also purchase property in Malaysia. As of December 2024, there were 58,468 active MM2H pass holders in the country. Along with its thriving food scene and year-round warm weather, Penang's affordability is a major draw. According to listings on real estate site PropertyGuru, studio apartments can be rented for as little as 1,450 Malaysian ringgit, or about $350, a month. Over the past 12 months, homes in Penang sold for a median price of 272,800 ringgit, or about $65,750. There's an international airport, a network of local bus services, and English is spoken almost everywhere. It's one of the things that Ward Chartier, 70, thought about when looking for a place to settle. Ask enough retirees what they're looking for, and the answers all start to sound the same: comfort, companionship, and a sense of purpose. Indeed, for many retirees here, Penang's charm begins at breakfast and never really ends. Do you have a story to share about retiring in Asia?</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Porshaye Watkins, a 37-year-old ride-hailing driver for Uber and Lyft in Atlanta. Business Insider verified her work and expenses. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. She raised me, so after that, I had to navigate life a little differently. In the fall of last year, I had the wonderful idea to use rideshare to supplement my income while studying and caring for my family. However, it has not been what I've planned. The story I had heard from others who drove rideshare was that they did it full-time and were able to make thousands of dollars a week. But the most profitable times to work don't always fall within the hours I'm able to spend outside and work. Sometimes I have to study when lots of people are requesting rides, such as at night. It was very expensive: I was paying about $300 a week for the car, and that doesn't include a deposit, taxes, fees, or insurance. Earlier this year, I ended up buying my own car. I'm taking a break from school, although I plan to re-enroll and complete my final year in January. As a future doctor, I see certain behaviors among other drivers that concern me. Like me, a lot of other ride-hailing drivers whom I talk to while working or getting rides myself say they sacrifice downtime and sleep to drive. That can make them more anxious, especially late at night, which puts everyone on the road at risk. (Editor's note: A Lyft spokesperson said driver health and well-being is a top priority, and the company encourages drivers to take breaks and limits drivers to working 12 hours at once. It doesn't do the body good. Over the past year or so, I've realized that driving for rideshare is not a sustainable side hustle for me. The main alternative that has worked out for me is working as a substitute teacher. It's devastating to me that I'm working this hard. I hoped the rideshare industry could be a reliable option for someone like me who needs flexibility, but it's not. Do you have a story to share about Uber or other gig work?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thousands of travelers worldwide were stranded after Airbus ordered immediate software fixes for 6,000 A320-series aircraft, a move that affected more than half of the narrow-body fleet and forced airlines to ground jets during one of the busiest travel weekends of the year. The disruption, linked to solar flares, hit especially hard in Asia, where the single-aisle A320 family anchors short-haul networks. American Airlines, the world's largest A320 operator, said more than 200 planes were impacted. The airline later said that, as of 8 a.m. United Airlines said six aircraft in its fleet were affected, and the carrier expected "minor disruption to a few flights." Delta Air Lines said less than 50 of its Airbus A320 fleet were affected. Japan's ANA Holdings canceled 95 domestic flights Saturday, affecting around 13,200 passengers. The carrier, along with affiliates such as Peach Aviation, operates the country's largest Airbus narrow-body fleet, while rival Japan Airlines relies mostly on Boeing aircraft. Air India, which is partially owned by Singapore Airlines, said it had completed software updates on over 40% of its affected aircraft and that there were no flight cancellations, although some flights were delayed or rescheduled. In Australia, Jetstar Airways canceled around 90 flights after identifying 34 aircraft that required the software correction. "As of 3:30 pm [local time], 20 of the 34 affected aircraft are ready to return to service. We're expecting the remaining to be ready overnight, allowing flights to resume as planned on Sunday 30 November," a Jetstar spokesperson told CNBC. The budget airline and its parent company, Qantas, which is Australia's national flag carrier, together hold about 65% of the domestic market. Rival Virgin Australia, which has four A320s in its fleet and a 35% share, said that it was unaffected by the recall. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said in a directive on Friday that a JetBlue flight on Oct. 30 experienced an "uncommanded and limited pitch down event." Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said in a LinkedIn post: "The fix required on some #A320 aircraft has been causing significant logistical challenges and delays since yesterday. ... Our teams are working around the clock to support our operators and ensure these updates are deployed as swiftly as possible to get planes back in the sky and resume normal operations."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Black Friday is the perfect time to make a change in your service provider, as both major carriers and smaller MVNOs are dropping their prices to commemorate the holiday. T-Mobile's Black Friday deal is no exception, giving shoppers one of the first chances to get the latest iPhones, Samsung Galaxy devices, and smartwatches for free. While the sale was previously limited to bulk plan purchases earlier this month, newcomers can now get a free Apple or Samsung bundle via 24 monthly billing credits with eligible trade-ins on an Experience Beyond Plan during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. We're breaking down everything you need to know about T-Mobile's Black Friday bundle deal below. If you also need to upgrade your home internet, check out our guide to T-Mobile's deals on 5G and fiber internet plans. Plus, don't forget to check out our full roundup of the best Black Friday deals across all categories. Luckily, the condition doesn't matter to them, so long as you have a qualifying device. If you happen to be shopping for new phones across your family, or just prefer a different promotion, you can also kick off T-Mobile's other Black Friday deals by heading to their appropriate landing pages. T-Mobile's Black Friday bundle deals are an excellent way to upgrade your entire suite of devices, featuring the latest Apple and Samsung phone, tablet, and smartwatch technology in the promotion. The brand's Experience Beyond plan also offers the most bells and whistles for top-tier support, including unlimited mobile hot spot, unlimited data, and free streaming service subscriptions to Apple TV Plus, Hulu, and Netflix Standard. If you've never dabbled in this type of deal, it means that you'll still be billed monthly for the devices, but you'll receive the same amount as credit off your phone bill. It locks you into T-Mobile service for two years, but at least you'll have a complete setup of great tech.
