                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is struggling to gain momentum as it heads toward its worst month since June 2022. As prices hover around $91,000 per token, or roughly 28% off their October all-time highs of more than $126,000, the cryptocurrency's problems don't appear to be easing. First, outflows of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for November have reached $3.5 billion, their largest since February. "These ETFs have turned into sellers, and as long as they keep selling, I think the markets will struggle to stay up, or rebound," he said. According to the firm's data, roughly $800 million flowed out of crypto and back into fiat currencies last week. Instead, its price is pegged to other assets, most commonly the US dollar. That happened in the days after crypto's historic wipeout last month. "Money is not just failing to come in, it's actually leaving the crypto market," Thielen said. Recent dovish comments hinting at a Federal Reserve rate cut in December helped lift bitcoin and other assets on Monday. Even if the Fed cuts in December, it is likely to be a hawkish cut, meaning this rally should be viewed as a short-term, oversold reaction amid extreme fear rather than the start of a sustainable V-shaped recovery. Bitcoin has struggled to recover since the leveraged liquidation event on Oct. 10 wiped out $19 billion in a single day. Bitcoin's past performance from peak to trough has largely followed an every-four-year supply cut known as "the halving." Many investors now deny that the same trajectory will repeat. "There has been OG people selling every single cycle," said Nicolai Søndergaard, a research analyst for blockchain analytics firm Nansen. The sell-off has rippled across nearly every corner of the digital asset space, with total crypto market capitalization falling more than 30%, from $4.28 trillion on Oct. 6 to $2.99 trillion as of Monday. Ethereum (ETH-USD) has also tumbled 38% since early October, while Solana (SOL-USD) dropped more than 40% during the same period. Strategy (MSTR) and the wave of public companies that have imitated its playbook of adding bitcoin and other digital assets to their corporate balance sheets has significantly cooled. While Strategy is still in the green, many of these other so-called digital asset treasuries (DATs) are now underwater on their crypto positions. Meanwhile, bitcoin miners like IREN (IREN), Riot (RIOT), and Mara Holdings (MARA) have retraced more than 30% to the downside, despite their pivots toward servicing the AI sector.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin BTC$90,821.88 may be acting like a recession is imminent — even if the macroeconomic data suggests otherwise. Drawing on macro survey data from sources such as Sentix, ISM, and the Philly Fed, Dragosch produced a chart comparing global growth expectations to the macroeconomic signals embedded in bitcoin's price. According to Dragosch, this setup resembles past dislocations like March 2020 and November 2022, just before bitcoin staged outsized rallies. “Bitcoin is essentially pricing in a recessionary growth environment,” he wrote, calling the current risk-reward setup asymmetric. The CMC Crypto Fear and Greed Index held steady at 20 (“Fear”) on Saturday, matching yesterday's level and slightly above the year-to-date low of 10, last seen on Nov. 22. For comparison, the index sat at 39 (“Fear”) one month ago, and hit a high of 84 (“Extreme Greed”) in late November 2024. Bitcoin traded at $90,559 as of 11:30 a.m. UTC on Nov. 29, down 0.8% in the past 24 hours. Year-to-date, the cryptocurrency is down 3% and 28% from its all-time high of $126,080, reached on Oct. 6.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The upcoming tech enhancements, growing adoption among institutions and corporations, positive regulatory announcements and DAT mania might push Ethereum ETHUSD to $25,000, community enthusiast @FigoETH shares on X. Despite the fact that it needs a 733% rally to achieve this goal, it still looks realistic to @FigoETH, a vocal Ethereum ETHUSD proponent on X. For me personally 25k still basecase this cycle and don't think it's over: With all these upgrades, the Ethereum ETHUSD ecosystem might reach 10,000 transactions per second bandwidth on Layer 1 and up to 650,000 transactions per second on Layer 2s. Then, Tom Lee, a key figurehead of Bitmine, the biggest Ethereum DAT, keeps pushing optimism about its developments. As stressed by @FigoETH, besides monetary pressure, it generates a solid sentiment change: Last but not least, Alibaba, Sony, OpenAI, Deutsche Bank, Coinbase, Kraken, Robinhood and other corporations are either building on EVM L2s or considering switching to them. As such, an 8x upside would not be surprising, even given the controversial ETH price performance in 2025. At the same time, Ethereum OG whales continue sending their ETH to centralized exchanges. As per Lookonchain, $55 million worth of Ether was moved to Bitstamp today. An Ethereum OG just deposited another 18,000 $ETH($54.78M) into #Bitstamp 8 hours ago. As of press time, Ethereum's ETHUSD price has dipped below $3,000, being 2.64% down in 24 hours. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc. All rights reserved.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arthur Hayes, co-founder of crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX, said he expects most layer 1 blockchain coins outside Ethereum and Solana to fail, including Monad, a recently launched layer 1 backed by Coinbase Ventures. “I think pretty much every other L1 besides Ethereum or Solana is a zero,” said Hayes, speaking in an interview with Altcoin Daily. “And they're not going to do very well.” Hayes predicts Monad's MON will crash 99% as its valuation is inflated relative to fundamentals, making a deep drawdown likely. “I think it's going to be another bear chain. MON is trading at approximately $0.037, up 45% from its ICO price of $0.0254, CoinGecko data shows. The coin has achieved a market capitalization of around $398 million. According to Hayes, new L1 projects typically experience an initial price surge, driven by investors hoping to replicate early Ethereum gains. And people want to believe in the new L1 because everybody wants to invest in the new Ethereum, like they would have in 2014 when everyone missed it, me included,” Hayes noted, adding that initial hype doesn't translate to long-term viability, however. When asked which protocols would make up his “magnificent five” in crypto, Hayes pointed to Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, Zcash, and Ethena. He also added ZEC amid the recent price rally. According to Hayes, Ethereum will serve as the backbone for TradFi activity, with L2 solutions such as Arbitrum and Optimism helping to address privacy and scalability needs. He expects Ethereum's ecosystem to drive the next phase of adoption and price growth. Regarding Solana, Hayes noted its strong performance and status as the second-largest public L1, largely because of its previous rally to meme coin activity. However, he said that meme-driven growth has slowed and Solana now needs a new catalyst to sustain momentum. “I don't know what that new trick is. “Will it be enough to power price performance greater than Ethereum?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Looking for a crypto presale that could realistically hit 100×? You're not alone – investors are rotating capital fast and backing projects that actually solve something instead of just shouting on X. Here are three presales that are pulling ahead for one simple reason: their fundamentals match where the market narrative is going, which are, real-world utility, problem-solving tech, and a clear path to mass adoption. IPO Genie positions itself as the Web3 gateway for early-stage opportunities – curated, risk-screened, and accessible to everyday users. IPO Genie's tech stack leans on AI + smart contracts for automated screening, risk scoring, and transparent vesting. Think of it as a compliance-grade engine that removes the “guess” from early-stage investing. BlockDAG targets a growing category: fast, DAG-based blockchains designed for micro-transactions and developer-led ecosystems. It wants to be the place where dApps run without gas drama. BlockDAG is real tech, but it will need major ecosystem momentum to keep up with the chains already miles ahead. Its tech revolves around fast settlement, elastic supply distribution, and gamified reward systems. Bitcoin Hyper can gain traction quickly, but long-term value depends on consistent community engagement. Below is an investor-grade table comparing the three projects across market valuation, tokenomics, and quality/adoption potential. Let's be blunt: 100× doesn't happen by accident. If the market rotates back into utility-first projects, IPO Genie is positioned like an early-stage fintech token rather than another speculative asset. That's exactly the profile historically associated with outsized returns. If you're scanning the crypto presale landscape for projects with real-world traction, long-term token value, and multi-chain expansion, IPO Genie is the standout. Its mix of AI utility, governance, deflationary design, and mass-adoption potential makes it the most credible candidate for a serious rally – and the one presale worth getting in early.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>John Rapley is a contributing columnist for The Globe and Mail. After the influential New York Federal Reserve president made a speech last week suggesting he would support another interest rate cut, it appeared a majority on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had formed in favour of further easing. After a few weeks of turbulence, stock markets celebrated the expected return of easy money and re-entered party mode. Yet one asset class has largely sat out the rally so far – crypto. Bitcoin on thin ice after sinking in flight from risk That era ended when inflation spiked four years ago, and ever since central banks have been trying to extricate themselves from it. Once they began raising interest rates and mopping up the supply of money, crypto's days appeared numbered, and the price of bitcoin collapsed. At this point institutional investors and “crypto treasuries,” companies which sell shares to buy bitcoin, rushed in, and bitcoin reached an all-time high of over US$125,000. Some FOMC members, particularly those named by Mr. Trump, are pushing for a return to easy money, but others remain anxious about inflation. Second, it's become evident that the United States is now a two-speed economy. The surging stock market is making the rich richer, but ordinary people are feeling increasingly stressed by rising prices and declining wage growth. If we look past the headline figures on inflation to focus on the things that ordinary people consume, in particular groceries, there's evidence that the negative feelings people report about the economy to pollsters have a sound basis: for millions of Americans, things really are getting worse. This helps to explain President Donald Trump's sinking approval ratings and the poor performance of Republicans in recent elections. In particular, Mr. Trump's cozying up to tech oligarchs and his push against any form of AI regulation is polling very badly, not least among Republican voters. Markets have largely ignored the political risks to booming markets, but the recent victory of Zohran Mamdani in New York's mayoral election shows that popular sentiment is turning against Wall Street, oligarchs, and unrestrained AI. Finally, and related to this, Mr. Trump's deepening unpopularity, and the approaching midterm elections, appear to be weakening his authority. His abrupt volte-face on the Epstein files, and increasing criticism coming from within Republican ranks, suggest he may be losing the vice-like grip he has had over Republicans. Given that crypto's renaissance owes much to his patronage, it may be that investors are starting to doubt he will be able to lend the support he did over the last year. And if Mr. Trump can't save crypto, he probably couldn't block any AI clampdown that may be coming. For now, bitcoin is back off the canvas and is rising again, albeit well behind the major market indexes. A key moment may come at the next FOMC meeting in two weeks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This guide explores how these innovations are revolutionizing shipping, enhancing efficiency, and driving transparency—empowering industry professionals to stay ahead in a rapidly evolving sector. Traditionally, shipping operations relied on paper-based processes prone to errors and fraud. For instance, IoT-powered condition monitoring helps shipping companies preempt equipment failures, while smart containers ensure sensitive cargo—like pharmaceuticals—remains within required parameters throughout transit. Shipping generates massive amounts of data daily—from vessel movements to weather patterns. By transforming raw data into actionable insights, shipping companies can make informed decisions that boost efficiency and competitiveness. Globally, these technologies are leveling the playing field, allowing shipping companies—regardless of size or location—to compete in a digital-first marketplace. As digital transformation accelerates, maritime professionals must stay informed about emerging trends, best practices, and regulatory developments. By embracing blockchain, IoT, and big data, maritime stakeholders can unlock new levels of efficiency, transparency, and sustainability, ensuring they remain at the forefront of global trade.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You couldn't turn a corner without seeing another celebrity crypto endorsement," said Mark Hays, the Associate Director for Cryptocurrency and Financial Technology with AFR/AFREF and with Demand Progress during the NFRPP's October 25th, 2025, panel discussion. The discussion was moderated by Peter Coy, a freelance journalist covering economics, business, and finance. Celebrities like Kevin Hart, Gwyneth Paltrow, Madonna, Justin Bieber, Serena Williams, Paris Hilton, and Snoop Dogg jumped to endorse crypto-related companies. The record of these endorsements has been poor (Bloomberg), and some are calling for people who endorse these products without doing due diligence to face legal repercussions (Boston College Law Review). The message from the NFRPP's panel discussion was one of intense skepticism towards cryptocurrencies in general, with Professor Allen going so far as to call them a “failure as a technology.” And the key to that was there was one central database with one person minding the store.” And as Allen explained, cryptocurrencies use the blockchain as an evolution to this centralized ledger technology, so “cryptocurrency is a notation on a database [blockchain]. And if there is a recordation on there that you own something associated with that blockchain, then you own a piece of cryptocurrency.” Peter Coy noted that the concept of an entry in a ledger as the thing that records value is how all modern assets are recorded. “The deed to my house is also on a ledger somewhere. Whether that works in practice is something I think we're skeptical of,” said Allen. Coy recalled a quote that cryptocurrency is “like a laboratory for money because we are seeing the crypto people rediscover year by year all the lessons that were learned about regular money over centuries.” But as with many new technologies (AI was mentioned several times as being on a similar path), advocates argue that regulation will stifle the new industry; therefore, it should be left as unregulated as possible. So, does cryptocurrency work well as an alternate form of money? Allen noted that, because a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin has (in principle) only a fixed number of coins, it is, by design, deflationary. “Assuming that the fixed supply does remain fixed…think about it. If you know that your money will always buy more tomorrow than it will today, then that's encouragement not to spend it. And deflation is worse for economic conditions than inflation … that this is a deflationary currency … is a terrible idea.” Cryptocurrencies were shown not to be great as payment systems; they ended up being primarily (when used for legal purposes) an investment. Allen explained that it's not possible to be both. Once it became “clear that this wasn't going to work very well as a money or a payment… what it became was something that people bet on the value. So that's where the investment part of it came in. How about the rationale for crypto that creates a “trustless” currency, in which you can replace your “faith” in a central bank with technology (the blockchain). You're trusting whole other individuals, a place without transparency into who is running the show. You're just putting your trust in an unregulated system, and for so many reasons, including this privacy reason, I think that's a little bit of a scary thing to do.” The origin story of crypto and Bitcoin is built around the idea that we can never trust central banks, and there's certainly a lot of critique one can have about the central bank system. In our country today, many of the sovereign rights associated with currency are held by governments. And we can inform how money works through those government-issued currencies. The idea of having some global currency or some decentralized currency sounds attractive until you think about the reality of how crypto works, which is today, and likely in the future, it is not truly decentralized, and therefore it is just as subject to the same kinds of controlled wealthy interests that we see in our current financial system. You are essentially replacing one set of masters with another,” added Hays. Professor Allen noted that “crypto is being used to fund half of the North Korean nuclear program. The goal of all ransomware attacks is to target infrastructure. There was a spate of them in France, where people were having their fingers dismembered in kidnappings, trying to get access to crypto cold storage wallets. There are consequences when you operate in a space without laws.” If cryptocurrencies are not particularly useful as payment systems, it's worth asking why interest in them remains so high. Hays explained that “because crypto entities can find money from wealthy venture capital firms, which are often the seed funders for a lot of their platforms, …they can sort of literally print their own money. They spent a tremendous amount of money in the 2024 election cycle, targeting many different political figures, and soon found rapport with the Trump family and campaign. They spent more money than pretty much any other corporate entity in the 2024 elections.” With this information, as Hays says, it is then “up to people who are being asked to sign up for this new version of finance without really being told what's under the hood to call their policymakers to say, ‘Hey, I didn't sign up for this. ‘” Are we sure this is the right direction to go?'"

As housing costs continue to rise and first-time home purchases are being delayed more than ever, securing a mortgage at a competitive rate for a homebuyer is vital to making home ownership possible, which underscores the need for an accurate and comprehensive way to analyze borrowers' creditworthiness.

A powerful look at how the “welfare queen” myth—from Linda Taylor to modern AI deepfakes—racializes poverty, masks systemic corruption, and fuels political scapegoating. In 1974, Linda Taylor, a 47-year-old woman in Chicago, was indicted on 31 counts of fraud involving welfare, medical assistance, food stamps, and Social Security benefits. Though few knew her name, many came to know her as the “welfare queen”—a label first coined in a Rochester, New York newspaper and later amplified by Ronald Reagan on the campaign trail in 1976. Without naming her, Reagan described a woman who used 80 aliases to collect government benefits, claiming she earned $150,000 tax-free annually. Taylor became the symbol of a racialized myth: that Black women were exploiting government handouts. Reagan never mentioned Taylor's race, but he didn't need to. As Bryce Covert of The New Republic explains, the image of a fur-wearing woman in a Cadillac was unmistakably Black to many White Americans. Though 60% of AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) recipients were non-Black, media portrayals had racialized poverty. Taylor became a proxy for resentment toward Black Americans and public assistance. Electrician Gabriel Farías carries tools before starting work in San Diego, California. He takes a sip of coffee and shakes his head. Farías came to California several years ago and now works legally for a local company. He says the construction sector, already stretched thin, would collapse without immigrant labor. “Around midyear, you could already notice it,” he tells The Fulcrum. “Before, immigrants used to show up looking for work every day.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In barely over a decade, blockchain has slipped from obscure cryptographic experiment into the background machinery of modern life. Public blockchains record open networks of transactions; private and consortium chains knit together specific industries. Cryptocurrencies showed that value could be transferred without a central clearing house. Stablecoins added a bridge back to familiar fiat currencies, while decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols layered lending, trading, and yield strategies onto programmable smart contracts. That growth is driven by a simple promise: faster settlement, 24/7 markets, and transparent rules coded into contracts rather than buried in fine print. For ordinary users, these abstract structures appear as very concrete conveniences, with fast clearing of cross-border remittances and peer-to-peer payments freely flowing through mobile wallets. Businesses are exploring blockchain for end-to-end product traceability in the food, pharmaceutical, and luxury goods sectors, as well as for cross-company data sharing where no single firm controls the database. Market researchers estimate that the blockchain market in the media, advertising, and entertainment segment was worth roughly $1.5 bln in 2024, with projections above $18 bln by 2034 as rights management, digital collectibles, and fan engagement move transition on-chain. Within this broader shift, online casino operators are experimenting with blockchain rails and auditability in games. For players exploring keno morocco (Arabic: كينو المغرب), blockchain can make the experience more convenient. A platform that uses on-chain payments and verifiable random number generators can show when a ticket was recorded, how the draw was seeded, and when winnings were released, all without exposing personal banking details. Online casinos that adopt this model gain an advantage in terms of lower chargeback risk and faster settlement, as well as technical proof that the results have not been tampered with. When offers like Keno Maroc are built on blockchain rails, bettors can fund balances with stablecoins or other digital assets, track every wager in an immutable transaction list, and cash out to self-custodied wallets rather than leaving funds on a central platform. Players gain more control over their funds and clearer evidence that the game they enjoy is running as advertised. Fox Corporation's Verify platform, for example, records cryptographic signatures of news content on a blockchain so that it can be identified and licensed when AI models train on it. Axios Commentators in outlets like Wired argue that this kind of on-chain provenance may become a bulwark against deepfakes and invisible edits, restoring some of the trust that the early web once had. Still, public networks that rely on proof-of-work consume significant energy, thus prompting criticism from central banks and climate researchers. Enterprise projects can stumble over integration costs, regulatory uncertainty, and the sheer difficulty of coordinating many stakeholders. Blockchain has moved beyond the stage where it needs to shout its own name. Disclaimer: This is a paid post and should not be treated as news/advice.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Do not sell or share my personal information. Blockchain technology is often criticized for its exorbitant energy consumption, but the Algorand platform was created to address that. It's an energy-efficient blockchain designed to have the lowest possible environmental footprint. The industry's bad reputation mostly stems from one model: Proof-of-Work. As Sustainability Magazine explained, this is the method that forces powerful computers to solve complex math puzzles to secure the network. It's a process that "sucks a ton of electrical power from the grid," often from dirty fuels, per Sustainability Magazine. One report showed how bitcoin miners alone can consume more electricity than some nations. And it's not just energy; this model also creates mountains of e-waste from outdated hardware and relies on rare minerals, as the U.N. notes. But that's not the only way of doing things. Algorand, founded in 2019 by MIT's Silvio Micali, was designed specifically to fix this. Algorand uses a different method called Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS), which doesn't require all that energy-intensive computation. As a result, its "annualized CO2 use [is seven times] lower than Ethereum," Matt Keller of the Algorand Foundation told Sustainability Magazine. That Proof-of-Work model is a massive, well-known problem. The industry is "moving toward greener models," as Keller noted. Newer blockchains, like Algorand, were built to be energy-efficient. Unlock your next great adventure with a high-tech e-bike at an unbeatable price. Upway saves you up to 60% off retail prices from top-tier brands like Specialized, Aventon, Cannondale, and many more. It also offers new ways to finance clean energy. That's where "tokenization" comes in, allowing people to buy fractional ownership in renewable assets, such as a share of a solar farm. Marc Vanlerberghe of the Algorand Foundation told Sustainability Magazine it's a way to make sustainability claims "immutable, transparent, and verifiable." But here's what's really interesting: "tokenizing" renewable energy. Enel, a major global utility, partnered with Algorand to tokenize its renewable energy assets. This means people in apartments can buy tokens representing "fractional ownership" in a solar farm, letting them benefit from clean energy without installing panels. One firm, Farmway Technologies, is using blockchain to tokenize farmland in the Republic of Georgia. Another, Amadeus, is developing a "thinking blockchain" that redirects mining energy toward AI training. And Algorand's own model has already built a reputation for requiring drastically less energy to run. It's a clear example of the shift Keller described to Sustainability Magazine: The industry is definitely "moving toward greener models."
