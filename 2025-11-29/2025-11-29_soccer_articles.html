                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Adams celebrates his magnificent strike against Sunderland George Wood/Getty Images There was a point here when it even rained footballs. As the heavens dispensed and Sunderland's Stadium of Light turf soaked up the torrents, Tyler Adams lurched forward, looked up and let fly. Adams, of Bournemouth and the United States Men's National Team, does not score many goals. Before today, across over 338 games for club and country, he had managed just eight, with his first for Bournemouth only coming earlier this month. He might never score another like the ninth. It came midway through a frantic first half-hour in this tussle between the Premier League's seventh- and eighth-placed clubs. Bournemouth and Adams had already plundered an early away goal in weather which, on another day, would have been cause enough to draw the curtains, extinguish the lights and come back tomorrow. As it were, the rains played their part in the game's opener, with Sunderland's Nordi Mukiele taking a tumble in a move which ultimately ended with Amine Adli notching his first Bournemouth goal. It can be largely forgotten that defensive midfielders like him — deployed to stop goals rather than score them, and called upon to hinder rather than hurt — remain of supreme technical ability. Lumping and harrumphing through a game won't cut it here. It came down in a perfect parabola, nudged off its line only slightly by the fruitless fingertips of goalkeeper Robin Roefs, before returning to earth and sending both visiting team and fans into giddy disbelief. What an unreal goal this was by Tyler Adams for Bournemouth against Sunderland 🤯⚽️ pic.twitter.com/nYP3alBuIa THE USA'S OWN TYLER ADAMS SCORES AN ABSOLUTE WORLDIE! The strike was eventually measured as 47.4 yards out by Opta. That South Stand behind the goal is reserved for Sunderland's loudest fans, a ‘singing end' where most choose to remain on their feet rather than sit. Yet the combination of Adams' shot and Adli's earlier finish rendered them silent. Wearside has been an infertile territory for away sides this season, yet here, just 15 minutes in, Bournemouth were two in front. Goalkeepers who are beaten from almost their opponent's half of the field suffer a strange injustice: it is both mortifying and, often, not their fault. Roefs' flailing hands made a better attempt here than most would have, and there really was little else the Dutchman could have done. His starting position was apt to the situation; there are times when it is enough to acknowledge brilliance in opposition. By that point, though, Bournemouth head coach Andoni Iraola was unsurprisingly more concerned by the fact Adams' goal had been relegated to a notable subplot on a day where Sunderland roared back from two down to claim victory — and in doing so meted out a third consecutive away defeat to Iraola's side. If his manager's comments seem understated, then they rather reflect the important wider context. That honour, once again, went to the hosts. Three and a half months into their Premier League return, Sunderland remain unbeaten on home turf. Chris Weatherspoon  is a Football Finance Writer for The Athletic UK.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid head coach Xabi Alonso insists he has a “very good relationship” with midfielder Jude Bellingham amid speculation suggesting there is growing tension between the pair. The Spaniard is adamant he has no issues with the England international, who has been in fine form since returning from the shoulder injury which disrupted his 2025-26 campaign. Missing a large part of the opening period of the season, Bellingham made his return to La Liga in Real's 2-0 victory over Espanyol on 20 September, emerging from the substitutes bench as goals from Eder Militao and Kylian Mbappe earned all three points for Alonso's men. Former Birmingham City ace Bellingham has since been in good goalscoring form for Los Blancos, scoring the winner in October's Clasico victory over rivals Barcelona before netting a last-gasp equaliser in the 2-2 draw with Elche last weekend. However, while Bellingham has impressed in his first few matches under Alonso's stewardship, Spanish publication Mundo Deportivo reported earlier in the week that there is believed to be friction between the two. The report claims midfielder Federico Valverde and forwards Rodrygo and Endrick are also unhappy with ex-Bayer Leverkusen boss Alonso, who took over the reins from Carlo Ancelotti in the summer. But ahead of Real's trip to Girona in the league on Sunday, Alonso has rubbished the talk surrounding his communication with Bellingham, saying their private conversations remain healthy. When asked if he had any problems with Bellingham, Alonso said: “Absolutely not. I have excellent communication and a very good relationship with Jude. “I like players who are curious and proactive enough to come and ask what we can do better. He fits in with different profiles and heights because he's very well-rounded, and we also need to be aware of what's going on around him.” This is not the first time Alonso has had to come out and clarify his relationship with a player, having also faced questions over his decision to start Vinicius on the bench for Real's trip to Elche. We've done it before, like in Getafe. Today we're not happy, but everyone is eager to get back on track.” Insisting he and the rest of the Real squad are growing closer, he added: “We haven't fallen apart. We're still competing; the context of each match is different. We need to turn this situation around, starting with Athens [against Olympiacos].” Alonso's side lost their place at the summit following Barcelona's 3-1 victory over Alaves at Spotify Camp Nou on Saturday, with midfielder Dani Olmo scoring twice for Hansi Flick's men. Warming up for their trip to Girona with a 4-3 win over Olympiacos in the Champions League in midweek, Real are looking to find form in La Liga after drawing their last two games against Rayo Vallecano and Elche, respectively. When an organisation falters even slightly, it makes things a bit more difficult.</p>

United States men's national team midfielder Tyler Adams scored one of the best goals in the Premier League this season when he lobbed the goalkeeper from nearly 50 yards (meters) for Bournemouth on Saturday.

In the 15th minute of a match at Sunderland, Adams collected a loose ball inside his own half, crossed the halfway line and then sent in a shot from the edge of the center circle. It flew over the head of goalkeeper Robin Roefs, who tumbled into the net after scrambling backward, and into the goal at a rainy Stadium of Light.

Goalkeeper Tim Howard is the only player from the U.S. men's team who has scored from further out in the Premier League, according to stats company Opta. That was in 2012, when Howard's clearance from his own area for Everton against Bolton bounced once and into the net.

The goal increased Bournemouth's lead to 2-0 at the time and was Adams' second in his last four games, with the midfielder having also netted at Manchester City on Nov. 2.

Adams, who captained the Americans at the 2022 World Cup, hadn't previously scored for Bournemouth, which he joined in August 2023, or in his one other season in the Premier League — at Leeds in the 2022-23 campaign.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Indeed, TEAMtalk insider Fraser Fletcher has been right on top of Celtic‘s search to replace Brendan Rodgers from the beginning, especially when it comes to their interest in Nancy. Indeed, Football Insider‘s Pete O'Rourke reports that Celtic may look to bring some of Nancy's Columbus Crew players to Parkhead in January, with a move for striker Wessam Abou Ali appearing realistic. The Bhoys are in need of attacking reinforcements following hamstring injuries to Kelechi Iheanacho and Callum Osmand, with Nancy ready to prioritise a striker swoop in the winter window. Prior to his MLS switch, the Palestine international made headlines at the Club World Cup, scoring a 51-minute hat-trick for Al-Ahli in a 4-4 draw with Portuguese giants Porto. Celtic may, however, need to raise funds to secure a significant signing in January, with the sale of Japan international Daizen Maeda a distinct possibility. TEAMtalk have previously reported how Maeda has asked for a January exit, with clubs in the Premier League keen on his services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2026 World Cup draw is coming up in Washington DC on Friday, December 5 and countries around the globe will be waiting anxiously to find out who they will face next summer across the USA, Mexico and Canada. MORE — Watch 2026 World Cup live with Pro Soccer Talk You can watch the draw live en Espanol on Telemundo and on Peacock here, while the Pro Soccer Talk crew will be hosting a live Watchalong show to break down the draw as it's happening, here. No teams from the same region can be drawn into the same group, except from UEFA as a maximum of two European teams can be in the same group. The obvious ones are whether Lionel Messi and Argentina will win back-to-back World Cup titles as he aims to call time on his international career (surely) in the best way possible. While the other big storyline swirling is around Cristiano Ronaldo, 40, and if he can win the one trophy which has evaded him during his legendary career, as he aims to lead his beloved Portugal to their first-ever World Cup title. Elsewhere the hosts are all hopeful of going on deep runs as the USA, Mexico and Canada all play their three group stage games on home soil and that should give them a huge advantage as all three have the potential to reach the quarterfinals, at least... There are also the likes of Norway, Scotland and Austria qualifying for the first time in 28 years and all three European nations could go on a deep run if the draw is favorable. And fairytales are alive and well at this competition as the expanded format has allowed for Uzbekistan, Jordan, Curacao and Cape Verde to qualify for their first-ever World Cup, while Haiti has qualified for just the second time. There is a huge hope there will be massive upsets and Cinderella runs at this tournament as the expanded format has given so many new nations a chance to compete in the World Cup. Pot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, South Korea, Ecuador, Austria, Australia Pot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa When you look at the pots above, there are a few “Group of Death” scenarios for some ridiculously tough groups. The obvious one is: Argentina, Croatia, Norway and Ghana. Another would be Spain, Morocco, Egypt and Italy (if they win in the playoffs). Basically, nobody wants to draw Croatia, Morocco or Norway and with the expanded format there is now the very real possibility we will have “Groups of Death” for the first-time ever in a World Cup tournament.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you're thinking about checking out the FIFA World Cup in 2026, but are unsure where to catch a game, you're spoiled for choice. With 16 host cities across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, there are a lot of options to choose from. The U.S. alone will host FIFA World Cup matches in 11 major cities, including Los Angeles, Seattle, Miami, Boston, and Atlanta. The City of Brotherly Love is known for taking sports seriously and welcoming travelers with open arms. So, how can you buy tickets for the World Cup games in Philadelphia? How long should you stay in Philly during the tournament? Six FIFA World Cup 2026 games will take place in Philadelphia between June and July 2026. When purchasing official travel packages and FIFA World Cup tickets for 2026, you need to buy them through the official FIFA website. Here, you can find tickets for all games and hospitality packages. These include packages where you can get several match tickets in one city, ones that allow you to follow your team around the continent. There's only one more sale window left, which is in December 2025. Once you get an access link or code, it's first-come, first-served. Over a million tickets have already been sold in previous windows, and as this is the first World Cup to use dynamic pricing (a controversial decision), prices are surging as soon as the selling windows open, so you need to be quick. This has an extra 15% fee for buyers and sellers, but it may be cheaper once the initial demand calms down. Don't purchase tickets from touts or scalpers, as they may not be genuine, and you'll likely be paying way over the odds. Many countries can get visa-free access to the U.S. by applying online for an ESTA. This lasts for two years, allows you to visit the U.S. for up to 90 days at a time, and costs just $21. It can take 4 to 6 weeks to get a B-2 tourist visa after you've completed your online application form and attended an interview at your local embassy or consulate. Keep in mind that it can take months to get an embassy appointment, depending on your country, so start this process early. However, Donald Trump has recently announced the launch of the FIFA prioritized appointment scheduling system, or the FIFA Pass, which allows international fans with a ticket for a FIFA match to receive priority for their visa appointment. Some fans from countries that have already qualified for the World Cup will not be allowed to attend matches in the U.S. That's because the U.S. has a list of countries whose citizens are banned from entering. Special allowances have been made for the teams and their staff, but fans from these nations will still be banned from entering and attending. When planning your Philadelphia World Cup travel itinerary, it's usually best to give yourself at least two days before the first match. This gives you time to recover from jet lag, especially if you are traveling from overseas, and get your bearings in the city. Overall, deciding how many days for a World Cup trip will depend on how many games you want to see. In Philadelphia, the shortest gap between games is just two days, so you can easily see multiple matches in one trip. You can also reach Philadelphia sustainably and on a budget with FlixBus. You can find the local buses, regional rail, subway, and trolley system on the SEPTA transport app to make things easier. Philadelphia's metro card is the SEPTA Key Card, which you can purchase and reload from kiosks around the city for tap-and-go payments. Alternatively, SEPTA accepts contactless payments, including Apple and Google Pay, across the bus, Metro, and regional rail services, except for routes to or from New Jersey. If you need a SIM card to get online to access the SEPTA app or any other transport tools, you can buy one from convenience stores at the airport or around Philadelphia. If you're looking for game day transportation, SEPTA is well-connected to Lincoln Financial Field. From here, it's a short walk to the stadium. Well, whether you want the best hotels near Lincoln Financial Field or budget accommodation in Philadelphia, there are plenty of options to choose from. If you want to stay near the World Cup stadium in Philadelphia, you need to stay in South Philadelphia. South Philly is traditionally an Italian area, so there are plenty of great places to eat, and the love of soccer during the World Cup will run deep here. This is the area near Independence Hall, known for its cobblestone streets, nightlife spots, and boutique eateries. If you want to be within walking distance of key sights when games aren't being played, the Old City is an ideal base. As the fan zone is on Lemon Hill in East Fairmount Park, you're within walking distance of green spaces, cozy cafés, and museums. If you want a nightlife district, opt for the Northern Liberties area. This is your classic old industrial area that's been gentrified by hipsters, so you can find great breweries, bars, restaurants, and galleries around here. It's also bordering Fishtown, which is known for its street art, great community, and awesome music venues. This is realistically the only hotel within walking distance. Otherwise, you're best staying in downtown Philadelphia, near the attractions and good public transport connections. For luxury options, head to the upscale neighborhood of Rittenhouse Square. Both are great options in a high-end district, close to public transport links. For mid-range 4-star fan accommodations, check out the Kimpton Hotel Monaco Philadelphia in the Old City with a peak location next to Independence Hall. Alternatively, stay at ROOST East Market in Center City for more of an apartment hotel option. If you're looking for a budget option, the Apple Hostel of Philadelphia in the Old City is well-located and well-rated. It's also German and Canadian-owned, so during the World Cup, you know the rivalry and sporting atmosphere will be thriving. There really is no shortage of things to do in Philadelphia. Some of the must-see places in Philadelphia include: Local experiences in Philadelphia include visiting Philadelphia's Magic Gardens, a beautifully mosaicked area on South Street, before heading to Washington Square Park. Popular spots include Jim's South Street, Dalessandro's, and Angelo's; however, if you get talking with a local, ask for their recommendation. Another key spot is the incredible Italian Market. This is the world's oldest and largest outdoor market, so it's a must for foodies. These are often well worth it as you'll not only see key sights, but hear stories that bring the locations to life. Of course, if you visit the iconic Philadelphia Museum of Art, you'll also find yourself at the famous Rocky steps. The chocolate-filled theme park is home to rides, entertainment, tasty treats, and more. For more of a relaxing day trip from Philadelphia, check out Longwood Gardens with over 1,100 acres of gardens and conservatories to explore. If you need a weekend escape, the Pocono Mountains are popular for hiking, camping, and romantic getaways in nature. The World Cup venue for 2026 in Philadelphia is Lincoln Financial Field. As part of our World Cup stadium guide, here are some Lincoln Financial Field facts to keep you informed during your trip. So, how does Lincoln Financial Field compare to the other host city stadiums? It's worth noting that FIFA World Cup guidelines state that stadiums need a minimum capacity of 40,000 seats and have to have at least 60,000 to host a semi-final or final. For the Philadelphia fan zone, head to Lemon Hill in East Fairmount Park. When you're figuring out what to bring to World Cup matches, remember to check emails from FIFA or Lincoln Financial Field for stadium entry tips, prohibited items, and things that are going on around the city. Remember that Philadelphia in the summer can get hot and humid, so wear breathable layers and bring a water bottle with you to stay hydrated. So, how much does it cost to attend the World Cup? The tickets for a Philadelphia group game start from $60. That's before you add in accommodation, transport, flights, and food. While you can get cheap food and transport around Philadelphia, finding an affordable hotel could be tricky. If you can, stay slightly further out of the main city. The accommodation is where you can save money. As with any major city, travel safety in Philadelphia is a concern for many tourists. Philly does have a reputation for not being the safest city in the U.S., despite seeing a consistent drop in crime since 2021. Whether that's people you're traveling with or other fans, groups are less of a target. As with any big city, be wary when walking around at night and don't wear a lot of flashy jewelry or tech that makes you more of a target. With there being so many more people in the city for the World Cup, expect more scams and petty theft, so be vigilant, know how you're getting home, and be sensible. In terms of local customs and etiquette, avoid calling Center City "downtown", don't compare New York and Philadelphia, and don't hold up lines at a cheesesteak place with indecision — know what you're ordering before you reach the front. Let's round out this guide with a few World Cup travel FAQs. How many World Cup games are being played in Philadelphia? There are six World Cup games being played in Philadelphia. This breaks down as five group games and one Round of 16 game. Where are the World Cup games being held in Philadelphia? Is Philadelphia a good city for watching soccer? Philadelphia is a great city for watching soccer with the Philadelphia Union MLS team, and huge soccer pubs like Tir na nOg, the Black Sheep Pub, the Plough & Stars, and Brauhaus Schmitz. Philadelphia is also generally a great city for watching any kind of sport. No, you do not need to drive in Philadelphia. So, for our final travel tips for the World Cup 2026, remember to pack your team's colors, bring plenty of water with you, and embrace the chaotic, passionate sporting vibe of Philadelphia. On your fan travel checklist, remember to pack plenty of breathable fabrics for Philly heat and comfy sneakers for all the walking you're going to do around the main sights.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ORLANDO, Fla. – The U.S. Women's National Team is turning fast starts into an art form. The fourth and latest came Nov. 28 versus Italy in Orlando. Lavelle assisted midfielder Olivia Moultrie's fearless finish merely 67 seconds after the opening kickoff. It's an incredible feat, but to say the USWNT is relying on fast starts wouldn't be telling the whole story. Yes, the team is starting matches on the front foot, and reaping those rewards with goals, but U.S. head coach Emma Hayes' squad is also aiming to build something more sustainable. Hayes seeks more than a flash of lightning – she wants her team to light up the whole sky and shine for a long time to come. “My goal is always to create successive, competitive teams,” Hayes said. “Not just one (team) and then you have to rebuild again over another four-year period. To do so means not only starting aggressively but also keeping up a high, competitive level throughout 90 minutes, and then consistency from game-to-game, year-to-year. Whether it was midfielder Sam Coffey, who assisted forward Catarina Macario's first goal of her brace, accelerating to intercept the ball in the midfield or fullback Emily Fox swiftly hustling to track back for a fleet-footed tackle or center back Naomi Girma recovering heroically to snuff out an Italian breakaway or Dickey making a massive save when tested, the effort and mindset on the defensive side of the ball was instrumental to Friday's win. “Starting fast is one thing, but we've often started fast and conceded just as quickly, so a clean sheet means as much to us this evening as the result and the performance,” Hayes said in her post-match press conference. Because of that balance, shown against a high-quality opponent, the performance was impressive for a U.S. Women's National Team that has spent 2025 rotating players and growing under Hayes. The USWNT's 2025 campaign has seen breakout performances along with first caps and young or inexperienced lineups. While Moultrie is a young player on the rise, Macario is not so much breaking out – showing her talent since she debuted in 2021 when she scored her first international goal – but finding consistency after a stint of starts and stops due to injury. “I'm very proud and happy at the fact that this was the first year in nearly three years I've been available for nearly every game, every training,” Macario said. Chicago Stars forward Jameese Joseph and Washington Spirit defender Kate Wiesner entered the match as substitutes to earn their first caps for the senior team. “I want to give opportunities to players that are not only deserving of it, but they develop the experiences that might be needed whenever we need them,” Hayes said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fans hoping to watch the men's soccer World Cup championship game live and in person next year may want to take out a personal loan for $200,000. Tickets don't go on sale to the general public until Dec. 11. In addition to unfettered field views, the suite tickets provide you and your guests with preferred entry, direct seating access, a private bathroom, champagne upon arrival, and dedicated food and beverage service throughout the game. By comparison, this upcoming Super Bowl's most expensive ticket for this year's big game in San Francisco runs nearly $27,000, while the most expensive tickets for the European UEFA Champions League's final match are priced around $35,000, according to data analyzed by SeatPick, a platform that tracks and aggregates resale tickets across the market. The starting price for World Cup Final tickets is $5,867. Even the average World Cup Final ticket price — at nearly $13,000 — is still significantly more expensive than the average Super Bowl ticket, which is around $8,400. “Ticket prices for the 2026 FIFA World Cup are already reaching record highs, which comes as no surprise, given the extraordinary global demand and limited ticket availability,” offered SeatPick CEO Gilad Zilberman. “With such a unique tournament spread across the United States, Canada and Mexico, and hosted in some of the world's most modern stadiums, higher pricing levels are almost inevitable.” Zilberman said the strong resale demand for these events shows just how much anticipation surrounds them. “While the elevated prices may be challenging for some fans, they also demonstrate the scale of enthusiasm and global appeal that only the World Cup can generate,” Zilberman said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A lingering injury has seen U.S. men's national team star left back Antonee Robinson play just four games in 2025–26, but recent developments in his recovery have left Robinson feeling confident about being fully ready to represent the Stars and Stripes in the 2026 World Cup. Robinson underwent knee surgery back in May. Initially the procedure was thought to be minor but the recovery process has been full of setbacks and the left back has played just 151 minutes for Fulham this season. Back in October, he was forced to withdraw from the USMNT camp due to his nagging knee issues. Despite the nightmare start of the term, there's growing optimism that Robinson could return sooner rather than later. However, the England-born U.S. international is now feeling confident about being fully recovered by the time Mauricio Pochettino announces his next USMNT roster for the March 2026 international friendlies. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC. “I'd say, well obviously a great World Cup would be winning it,” Robinson told the U.S. Soccer podcast. “Being able to set ourselves up in history. First time we win the World Cup as a men's team, being able to win it on home soil, it would be something that feels like you can't write it. Being able to add yourself in history like that, it'd be something that would be really special to me and all of us. “It'll just be the whole team just trying to do whatever we can to make sure we win each game. I don't care if we play terrible soccer the whole time and manage to win. Despite his lengthy absence, if he manages to recover in time, Robinson is a lock to be part of Pochettino's USMNT World Cup roster and would even be a likely starter in the Stars and Stripes' quest for a maiden World Cup triumph.

President Donald Trump discusses meeting with FIFA World Cup 2026 Task Force and vows to make the event an 'unprecedented success.' Iran opted not to attend the event, because the United States denied visas to members of its delegation, the state-run IRNA news agency reported on Friday. The agency quoted Iranian soccer federation spokesman Amir-Mahdi Alavi as saying that officials faced visa obstacles that go beyond sports considerations. Alavi said the federation had reached out to FIFA and hoped it could help resolve the issue. Iran's players celebrate after the FIFA World Cup 2026 Asia zone qualifiers group A football match between Iran and Uzbekistan, on March 25, 2025, in Tehran. President Donald Trump's administration announced in June a travel ban on citizens from 12 countries, including Iran. Exemptions, however, were promised for "any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, traveling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the secretary of state." The White House did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. The Iranian delegation would have been expected to be led by its soccer federation president Mehdi Taj, one of the most senior officials in Asian soccer and a member of two FIFA committees that have oversight of the World Cup. He is one of the vice presidents of the Asian Football Confederation and a member of FIFA panels with responsibility for the ruling body's competitions, plus men's national team soccer in general. FIFA President Gianni Infantino answers questions during a 2026 soccer World Cup news conference Thursday, June 16, 2022, in New York. A record 48 teams will participate in the June 11-July 19 World Cup co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Six of the teams will be determined next March. The first will be at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City. Games will also be played in the Boston area, but Trump has threatened to take games out of Foxoborough, Massachusetts if "there's unsafe conditions." Trump made the suggestion while taking questions from the media during a meeting with Argentinian President Javier Milei at the White House, threatening to call FIFA President Gianni Infantino to have the games moved to cities that do cooperate, citing safety concerns.

"The answer is yes, if somebody's doing a bad job, and if I feel there's unsafe conditions, I would call Gianni, the head of FIFA, who's phenomenal, and I would say, ‘Let's move it to another location,' and he would do that. And this is the right time to do it." Boston is currently set to host seven matches when the World Cup comes to North America next summer. The slate includes five group-stage games, one Round of 32 fixture and the first quarterfinal on July 9. Fox News' Jackson Thompson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The USWNT combined their signature brand of dynamic offence with some equally potent defence to notch a shutout win over Italy on Friday (28 November). The United States Women's National Team (USWNT) earned their third straight victory in an international football friendly on Friday (28 November), besting Italy 3-0 in Orlando, Florida. The five-time Olympic champions looked confident and composed as they took to the pitch against Italy for the first time since 2010, attempting to build on wins over Portugal and New Zealand in late October. Olivia Multrie set the tone for a one-sided contest early on, converting a perfectly timed cross from Rose LaVelle in the second minute to give the U.S. lead. Italy did come close to levelling the score when Chiara Beccari went one-on-one with Naomi Girma, but a turn of speed from the defensive star foiled the Italian forward's attempt on goal. Catarina Macario further solidified her side's lead in the second half, when she converted on a cross from Sam Coffey in the 64th minute. It wasn't long before she was celebrating with her teammates again, as she fired a shot from distance into the goal at the 76th minute. As the U.S. continued to control possession, Italy found themselves outplayed and outclassed. Both sides will have a few days to recover and strategise, before gearing up for the second match of their double-header on Monday (1 December). ⚽ Relive the best football moments from Paris 2024 🏅</p>

The United States women's national team had a post-Thanksgiving feast when they defeated Italy on Friday, 3-0, with goals by Olivia Moultrie and Catarina Macario. Moultrie's goal came just two minutes in, while Macario scored in the 64th and 76th minute to cement the lopsided scoreline. The Stars and Stripes got off to a quick start to their two-game series with Moultrie putting this effort away with a well-placed, one-time shot into the right side of the goal: Things we are thankful for: This goal USWNT x @VW pic.twitter.com/dYY04VHK1P We had a really good weekend training, so I feel like it just kind of flowed into the first minutes of the game," Moultrie told the broadcast about her goal at halftime. The 20-year-old Moultrie has been in top form for club and country recently. She played 28 games for Portland Thorns FC and had a surge in the second half of the year, scoring seven goals in her final 15 club games. The European side took advantage of some set-piece defending and quick thinking, and very nearly had a breakaway, but defender Naomi Girma came up with massive defensive play. In true Emma Hayes tradition, the manager wanted her team to sort things out before making any additional changes. The tactics paid off when the insurance goal came by way of a combination between midfielder Sam Coffey and forward Macario.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran will not be in attendance for the 2026 World Cup draw in Washington D.C. next week after members of its delegation were reportedly denied visas. Iran soccer federation spokesman Amir-Mahdi Alavi was reportedly quoted as saying the federation reached out to FIFA for assistance. The visa denials come after months of speculation that President Donald Trump's travel bans could interfere with some of the most high-profile sporting events in the world, including next year's World Cup and the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. In June, the Trump administration announced a full denial of entry for 12 countries, one of them Iran, and partial denial for another seven countries. The June ban, however, specifically includes a carveout for "any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, traveling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the Secretary of State." This matter has come up before, just in less notable events. A senior Little League team from Venezuela, one of the seven partially banned countries, was denied entry in July for a tournament and had to be replaced by a team from Mexico and a Cuban volleyball team was unable to participate in a tournament under similar circumstances. Barring further boycott action, Iran is set to compete in its seventh World Cup and fourth straight after officially qualifying in March. The AP notes its federation president Mehdi Taj is one of the most senior officials in Asian soccer and a member of two FIFA committees that have oversight of the World Cup. The 2026 World Cup is scheduled to kick off June 11, with matches hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico.</p>
