                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump endorsed right-wing presidential candidate Nasry “Tito” Asfura and smeared his progressive opponent Rixi Moncada. If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation. The US Congressional Progressive Caucus on Friday accused President Donald Trump of “flagrantly interfering” in Honduras' upcoming presidential election after Trump announced his endorsement of right-wing candidate Nasry “Tito” Asfura and repeated threats he's made previously ahead of other electoral contests in which he sought to secure a conservative win. He added that a loss for the right-wing candidate would allow Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro “and his Narcoterrorists [to] take over another country like they have taken over Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.” The president also wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, that “if [Asfura] doesn't win, the US will not be throwing good money after bad,” repeating a comment he made during New York City's mayoral election in which he urged voters to reject progressive candidate Zohran Mamdani or risk losing federal aid for the city. Trump also offered Argentina a $40 billion bailout if voters elected his ally, Javier Milei, earlier this year. The poverty rate has also been reduced by about 13% since Castro took office in 2021, although, as the outlet reported, some rights advocates have criticized Castro's government for keeping “many of her predecessor's militarized policies in place, despite her commitment to implement a more community-minded strategy.” Trump added in his social media post that he was issuing a pardon to former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who represented the National Party and is currently serving a 45-year prison sentence in the US after being convicted of working with drug traffickers who paid bribes to ensure more than 400 tons of cocaine were sent to the US. CPC Deputy Chair Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Whip Jesús “Chuy” García (D-Ill.) called Trump's “smearing” of Asfura's opponents “completely unacceptable,” and noted that the president has been joined by other congressional Republicans in making “wild, unsubstantiated allegations” regarding Honduras' election — including Rep. María Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.), who voiced “support for a military coup.” “We also cannot tolerate premature declarations by prominent US politicians regarding the election results before ballots are fully counted. The two progressive leaders were echoing concerns brought up by Honduran Vice Foreign Minister Gerardo Torres, who spoke at a gathering of left-wing leaders on Thursday in Tegucigalpa. “Even Trump could congratulate him — and that's when real trouble will erupt in this country,” said Torres. “At a time of global democratic fragility, we must move beyond US bullying and political interference in Honduras's sovereign affairs. “There are even people who went to look at a map to see where Honduras is and find out who Rixi Moncada is… It puts us in an important position, which creates a wonderful scenario, because Rixi's victory will be more famous and important. Torres added that many conservative voters in Honduras are likely to reject the party formerly led by Hernández. “It's a discourse that doesn't really land, in my view,” López told the outlet. “I think what can move votes is the economic issue, because historically one of the main problems identified in public opinion polls is unemployment and lack of economic opportunities.” As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares. President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal and military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov on Nov. 29 and ordered a revision of Ukraine's core defense documents. The move comes as Russia intensifies offensive operations in Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk oblasts, while Kyiv prepares for crucial negotiations with the U.S. on ending Russia's war. "It is time to update the fundamental defense documents of Ukraine," Zelensky said. Zelensky said the government and Defense Ministry must fully fund drone purchases, a priority as Ukraine leans heavily on unmanned systems to offset Russia's advantages in manpower and firepower. Budanov, part of a delegation led by National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov, is expected to meet senior U.S. officials in the coming days. Zelensky said Budanov briefed him on the security and political landscape surrounding Ukraine and outlined several points critical to the upcoming talks. He also met with Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov on Nov. 29. Yermak stepped down after the National Anti-Corruption Bureau searched his property on Nov. 28 as part of a major probe into embezzlement at state nuclear operator Energoatom. Lawmakers expect Zelensky to name a new chief of staff soon. Yaroslav Zheleznyak, a lawmaker from the opposition Holos party, told the Kyiv Independent that four candidates are under discussion: Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko, Fedorov, Budanov, and Shmyhal. He said Shmyhal appears to be the strongest contender. Tim Zadorozhnyy is the reporter for the Kyiv Independent, specializing in foreign policy, U.S.-Ukraine relations, and political developments across Europe and Russia. The leaders will discuss "the conditions of a just and durable peace" in Ukraine, according to French President Emmanuel Macron's office. The operation targeted ships that, according to the source, could have transported nearly $70 million worth of oil and helped Moscow bypass international sanctions. Ukraine's military reportedly struck one of southern Russia's largest oil refineries overnight on Nov. 29, Russian Telegram media channels reported. "I'm going to the front and am prepared for any reprisals... I am an honest and decent person," Former Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak said. Orban reiterated his readiness to hold the peace talks on Ukraine in Hungary, even as plans for a summit in Budapest between Putin and Trump have been scrapped. Vasyl Verameichyk, a Belarusian soldier who previously served as a volunteer fighter for Ukraine, was sentenced to 13 years in prison in Belarus, independent outlet Belsat reported on Nov. 28. Andriy Yermak, head of the President's Office, submitted his resignation following searches by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) at his premises earlier on Nov. 28, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Exit of Zelenskyy's most powerful aide could also have impact on Kyiv's negotiating position in talks over ending war Ukraine's political system is bracing for a “mini-revolution” as the county's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is forced to adapt to life without his closest adviser, chief enforcer and most loyal associate, Andriy Yermak, who resigned on Friday after his apartment was searched as part of a widening anti-corruption probe. Yermak's resignation could have tremendous consequences for domestic governance, as well as for Ukraine's negotiating position in talks over ending the war with Russia, where he had served as the head of Ukraine's delegation to peace talks with the White House. Yermak, a former intellectual property lawyer, became a B-movie producer and then lawyer for Zelenskyy's production company, back when Zelenskyy was still an actor. When his friend won victory in the 2019 presidential election, Yermak went with him into politics, first as a foreign policy adviser and then, a year later, as chief of staff. He ran the most sensitive tracks of Ukraine's foreign policy, speaking regularly with national security advisers from allied countries and was in charge of the team working on peace negotiations. Additionally, his role as a hate figure often helped to protect Zelenskyy. Even as Yermak's apartment was searched on Friday, few expected it to push him out of office, as a broad understanding had developed that Zelenskyy was unlikely to sacrifice his most trusted aide at any cost. Although Yermak has not been charged with anything at this point, the anti-corruption investigation threatened to dominate the news agenda and lead to a full-blown crisis, amid growing public discontent over corruption. Zelenskyy's approval rating had already taken a severe hit over the scandal. On Saturday, the Ukrainska Pravda outlet reported via sources that investigators had seized several laptops and mobile phones from Yermak's apartment for analysis. “For Zelenskyy, it would have been a hard decision to take, he understood the political need but was psychologically dependent on Yermak,” said Fesenko, who suggested it was most likely that Yermak's resignation had been his own decision and not a case of Zelenskyy ordering him to go. “I think Yermak understood that if he goes down, he'll bring Zelenskyy down with him, and decided to sacrifice himself to save Zelenskyy.” Yermak was widely believed to control a network of Telegram channels that poured dirt on those who crossed him, and was known for the ferocious policing of access to Zelenskyy. One of those who has managed to push back is the longstanding military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov, who has survived several reported Yermak-led attempts to fire him. This could prove challenging for a weakened Zelenskyy, especially if further revelations follow from the corruption investigation. Alternatively, it could give his presidency, already extended by more than a year from its planned endpoint because of the impossibility of holding elections during martial law, the influx of fresh ideas and more consensual decision-making that many have been calling for.</p>

ASTANA, November 29. /TASS/. Kazakhstan has urgently sent oil exports via alternative routes after an attack on the Caspian pipeline, the Energy Ministry said.

"To minimize negative consequences and maintain production rates at large fields, the ministry has urgently activated a plan to redirect oil exports to alternative routes. The situation is under special control of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan," the ministry said in a statement.

A night attack of unmanned boats rendered further operation of one of the CPC outrigger mooring devices at the marine terminal near Novorossiysk impossible.

CPC carries oil from three large Kazakh fields: Tengiz, Kashagan, Karachaganak. In 2024, it transshipped about 63 million tons of oil.

Foreign shippers, including Tengizchevroil (a subsidiary of American Chevron), ExxonMobil, Kazmunaygas, Eni and Shell, account for about 74% of the volume.</p>

Their hands were raised, they posed no threat, and Israeli soldiers murdered them anyway. The Israeli army and border police said in a joint statement on Friday that Israeli troops “operated to apprehend wanted individuals” allegedly affiliated with a resistance network in the Jenin area, and that after they exited, “fire was directed toward the suspects.” Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, under whose jurisdiction the border police operates, voiced his “total support” for the Israeli soldiers in question, asserting that they “acted exactly as expected of them: terrorists must die.” While the latest killing in Jenin was caught on video, Palestinians have remarked that it is not an isolated incident. In 2022, the Palestinian Human Rights Association documented 38 cases of the arbitrary killing of Palestinians by Israeli forces between August 1 and November 4. The operation comes almost a year after Israel's previous “Iron Wall” offensive in the northern West Bank, during which Israeli forces displaced over 40,000 Palestinians from their homes in refugee camps in Jenin and Tulkarem. Jenin city and its adjacent refugee camp have been at the center of Israeli military raids since late 2021, as it became the center of Palestinian armed resistance groups that formed groups such as the Jenin Brigade. After October 2023, Israel launched a protracted military campaign to dismantle those groups. As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

MOSCOW, November 29. /TASS/. Russia and the United States carry on with their dialogue, and the US side perceives the situation around the Ukrainian conflict more adequately compared to Europe, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said on Saturday.

"We proceed from the fact that the US administration pursues a common-sense approach under present-day conditions and perceives the situation [around Ukraine] more adequately compared to their European allies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian underwater drones have struck two tankers belonging to Russia's so-called shadow fleet in the Black Sea, according to an official in Ukraine's security services (SBU). A Ukrainian security source told CNN that Sea Baby maritime drones had been used in a joint operation by the SBU and the navy. There was no immediate comment from Russia. Both tankers sustained critical damage, the source said, and were effectively taken out of service. “This will deal a significant blow to the transportation of Russian oil.” The Gambian-flagged tanker Virat was attacked again on Saturday, after first sustaining damage on Friday, according to Turkey's Transport Ministry. Ship tracking data showed it slowing and turning towards the coast late on Friday. Shipping data showed it awaiting orders in the Black Sea. It was sanctioned by the United States in January when it sailed under a different name, and by the United Kingdom and European Union later this year. There was also an explosion on another ship that carries Russian crude oil in a nearby part of the Black Sea on Friday. All 25 crew members on board that tanker, the Gambian- flagged Kairos, were evacuated. Neither vessel was in Turkish waters when they were hit. Video showed Turkish tugs tackling an extensive fire on board the ship about 30 miles off the Turkish coast. The Kairos is 275 meters long and weighs nearly 80,000 tons. It was sanctioned by the EU earlier this year and left an Indian port earlier this month to return to the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. Earlier this year, several unexplained explosions occurred on ships that have carried oil for Russia from the Black Sea. Other ships also sanctioned for carrying Russian crude oil were traveling the same route, according to shipping data on Saturday. There was also an attack by a marine drone early Saturday on a mooring point at the Russian port of Novorossiysk in the Black Sea, according to the Caspian Pipeline Consortium. The pipeline carries oil from Kazakhstan – through Russia – to customers overseas. Kazakhstan's Energy ministry said it had “activated a plan to redirect export oil volumes to alternative routes” after the strike. Novorossiysk has been attacked by Ukrainian drones multiple times. CNN has reached out to Ukraine's security services for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rage rooms are cropping up across the UK, allowing punters to smash seven bells out of old TVs, plates and furniture. “We are at capacity – we were looking for another venue because we can't keep up with demand,” said Amelia Smewing, who set up the business with her husband after exploring ways to help their son cope with PTSD. Rob Clark, an operations director at Urban Xtreme Ltd, said the popularity of its Rage Room was growing year on year, with customers ranging from younger people looking for a unique experience, to groups of women celebrating break-ups, and people using the space as a “healthy outlet” for stress or mental health challenges. “The feedback we get is consistently good – the Rage Room gives them a safe, constructive way to release pent-up anger and frustration, and it's making a genuine difference to their mental wellbeing,” he said, adding several youth care homes regularly bring their teenagers, while a handful of therapists actively refer clients when traditional talking therapy is not enough. Lucy Bee, the founder of Rage Rooms Leamington Spa said her venue also hosted visits from schools and children's homes. “It's so against how we're conditioned to behave,” she said. Like other venues, Bee said, the typical “rager” is female. “We're talking early 40s, woman, a couple of kids, good job,” she said. Bee added that having trained as a holistic therapist she found many women experience guilt and shame over feeling angry. “A lot of women … are at breaking point, permanently teetering, living in survival mode. And this gives them a way to just let it out,” Bee said,  adding that for some people who were struggling the experience could act as a gateway towards seeking further help. So I don a protective outfit, pull down my visor and enter one of Bee's rage rooms. Within seconds I am turning wine bottles into explosions of glass, laughing in surprise at myself. Last year Dr Sophie Kjærvik, now at the Norwegian Center for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies in Oslo, co-authored a review into what activities fuel or douse rage. “We found that doing meditation and mindfulness and muscle relaxation activities are way more productive ways of dealing with anger.” Kjærvik said cognitive behavioural therapy was also very efficient. Dr Ryan Martin, a dean at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay and an author of several books on anger, said people who relied on catharsis stayed angrier for longer, and were more likely to lash out aggressively after the fact. “But at the same time, other things that we know might feel good when we're emotional, like drinking, overeating, … aren't necessarily good for us either.” Prof Brad Bushman of Ohio State University, who co-authored the review with Kjærvik, also raised concerns. “When people feed their anger in these rage rooms, they're just practising how to behave more aggressively,” he said. Suzy Reading, a chartered member of the British Psychological Society and author of the book How to be Selfish, said it was not that anger should not be expressed, but that there were many ways to do this, including writing and breathing exercises. Reading also said while rage rooms may offer an outlet for stress they cost money and did not provide insights into the causes of such feelings. “And for a lot of women, [the cause is] going to be unmet needs.”</p>

WASHINGTON—FBI Director Kash Patel sat down with The Epoch Times for an exclusive interview on Nov. 26 in which he highlighted the agency's effectiveness this year and investigations that uncovered espionage rings, rescued missing children, and recovered burn bags containing thousands of government documents.

The discussion ranged from Patel's perspective on his first 10 months on the job to future expectations and objectives, with a focus on taking down cartels and other criminal organizations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Francisco Govea holds a photograph of his mother Silvia Reyna Mendoza, an undocumented U.S. immigrant from Mexico.José Luis Villegas/The Globe and Mail The lewd messages began to appear on Silvia Reyna Mendoza's phone in 2023. They came, she said, from a man who was her case specialist at BI Inc., a company that does contract work monitoring migrants for United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Some were suggestive: “What else can I show you?” one asked, followed by tongue and water droplets emojis. Canadians say they are struggling to get information on relatives in ICE detention The allegations made by Ms. Reyna Mendoza, an agricultural worker in northern California who has lived in the country for nearly four decades and has seven children that are U.S. citizens, have not been tested in court. Neither BI nor its employees have responded in court, but the company said in a statement that it maintains “a zero-tolerance policy as it relates to such matters.” Nonetheless, Ms. Reyna Mendoza's case adds to a growing body of complaints against ICE and its contractors at a moment when U.S. President Donald Trump has reinforced federal agents with billions of dollars in new funding and a mandate to accelerate the eviction of migrants from the country. Earlier this year, his administration slashed the work force at three watchdog offices that were charged with oversight of the immigration system. “It sounds like they have an unlimited amount of power, with no constraints,” he said. He had enlisted in part so he could secure citizenship for his mother, whose lack of status hung heavy over his childhood. But Ms. Reyna Mendoza had not been able to secure status in the U.S., working instead at jobs like harvesting walnuts. She had a previous DUI charge, but has been sober for years. Canadians with U.S. permanent residency risk losing status, new advisory from Ottawa warns In the months that followed, she was fitted with an ankle monitoring bracelet, without explanation. She had previously spent years being monitored through a cellphone app, and attending regular check-ins with BI. After decades in the U.S., officials told her she had been classified as a flight risk. “BI Incorporated takes all allegations of sexual abuse and harassment with the utmost seriousness,” GEO Care spokesperson Monica Hook said in a statement. Federal records show the group has been paid billions of dollars in recent years for work that includes case management and monitoring. “We have a zero-tolerance policy as it relates to such matters and takes steps to ensure a thorough investigation of all related complaints,” Ms. Hook said. Contractors like BI, which got its start tracking cattle, do not formally hold the power to detain or deport. A negative notation from BI could “make ICE look at the case and say, ‘yeah, then we should take this person back into custody,'” said Claire Trickler-McNulty, who served at ICE under the administrations of Mr. Trump, Joe Biden and Barack Obama. That is doubly true today, when those docket officers are saddled with far greater caseloads, leaving little time for review. “There's so much more stress on the system,” Ms. Trickler-McNulty said. In a system built on deep power imbalances – migrants enjoy few protections and fear angering those who oversee their cases – allegations of misconduct are not new. Changes made by the Trump administration have not helped. It slashed funding from the Department of Homeland Security Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, as well as ombudsman offices under U.S. Advocacy groups have accused the administration of closing those offices and freezing their work. Those offices “existed as the watchdogs, a place where whistle-blowers could go and the government would investigate its own,” said Pablo Manríquez, who has closely watched ICE at Migrant Insider, a news Substack he operates. Even if federal agents are held to account for crimes, some fear Mr. Trump will intervene. That has left lawyers representing migrants to calculate statutes of limitations, he said. The hope is to ensure any findings of criminal guilt are made after Mr. Trump leaves office. ICE said it has no comment on contractors named in a lawsuit. When she re-entered the facility where she is currently incarcerated, it fell to one of her cellmates to give her a blanket, Mr. Govea said. Migrants in detention are accused of being criminals, he said. “But they're showing more compassion than ICE ever has.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump praised Mr Asfura as “the only real friend of freedom in Honduras”. It was an extraordinary intervention in a foreign election. The man who is standing up for Democracy, and fighting… He called Rixi Moncada, the candidate for the Left-wing Libre Party, which is currently in power, a “communist” aligned with Nicolas Maduro and Cuba, and said television host Salvador Nasralla of the centrist Liberal Party “cannot be trusted”. “Tito and I can work together to fight the narcocommunists, and bring needed aid to the people of Honduras,” Mr Trump said. In another Truth Social post Mr Trump wrote: “Tito will be a great president, and the United States will work closely with him in order to ensure the success, with all of its potential, of Honduras! But on Friday, Mr Trump said he was granting him a “full and complete pardon” and that he had been “treated very badly”. If Mr Asfura were to win on Sunday, it would hand Mr Trump an important ally in Latin America at a time when he is trying to reassert US dominance in the region, weaken China's influence and take on drug cartels. With the staunchly pro-Trump Nayib Bukele in El Salvador, and Bernardo Arévalo in Guatemala, who has cooperated with the US government, it would give Mr Trump allies in all three countries that make up the Northern Triangle, a key passage for drug, human and arms trafficking. “It would make a lot of sense [for Mr Trump],” Carlos Solar, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said. “They could combine security, they could put a stop to the migrants... it would turn the whole triangle towards Trump, rather than having this Left-wing government, which doesn't allow him to have more of a security control over the Northern Triangle.” But Mr Trump's endorsement is a gamble: it could work against Mr Asfura if his opponents seize on it to claim election interference and it could put off Honduran voters, especially the estimated 400,000 living in the US, who may have been impacted by the Republican leader's hardline immigration policies and mass deportations. “It is really clearly breaking with US policy that has evolved over decades, but it's also risky, because the truth is the National Party that Tito is from has never been clear of corruption,” he told The Telegraph. Hernandez, the party's former leader, was last year sentenced to 45 years in prison and handed an $8m fine after he was convicted of drug trafficking and firearms charges. His brother, Juan Antonio “Tony” Hernández, a former congressman, is currently serving a life sentence in the US for manufacturing and smuggling 185,000 kilograms of cocaine into the US. It has been under a state of exception, which suspended some constitutional rights to fight drug trafficking and gangs, since December 2022. Mr Sabatini said that, should Mr Asfura win, he may pay lip service to Mr Trump's policies or allow the US to send a militarised anti-narcotics force to enter Honduras, but there are no guarantees. “Truth is, it's a very small, shallow political class, not intellectually, but in terms of depth. “The US often thought it had allies, whether it was Juan Orlando Hernandez [or someone else], that they thought could do their bidding on multiple fronts, on US policy, specifically on narcotics and corruption, and that has never panned out [for them].” Experts have not ruled out the possibility that more than one candidate could declare victory, a scenario that would exacerbate the country's political crisis. Prosecutors have also opened an investigation into audio recordings that allegedly show a high-ranking National Party politician discussing plans with an unidentified military officer to influence the election. He was the mayor of his home city from 2014-2022, where he oversaw a string of construction projects, which earned him the nickname “Papi, at your service”. He has suggested ways Honduras might benefit from the return of migrants from the US who often have skills in construction and agriculture and capital to start their own businesses. “I am not wishing for our countrymen to be deported, but there is an opportunity here,” Mr Asfura told Bloomberg during a visit to Washington, DC. The politician, who wears a uniform of jeans and rolled-up sleeves, is currently under investigation with other former officials from his administration, for allegedly being part of a scheme to embezzle public funds and launder money. He has claimed the allegations are politically motivated and denies wrongdoing. Xiomara Castro, the current president, is married to Manuel Zelaya, the former Left-wing Honduran president who was overthrown in a military coup in 2009. Both her rivals have said they will resume relations with Taiwan, which would represent the biggest diplomatic setback in the region for China in decades. “I think in this situation, we know both devils, and I would far prefer one over the other,” he told The Telegraph. “Especially in these countries, there's always going to be concerns and faults with every single candidate... the National Party candidates have all kind of been labelled as that, and, you know, they've had ties to the narcos, they're pro US, pro business because it helps them, you know, sweep some other things under the rug.” He added: “If I'm Trump, I'm thinking, look, you know, the cons of having Rixi Moncada as president of Honduras are massive and they don't outweigh the potential cons of another person in office.” “If Tito claims electoral fraud if he loses, Trump will have to say something.... he has forced himself into a box in which he will probably most likely need to follow that regardless of any evidence, and that's deeply toxic, not just in terms of Honduran politics and polarising, but in terms of US relations in the hemisphere and beyond Honduras,” he added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares. Former Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak said he intends to go to the front line after resigning from his post amid a major corruption investigation, the New York Post reported on Nov. 28, citing a letter he sent the outlet. "I'm going to the front and am prepared for any reprisals," he said. Yermak's remarks came after the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) searched his premises on Nov. 28 as part of a sweeping probe into alleged embezzlement at state nuclear operator Energoatom. His letter suggested he stepped down to avoid political fallout for Zelensky. Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Olha Stefanishyna told the New York Post that investigators conducted searches at Yermak's home, but "no procedural actions followed afterwards." Appointed in 2020, Yermak became one of the most powerful figures in the Ukrainian government, with influence stretching across security, diplomacy, and domestic politics. Despite long-standing criticism, Zelensky repeatedly defended him and dismissed claims that Yermak wielded excessive authority. Independent outlet Ukrainska Pravda reported on Nov. 24, citing sources, that investigators implicated Yermak in the Energoatom scheme and referred to him as "Ali Baba." Ukraine's chief anti-corruption prosecutor, Oleksandr Klymenko, said earlier in November that "Ali Baba" held meetings and assigned tasks to law enforcement agencies aimed at pressuring NABU detectives and anti-corruption prosecutors. The Energoatom case — which includes allegations of luxury property purchases financed through the scheme, including one near Kyiv reportedly intended for Yermak — has triggered calls within the president's circle to remove him to restore public trust. Yermak is not the first high-ranking official to leave office and volunteer for front-line service. Former Chernivtsi Oblast Governor Serhii Osachuk deployed after his deputy was implicated in humanitarian aid embezzlement. Tim Zadorozhnyy is the reporter for the Kyiv Independent, specializing in foreign policy, U.S.-Ukraine relations, and political developments across Europe and Russia. The leaders will discuss "the conditions of a just and durable peace" in Ukraine, according to French President Emmanuel Macron's office. The operation targeted ships that, according to the source, could have transported nearly $70 million worth of oil and helped Moscow bypass international sanctions. Ukraine's military reportedly struck one of southern Russia's largest oil refineries overnight on Nov. 29, Russian Telegram media channels reported. "I'm going to the front and am prepared for any reprisals... I am an honest and decent person," Former Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak said. Orban reiterated his readiness to hold the peace talks on Ukraine in Hungary, even as plans for a summit in Budapest between Putin and Trump have been scrapped. Vasyl Verameichyk, a Belarusian soldier who previously served as a volunteer fighter for Ukraine, was sentenced to 13 years in prison in Belarus, independent outlet Belsat reported on Nov. 28. Andriy Yermak, head of the President's Office, submitted his resignation following searches by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) at his premises earlier on Nov. 28, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Northwestern University has agreed to pay $75 million as part of a settlement with the Trump administration which restores previously frozen federal funding and ends a monthslong investigation over government allegations of “unlawful discrimination,” including “race-based admissions” and a “hostile” environment for Jewish students, the Department of Justice announced Friday. The agreement requires Northwestern to comply with federal anti-discrimination laws, overhaul its policies on campus demonstrations, and implement mandatory antisemitism training for students, faculty and staff, conditions similar to those imposed on other campuses. The university's $790 million of federal funding was suspended earlier this year amid a Title VI civil rights investigation, part of a broader administration effort to scrutinize university policies and campus speech. Northwestern University president steps down following federal funding freeze That includes overdue payments on all non-terminated, federally funded grants and contracts, the paper said. CNN has reached out to Northwestern and the White House for further information. The deal with Brown University, by contrast, determined its payment will fund Rhode Island workforce development groups. And unlike Columbia University, which is subject to external monitoring, Northwestern will oversee its own compliance. The agreement places Northwestern among several universities facing federal scrutiny, including Columbia, Brown and Cornell, which have made multimillion-dollar payments, and the University of Virginia, which accepted strict, multi-year reporting requirements through 2028 to regain federal funds. The federal funding freeze and related investigation brought significant upheaval at Northwestern, including the resignation of president Michael Schill in September, citing “serious and often painful challenges” and warning that “difficult problems remain, particularly at the federal level.” This story has been updated with additional details.</p>

PARIS, Nov 28 (Reuters) – Europe's Airbus AIR.PA said on Friday it was ordering immediate repairs to 6,000 of its widely used A320 family of jets in a sweeping recall affecting more than half the global fleet, threatening upheaval during the busiest travel weekend of the year in the United States and disruption worldwide. The fix mainly involves reverting to earlier software and is relatively simple, but must be carried out before the planes can fly again, other than repositioning to repair centers, according to the bulletin to airlines seen by Reuters. Airlines from the United States to South America, Europe, India and New Zealand warned the repairs could potentially cause flight delays or cancellations. It said it mostly expected these to be completed by Saturday with about two hours required for each plane. Other airlines said they would take planes briefly out of service to do the repairs, including Germany's Lufthansa LHAG.DE, India's IndiGo and UK-based easyJet EZJ.L. Colombian carrier Avianca said the recall affected more than 70% of its fleet, prompting it to close ticket sales for travel dates through December 8. Chinese, European and Indian carriers are also among the jet's biggest customers. For about two-thirds of the affected jets, the recall will result in a brief grounding as airlines revert to a previous software version, industry sources said. Still, that comes at a time when airline repair shops are already overrun by maintenance work, as hundreds of Airbus jets have been grounded due to long waiting times for separate engine repairs or inspections. “The timing is definitely not ideal for an issue like this to arise on one of the most ubiquitous aircraft around the (U.S.) holidays,” Mike Stengel of AeroDynamic Advisory said. But due to the quick repair time, many jets can be fixed between scheduled flights or during overnight checks, he added. Britain's easyJet said it had already completed the work. A senior airline industry source, however, said sequencing the repairs at a time when demand is high and fleets are already facing maintenance delays was expected to be a major challenge. Aviation analyst Rob Morris said there were questions over how much hangar capacity would immediately be available. Airbus said a recent incident had revealed that solar flares may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls. Industry sources said the incident that triggered the unexpected repair action involved a JetBlue flight from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, on October 30, in which several passengers were hurt following a sharp loss of altitude. The temporary groundings for repairs for some airlines could be much longer since more than 1,000 of the affected jets may also have to have hardware changed, industry sources said. A Finnair FIA1S.HE flight was delayed almost an hour as pilots established which software version they had, a passenger said. Air France AIRF.PA said it was canceling 35 flights, 5% of the airline's daily total. Mexico's Volaris said it would be hit by delays or cancellations for up to 72 hours. It competes with the Boeing BA.N 737 MAX, which suffered a lengthy worldwide grounding after fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, blamed on poorly designed flight-control software. Demand for the two main brands of workhorse jets has surged in recent years as economic growth led by Asia brought tens of millions of new travelers into the skies. Originally designed to serve hubs, the single-aisle models were later widely adopted by low-cost carriers. These in turn control the aircraft's pitch or nose angle. The computer's manufacturer, France's Thales TCFP.PA, said in response to a Reuters query that the computer complies with Airbus specifications and the functionality in question is supported by software that is not under Thales' responsibility.
