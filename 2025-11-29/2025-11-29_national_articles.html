Fox News' Madeleine Rivera joins "Saturday in America" with new details in the Washington, D.C., shooting of two National Guard members and the Trump administration's move to pause issuing visas for Afghanistan passport holders. Dramatic eyewitness video has emerged showing the part of the brazen daylight ambush attack that left one National Guard member dead in Washington, D.C., and another fighting for his life. The footage, taken by an eyewitness in a passing vehicle and obtained by the Wall Street Journal, shows a man in dark clothing with what appears to be a revolver in his hand, as two Guardsmen scramble for cover. Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, has been named as a suspect. The horrific scene, which took place about three blocks north of the White House, captures Lakanwal raising his arm. Seconds later, he opened fire on two West Virginia National Guard members, the outlet reported. Screenshots show National Guard members scrambling for cover and returning fire during Wednesday's ambush near Farragut West Metro station in Washington, D.C. (Obtained by the Wall Street Journal) The incident, which has rocked the nation, unfolded on 17th Street NW near Farragut West Metro Station at around 2:15 p.m. Specialist Sarah Beckstrom died from her injuries on Thursday while Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe remains in critical condition. Lakanwal entered the United States in September 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome, the Biden administration's Afghan evacuation and resettlement program. He now faces charges including first-degree murder and two counts of assault with intent to kill while armed. National Guard members Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Andrew Wolfe, 24, were shot in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. (United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia/Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Beckstrom and Wolfe are members of the West Virginia National Guard, which was deployed to the nation's capital to tackle crime in the city following an executive order from President Donald Trump earlier this year. Rep. Riley Moore, R-W.Va., said Saturday told "FOX & Friends Weekend" on Saturday that Wolfe is "hanging on," adding that his family is calling for prayer. "His father is a deputy sheriff in the county next to mine and Andy wanted to follow in [those] footsteps and serve his nation as a National Guardsman," Moore told "FOX & Friends Weekend." I believe in the power of prayer and I can promise you his parents believe in the power of prayer... Streets are blocked after reports that two National Guard soldiers were shot near the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Nov. 26, 2025. Patrick Morrisey also told "Fox & Friends Weekend" on Saturday that, "Andrew is fighting for his life right now, and his family and all of his friends, they're trying to harvest as many prayers as possible from all across the country, all across the globe, to help him recover." Morrisey said Wolfe's condition, as of Saturday, "remains very serious." "West Virginia cares very deeply about its Guard. And there's just a proud tradition of West Virginians who step up from military service. So when something like this happens, it's really a gut punch to the communities," Morrisey added. "Most importantly, we need justice to be served. I think West Virginians are counting on that. Americans are counting on that," he told Fox News.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK (AP) — Despite wider economic uncertainty hovering above this year's holiday season, shoppers turned out in big numbers for Black Friday — spending billions of dollars both in stores and online. Traffic particularly piled up between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. local time nationwide, when $12.5 million passed through online shopping carts every minute. Consumers also spent a record $6.4 billion online on Thanksgiving Day, per Adobe. Top categories that saw an uptick in sales across both days included video game consoles, electronics and home appliances. Shopping services powered by artificial intelligence and social media advertising have also particularly influenced what consumers choose to buy, the firm said. At its peak, sales reached $5.1 million per minute — with top categories including cosmetics and clothing, according to the Canadian company. Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks in-person and online spending, reported that overall Black Friday sales excluding automotive rose 4.1% from a year ago. The retail sales indicator, which is not adjusted for inflation, showed online sales jumped by double digits (10.4%), while in-store purchases inched up 1.7%. Michelle Meyer, chief economist at the Mastercard Economics Institute, said consumers are “navigating an uncertain environment” this holiday season “by shopping early, leveraging promotions, and investing in wish-list items.” Black Friday is far from the sales event that created midnight mall crowds or doorbuster mayhem just decades ago. More and more consumers have instead turned to online deals to make post-Thanksgiving purchases from the comfort of their own homes — or opt to stretch out spending across longer promotions now offered by retailers. Sensormatic Solutions, which also tracks store traffic, found that in-store retail visits dipped 2.1% — but said that was in line with expectations and trends already seen this year. “Black Friday has really turned into like a full week event, or even further,” said Grant Gustafson, head of retail consulting and analytics at Sensormatic Solutions. And “Black Friday is really the start of just a really and critical stretch for retailers,” he added — noting that the weekend following Thanksgiving, as well as the days leading up to Christmas next month, will also be some of the busiest in terms of in-store traffic. Still, rising prices could be contributing to some of those numbers. U.S. President Donald Trump's barrage of tariffs on foreign imports have strained businesses and households alike over the last year. And despite spending more overall, Salesforce found U.S. shoppers purchased fewer items at checkout on Black Friday (down 2% from last year). Order volumes also slipped 1%, the firm noted, as average selling prices climbed 7%. This year's holiday spending rush arrives amid heightened economic uncertainty for consumers. Beyond tariffs, workers across public and private sectors are also struggling with anxieties over job security — amid both corporate layoffs and the after-effects of the 43-day government shutdown. While Sensormatic doesn't track spending, “we do track consumer footsteps,” Gustafson notes — and “consumers are thinking a little bit harder about their purchases” this year, he explains, “to make sure that they're getting their very best deals.” But the rate of growth is slowing — with an anticipated increase of 3.7% to 4.2% year over year, compared to 4.3% in 2024's holiday season. At the same time, credit card debt and delinquencies on other short-term loans have been rising.</p>

Debbie Wasserman Schultz condemned President Trump, arguing he fails to look inward and reconsider his own policies as he reacts to the shooting of two National Guard members, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., has long performed a key role for many on the left. When there is an argument barred by decency or decorum, Wasserman Schultz is happy to make it, from attacking journalists in her defense of censorship to attempting to rig an election and bar Republicans from ballots as part of her defense of democracy. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) speaks during a press conference on new legislation to support Holocaust education nationwide at the U.S. Capitol Building on January 27, 2023 in Washington, DC. "This is a deeply concerning situation, but, you know, it's one that I think we have to — it begs the question, would an individual have flown across the country to target law enforcement officers in Washington, D.C.? And, I mean, the answer is likely no. So why wasn‘t the president‘s first thought, ‘Wow, you know, maybe I should reconsider deploying military troops in the nation‘s capital or in any city?' Particularly not when they haven‘t coordinated closely with the leadership of these cities and when we have law enforcement that are quite capable of handling the criminal justice issues that are — that we need law enforcement to focus on, and not our military." There is a good-faith debate over the deployment of National Guard personnel in cities. "I just think, you know, the president looks everywhere except inward to blame his own policies. We need to make sure that we don‘t have our military deployed in our cities, doing — handling law enforcement responsibilities. File photo of National Guardsman Sarah Beckstrom who was wounded in a shooting incident in Washington D.C., on the evening of November 26, 2025. Moreover, this is a crime committed with a handgun brought from another area with strong gun control, Washington State. Wasserman Schultz is also assuming that it was the deployment that motivated the shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national. Lakanwal entered the U.S. on September 8, 2021, under Operation Allies Welcome, a program established by former Democratic President Joe Biden after the U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021. Wasserman Schultz, however, does not blame former President Biden for Lakanwal's presence in the United States. (Lakanwal, a former member of a CIA unit in Afghanistan, was reportedly granted asylum under the Trump Administration in April). Investigators are still working to discover the motive of Lakanwal for murdering one soldier and critically wounding another. However, Wasserman Schultz feels entirely comfortable in suggesting that it was the deployment of the Guard in cities over Democratic objections. Of course, a few other possibilities come to mind. First, it could be an act of religious-based terrorism. Second, it could be an act of mental illness. Third, it could be a personal grievance with the U.S. government. Undated file photo of Rahmanullah Lakanwal, the suspect in the shooting of  two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., November 26, 2025. Killing soldiers in the nation's Capitol can be appealing for any of these motivations or a combination of motivations. It is not obvious that someone travels across the country because this is where you can find personnel on the streets. After all, there are also troops deployed in other states closer to Washington state. Wasserman Schultz seems to suggest that Trump is responsible for making troops targets due to the controversial use of the Guard and supplying targets for a terrorist. The most important point for Wasserman Schultz is a familiar one: Trump did it. Hodgkinson, a former Bernie Sanders supporter, hated Republicans and would have found another gathering to carry out his murderous plan. File photo of National Guardsman Andrew Wolfe who was wounded in a shooting incident in Washington D.C., on the evening of November 26, 2025. The point is that we do not know. The effort to use this tragedy for political purposes is to dishonor the victims and capitalize on their deaths. Few would feel comfortable getting into the head of a homicidal madman without any evidence or support. However, that appears to be a unique skill set for Debbie Wasserman Schultz.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An oil tanker is moored at the Sheskharis oil and petroleum complex on the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, Russia, Oct. 11, 2022. ISTANBUL (AP) — Ukraine used domestically produced Sea Baby naval drones to strike two Russian oil tankers in the Black Sea, an official from Ukraine's security services told The Associated Press on Saturday. The two oil tankers, Kairos and Virat — said to be part of Russia's “shadow fleet” that evade sanctions — were struck in quick succession off Turkey's Black Sea coast late Friday afternoon. Crew members on board both vessels were reported to be safe. The official said the two tankers were vessels that were sanctioned by the West, adding that Ukrainian intelligence continued “to take active steps to curtails Russia's financial capabilities to wage war against Ukraine.” Sea Baby naval drones had disabled vessels capable of transporting oil worth almost $70 million, hindering Russia's efforts to circumvent international sanctions, the official said. Earlier, Turkey's Transport and Infrastructure Minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu said the tankers were possibly struck by mines, missiles, a marine vessel, or a drone. The incidents took place within Turkey's exclusive economic zone, he said, noting that Turkish authorities were in contact with their counterparts to prevent a recurrence and to ensure navigational safety. He did not provide further details. Uraloglu said the Gambian-flagged Kairos had caught fire, which was continuing in the vessel's enclosed areas on Saturday. Authorities had earlier reported a fire in the Virat's engine room. He minister the captain of the Virat tanker had issued a distress call over “a drone attack.” The OpenSanctions database, which tracks people or organizations involved in sanctions evasion, describes the vessels as part of a shadow fleet of ships used to evade sanctions imposed on Russia following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine has carried out successful naval strikes against Russian shipping during the war, particularly using explosives-packed marine drones. However, Ukrainian missions have largely been limited to the waters of the northern Black Sea. It was sailing empty from Egypt toward Russia's Novorossiysk port. Shortly after, the maritime authority reported that a second tanker, Virat, was “struck” while sailing in the Black Sea about 35 nautical miles (64 kilometers) off the Turkish coast. “The shadow tanker fleet continues to provide multibillion-dollar revenues for the Kremlin bypassing sanctions, disguising its activities under the flags of third countries, using complex schemes to conceal owners and poses significant environmental threats,” OpenSanctions says in its website entry on the Kairos. The Virat, built in 2018, uses “irregular and high-risk shipping practices” and has previously sailed under the flags of Barbados, Comoros, Liberia and Panama, OpenSanctions says. The Kairos, formerly flagged as Panamanian, Greek and Liberian, was built in 2002.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An aircraft heavily used by commercial airlines around the world needs a software fix to address an issue that contributed to a sudden drop in altitude of a JetBlue plane last month, the manufacturer and European aviation safety regulators said Friday. Airlines around the world canceled and delayed flights heading into the weekend to fix software on a widely used commercial aircraft.

Airbus said Friday that an examination of the JetBlue incident revealed that intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls on the A320 family of aircraft. The EU safety agency said it may cause “short-term disruption” to flight schedules. Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury apologized to customers after the required fix led to “significant logistical challenges and delays.” “Our teams are working around the clock to support our operators and ensure these updates are deployed as swiftly as possible to get planes back in the sky and resume normal operations, with the safety assurance you expect from Airbus,” he wrote in a message posted on LinkedIn on Saturday. In Japan, All Nippon Airways, which operates more than 30 planes, canceled 65 domestic flights for Saturday. Additional cancellations on Sunday were possible, it said. American Airlines has about 480 planes from the A320 family, of which 209 are affected. On Saturday, the airline said in a statement that only four planes still needed to be updated and that it “expects no further operational impact.” Delta said it expected the issue to affect less than 50 of its A321neo aircraft. United said six planes in its fleet are affected and it expects minor disruptions to a few flights. Pope Leo XIV is on his inaugural foreign trip, to Turkey and Lebanon, and is flying along with the papal delegation and press corps aboard an ITA Airways Airbus A320neo charter. In France, Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot said the situation has stabilized as several software updates had already been installed. He told BFM-TV that the impact was limited in the country with an “almost complete return to normal in French airports.” British Airways, for example, said only three of its aircraft required the update, while EasyJet indicated there may be changes to its flying schedule as a result of the update, in which case passengers will be informed. Germany's Lufthansa said most software updates were completed during the night and on Saturday morning. No Lufthansa Group Airlines flights are expected to be canceled due to the current situation, but there may be minor delays over the weekend, it said. Scandinavia's SAS said its flights were operating as normal Saturday, after teams worked overnight to install the required software. Mike Stengel, a partner with the aerospace industry management consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory, said the fix could be addressed between flights or on overnight plane checks. “Definitely not ideal for this to be happening on a very ubiquitous aircraft on a busy holiday weekend,” Stengel said from Ann Arbor, Michigan. “Although again the silver lining being that it only should take a few hours to update the software.” Airbus, which is registered in the Netherlands but has its main headquarters in France, is one of the world's biggest airplane manufacturers, alongside Boeing.</p>

Riley Moore, R-W.Va., shares an update on National Guard member Andrew Wolfe as he remains in critical condition and argues the accused gunman should have 'never' been in the U.S. The West Virginia National Guardsman who is in critical condition after being shot this week in Washington, D.C., is "hanging on," a congressman told "FOX & Friends Weekend," adding that his family is calling for prayer. Rep. Riley Moore, R-W.Va., said Saturday that the family of Andrew Wolfe, 24, is "committed to service." "His father is a deputy sheriff in the county next to mine and Andy wanted to follow in that footsteps and serve his nation as a National Guardsman," Moore told "FOX & Friends Weekend." I believe in the power of prayer and I can promise you his parents believe in the power of prayer... Patrick Morrisey also told "Fox & Friends Weekend" on Saturday that, "Andrew is fighting for his life right now, and his family and all of his friends, they're trying to harvest as many prayers as possible from all across the country, all across the globe, to help him recover." Morrisey said Wolfe's condition, as of Saturday, "remains very serious." "West Virginia cares very deeply about its Guard. And there's just a proud tradition of West Virginians who step up from military service. So when something like this happens, it's really a gut punch to the communities," Morrisey added. "Most importantly, we need justice to be served. I think West Virginians are counting on that. Americans are counting on that," he told Fox News. National Guard member Sarah Beckstrom, 20, of West Virginia, died after the shooting on Wednesday in the nation's capital. The alleged gunman, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, faces multiple charges, including one count of first-degree murder and two counts of assault with intent to kill while armed. Beckstrom and Wolfe are members of the West Virginia National Guard, which was deployed to the nation's capital to tackle crime in the city following an executive order from President Donald Trump earlier this year. People gather for a vigil in honor of National Guard member Sarah Beckstrom in Webster Springs, W.Va., on Friday, Nov. 28, 2025. Lakanwal arrived in the U.S. a month later under "Operation Allies Welcome." But in my view, he should have never been here. He should have never been in this country to begin with," Moore said Saturday. We don't know who they are." "We have had terrorists come to the United States before. "After we had 13 of our service members killed at Abbey Gate, that continued failed policy just cost us another American life, by the Biden administration. We should not be in this position to begin with and beautiful young lady from West Virginia lost her life because of this failed policy by Joe Biden." People gather on Friday, Nov. 28, 2025, for a vigil in Webster Springs, W.Va., in honor of National Guard member Sarah Beckstrom, one of two National Guard members who were shot in Washington, D.C., this week. Community members in Webster Springs, West Virginia, gathered Friday night for a vigil for Beckstrom and Wolfe. Fox News' Landon Mion, Stephen Sorace and Brooke Singman contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Signs are displayed outside a tent encampment at Northwestern University on April 26, 2024, in Evanston, Illinois. Northwestern University has agreed to pay $75 million to the U.S. government in a deal with the Trump administration to end a series of investigations and restore hundreds of millions of dollars in federal research funding. Among other commitments it also requires the university to revoke the so-called Deering Meadow agreement, which it signed in April 2024 in exchange for pro-Palestinian protesters ending their tent encampment on campus. During negotiations, interim university president Henry Bienen said Northwestern refused to cede control over hiring, admissions, or its curriculum. “I would not have signed this agreement without provisions ensuring that is the case,” he said. The agreement also calls for Northwestern to continue compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws, develop training materials to “socialize international students” with the norms of a campus dedicated to open debate, and uphold a commitment to Title IX by “providing safe and fair opportunities for women, including single-sex housing for any woman, defined on the basis of sex, who requests such accommodations and all-female sports, locker rooms, and showering facilities.” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said the deal cements policy changes that will protect people on campus from harassment and discrimination. “The reforms reflect bold leadership at Northwestern and they are a roadmap for institutional leaders around the country that will help rebuild public trust in our colleges and universities,” McMahon said. Trump has leveraged government control of federal research money to push for reforms at elite colleges he has decried as overrun by “woke” ideology. Brown and Cornell also reached agreements with the government to restore funding following antisemitism investigations. Harvard, the administration's primary target, remains in negotiations with the federal government over its demands for changes to campus policies and governance. This fall, the White House tried a different approach on higher education, offering preferential treatment for federal funds to several institutions in exchange for adopting policies in line with Trump's agenda. The administration received a wave of initial rejections from some universities' leadership, citing concerns that Trump's higher education compact might supplant academic freedom.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Little did he know it was the start of an ordeal that would eventually tear his life apart. It was October 2024, three months after Novak shared a public post about the lack of safe fast-food options for his son, who has celiac disease. It drew a handful of likes and comments from his friends. The sender's profile showed a slender blonde woman named Ailis Danner. She described herself as a fashion designer who worked on Madison Avenue, the heart of New York City's luxury shopping district. The two began an exchange, and their messages – at her suggestion – moved from Facebook Messenger to WhatsApp, where they gradually grew more personal. She told him about her globetrotting lifestyle as a fashion designer navigating two continents. By February, they'd declared their love for each other. By April this year, he'd funneled $280,000 – almost his entire life savings – to an investment site she recommended. And the woman, along with her Facebook profile, vanished not long after. I lost my future,” said Novak, 52, who lives in Wallington, New Jersey. How do you tell your 78-year-old mom who has medical problems that everything's gone?” Novak's experience is part of a growing online scam known as “pig-butchering,” which authorities say has drained billions from US victims through fake cryptocurrency investments. It often starts with innocuous online messages from a fraudster posing as a romantic interest to gain trust and connection. Experts have compared it to fattening a pig before slaughter. “Ailis” flaunted images of a luxurious lifestyle that included red Ferraris, fancy vacations and front-row seats at fashion shows. She sent Novak playful WhatsApp voice notes explaining how to pronounce her name, and shared videos of a fluffy chocolate goldendoodle, Lucky. I like to be honest and sincere with others, only in this way we can win other people's respect and make better friends. I didn't expect you to be so well maintained. —"Ailis," in a WhatsApp message to Novak The carefully curated details and imagery were part of a plan to build trust, experts tell CNN. Novak, who lives about 20 miles from New York City, knew when it was snowing in the area, making her story more believable. At 50 … all I wanted was to connect with someone. I don't care what you have.” Except for one carefully staged video call, “Ailis” avoided talking on the phone or over FaceTime, preferring instead to chat through text messages or voice notes. She made vague promises about meeting Novak in New York City but demurred whenever they seemed close to firming up plans. “Ailis Danner” told Novak she lives in Queens, but a CNN search for that name in the New York City area turned up no results. No names came up for the WhatsApp number that “Ailis” used to communicate with him. A CNN review of the photos and videos sent to Novak found they appear on the Instagram page of a New York City-based lifestyle influencer with a different name. That woman did not respond to CNN's repeated requests for comment via email and Instagram messages. Novak said he has always been reserved and introverted. He earned a computer science degree from Rutgers University, was married briefly at 25, then was married again for more than a decade before that relationship ended last year. He'd worked for the company for nearly three decades and was in a vulnerable place after losing his job and the collapse of his marriage. “Ailis” told him she was an immigrant from Germany who was trying to find her place in the flashy, fast-paced world of fashion. I think I have found a good friend … With our birthdays only one month apart, it feels like a special connection! And “Ailis” showed consideration for him in a way no one ever had, he said. Some days, Novak took his mother to her doctor's appointments, and he'd get messages from “Ailis” asking how the visit went. As the person everyone in his family leaned on, the new connection made him feel cared for as he navigated his divorce, he said. His new friend said that like him, she enjoyed hiking, golfing and the outdoors. During one of their online chats, she mentioned a love for Lake George, a favorite camping spot for Novak and his children in upstate New York. I don't know how she made the connection,” he said. “Ailis” also said she was an investor in a medical devices company – one that happened to have an office next door to Novak's former employer. Even the fact that they lived less than an hour apart seemed like fate, he said. “At the time, I was like ‘Oh, another connection,'” Novak told CNN. “And now, the only thing I can think of is, ‘you stupid idiot. For example, “Ailis” preferred to send text messages or short voice notes, spoken in a heavy accent, rather than appearing on camera. “You hear about people that punch themselves in the face, and you say, ‘who the f**k does that? I always say my superpower is empathy, putting myself in someone shoes and seeing the other side and telling my brain what I see may not be what's real. In the early days of their correspondence, they had a 15-minute WhatsApp video call. Novak remembers seeing someone sitting at the far end of what appeared to be a long table in a conference room. The person's face was blurry, but they appeared to have a similar bone structure to “Ailis,” he said. But it was around 3 p.m. in New Jersey – the same time zone as New York City – and the sun was still out. “I've read up a lot on the subject (of online scams) now, and there were signs (I missed).” Novak now believes his candor made him an easy target. Without a job, he told “Ailis,” he needed investment opportunities to secure a future for his two children, ages 13 and 15. I gotta be able to save for my kids' high school and college.” My sister is the person closest to me. My father … died of natural causes in 2015. “Ailis” recommended cryptocurrency as a stable source of passive income and explained how to transfer the money from his bank account to a crypto digital wallet and then connect it to what she described as a lucrative investment site. She asked him to send her screenshots of his information, including his account details, then guided him on how to use the site. As she explained it, the purported investment site had different tiers and clients who invested more money earned higher interest rates. Every time he was able to withdraw a little money as a test, he felt more confident that the process was working. I think you don't need to operate your account frequently. When the investment account generates profits, there is no need to withdraw money every day. With all my money tied into this I will need to draw to live on but it won't be daily for sure. And now I just got this lump sum of about $280,000,” he told CNN, referring to his share of the house he shared with his wife. “Ailis” helped him navigate the process throughout. His friends implored him to be careful. “But then you say to yourself, ‘I'm a smart guy. “By the end of January, I was probably $150,000 in.” Meanwhile, Novak tried to persuade “Ailis” to meet in person, but she told him she was busy preparing for New York Fashion Week in February. You are still very mysterious about most of your life again. They made plans to meet for coffee in Central Park toward the end of February. That same month, he got a notification from the crypto site urging him to move to the next level because new investors were flooding in, he said. She told him if he deposited more money, she'd match his investment to get him to the $500,000 level. I initially freaked out on Friday afternoon and let the feeling go knowing you would have the answers. … I don't know what problem you are talking about. The same day, a friend sent him an article about pig-butchering schemes. I did contact customer service … I put all my money in there, every penny, and I don't have anything besides the profits but they won't let me use them… In July, “Ailis” sent him a message via WhatsApp. “I believe that you will get better sooner. The goddess of luck will not let down any kind person,” it read. Then she asked if he could use his 401(k) to pay the fee. That was the last he heard from her for a few months. Her Facebook page vanished not long after. So did the investment site where he'd sent his money. An expert now says the $250,000 the stranger claimed to have deposited in Novak's account was likely part of the ploy to get him to part with all his money. Fraudsters obtain untraceable US phone numbers to create WhatsApp accounts with which they message their victims, said Bezalel Eithan Raviv, founder of Lionsgate Network, a company that helps with crypto-recovery and financial scams. Referring to the video call, Raviv said AI deepfake technology can mimic voices and faces and make the person on screen sound like they're responsive through utterances such as, ‘Mmmh, I see what you're saying. In some cases, he said, scammers hire real people to message victims. These people often don't understand how the back end operates and may not realize they're taking part in fraud, he said. “This is a new breed of scammers. Scammers from all over the world target Americans because they believe they have easily accessible 401(k)'s and credit lines. “The moment that money transfers to this wallet, it's no longer his,” Raviv said, referring to Novak's case. Raviv said his company has traced the online transaction flows and cross-chain transfers of Novak's funds and compiled a case file that it sent to him to assist law enforcement with financial fraud investigations. Novak said a county investigator told him the scammers are likely in Asia. CNN also reached out to the WhatsApp number that Novak was communicating with. The person did not answer calls but responded to messages and denied responsibility for Novak's financial losses. The person did not respond to other questions, such as why their profile photo is associated with a different person on social media. “This has nothing to do with you,” the person said, cutting off contact. In shock and overwhelmed with shame, Novak spent most of the summer secluded at his mother's home in Wallington. He's slowly emerging from the fog of what happened and trying to figure out a way forward. Clarity, he said, brings a different kind of pain. But Novak said he's not giving up. In addition to local authorities, he's also filed a claim with the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center. And he's reading a lot of Eckhart Tolle, the German-born author whose books focus on mindfulness and spiritual enlightenment. The days when self-blame creeps back in are less frequent now. I could possibly help somebody (else),” he said. “I can imagine how many people are sitting in my position now, thinking the thoughts I did, thinking they're helpless.” He's also keeping a journal to help make sense of it all and hopes his children will read it someday and better understand the man he was. “How could all that be fake?” he said. “How could you fake this video call? How do you fake that it's snowing? “Ailis” has resurfaced on Facebook with a new profile and last name. Earlier this month, after being contacted by CNN, the person reached out to Novak via WhatsApp for the first time since July with a series of taunting messages. But this time, Novak's response was different. Novak: How could I be given what … you did to me? You … convinced me to invest, encouraged me to put all my money into it, which i did, then immediately after getting all my money … you fell off the face of the earth. … I gave you my heart and you strung me on for 6 months and then still didn't want to meet. Getting angry won't do any good. “Ailis”: I didn't force you to invest; it's your own fault for not paying the … fee. You'll pay for that one day, I guarantee it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aftyn Behn, the Democratic nominee for next week's special election in a heavily Republican Tennessee congressional district, has made affordability concerns a centerpiece of her campaign messaging – mirroring the playbook of the party's victorious candidates for governor in Virginia and New Jersey earlier this month. Tuesday's contest is poised to test just how far Democrats can ride that argument in a district that President Donald Trump carried by 22 points last November. Republicans are hoping the district's partisan lean, combined with Behn's progressive profile and recently resurfaced remarks on policing and other issues, will tilt the race in their favor. Democrats, meanwhile, are banking that voters' frustration over the GOP agenda in Washington could help them significantly overperform in a race that otherwise wouldn't be competitive. “I don't care what political party you belong to, but if you are upset about the cost of living and the chaos of Washington, then I'm your candidate, and I welcome you with open arms.” Tennessee special election puts Democratic momentum in 2025 races to the test As part of the 2022 redistricting process, Tennessee GOP lawmakers redrew Nashville from one solidly Democratic district – long held by moderate Rep. Jim Cooper – into three seats that favored Republicans. Behn, a state representative and progressive organizer, narrowly won the four-way Democratic primary. Matt Van Epps, a combat veteran and member of the Tennessee Army National Guard running with Trump's endorsement, beat 10 other candidates to win the Republican nomination. On Monday, Trump will hold his second tele-rally for Van Epps, this time alongside House Speaker Mike Johnson, the candidate's campaign confirmed. Opponents have also mined episodes of her podcast including one from 2020 where she talked about her dislike of country music and Nashville's status as a popular tourist destination, as well as a video Behn recorded in May while monitoring immigration operations in her district in which she said she was “bullying the ICE vehicles and state troopers.” (Behn said her use of the word bullying was satire.) In her interview with CNN, Behn suggested Republicans have “been caught flat-footed, and they have resorted to personal attacks and character assassination.” Addressing the flurry of reports about her past comments in the final weeks of the campaign, Behn claimed they were “taken out of context and/or mischaracterized.” “I've learned a lot, and I would hope that voters in the 7th District would give me the benefit of the doubt, that despite whatever … is being resurfaced right now, that I'm someone who has a track record of trying to unrig the system in favor of working people,” she told CNN. Tennessee Democrats told CNN they believe voters in the district will weigh other concerns when deciding on their vote in the election. “It's a very important chance for Tennessee voters in one of the most beautiful parts of Tennessee to really speak loudly and clearly and say, ‘Hey, we're upset, we need some help, and we're looking for somebody who's gonna help us. One campaign adviser pointed to a recent ad from Van Epps in which the Republican nominee does not mention the president, but leans into messaging about bringing down costs and making health care more affordable. Democrats are more enthusiastic about the midterms as Trump's approval hits a second-term low, CNN poll finds Even as Democrats outperform their 2024 margins in special elections this year, both parties see Van Epps as the favorite heading into Tuesday. “With strong conservative turnout, we will have a win next Tuesday, and I'll hit the ground running, working with President Trump to lower the cost of living for hardworking Tennessee families,” Van Epps said in a statement to CNN. Still, Republicans are bracing for a result that will be closer than the more than 20-point margins posted by Trump and Green a year ago. Chip Saltsman, a Nashville-based Republican strategist not working with the Van Epps campaign, said that unlike Green, an incumbent and former state lawmaker who represented part of the district before the 2022 redistricting, Van Epps is a first-time candidate. He added that while he still expects Van Epps to win, Democrats had done a better job of quickly pivoting to the general election. Behn has made health care and grocery affordability a central part of her message, which she argues has been a common theme of her activism and political work. “I'm someone who hasn't equivocated on affordability,” she said. During her time as a national organizer for Indivisible, a progressive grassroots group, Behn took a leave of absence to help organize protests against the expulsion of two Black lawmakers who protested on the state House floor in favor of gun control. “This race is competitive because the Washington Republican agenda has not delivered,” Behn said. “They have not addressed costs despite the commitment from the Trump administration to make groceries cheaper, utilities cheaper, rent cheaper … and I think people are looking for an opportunity to vote for someone who's going to usher in an era of change.”</p>

Hannah Arrowood, executive director of Present Age Ministries in Charlotte, North Carolina, details the ways human traffickers are targeting children in the area as reported cases reach record levels throughout the state. An epidemic sweeping the country's roadways and causing human trafficking victims to vanish without a trace is being highlighted on the heels of one of the largest child-smuggling busts in United States history. Individuals being trafficked along interstate highways has become increasingly common throughout the U.S. However, data regarding just how many victims are transported along interstate highways remains unavailable, largely due to the secretive nature of such crimes. In November, a multi-regional operation involving several federal, state and local agencies resulted in the rescue of 122 missing or endangered children from ten states, according to Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier. Human trafficking victims are often transported by criminals using interstate highways, making them virtually untraceable by law enforcement. "Many have been through the unthinkable," Uthmeier said, according to FOX13. They need our help now more than ever." Of the victims rescued, 109 children were found in various cities throughout Florida, according to Uthmeier. Thirteen children were also rescued from other states and internationally. Human trafficking is defined as "the use of force, fraud, or coercion to obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act," according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Federal law enforcement reported 36 truck-stop-based instances of human trafficking in 2023, according to the National Human Trafficking Hotline. According to a 2024 report released by the Department of Transportation's (DOT) Advisory Committee on Human Trafficking, global traffickers earn more than $150 billion annually by exploiting victims for both commercial sex and forced labor. "While roadways, railways, waterways, and airways serve as vital arteries of global connectivity and commerce, these same networks can also facilitate the clandestine movement of individuals being subjected to human trafficking by concealing them amidst the vast flow of legitimate passengers," the report states. In 2023, the National Human Trafficking Hotline received a total of 9,619 confirmed reports of human trafficking nationwide, according to the report. While the Hotline does not track transport-related cases, the report indicated there were 36 truck-stop-based instances of trafficking in 2023. Of the confirmed federal sex trafficking cases in 2023, transportation using private vehicles accounted for 38% of reported cases, according to the Human Trafficking Institute's Annual Federal Human Trafficking Report. "These traffickers bring them from different cities and essentially sell them as human goods," Toby Braun, founder of American Special Investigative Group, told Fox News Digital. Victims are often transported between traffickers using interstate highways throughout the country, with a particular emphasis on states and cities with marine ports and international airports. "They may start in South Florida," Braun said. Oftentimes, they may put victims in safe houses there." Braun added that from Charlotte, victims can then be driven to major metropolitan hubs, such as New York City. "You have [trafficking] in a lot of major cities," Braun told Fox News Digital. The DOT has emphasized that the transportation sector plays a key role in both facilitating and preventing human trafficking. Of the confirmed federal sex trafficking cases in 2023, private vehicles were the most common form of transporting victims, accounting for 38% of reported cases, according to the Human Trafficking Institute's Annual Federal Human Trafficking Report. Additionally, transportation using airplanes and rideshares each accounted for 7% of reported cases, respectively, according to the report. Commercial vehicles and rental vehicles each accounted for 3%, with 2% of victims being transported by buses and 1% by train. Braun points to organized criminal groups exploiting transportation methods throughout the country to move victims across state lines. "It makes it tougher because of the kind of resources [these groups] have and their ability to traffic people around, hide them in places and really oftentimes stay undetected," Braun said. Law enforcement also faces numerous hurdles when it comes to tracking down both traffickers and their victims, specifically when individuals are being relocated frequently. "They move people and are trafficking to other locations very quickly," Braun told Fox News Digital. "So, a lot of times when law enforcement gets tips or information, by the time they respond, the victim is already in a completely different place. Braun also indicated that many departments throughout the country lack the manpower or resources to track down traffickers when they are on the move, while suggesting authorities on both the state and federal levels need to further collaborate to track down criminals. The DOT's report echoes this sentiment, stating that the Department of Justice has "little to no data related to human trafficking offenses" involving commercial transit, while calling on officials to establish more robust data collection between federal and state law enforcement. The DOT did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. As a result, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) launched the "Your Roads, Their Freedom" campaign in an effort to educate commercial motor vehicle drivers on the signs of human trafficking. The campaign points to various indicators of victims being transported for human trafficking, including looking for two vehicles exchanging individuals, individuals flashing headlights at people in parking lots or chatter regarding a commercial company's "sale" on citizens band (CB radio). "I think because there's just not enough information out there to make people understand the real issue that's out there, and to really highlight this epidemic that we're facing as a country with human trafficking. I think more people need to know that this is a real problem for our country. You can follow her at @juliabonavita13 on all platforms and send story tips to julia.bonavita@fox.com.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fasil Regassa wipes away tears when he talks about Sarah Beckstrom, the 20-year-old National Guard member who was shot Wednesday just a few feet away from his store. For nine years, Regassa and his wife, immigrants from Ethiopia, have managed a 7-Eleven convenience store just across the street from the shooting scene. In the bustling downtown area of Washington, DC, blocks away from the White House and packed with tourists, chain restaurants, cafes, banks, stores and corporate offices, business community members are still processing the violence and chaos they experienced near the Farragut West Metro Station. Beckstrom and fellow guard member Andrew Wolfe, 24, were shot multiple times by a lone gunman just outside the entrance to the metro station. Both soldiers, members of the West Virginia National Guard, had been deployed to the nation's capital during President Donald Trump's law enforcement surge in August of this year. Regassa said the presence of National Guard members in this district has made the area “more safe” and described the Guard members who have come into his store for snacks and drinks as “completely nice people.” He says he appreciates the guard members and feels the retail area was a more dangerous place before their arrival. He told CNN of an incident in 2020 when he says five assailants overran his store, stole some goods and caused him to suffer a broken leg when one of them crashed down on him as he lay on the floor. Rosa Fuentes was also caught up in the chaos of Wednesday afternoon. Fuentes, who has a 23-year-old daughter, also fought back tears when she reflected on Beckstrom's death. She initially said she thought it could make the area safer, but added, “I don't know,” saying that she's worried about what could happen to the guard members themselves. She said the guardsmen patrolling the area since August have kept a “low profile,” and she is pleased that more of them could be deployed here soon. They'd provide “another layer of protection,” she said. Gyanu Sapkota, an immigrant from Nepal who has managed a Subway sandwich shop near Farragut Square for 18 years, told CNN that guard members would often come into his shop during their deployment, and he said Beckstrom and Wolfe looked familiar to him. Before the arrival of the guard members in the tourist-heavy area, Sapkota said he often had problems with people coming into his store and stealing drinks and bags of chips. Managers of local branches of major banks that operate in Farragut Square, who declined to give their names, described to CNN locking doors and taking cover after the shooting, seeing police converging on the scene and people running past their windows. “I just feel there's ways you can do more in the community to cut violence. The manager of another bank described the guard members in the area as friendly, and he said one of them gave him a patch as a kind gesture. I don't think it'll help the situation.” A 21-year-old Marine, who did not give his name because he's not authorized to speak to the media, placed a vase of roses, an American flag patch and two challenge coins at the memorial. “We need to recognize that a US service member has lost their life.” A note was placed that read: “Praying for all Nat'l Guard — thank you for all you do.” A man who laid flowers said, while he didn't agree with the National Guard's deployment in the city, “she didn't deserve to die.”</p>

All Star Panelists join ‘Special Report' to discuss the Trump administration's decision to halt asylum cases after two National Guard members were attacked in Washington, D.C. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced on Friday that it has halted all asylum decisions following the shooting in Washington, D.C., in which an Afghan national was accused of shooting two National Guard members, including one who died from her injuries. USCIS Director Joseph B. Edlow said the asylum decisions would be suspended "until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible." The pause comes amid a broader immigration crackdown signaled by President Donald Trump, who on Thursday vowed to halt migration from "Third World countries" and reverse Biden-era admissions. National Guard members Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Andrew Wolfe, 24, were shot in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. (United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia/Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Edlow said on Thursday that officials would reexamine green cards issued to immigrants from every "country of concern," including Afghanistan. USCIS also implemented new national security measures to be considered while vetting immigrants from "high risk" countries. ATF and Secret Service officers are seen after two National Guard soldiers were shot near the White House in Washington, D.C., Wednesday, Nov. 26, 2025. The Department of Homeland Security also said it had already halted all immigration requests from Afghanistan and was in the process of reviewing all asylum cases approved under the Biden administration. "The Department of State has IMMEDIATELY paused visa issuance for individuals traveling on Afghan passports," the agency wrote. "The Department is taking all necessary steps to protect U.S. national security and public safety." The alleged gunman, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, faces multiple charges, including one count of first-degree murder and two counts of assault with intent to kill while armed.

He was vetted by the CIA in Afghanistan for his work with the agency and again for his asylum application in the U.S. A senior U.S. official told Fox News he was "clean on all checks" in his background check. Lakanwal had his asylum application approved by the Trump administration earlier this year. A report released by the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General in June found there were "no systemic failures" in Afghan refugee vetting or subsequent immigration pathways.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Migrants deported months before by the United States to El Salvador under the Trump administration's immigration crackdown arrive at Simon Bolívar International Airport in Maiquetia, Venezuela, July 18, 2025. Two planes carrying Venezuelan migrants out of the U.S. were midair on March 15 when a federal judge in Washington ordered the Trump administration to turn them around. That fight entered a critical phase on Friday when U.S. District Judge James Boasberg relaunched an investigation to determine whether the Republican administration deliberately ignored his instruction, letting the planes continue onto El Salvador. The judge previously concluded it did and threatened to have the responsible official or officials prosecuted on a contempt charge. But an appeals court threw Boasberg's decision out. The contempt probe appeared dead until in yet another twist, a larger panel of judges on the same appeals court ruled on November 14 that the investigation could proceed. They are a last resort, former federal judges Jeremy Fogel and Liam O'Grady told The Associated Press in an interview Monday conducted on Zoom. “The judge has to believe that some line may have been crossed that you can't ignore,” said Fogel, who spent 20 years on the bench in Northern California before retiring in 2018. Fogel said the issues raised by Boasberg's contempt probe — whether the migrants were deprived of their due process rights and whether the court's authority was flouted — meet that standard. “Whatever actually happened, I think it would be very hard for him to just let it go,” the judge said. O'Grady, who served in Alexandria, Virginia, just outside Washington, for 16 years, credited Boasberg for his efforts to determine the facts. “He's making sure that his record is absolutely clear,” O'Grady said. Justice Department attorneys had urged him to abandon the probe, but Boasberg said he must determine whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem or anyone else “should be referred for potential contempt prosecution.” In a court filing on Tuesday, Justice Department attorneys said Noem decided the migrants aboard the flights could be transferred to El Salvador after receiving advice from the Homeland Security department's acting general counsel, Joseph Mazzara. Mazzara had received legal advice about the planes from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, according to the filing. The judge's directive to return them was made verbally in court but not included in his written order, government attorneys said in the court filing on Tuesday. “Accordingly, the Government maintains that its actions did not violate the Court's order — certainly not with the clarity required for criminal contempt — and no further proceedings are warranted or appropriate,” they wrote. A federal appeals court judge said in August that the administration's interpretation of Boasberg's order was plausible. Katsas was appointed by President Donald Trump. Trump officials have chafed at judicial oversight and repeatedly contested the power of judges to review executive branch policies, particularly on immigration. After the March 15 ruling, Trump derided the judge as a “troublemaker and agitator” and called for his impeachment. In July, the Justice Department filed a misconduct claim against him, alleging he told Chief Justice John Roberts and other federal judges in March that the administration would trigger a constitutional crisis by disregarding federal court rulings. Boasberg has framed the contempt inquiry as an effort to uphold the U.S. Constitution, which he says requires compliance with judicial orders. Separately, he is considering a request to require the administration to give at least 137 of the migrants, who are now back in Venezuela, a chance to challenge their gang designation. He has accused Trump administration officials of rushing the migrants out of the U.S. and said significant evidence had surfaced indicating that many of them were not connected to the Tren de Aragua gang. But history shows such punishments are rarely issued or allowed to stand against the government. A survey of thousands of federal court opinions published in the Harvard Law Review in 2018 turned up 82 contempt findings against government officials and agencies since the end of World War II. Judges issued or tried to issue fines in 16 of those cases, but higher courts blocked them in all but three. Judges locked up or credibly threatened to lock up a federal agency official in only four of the cases, and high courts similarly intervened to block the sanction, the study by Yale Law School professor Nicholas Parrillo found. Noll, the Rutgers Law professor, said if the inquiry moves ahead, it could influence public debate about whether the administration can carry out its mass deportation policy legally. “A lot of a district court's power just comes from the ability to get an issue in front of the public,” he said in a phone interview on Tuesday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Honduras on Sunday will hold general elections marked by preemptive allegations of voting fraud and an intervention by the United States. The presidential race has been clouded by uncertainty. Out of the several candidates running to succeed Honduran President Xiomara Castro, three have emerged as the frontrunners, but there is no clear favorite to win. “We are in an election with a deep political and economic divide,” political scientist Héctor Soto Caballero told CNN. Castro's term is due to end on January 27, which would mark the first time a left-wing president has finished a term in the country. While Honduras' economy has shown moderate growth under Castro, who has maintained her social protection focus and continued the International Monetary Fund's credit program, the campaign has shifted focus to other polarizing issues. “What's at stake isn't the typical campaign promises, with problems related to health, education and security. The television star is a former ally of Castro who served as her vice president until last year. He has called for labor reforms and stronger trade relations with the West. The construction magnate who is running on a free market platform has been endorsed by US President Donald Trump. CNE president Ana Paola Hall described the move as “interference.” In that regard, she said the situation would follow “the same script as Nicaragua and Venezuela,” two nations whose electoral processes have been denounced and are not recognized by numerous countries in the region. Castro said this week on X that her government “upholds and honors” the principles of personal freedom, democracy and accountability, among others. Americas director at Human Rights Watch Juanita Goebertus warned in a statement that “allegations of possible fraud, aggressive moves by both prosecutors and the army, and political deadlock in the electoral authority are threatening Hondurans' right to participate in free and fair elections.” Eduardo Fuentes, co-director of CNE acknowledged that “there were atypical circumstances and very conflicting positions,” but assured that the institution has met most of its duties. On Friday, Trump made another post, saying he would pardon former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez of the conservative National Party, who is serving a 45-year prison sentence in the US after being convicted of drug trafficking. Soto says opposition candidates have been signaling their ideological ties to Washington, while the ruling party has been committed to maintaining a transactional relationship with the US. In Asfura's case, he wouldn't be much opposition (to the White House); it would be a close influence,” Soto said. Castro's ruling party has met many of Washington's demands on security and migration issues while avoiding direct confrontation. The country is heavily impacted by US immigration measures such as the end of the temporary protected status (TPS) for immigrants, which affected tens of thousands of Hondurans in the US; and remittances, which represent approximately 25% of Honduras' GDP, according to World Bank data. 38 migrants land in Honduras after voluntarily deporting themselves Honduras has fewer tools than other countries to confront this asymmetrical relationship with the White House. “We depend more on the United States and on relations in Central America,” Sánchez said, recalling that Trump has already threatened to impose taxes on remittances and that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio did not include Honduras in his tour of Central America and the Caribbean. Another key aspect of Honduras' foreign policy is its relationship with Venezuela, whose ruling Chavismo movement strongly supported Castro's husband after his coup. The government is definitely a close actor, but it has understood that it is a complex, uncomfortable relationship,” Soto said. Her handpicked successor Moncada has avoided commenting on Venezuela during the campaign, while opposition candidates assured that they would break relations with Caracas if they became president. According to Soto, if tensions between the US and Venezuela were to escalate into a military conflict, it would lead to an increased US presence in Honduras, where American military personnel are stationed at La Palmerola air base. “From a hemispheric perspective, it would have an impact, at least logistically. If there were a government more aligned with Washington, it would be an opportunity to foster closer ties,” he said. The White House also faces another challenge in Honduras: China's growing influence throughout Latin America. However, Soto points out that there has been no significant progress toward a free trade agreement since relations were established. Miami Strategic Intelligence Institute (MSII), a conservative think tank based in Florida, said in a recent report that the election outcomes could “either deepen Beijing's foothold or recalibrate toward US-aligned positions.”</p>
