                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2025 Qatar GP: Liam Lawson and Isack Hadjar meet the fans on stage Oscar Piastri continued his momentum from Sprint Qualifying as he took a strong victory over George Russell and Lando Norris. The third title contender Max Verstappen could only improve from sixth to fourth as he continued to experience a frustrating issue with porpoising, while Kimi Antonelli initially took fifth place after Yuki Tsunoda was handed a time penalty for exceeding track limits. However, Antonelli was also dealt a five-second penalty after the chequered flag, dropping the Mercedes rookie back to sixth and leaving Tsunoda with four points. Piastri stormed to pole position on his final attempt, putting him in the best position to claim the maximum eight points for a win. Alonso was an impressive fourth for Aston Martin, with Tsunoda taking P5, unexpectedly outqualifying his Red Bull team mate Verstappen. The Dutchman typically excels in Sprint Qualifying, having secured 10 pole positions in this format, but he settled for sixth on the grid on this occasion. Just behind, Alonso lost out the most as he was passed by both Red Bulls, with Verstappen improving to P4 within what was a dream couple of corners for him. It was a less than ideal opening lap for Charles Leclerc, who went wide at Turn 2 and dropped from ninth to 13th, landing him in a midfield DRS train. Things didn't look much better for his team mate Hamilton, who was still lingering in P18 after failing to improve on his pit lane start. As Piastri sped up the road, establishing a gap of over a second on the first few laps, Verstappen unsuccessfully attempted to overtake Norris for third place before reporting that “the bouncing is still very bad” – he struggled with porpoising throughout Friday's running and it was evident that the problem had not been fully resolved. Back at the front of the field, Piastri appeared to be in a league of his own having extended his lead to two seconds over Russell by Lap 11. The Mercedes driver was warned that tyre degradation could begin to come into play, but the top three were in little danger of changing order. There was more action outside of the points-paying positions as Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson battled with Leclerc, veering off track while trying to pass the Ferrari. He quickly gave the position back and was not the only one finding difficulty staying within track limits – Tsunoda was revealed to be under investigation for going over the white line too many times, and he was subsequently handed a five-second time penalty. That proved to be good news for Kimi Antonelli, who improved to P6 when Alonso drifted wide at the final corner and looked to gain another position from the Red Bull driver's penalty if he could stay within the track limits himself. However, the Italian youngster ended up being handed a time penalty for identical reasons to Tsunoda, ultimately leaving him in sixth place. He nevertheless had a much better Sprint than the Ferrari pair, who scored zero points as Leclerc and Hamilton crossed the line in P13 and P17 respectively. Others who failed to score were Hadjar in P9 and Alex Albon in P10, followed by Gabriel Bortoleto and Ollie Bearman, meaning that Kick Sauber is still the only team without a point from a Sprint this season. Lawson was 14th ahead of Esteban Ocon and Nico Hulkenberg, with the remaining pit lane starters treating the session as a testing event and pitting for fresh tyres at various stages. "I mean it's been a good weekend so far," said Piastri.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Qatar Sprint victory ‘a nice start to the day' – Piastri George Russell will start between the McLaren pairing for Saturday's Qatar Sprint. George Russell was left surprised with his second place in Sprint Qualifying ahead of the Qatar Grand Prix, claiming performances over one lap "haven't been great recently". The Mercedes driver put in a strong performance on Friday, setting a time good enough to split poleman Oscar Piastri and McLaren team mate Lando Norris on the grid for Saturday's 19-lap Sprint. "It's just nice, my Qualifying hasn't been great recently, bar Singapore," said Russell. "For a while I haven't had a good session so I was pretty happy to get good laps under my belt and I was always sort of there or thereabouts throughout the session, so that was nice. "This track is such a joy to driver around. "I don't want to put a downer on it but Turn 1 is probably going to be where we end up really," he said. "We briefly spoke about it this morning in the Drivers' Briefing about why the DRS hasn't been extended and I hope maybe after the Sprint they can adjust it if needed for the race, but it's going to be very challenging to overtake but obviously we're in a good starting position. Team mate Kimi Antonelli, meanwhile, was left in P7 having just squeezed through to SQ3 after Isack Hadjar was stripped of his final lap time due to track limits. The young Italian had made a small mistake on his own lap, which in turn meant he lost confidence in the final segment of Sprint Qualifying.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2025 Qatar GP: Liam Lawson and Isack Hadjar meet the fans on stage Charles Leclerc never challenged the leaders in Qatar Sprint Qualifying as Ferrari struggled for pace. Charles Leclerc has said Ferrari are "struggling once again this weekend" having only qualified ninth for the Qatar Sprint, while team mate Lewis Hamilton was P18 on a difficult Friday. While team mate Hamilton was unable to progress beyond the opening segment of Qualifying, Leclerc managed to reach SQ3 and posted a lap good enough for ninth on the grid ahead of Saturday's 19-lap Sprint. The Ferrari driver admitted that while a preparation lap for Carlos Sainz's Williams ahead was far from ideal, it ultimately didn't make a significant difference when compared with the leading pace of the McLaren pair and George Russell's Mercedes. "The last lap I think [Sainz] was taking quite a significant gap to the car ahead just before Safety Car line 2 and then obviously it puts all the guys behind under stress," said Leclerc. "He has the right to do that but it's very annoying and it's a but unnecessary sometimes. "I had to start the lap too close and when you see the gap between the top five and us, you can say that could have been a better Qualifying. I think there was potential to do that. Leclerc has failed to reach the podium in the last two Grands Prix at Sao Paulo and Las Vegas, with Ferrari now 13 and 53 points behind Red Bull and Mercedes respectively in the Teams' Championship.</p>
