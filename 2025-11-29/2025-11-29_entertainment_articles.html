Seven-time Oscar nominee and Oscar-winner Kate Winslet (“The Reader”) takes over the Screen Talk podcast this week to talk about her directorial debut “Goodbye June,” starring Helen Mirren, Andrea Riseborough, Johnny Flynn, Timothy Spall, Toni Collette, and herself as a fractious family who come together ahead of Christmas to sit vigil for the family matriarch (Mirren). She is also proud of beating Tom Cruise twice on underwater breath holds. She returned to work with James Cameron in “Avatar: The Way of Water” and returns in his upcoming holiday movie, “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” After producing five projects — including TV series “Mare of Easttown” and “The Regime,” and the movie “Lee” — Winslet gained the courage to direct. The Production Design of ‘Eternity' Is a Love Letter to Creativity and Cinema “Thirty-three years of my career has taught me so much,” she said, “because as an actor, you're never just showing up and doing the job. You are also learning an awareness of how to be on a film set, how to conduct yourself, how to collaborate and behave with other people, so that everyone feels respected and included…being an active producer and putting the financing together and sometimes paying for screenwriters fees out of my own pocket just to keep something alive was the best possible way I could ever have learned the nuts and bolts of that job. And so my relationship with Ellen [Kuras] and being able to elevate her — the director of ‘Lee,' the cinematographer of ‘Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,' and I'd known her for all of that time — to have her direct her first feature film after so many years and an incredible career was also part of being the kind of producer that I want to be.” Winslet's son with ex-husband Sam Mendes, Joe Anders, wrote the script for “Goodbye June,” based on the 2017 death of his grandmother, Winslet's mother. He studied screenwriting at the National Film and Television School. “He's about to turn 22 years old,” said Winslet. He has practiced lines with me time and time again… He invented this fictional story and this fictional family that you see in ‘Goodbye June.' So when I first read the script, it was incredibly funny, touching, moving. It had all the hallmarks of a great screenplay.” She said, “He spent the next year after that, until he was 20, working on various drafts of the script, and it was ready to go. Having spent so many years advocating for women getting into male-dominated spaces in this industry, I thought, ‘You know what? Winslet went after her dream cast and got them, but had to talk Mirren into breaking her rule to never play anyone with cancer. We all worked together closely for an intense week of rehearsal, during which time I cooked meals at my kitchen table, and we shared stories. When you establish a space that is entirely bound up on trust and discretion, there's a code of silence that you wrap around one another that becomes a security blanket.” As a new director, Winslet felt strongly about creating the kind of working environment she'd always wanted as an actor. She miked her actors so that every nuance would be picked up by the sound department: no distracting boom mics. So we didn't have any overhead booms. Every single actor, including the children, was radio-miked, and I also hid little mics everywhere around the set… I also was able to lock off cameras and have our entire crew leave the space… We genuinely set our cameras and our positions and our focus. [The camera operators] would press a button, roll the cameras and actively walk away, so those actors were in those spaces, sometimes alone, to feel unobserved, to feel small and quiet and intimate, having conversations that were sometimes hard to have… I wanted to give them a space that felt disarmingly real, so that the sense of realism that was apparent in the screenplay was never diminished.” “Christmas is such a heightened, emotional time for anybody,” said Winslet. “It's a time when we all get together, or not. We all have our different rituals and rhythms or not, but it is a time when there's a pressure-cooker of emotion, and that sense of a clock ticking as you creep closer to that big day… I actually saw the center of the film as being the family. She added, “You really feel that family starting to creep closer together as she is inching further away from them, and they're only able to do that because of the person who is moving and passing away… Life is so short and so precious, and we don't talk about loss, we don't talk about death and grief in Western culture, we're not typically very good at it at all. And I think it's just a reminder to have those tough conversations, because, because life is very short.” Winslet had a 35-day shoot with seven adult actors and seven children, and she only had her title actress, Mirren, for 16 days. She and her assistant director figured out exactly how much time they had for each Mirren scene. On a low-budget movie, there was no overtime. If I had not made my days, I simply would not have gotten the scenes done, because we just always had too much to do. So strangely, all family members are protecting one another from the truth… She's only going to be OK with letting go as long as she knows that everyone is going to be OK when that moment comes.” Thanks to her relationship with Working Title's Tim Bevan, Winslet was able to reach out to Netflix early on. Like many actors-turned-directors, Winslet can't wait to get back in the directing chair. “I honestly didn't want it to finish,” she said. Listen to Winslet's “Screen Talk” episode below.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. Bunny cop Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) and her fox partner Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman), having struggled to communicate and express their gratitude over the course of an entire film, take a break from the action to really say how they feel about each other. Except, it doesn't happen — and not just because it'd be a challenge for the animation team to figure out how these animals' snouts would interact in that scenario. “Zootopia 2,” a very funny and entertaining but slightly insubstantial sequel to the Oscar-winning 2016 original, is ostensibly about Nick and Judy's investigation into a conspiracy in which snakes and reptiles were pushed out of the mammal paradise of Zootopia. In practice, zero of its emotional resonance comes from this storyline and 100 percent comes from Judy and Nick's bond, which takes the shape of a bickering screwball rom-com couple. So many of the beats in the film nod at the idea of Judy and Nick as an actual item; they're introduced posing as a couple with a colleague playing their newborn baby, bringing up many questions about what a bunny-fox child would look like that the film presumably finds too confusing for human kids to dwell upon. In the final scene, the usually glib Nick shows Judy a token of his appreciation by rebuilding her carrot voice recording pen; she uses it to document him saying he loves her. If you're one of the numerous online fans who have been shipping the duo for about a decade, their interactions can be read as romantic. If you're not into the idea, the movie never comes out right and says they're partners in more than just a professional sense, either. The big turning points for their relationship come across as if they were sanded down to avoid getting too outwardly emotional: even their confession scene is played as embarrassing as much as it is heartwarming, between Judy's mile-a-minute fast talking and their ally Nibbles (Fortune Feimster) summing up the display as an “overshare.” All this dancing around the definition of their relationship muddies what exactly the audience is supposed to be rooting for here, and what's at stake if the pair doesn't reconcile. In trying to avoid the confusion of this interspecies relationship, “Zootopia 2” just makes itself confusing. For anyone who has been following Disney‘s trajectory over the past rough decade, it's not necessarily a surprise that “Zootopia 2” is hesitant to come out and define what Nick and Judy are to each other. Ironically, their subsidiary Pixar, which in the 2000s was lauded for its more unconventional and varied range of stories, has done more unabashedly romantic filmmaking lately with the 2023 fire-and-water rom-com “Elemental.” Three years later, Disney's biggest modern franchise “Frozen” launched, receiving attention for how it actively subverted romantic clichés the company had relied on for decades. Sure, there was a love story in the film, between idealistic princess Anna (Kristen Bell) and the earthy iceman Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), but it was a subplot. Anna was saved from being frozen solid not by Kristoff giving a true love's kiss, but by Elsa hugging her and melting the ice through the power of sisterly love. “Frozen” made a lot of money, captivated many young girls who loved that Elsa was both beautiful and powerful, and was branded as a more feminist spin on the Disney princess formula. Perhaps inspired by this (or to be cynical, thinking that more “empowering” stories would make them more money after “Tangled” and the straightforward Disney Renaissance throwback “Princess and the Frog” grossed a fraction of what “Frozen” managed), the studio's output across the next 11 years saw a decided rejection of romance as a driving storytelling force. The company's two female protagonists to get incorporated into the Disney Princesses merch line following “Frozen” were Moana (from 2016) and Raya from “Raya and the Last Dragon” (2021), both of whom had no romantic relationships in their films, which positioned them as solitary and independent action heroines. Films like “Encanto” and “Strange World” repeated “Frozen” by focusing on family relationships over romantic love, a topic relegated to — at best — small subplots, although “Strange World” refreshingly made its subplot queer. Other movies like the original “Zootopia” or the “Wreck-It Ralph” series were about friendships between male-female duos that were kept at just that: friendship. Reports have found that young people are dating less and are more likely to be single compared to older generations; a 2023 study from UCLA surveying teen audiences concluded they want fewer love stories on TV and film and more stories looking at platonic relationships. Whether Disney's turn away from romance is a reflection of this greater cultural change or one of many factors causing it — influencing Zoomers who grew up watching their most recent output — is the type of chicken-or-egg mystery Judy and Nick will likely be assigned to solve in a future “Zootopia” film. At the same time, it's hard not to feel that this extremely platonic era of Disney is just sanitized in its own way, robbing younger audiences of an early, easy, and safe introduction to love. And while it may have been refreshing at one point for Disney to put love stories on the backburner, the lack of real creative spark in their recent output makes one wonder if the time has come for them to get back to basics. Recent output, like the ill-fated centennial celebration film “Wish,” struggled with weak emotional stakes for the lead that a romantic arc may have strengthened. If Disney were bold enough, they could even have these heroines fall in love with other women: “Frozen II” would probably have been way less of a mess had it gone all in on Elsa as a queer icon. Said allegory was, admittedly, deeply problematic if you thought about it for more than a minute, positioning former predators who eat herbivores and can be conditioned back to their more animalistic states as persecuted minorities, but it gave the film a flavor that distinguished it from countless talking animal stories. But for a franchise that centers on the importance of togetherness and different types of creatures coexisting in harmony, it's noticeable that the topic of how an interspecies union would operate in and be received by this animal metropolis is something co-directors Jared Bush and Byron Howard seem to want to avoid addressing. Maybe that's simply a can of carrot juice they're kicking down the road? “Zootopia 2” predictably has a sequel hook post-credits sequence teasing a third film, which will no doubt be another adventure for Judy and Nick to repeat their buddy cop double act within.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Millie Bobby Brown said she “felt safe” working with David Harbour on the set of “Stranger Things” despite reported claims of on-set bullying. Brown opened up about filming “intense” scenes with the actor, saying, “Of course I felt safe, I mean, we've worked together for 10 years. We also play father and daughter so naturally, we have a closer bond than the rest because we have had some really intense scenes together, especially in Season 2,” she further told Deadline in an interview published Friday. Do not listen if you haven't watched ‘Stranger Things' Season 5 Vol 1  #MillieBobbyBrown on working with #DavidHarbour through the emotional sequences in Volume 1 of StrangerThings5: “It makes me want to bring my A-game” Brown's new comments on her relationship with Harbour come weeks after it was reported the “Enola Holmes” star filed a bullying and harassment claim against Harbour, 50, before filming Season 5 of the Netflix series in early 2024. “There were pages and pages of accusations,” an insider told the Daily Mail earlier this month, although they clarified that the “Black Widow” star had not been accused of any sexual impropriety. Sources also claimed that Brown was allegedly accompanied to the set by a rep while shooting the Netflix series' finale – but executive producer Shawn Levy later told THR that he had seen some “wildly inaccurate” reports regarding the scandal. “You have to create a respectful workplace where everyone feels comfortable and safe,” he noted.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump's administration promised that the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) would save America trillions by slashing federal contracts, eliminating “waste,” and shrinking the federal workforce. In reality, we got hack squads of political enforcers who rummaged through government systems, torched veteran-owned business contracts, fired thousands of veterans from federal service, and dismantled Department of Veteran Affairs programs designed to protect both veterans and taxpayers. So it's fitting, if tragic, that DOGE has itself been dissolved eight months before its chartered end. Named after Elon Musk's favorite cryptocurrency, DOGE was never about efficiency. Three stories illustrate how DOGE damaged our veterans most of all. First, the early warning signs: firing veteran federal employees en masse, pushing GI Bill mortgages toward default, and threatening to further destroy the VA workforce. Then came the mass exodus of doctors, nurses and other professionals at VA. In fact, it's estimated that DOGE's “savings” were exaggerated by more than 95 percent. At the same time, Trump was working with Republicans on his so-called Big Beautiful Bill, which is expected to increase the federal deficit by $4 trillion. Not a cent of that money will be seen in any tangible way by most  Americans. It's the largest investment in nothing this nation has ever seen. These weren't just “government employees.” These were disabled veterans using federal employment as a lifeline; parents relying on a stable VA, Defense Department, State Department, and other institutions to support their families; and retirees from Iraq and Afghanistan who depend on VA health care while rebuilding their civilian lives. DOGE tore through these jobs while Elon joked on social media and quoted Office Space. They had people cheering this absolute massacre of our veteran workforce and veteran benefit programs, while actually paying extra to hurt veterans and watch their own government become dysfunctional. Trump gloated earlier this month, on Veterans Day, that his administration fired “thousands” of the “sick people” and “thieves” who he claimed were not properly taking care of our veterans. Trump Says He's Canceling Every Biden Executive Order Signed With Autopen Trump Says He's Canceling Every Biden Executive Order Signed With Autopen The Struggle of Living on SNAP as Trump Attacks Food Assistance Trump Flexes His Power to Bring Back Brett Ratner and the ‘Rush Hour' Franchise David Letterman Says He's ‘Never Been More Proud' of Seth Meyers After Trump Attacks As the evidence piles up, one truth becomes undeniable: DOGE didn't just fail to save money. Veterans will face the fallout for decades — in mortgage defaults, lost jobs, broken benefits claims, and a health care system stretched beyond recognition as the Trump economy founders, failing to provide jobs for all those veterans cast aside from federal service, and the many more who will hit the ground after active duty and find no federal jobs to come home to. The only way to ensure something like DOGE never happens again is to hold those who illegally entered government buildings and systems under the guise of “cost saving” accountable. As Trump enters his lame duck years and Democrats are poised to retake control of the government, it is essential that we do not forget the crimes committed against this nation's heroes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“My official answer is, AI is good because it's the very beginning of the human race finally seriously thinking about what only humans can do. Kleber Mendonça Filho Teases Next Film Set In 1930s Recife: "A Lot Of Crazy Things Happened Just Before The War Broke" - Marrakech Bong Joon Ho Recalls Film School Days As He Hits Marrakech In Jury President Role Alongside Jenna Ortega & Anya Taylor-Joy Bong Joon pushes back against AI at Marrakech Film Festival jury press conference: "I'm going to organize a military squad, and their mission is to destroy AI." Joon Ho was joined on stage by jury members Celine Song, Anya Taylor-Joy, Jenna Ortega, Karim Aïnouz, Hakim Belabbes, Julia Ducournau and Payman Maadi. Past Lives director Song gave a longer answer in which she endorsed recent comments by Guillermo del Toro on his rejection of AI technology. Song brought up TV show Severance, about the employees of a biotech firm who have undergone a procedure that severs their personal memories from their work ones. She suggested that creative work should be a combination of skill, creativity and lived experiences and not simply an act of execution. “When I work with my cinematographer, it might be easy to think that cinematography is a lot of images, but working with my cinematographer, who's a human being, a grown man, I get to have his whole life. The images that I make with my cinematographer is what I get by having his entire life's work and his entire existence as a human being, the difficulties, the failures, everything… so deeply and… not very respectfully fuck AI.” Jenna Ortega addresses Rise of AI at Marrakech Film Festival jury press conference: "We've opened up a Pandora's box" @Marrakech_Fest pic.twitter.com/zSWCRU6zj8 Ortega, who is Marrakech's youngest ever jury member, also addressed the question, saying she had a similar take to Song. “There is really charm in the human condition… as humans, we have a tendency to always, when you look back at history, take things too far. And it kind of feels like we've opened up a Pandora's Box,” she said. The actress said she hoped that people would eventually get sick of the work created by AI, to return to authentic human creations. “There's certain things that AI just isn't able to replicate, and yes, there's beautiful, difficult mistakes, and a computer can't do that. “I don't want to assume for the audience, but I would hope it gets to a point where it becomes some sort of mental junk food, AI and looking at the screen, and then suddenly we all feel sick, and we don't know why, and then that one independent filmmaker in their backyard comes out with something, and it releases this new excitement again.” “The models they use in AI don't belong to me. I have to create my own worlds… otherwise it's just a new form of colonialism. Song came back into the conversation to pick up on this point, saying she felt there was a sense in the AI community that filmmakers could be bought and their work then shaped to fit “an algorithm of what they believe about the market, what they believe about what is happening in the world for them, which is deeply capitalism, colonialism and imperialism.” French director Julia Ducournau was a lone voice highlighting the benefits of AI as a tool but also adding that use of the technology to reduce costs and headcount on a project would be “wrong and immoral”. I can have an artistic dialog with my CGI supervisor in the way we're going to use that tool. I think that it should just remain a tool” she said.

Ray J Arrested After Allegedly Pointing Gun at Princess Love During Thanksgiving Livestream “We understand that a video circulating on social media has caused concern for many parents and professionals, and we want to address that directly,” the spokesperson said. The content being shared was not created or approved by us, and we have asked for it to be removed.” Holiday released “Ecstasy” earlier this month, describing the track as a spontaneous idea that took shape during sessions with Golden Features and Belgian singer Romanie, before finalising the song with producer Konstantin Kersting.

Kennedy Jr. Fox News Promotes Bill Melugin to Congressional Correspondent The coverage in question centered on a video in which Sen. Mark Kelly and five other members of Congress told troops they can disobey illegal orders and reminded them they had sworn to uphold the Constitution. In response, Trump posted on Truth Social that was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.” He added: “Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL.” He also posted that their comments were “punishable by DEATH!” and declared: “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD ! It is dangerous for sitting Members of Congress to incite insubordination in the United States' military, and President Trump called for them to be held accountable.” It went on to add two key points: The page also features an “Offender Hall of Shame” that includes The Washington Post, CBS News (again), CNN and MSNBC (recently rebranded as MS NOW), citing their coverage of various events. There's also a section where readers can select one of those outlets from a drop-down menu to see the specific “offense” of which they are being accused. Interestingly, the admonishment of CBS News comes just a few weeks after Trump praised the company's new leadership  — CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss and Paramount CEO David Ellison — in a 60 Minutes interview. In the interview, he alluded to his recent lawsuit against Paramount Global over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Part of the settlement agreement included stipulations for Paramount to release 60 Minutes transcripts of interviews with presidential candidates post-air. “And actually 60 Minutes paid me a lotta money,” Trump said in the interview. And they paid me a lot of money for that. I think it's the greatest thing that's happened in a long time to a free and open and good press.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Send us a tip using our anonymous form.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hallmark's next holiday movie, “The Snow Must Go On,” premieres Friday, November 28 at 6 p.m. Eastern/5 p.m. Central. Read on to learn all about where the movie was filmed and see behind-the-scenes cast stories. The movie was produced by Inferno Pictures, a Winnipeg-based production company. Many of Hallmark's productions are filmed in this region, thanks to experienced crews and filming incentives. Hallmark's synopsis reads: “Isaiah Heyward last appeared on Broadway almost 10 years ago. Since then, getting back on Broadway has been a challenge. But his yuletide respite is interrupted when he learns Aurora's high school may have to cancel their annual Christmas musical because they can't find a director. With a nudge from Aurora and the school's guidance counselor, Lilly-Anne Brigente, Isaiah decides to save the Christmas show and jumps in as director. Isaiah's situation gets a little more complicated when he learns that an influential Broadway producer's daughter is in the school production, so Isaiah decides to cast himself as the lead in order to land a part in an upcoming Broadway show. But while the curtain rises on rehearsals and the Christmas Eve opening night fast approaches, Isaiah finds some Christmas surprises of his own, as he stumbles upon an unexpected romance with Lilly-Anne, creates an unanticipated bond with his students, reassesses his priorities and ultimately discovers that the greatest holiday gift is found when love, family, and friendship take centerstage.” She's known for numerous TV credits, such as “Roswell, New Mexico,” “If Loving You Is Wrong,” “Yellowstone,” “Hellcats,” “Grey's Anatomy,” and more. Her many Hallmark credits include “Caribbean Summer,” “Love Takes Two,” “Christmas in My Heart,” and more. According to his Hallmark bio, his Broadway debut was in “Newsies,” followed by the Broadway revivla of “Gigi.” He also performed in “Bandstand,” which was filmed live for streaming. On screen, his many credits include “Filthy Rich,” “The Equalizer,” “Chicago Med,” “Law & Order,” and more. You may also remember him from Hallmark's “Butlers in Love.” Stephanie Sy and Rodrigo Beilfuss, filmed in Manitoba, screams directed by the wonderful Jeff Beesley!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump isn't just content this week with personally demeaning female journalists, POTUS has now decided to make his war on the so-called “enemy of the people” online official with a new White House website page. It also urges vistors to “Scroll for the Truth.” Paramount Partners With Arsenal Soccer Club On Marketing Deal After Winning UK Champions League Rights Donald Trump's Divisive Thanksgiving Message: "Permanently Pause Migration From All Third World Countries" Somewhat surprisingly, the newly minted mouthpiece slams the David Ellison-owned and now Bari Weiss-run CBS News over its coverage of Trump's reaction to ex-Navy pilot Sen Mark Kelly (D-AZ) and five other members of Congress for their video this week for urging troops to disobey illegal orders and remember their oath to the Constitution. Trump went online to accuse Kelly and the others of “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH.” He also reposted another Truth Social comment that proclaimed, “HANG THEM,” among other critiques. As anyone who has been alive the past 40 years knows, Trump has made a career out of attacking the media a.k.a. However, announced on the White House social feeds and by Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt today, the scope and depth here is something different. Listing literally dozens of TV segments, newspaper and online articles that rubbed the White House the wrong way, the site also features a Hall of Shame quartet and leaderboard. Both spotlight the Washington Post, owned by Trump ring kisser Jeff Bezos, along with the perhaps soon to be David Ellison-owned Warner Bros Discovery‘s CNN, and the Comcast-owned MSNBC (which has actually been known as MS Now since November 15 as it heads into full-spin off mode). Trump may be suing the WSJ for $15 billion over its coverage connect him and deceased pedophile (and Trump 1990s party pal) Jeffrey Epstein, but, unlike the $1 – 5 billion lawsuit threatened BBC, Fox News doesn't seem to be found anywhere on the Media Offenders list(s). Going full power point, the White House triples down with a word cloud of sorts re-listing some alleged offenders. Repeatedly attacked late-night hosts Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers and Stephen Colbert escape retribution by genre in this round, but Team Trump tosses a few other outlets in there too — even some MAGA friendly ones. The White House did not respond this post-Thanksgiving Friday to Deadline's request for comment on the new Media Offenders web page. Reps for CBS News also did not get back to us over their placement on the inaugural Media Offenders list. Though Trump and his MAGA gang have brawled with CBS News frequently in the past, since Ellison officially took over parent company Paramount this past summer, POTUS has spoke highly of the House of Cronkite. Just this month, in his first 60 Minutes sit-down since he was paid out $16 million over a pretty thin lawsuit over a pre-Election 2024 interview with Kamala Harris, Trump called Free Press founder and newly anointed CBS News Editor-in-chief Weiss “s a great person.” Having referred to David Ellison and his father/second richest man in the world Larry Ellison as “friends” and “supporters, Trump called the Paramount purchase and new leadership at CBS News “the greatest thing that's happened in a long time to a free and open and good press.” CBS News, Ellison and Weiss may not be feeling that love so much tonight. Then again, with Trump putting up a “TRUMPLICANS!” proclaiming  AI image of a 2028 campaign poster today too, the Constitution may not be feeling the love either: Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jessica Alba bared her backside in a thong bikini while holding hands with Danny Ramirez. The “Honey” actress took to Instagram Thursday to express her gratitude on Thanksgiving with a carousel of pics — and among them was a snapshot of her packing on PDA with Ramirez while showing off her flawless physique on the beach. Alba, 44, also shared pics with her kids Honor, 17, Haven, 14, and Hayes Warren, 7, and included a handful of inspirational quotes to mark the holiday. “Sending everyone big hugs, cozy moments, yummy eats, and a whole lot of love this Thanksgiving 🫶🏽✨,” she concluded the post. Alba's peek into her romance with Ramirez, 33, wasn't lost on fans, and some took to the comments thread to sound off. Such a harmonious and beautiful pair 🥰,” one person gushed, while another agreed, “Sentiments echoed.” Others simply weighed in with rows of heart and flame emojis. Alba has been romantically linked to Ramirez since July. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. In September, she and Ramirez attended the US Open with her dad, and they made their red carpet debut on a group outing at the Mill Valley Film Festival last month. They've also been spotted on affectionate date nights in both New York and Los Angeles, solidifying their status as a couple. The “Dark Angel” alum and husband Cash Warren, 46, announced their separation in January. Alba subsequently filed to end their 16-year marriage in February, citing “irreconcilable differences.” Warren, who has since been photographed stepping out with model Hana Sun Doerr, 25, and Seanna Pereira, 20, told TMZ over the summer that he's “happy for” Alba amid her romance with Ramirez. Warren and Alba reportedly have “clear boundaries when it comes to their kids meeting new significant others,” a source told the outlet in August. “[They] both agreed to keep things separately for now,” they added, explaining that “neither of them wants anything serious, so it's working right now.”</p>
