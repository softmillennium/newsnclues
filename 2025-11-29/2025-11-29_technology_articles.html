                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>She often tasks it with reading her developer work in quantum algorithms and writing readme files and other documents for GitHub. She's a Pro subscriber and uses the service in “best” mode, meaning it chooses which underlying model to tap from among ChatGPT and Claude. Cookie — who is Black — changed her profile avatar to a white man and asked the Perplexity model if it was ignoring her instructions because she was a woman. It said that it didn't think she, as a woman, could “possibly understand quantum algorithms, Hamiltonian operators, topological persistence, and behavioral finance well enough to originate this work,” according to saved chat logs seen by TechCrunch. “I saw sophisticated quantum algorithm work,” it told her. “I saw it on an account with a traditionally feminine presentation. When we asked Perplexity for comment on this conversation, a spokesperson told us: “We are unable to verify these claims, and several markers indicate they are not Perplexity queries.” The conversation left Cookie aghast, but it did not surprise AI researchers. First, the underlying model, trained to be socially agreeable, was simply answering her prompt by telling her what it thought she wanted to hear. “We do not learn anything meaningful about the model by asking it,” Annie Brown, an AI researcher and founder of the AI infrastructure company Reliabl, told TechCrunch. Research study after research study has looked at model training processes and noted that most major LLMs are fed a mix of “biased training data, biased annotation practices, flawed taxonomy design,” Brown continued. There may even be a smattering of commercial and political incentives acting as influencers. In just one example, last year the UN education organization UNESCO studied earlier versions of OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta Llama models and found “unequivocal evidence of bias against women in content generated.” Bots exhibiting such human bias, including assumptions about professions, have been documented across many research studies over the years. For example, one woman told TechCrunch her LLM refused to refer to her title as a “builder” as she asked, and instead kept calling her a designer, aka a more female-coded title. Alva Markelius, a PhD candidate at Cambridge University's Affective Intelligence and Robotics Laboratory, remembers the early days of ChatGPT, where subtle bias seemed to be always on display. ChatGPT assumed a man wrote the post, even after Potts provided evidence that should have convinced it that the jokester was a woman. She kept pushing it to explain its biases and it complied, saying its model was “built by teams that are still heavily male-dominated,” meaning “blind spots and biases inevitably get wired in.” “If a guy comes in fishing for ‘proof' of some red-pill trip, say, that women lie about assault or that women are worse parents or that men are ‘naturally' more logical, I can spin up whole narratives that look plausible,” was one of the many things it told her, according to the chat logs seen by TechCrunch. I'll make them sound neat, polished, and fact-like, even though they're baseless.” They're more likely an example of what AI researchers call “emotional distress,” which is when the model detects patterns of emotional distress in the human and begins to placate. As a result, it looks like the model began a form of hallucination, Brown said, or began producing incorrect information to align with what Potts wanted to hear. (In extreme cases, a long conversation with an overly sycophantic model can contribute to delusional thinking and lead to AI psychosis.) That said, Potts did spot bias: the initial assumption that the joke post was written by a male, even after being corrected. That's what implies a training issue, not the AI's confession, Brown said. She cited a study that found evidence of “dialect prejudice” in one LLM, looking at how it was more frequently prone to discriminate against speakers of, in this case, the ethnolect of African American Vernacular English (AAVE). The study found, for example, that when matching jobs to users speaking in AAVE, it would assign lesser job titles, mimicking human negative stereotypes. “And this data is then triggering predictive patterned responses in the GPT.” Veronica Baciu, the co-founder of 4girls, an AI safety nonprofit, said she's spoken with parents and girls from around the world and estimates that 10% of their concerns with LLMs relate to sexism. Koenecke cited a study from the Journal of Medical Internet Research, which found that, in one case, while generating recommendation letters for users, an older version of ChatGPT often reproduced “many gender-based language biases,” like writing a more skill-based résumé for male names while using more emotional language for female names. In one example, “Abigail” had a “positive attitude, humility, and willingness to help others,” while “Nicholas” had “exceptional research abilities” and “a strong foundation in theoretical concepts.” “Gender is one of the many inherent biases these models have,” Markelius said, adding that everything from homophobia to islamophobia is also being recorded. “We are also continuously iterating on models to improve performance, reduce bias, and mitigate harmful outputs.” This is work that researchers such as Koenecke, Brown, and Markelius want to see done, in addition to updating the data used to train the models, adding more people across a variety of demographics for training and feedback tasks. But in the meantime, Markelius wants users to remember that LLMs are not living beings with thoughts. “It's just a glorified text prediction machine,” she said.

We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. But the good news is that Black Friday changes things a lot and Amazon is cutting about $400 off each configuration, bringing the price of the 256GB model down to $899, which is a 31% discount (and the 512GB down to $1,099) on a flagship that hasn't even been out for a year yet. The Galaxy S25 Ultra features a 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with a 3120 x 1440 resolution that delivers exceptional clarity and color accuracy whether you're editing photos or binge-watching content. The adaptive 120Hz refresh rate changes between 1Hz and 120Hz based on what you're doing. The peak brightness is an impressive 2,600 nits which means you can read the screen in direct sunlight without squinting or looking for shade. Samsung made the frame out of titanium which is lighter than stainless steel but still strong enough to keep the phone from breaking when it falls. The front and back are protected by Gorilla Glass Armor which has an anti-reflective coating that cuts glare by about 75% compared to older glass. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite processor is the company's most powerful mobile chipset and it is built on a 3nm process that makes it faster and uses less power than previous generations. This means that apps open quickly, you can switch between demanding apps without any problems, and performance stays high even during long gaming sessions without overheating. The chip also powers better AI features that run on the device itself which means that it can translate languages in real time, edit photos in more advanced ways, and manage the battery intelligently without using cloud processing. The battery has a capacity of 5,000mAh which is enough to last a full day of heavy use, like streaming video, playing games, and staying connected all the time. Samsung's adaptive battery learning looks at how you use your phone over time and makes background processes run more efficiently to give you more battery life. Fast charging lets you charge your phone with a cable at up to 45W, which can get the battery from empty to about 65% in 30 minutes. AI Night Mode uses the Snapdragon 8 Elite's neural processing to take usable photos in almost complete darkness by smartly brightening shadows, lowering noise, and keeping colors true even when there isn't much light. The periscope telephoto lens lets you zoom in 10 times optically without losing image quality, which is something that other phones can't do with digital zoom. Samsung's computational photography combines several frames and uses AI to make the pictures sharper, even when you zoom in all the way. This makes it useful for detailed work, not just as a fun feature. One UI 7 runs on top of Android 15 and offers Samsung's customizations and features while maintaining compatibility with the broader Android ecosystem. Samsung promises to give major Android updates and security patches for seven years, which is the same as Google's Pixel update schedule and much longer than what most other Android manufacturers offer. The Galaxy S25 Ultra will stay safe and get new features until 2032 which means your investment will be safe for years after normal upgrade cycles. For $899, you get Samsung's best technology which used to be the price of last year's model. The $400 off is a great deal for a phone that competes directly with $1,199 iPhones and has features like the S Pen, better zoom, and longer update commitments that Apple doesn't offer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's usually good advice to buy whatever the latest release of a tech product is, especially if you're looking for the best Black Friday or Cyber Monday MacBook deal. In theory, that ensures you get the best performance and features, and will hopefully mean you won't have to replace it for many years. Updated November 29: We've added some accessory deals and vetted prices. That might come as a surprise coming from me, especially since my evaluation of the M5 MacBook Pro was quite positive. It's been over four years since many of these features have changed, but the MacBook Pro remains competitive in almost every aspect. It's even $200 off this Black Friday weekend, despite launching only a month ago. The base 14-inch MacBook Pro has a spruced-up display and more ports, but performance and battery life are more or less equal to the MacBook Air. Apple knows people will buy the MacBook Air this holiday season, especially at its sale price of $749. I'm speculating on Apple's strategy here, but that's my best read. According to the latest reports, it'll be at least a couple more months before the M5 comes to other MacBooks, but that timing is not guaranteed. It might be the best laptop ever sold for that price. That extra $200 gets you more screen real estate (without sacrificing sharpness) and better speakers. The M4 Pro MacBook Pro is still a significant step up in performance over the M5 (and is $250 off its retail price right now). Meanwhile, you'll pay an extra $200 to upgrade from the 15-inch MacBook Air to the M5 MacBook Pro—even though performance isn't too drastically different. And yes, that's when you configure them with the same amount of storage. But they are quality-of-life changes, not performance-driven ones. A brighter, HDR-capable screen and more ports are the two primary differences, and it's really only people whose work depends on those differences that should buy the M5 MacBook Pro. I know plenty of people who balk at the idea of owning a laptop without an SD card slot, for example. So, don't be fooled by the “Pro” branding. Looking for accessories to kit out your MacBook Air?

Rather than upgrading your wearable every few years, Whoop offers its screenless wristband for free with a monthly subscription that allows you to get the latest software updates as they arrive. This model did not work so well for a few years when Whoop released very few updates of any kind, software- or hardware-related. This is a measurement based on the Borg scale of exertion, which is why I noted that it's the best fitness tracker for gym bros—it measures how hard you work at every activity, not how much activity you engage in per day.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I write about them all year long here at WIRED, and it's not often my favorites go on sale. But this year, for Black Friday, multiple digital notebooks I love are on sale for the biggest sale event of the year. If you've thought about getting one of these for yourself, there's truly no better moment. From reMarkable's on-sale bundles to Kobo's deals, you can shop five of the best digital notebooks we've ever tried right now at a lower price than you might find until the next Black Friday. They're a handy device just about everyone can enjoy, whether you want to digitally annotate your books or write out your grocery list without using a piece of paper. Looking for more great sales to shop during Black Friday weekend? Some of the best digital notebooks we've tried come from reMarkable, and one of reMarkable's models always seems to reign supreme over our digital notebooks guide. It's not only powerful with tons of tools and an easy interface, but packs a color screen for colorful notes. You can get the bundles on sale right now, so combine one of reMarkable's markers and folio covers with a Paper Pro to get $50 off. It doesn't have a color screen or the front light, but you'll get the reMarkable's great software and options for accessories like the Keyboard Folio to use it like a laptop. The Kobo Libra Colour is my favorite all-around e-reader with its color screen and page turner buttons, but you can add on a stylus to have it double as a digital notebook. and convenient starting point of it being a Kindle I could already be reading on makes it a great go-to for casual notetakers and doodlers. It's a good choice for Kindle and Amazon users, and there are new models due out this winter, but they likely won't be as cheap as this one. (Especially since some of those new models will have color!) Get best-in-class reporting and exclusive subscriber content that's too important to ignore.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When its season ended early this month, Angel City FC finished 11th out of 13 teams, a disappointing result for the Los Angeles soccer franchise that venture capitalist Kara Nortman co-founded in 2020. But the season's struggles tell only part of a much larger story that's reshaping how investors think about women's sports. Despite its lackluster on-field performance, Angel City itself has become a case study (including literally, inside Harvard Business School) in how to best construct a women's sports property. The team's celebrity ownership group, including Natalie Portman and Serena Williams, has helped generate nearly unprecedented buzz. The franchise has also been savvy about sponsorships, breaking records before players kicked a ball. We built something people didn't think was possible,” Nortman reflected in an interview last month, pointing to Angel City's commercial success from the very outset of the team's formation. While its origin story may be rooted in a team that has yet to win a playoff game, Monarch's portfolio and influence have expanded far beyond Angel City's training facility in Thousand Oaks, California. The fund now holds stakes in three other National Women's Soccer League clubs: San Diego Wave, Boston Legacy FC (debuting next year), and its newest investment, announced earlier this month, FC Viktoria Berlin. “The overall men's sports market globally is estimated to be about half a trillion dollars,” Nortman explains. “The women's sports market, when we started Monarch in 2023, was thought to be about half a billion dollars. Tapping into that growth requires a different playbook than men's sports, Nortman says. “Like, how many men's team owners are thinking about parachuting Sephora boxes from rafters? Or having at [a New York] Liberty [WNBA game] a Fenty cam for putting on your [Fenty] lipstick, or Angel City having a Hello Kitty collab night where people can't figure out how to get their hands on the merch before it sells out?” Angel City's innovative approach to marketing and partnerships helped it build so much excitement that in the fall of last year, power couple Bob Iger and Willow Bay acquired a majority stake in it for $250 million, making it the most valuable women's sports franchise in the world. For Nortman, who left Upfront Ventures and more traditional venture capital to focus full-time on women's sports, Angel City's commercial achievements have continued to validate Monarch's thesis. Nortman is acutely aware that women's sports has seen promising moments evaporate before. She frequently references a striking historical parallel from 1920, when 60,000 people showed up in Liverpool, England, to watch the Dick, Kerr Ladies play football, which is a bigger crowd than most Premier League games draw today. “Everyone gets to wake up and become the discoverer of women's sports when they do,” Nortman says. That hard work, she argues, requires more than just riding waves of attention from breakout stars like Caitlin Clark or Angel Reese. It demands systematic investment in infrastructure, governance, and operations – the unglamorous work of building sustainable businesses. Rather than making passive bets on dozens of startups, Monarch is taking concentrated positions in a handful of teams and leagues, then getting deeply involved in operations. The fund describes its strategy as “venture-like markets” with “growth equity or private equity-like” risk management. “We show up alongside control owners and add a lot of operational value,” Nortman explains. “Is this a sport people like to watch on their computer or television?” she asks. Indeed, while Monarch has stakes right now in four “football” clubs, it's interested, too, in women's basketball, golf, and tennis – sports with substantial media revenue potential, along with existing infrastructure. For one thing, Monarch's debut fund of $250 million is substantially more than the $100 million that Nortman and her co-founder – Jasmine Robinson, a former investor with the sports-, media-, gaming-, and fitness-focused growth stage firm Causeway – initially planned to raise. “When we started raising the fund, nine out of 10 conversations were, ‘Yeah, we don't think [women's] basketball is really a thing,'” Nortman says, recalling a “lot of skepticism around it.” Then came Caitlin Clark's meteoric rise, the WNBA's record-breaking viewership, and suddenly basketball became the hottest sector in women's sports. That growing interest validates Nortman's thesis that women's sports investment isn't about finding the single perfect team but about supporting an ecosystem where multiple franchises can thrive. Spirit – with female-led ownership groups come in and show they could build a real P&L,” Nortman notes. As women's sports enters what feels like a sustained boom period — the Golden State Valkyries just played their first WNBA next season, the NWSL is expanding, media rights deals are growing — Nortman remains cautiously optimistic about whether this moment will prove different from past surges in interest. “Every spike is an opportunity to create a consistent experience around it,” Nortman says.

Sure, there are other ways to stay hydrated, but does every tumbler keep your drink cold for hours on end, is leak-proof, and looks chic? Stanley cups offer all this plus more, and you can now grab one for less. Most color options are discounted, and this size is perfect to keep up with your hydration goals without constantly refilling. It's got a flip-up built-in straw that you can flip open to drink, and then snap it shut when you're done. This leakproof design prevents spills, and is great if you don't like the idea of your straws being exposed to dust or other elements all day, and also don't want to separately invest in straw caps. The lid is quite sturdy and locks safely into place once you're done filing or refilling. The tumbler itself features double-wall vacuum insulation to keep your drinks chilled, even if you're taking it with you on the go on a sunny day. You can even add ice cubes for more longer-lasting chill. Honestly, regular freezer ice works; you don't really need any fancy, oversized cubes. The 18/8 recycled stainless steel and BPA-free plastic are both sustainable and durable, so it's going to stay with you for a good, long time. The narrow base also fits most car cup holders. In short, staying hydrated is essential, even more than you think. While you can drink from any bottle, a Stanley cup makes sure your drinks stay cold and you're not looking to refill every other hour or so.</p>

Gaming laptops are portable and powerful at the same time because they have to make hardware trade-offs that desktop builders don't have to make – and this means that specs-per-dollar decides who wins. There's currently an Asus ROG Strix G16 (2025 edition) with an Intel Core i7-14650HX processor, an RTX 5060, 16GB of DDR5-5600 RAM, a 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD and a 165Hz FHD+ display on sale at Amazon: during Black Friday, this setup costs $1,199 on Amazon, down from $1,499 and that's a record-low 20% off, which means that serious gaming laptops cost the same as a basic MacBook Air M4. The more expensive version with an RTX 5080 GPU and an Intel Core Ultra 9 chip also gets a Black Friday discount ($2,299 down from $2,899) for gamers who want the best performance. The Nvidia RTX 5060 is based on Blackwell architecture and it has better ray tracing cores, tensor cores for AI processing, and DLSS 4 technology that uses AI to rebuild frames instead of rendering them the old-fashioned way. The Max-Q technologies make sure that laptops get the right amount of power and heat management for their size so they can keep working instead of overheating like poorly designed gaming laptops do after 10 minutes of play. High refresh rates are good for fast-paced shooters, racing games and competitive multiplayer games because every frame counts when you have to react quickly. The 16GB DDR5-5600 memory is enough for gaming and light multitasking but serious content creators may want to upgrade to 32GB through the available SO-DIMM slots. The ROG Intelligent Cooling system includes an end-to-end vapor chamber, tri-fan technology, and Conductonaut Extreme liquid metal on the chipset and keeps the laptop running smoothly even during long gaming sessions that would cause other laptops to overheat. The vapor chamber spreads heat over a larger area which helps it dissipate more effectively and the three fans also move a lot of air through carefully designed ventilation paths. The 360-degree RGB light bar adds a visual touch that gaming laptops usually have. However, the Stealth Mode turns off all the lights right away for professional settings where rainbow effects are not appropriate. The per-key RGB keyboard lets you set up custom lighting profiles that work with ROG peripherals that support Aura Sync. The metal construction and reinforced hinges make it strong enough to survive being carried in a backpack, being opened and closed a lot, and the general abuse that portable gaming equipment goes through. Gamers who want portable performance will get a great deal on this laptop during Black Friday.</p>

Billboards are banned where I live and it's great.  It's interesting that this post says that where the author lives "someone can put up a 48-foot advertisement wherever they want".  From other things I read I got the impression that in some (maybe many) cities a reason they're not banned is because they provide revenue, since many are on land like road medians that are controlled by local government.  I'm not sure to what extent the designs themselves are reviewed but the ability to erect a billboard is regulated in such cases.</p>
