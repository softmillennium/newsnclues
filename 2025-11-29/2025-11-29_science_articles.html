                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A third shape hidden in the infamous Vitruvian Man drawing suggests an even deeper understanding of human anatomy than previously known. Art, by its nature, often lends itself to multiple readings or interpretations. That's precisely what happened recently, when a British dentist took a look at one of the most iconic images ever drawn: Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man. “For if a man be placed flat on his back,” he wrote, “...with his hands and feet extended, and a pair of compasses centred at his navel, the fingers and toes of his two hands and feet will touch the circumference of a circle described therefrom.” But this was not the only shape that Vitruvius noticed could fit the human form: Leonardo da Vinci's drawing—made centuries after Vitruvius' musings—illustrates the manner in which man could indeed fit within those described shapes. But, as ArtNet News recently reported, the famed polymath and Renaissance man may have stowed away a third shape hidden within his drawing, one which was only recently been remarked upon. Dr. Rory Mac Sweeney, the aforementioned dentist, published his assessment in the Journal of Mathematics and Arts, that Leonardo's famed drawing “incorporates geometric principles that anticipate modern understanding of optimal biological architecture,” by way of a third shape, located between the man's legs: an equilateral triangle. If, Sweeney posits, one were to create five more triangles of equal dimension all originating from that navel point, it would create the “hexagonal pattern behind the ratio of approximately 1.64—a tetrahedral ratio—between the square's side and the circle's radius,” which Sweeney describes as “a mathematical relationship that defines optimal spatial arrangements in both synthetic and biological systems.” Sweeney even draws parallels between the ratios found in Leonardo's illustration and Buckminster Fuller's Isotropic Vector Matrix from 1975, concluding that “the same geometric relationships that appear in optimal crystal structures, biological architectures, and Fuller's coordinate systems seem to be encoded in human proportions, suggesting that Leonardo intuited fundamental truths about the mathematical nature of reality itself.” Michale Natale is a News Editor for the Hearst Enthusiast Group.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study examining cognitively impaired professional boxers and mixed martial arts fighters reports that the brain's waste-clearing system appears to weaken after repeated blows to the head. Sports-related traumatic brain injuries represent up to 30 percent of all brain injury cases, with boxing and mixed martial arts among the leading contributors. Sustained head impacts over time are known risk factors for both neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions. "It's vital for helping the brain flush out metabolites and toxins." The DTI-derived ALPS index is a non-invasive marker of glymphatic function. "When this system doesn't work properly, damaging proteins can accumulate, which have been linked to Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia," said Dr. Amin, now an assistant professor of neuroradiology at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. "Studying this system gives us a new window into understanding and possibly slowing memory loss." Their analysis drew from baseline data in Cleveland Clinic's Professional Athletes Brain Health Study (PABHS), which tracks roughly 900 active fighters, about 300 of whom have been monitored for at least three years. They also compared impaired fighters with those who showed no cognitive impairment. Impaired athletes showed significantly higher glymphatic index values at first, but those values fell sharply over time as the number of knockouts increased. Glymphatic function continued to drop in fighters who sustained ongoing head trauma. The study also noted that athletes without cognitive impairment had lower right-sided and overall glymphatic index values than impaired fighters. Early Detection Could Protect the Long-Term Brain Health of Fighters Dr. Amin emphasized that understanding how repeated head impacts affect the glymphatic system is essential for identifying neurodegenerative risk early in athletes who participate in contact sports. "If we can spot glymphatic changes in the fighters before they develop symptoms, then we might be able to recommend rest or medical care or help them make career decisions to protect their future brain health," he said.
