                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The two supernaturals even automatically dislike each other in The Sims 4, and can settle their beef through a special interaction, Supernatural Showdown. In The Sims 4, rather than being covert inclusions in an Expansion Pack — werewolves were first added in The Sims 2: Pets, for example — both vampires and werewolves received their own Game Packs. Each DLC came with its own world and NPCs who have become rather infamous within the Sims community. Ancient vampire Vladislaus Straud is infamous for calling up Sims and telling them they have a great looking neck, while wild werewolf Greg is the ultimate “I can fix him” character. But who cares about history when there's a more important matter at hand: which one is stronger? So for Fangsgiving, I set out to rectify it in the most extra way possible: a rigorous scientific experiment that pits fur against fang. On the vampiric side, I recruited (and by recruited, I mean forced into a single household with autonomy turned off) Caleb and Lilith Vatore, Miss Hell, and everyone's favorite neck appreciator Vladislaus Straud. On the werewolf side, I had Kristopher Volkov, Lou Howell, Rory Oaklow, and Greg. I also used the same mod to clear any negative moodlets and keep all Sims' needs high for each fight. There was another variable that was trickier to balance, but I did the best I could to even the playing field. Vampire Sims have a three-level Vampiric Strength power that affects their sparring abilities, and werewolves have an Alpha Wolf ability that functions similarly. Technically, the latter's description says it applies to werewolf-on-werewolf sparring, but I had no way to know for sure if it would potentially still have an effect elsewhere. To not include either for every subject wouldn't be showcasing their full abilities, but giving the powers to every combatant could potentially skew the study if it turns out the Alpha Wolf ability doesn't affect vampire versus werewolf fights after all. I opted to split each team into two groups, which I called regulars and alphas; regulars only had their ranking and Fitness skill changed, while alphas also had the aforementioned extra powers. I assembled my fighters on a lot with ample open space and got to work, and the results were not exactly what I was hoping for. Somehow, whether they were vanilla or not, the Vatore siblings easily pummeled both lycanthropes, but both Vlad and Caleb were no match for a regular werewolf. Unsatisfied with my absolutely deadlocked results, it occurred to me I might need an even more curated Sim pairing to get the answers I was looking for. So, I downloaded a Jacob Black Sim and a Nadja of Antipaxos Sim from the gallery and got to work. I gave the pair the exact same traits — Evil, Mean, and Competitive — and moved them into a lot that would soon be their own personal fight club. I'd decided to run a battery of tests that measure their strengths at several different stages. First, I had them duke it out with no Fitness or supernatural leveling, alternating who would initiate, as I'd read in my research (by which I mean reading old forum posts at length) this can potentially affect fight outcomes as well. Just as a side note here: This is perhaps some of the most torturous I've treated a Sims household in a long time, as I had them in a constant loop of fighting for days on end in front of hot stage lights as I took notes, like some kind of vengeful combination of Andy Cohen and Marie Curie. I was still manually mood fixing them just as before, but damn, life was not made easy for these guys. Both at level zero everything, the werewolf side proved stronger, with Jacob winning 3-0. Then, I measured the pair at medium strength: a shared Fitness level of 5, halfway up the supernatural ranks, and I gave Nadja a single point of Vampiric Strength. Jacob won all three fights against Nadja this round, making out with a demoralizingly-decisive victory for his kind. When equally matched in temperament, the answer is abundantly clear: werewolves win. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"I realized I was overworking myself," Trainor says of the realization she had after quitting coffee Quitting coffee may have been the best decision Meghan Trainor ever made — and it all started with a tip from a psychic. The 31-year-old pop star recently caught up with PEOPLE to discuss her upcoming Get in Girl Tour and new single "Still Don't Care." Reflecting on the balancing act of touring as a mother of two, Trainor says she decided to quit after her husband Daryl Sabara visited a psychic. My husband was gifted a session with her and she said, 'Your wife is using coffee like speed. "I was like, 'How does she know that?' "Cold turkey just stopped because I was drinking it all day to just survive and be steady and then I would crash and be buzzing at night to sleep." At the time, the "Made You Look" singer realized her "adrenals were shot" and her hormones were "so off." Why do I feel like this?' Quitting cold turkey wasn't an easy feat, however. Trainor says it was a "tough week" but now she has "more energy than ever." For her upcoming tour, which kicks off in June 2026, the "All About That Bass" singer plans to do what she's always done: "No sleep, power through and thrive." We get up at 7 a.m. because the kids get up at 7 a.m. and then we go find an amusement park or a museum. They love children's museums... then we eat lunch together, I do a soundcheck, we have early dinner so that I don't burp on stage," she says. "There's four of us on two kids trying to get them in a bath that we unfold to put in this shower. And then I do the show and I get to sleep at about 11 or midnight. The Get in Girl Tour will be in support of Trainor's forthcoming album Toy with Me, which is set for release on April 24, 2026. She released the first single, "Still Don't Care," on Nov. 12.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These extremely compact, distinctly red objects appeared with remarkable clarity thanks to JWST's sensitivity, and there were far more of them than expected. Their discovery suggested the presence of an entirely new population of distant celestial sources that the Hubble Space Telescope had not been able to detect. In astronomy, calling something "very red" means the object emits most of its light at long wavelengths. These little red dots emit much of their light at wavelengths longer than a 10 millionth of a meter, in the mid-infrared. Hubble cannot observe such long wavelengths, while JWST was designed specifically to reach them. Follow-up data made it clear that these objects were extraordinarily distant. Since looking across space is also looking back in time, we see those objects as they appeared 12 billion years ago, roughly 1.8 billion years after the Big Bang. To interpret any astronomical observation, researchers rely on models that describe what different types of objects should look like. Astronomers can confidently identify a star only because they understand stars as giant plasma spheres held together by gravity, generating energy through nuclear fusion. When an object matches both appearance and spectrum, it can be classified reliably. The little red dots did not align with any familiar category, so astronomers began considering more extreme explanations. One early proposal suggested that these objects were unusually dense galaxies filled with enormous numbers of stars, with their reddish color caused by thick layers of dust. To visualize this density, imagine placing the solar system inside a cube one light-year on each side. In our region of space, that cube would contain only the Sun. As co-author Bingjie Wang (Penn State University) notes, "The night sky of such a galaxy would be dazzlingly bright. If this interpretation holds, it implies that stars formed through extraordinary processes which have never been observed before." Some researchers favored the star-rich, dust-heavy galaxy idea, while others argued that the little red dots were actually active galactic nuclei obscured by large amounts of dust. Active galactic nuclei occur when material spirals into a galaxy's central black hole, forming an extremely hot accretion disk. The scenario also required these objects to host supermassive black holes with extremely large masses, and far more of them than expected, considering how many little red dots JWST detected. One of those successful proposals was the RUBIES program, led by Anna de Graaff of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, short for "Red Unknowns: Bright Infrared Extragalactic Survey." Between January and December 2024, the RUBIES team used nearly 60 hours of JWST time to collect spectra for 4500 distant galaxies, producing one of the largest JWST spectroscopic data sets so far. According to Raphael Hviding (MPIA), "In that data set, we found 35 little red dots. Most of them had already been found using publicly available JWST images. The most striking discovery came in July 2024: an extraordinarily distant example they named "The Cliff," whose light traveled 11.9 billion years to reach us (redshift z=3.55). Its properties suggested it was an especially intense representative of the little-red-dot population and therefore a crucial object for testing any theories about them. This sudden rise is known as a "Balmer break." De Graaff and her colleagues tested a wide range of galaxy and active galactic nucleus models against the object's spectrum, attempting to reproduce its features. Around this time, a September 2024 study from researchers in China and the UK suggested that some Balmer-break features might come from sources other than stars. De Graaff's team had begun considering a related idea themselves. Balmer breaks can appear in the spectra of single, very hot, young stars, as well as in galaxies containing many such stars. A New Model Emerges: The Black Hole Star (BH)* Building on that idea, de Graaff and her collaborators introduced a new concept they refer to as a "black hole star," written as BH*. In this model, the central engine is an active galactic nucleus containing a supermassive black hole with an accretion disk, but instead of dust, the entire system is enshrouded in a thick layer of hydrogen gas that reddens the emitted light. BH* objects are not true stars because they lack nuclear fusion in their centers. The gas around them is also far more turbulent than anything found in a normal star's atmosphere. They are not yet perfect matches to the data, but they reproduce the observed features more successfully than any previous model. If this interpretation is correct, The Cliff would represent an extreme case dominated by the central black hole star, while the other little red dots would contain varying mixes of BH* light and light from surrounding stars and gas. If BH* objects are real, they could help clarify another long-standing puzzle. Earlier theoretical work on somewhat smaller intermediate-mass black holes had suggested that a gas-enshrouded configuration like this could enable very rapid black hole growth in the early universe. JWST has already revealed evidence for unusually massive black holes at early times. It remains uncertain whether BH* objects can achieve this, but if they can, it would significantly influence models of early galaxy evolution. Whether these ideas will become widely accepted depends on further evidence gathered in the years ahead. How could such a black hole star form in the first place? What allows its unusual gas envelope to persist over long periods (especially since the black hole consumes the gas and must somehow be replenished)? Addressing these issues will require both theoretical modeling and more observations. De Graaff's team already has JWST follow-up observations scheduled for next year, targeting The Cliff and other especially interesting little red dots. These future studies will help determine whether black hole stars truly played a role in shaping the earliest galaxies. The work described here has been accepted for publication as A. de Graaff et al., "A remarkable Ruby: Absorption in dense gas, rather than evolved stars, drives the extreme Balmer break of a Little Red Dot at z = 3.5" in Astronomy & Astrophysics. A companion paper led by Raphael Hviding, presenting the broader sample of Little Red Dots from the RUBIES survey, has also been published in the same journal under the title "RUBIES: A spectroscopic census of little red dots -- All point sources with v-shaped continua have broad lines."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For nearly 20 years, the Assassin's Creed video games have presented themselves as sprawling works of historical fiction. They cast players as noble assassins during big inflection points in history—the French Revolution, Ptolemaic Egypt, the end of Japan's Sengoku era—and give them freedom to romp around stunning re-creations of these eras, interacting with historical figures along the way. You can do secret missions for Cleopatra, you can get Socrates out of a jam after he pisses a mob off, that sort of thing. They're extremely popular to the point of being taken for granted, the way a ubiquitous CBS procedural might be. In the fiction of Assassin's Creed, humanity is descended from ancient aliens, and this knowledge is suppressed throughout history; the tide of world events is influenced by a shadow war between two secret societies; the media exists to manipulate the public. This makes for an exciting series of video games with a near-limitless scope. It also echoes uncomfortable real-world conspiracy theories that have proven consequential in our lifetime. And, even more thornily, is it harmful? Slate discussed these questions and more with media critic and scholar Cameron Kunzelman, whose new book, Everything Is Permitted: On Assassin's Creed, argues that the series is the modern entertainment ecosystem in miniature, franchised to hell and shot through with conspiracy theory. And, while Assassin's Creed games may directly reference conspiracy theories, Kunzelman argues that, crucially, following just about any modern franchise, from Star Wars to Love Is Blind, has quite a bit in common with being a conspiracy theorist. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. Slate: So the Assassin's Creed games appear as works of historical fiction, but they all immediately have this curveball conspiracy-theory plot that is ultimately revealed to be the thread tying the whole thing together. Do you find it pleasurable to untangle the games' conspiracies? Cameron Kunzelman: I don't know if I find it pleasurable as a player—I find it directing in its force. There's no moment in the Assassin's Creed games where I'm not aware that the way they engage with conspiracy is probably bad. In some ways, the Assassin's Creed games have grown up in the age of conspiracy being the dominant rhetorical form of American political discussion, as things like birtherism in the United States became a mainstream belief, extending into things like QAnon, and now, constant debates over what the Epstein files mean. We're living in a moment of profound conspiracy right now. Just a good old-fashioned Philip K. Dick-ian kind of moment—just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you. The fact that there are real, observable conspiracies driving events that look an awful lot like the loonier, harmful ones. Conspiracy exists as a crime that you can be charged with, because conspiracies do exist! There are groups of people who make decisions together that can impact other people, and they can do that secretly. Seemingly lots of things that are involved in what's being released right now in the Epstein files are what we would call dyed-in-the-wool, true conspiracy. From human trafficking to much more banal, but just as bad, practices of money moving around and political meetings. But what the Assassin's Creed games do is take all forms of conspiracy—from Illuminati conspiracies to precursor-species stuff, to pseudo-Masonic-style stuff—and squishes them all together and says that there's a massive metaconspiracy that unites them all. Again, it's interesting that Assassin's Creed has grown up in the age of conspiracy that we live in because we've seen metaconspiracies emerge, like QAnon, fairly recently. Where conspiratorial movements at one time were seen as discrete from one another, now they kind of attach to each other and they get folded into QAnon. So, when people were hanging out just a few years ago in campers on the streets of Dallas waiting for JFK Jr. to return as a kind of revelation, right? I have some quotes from [former Assassin's Creed writer] Corey May in the book specifically talking about what conspiracy theories he's reading and having fun with. But what's interesting is that the play of conspiracy, the fun, is identical to just building conspiracies! Slate receives a commission when you purchase items using the links on this page. This folding in of discrete conspiracy theories into bigger metaconspiracies that you're describing mirrors how entertainment franchises are built now: never really going away, like a renewable energy source. I think it's even more direct than that. A thing that shouldn't work, but does. I'll be dead and [these franchises] will keep going. Maybe not every franchise I grew up with, but probably Star Wars, right? These things use the engine of capital to keep themselves revolving and moving. You can always go back to some sort of ancillary material to say that was the real proof the whole time. Can you tell me more about how the appeal of a big entertainment franchise is comparable to finding conspiracy theorists persuasive? Jenny Rice wrote this book called Awful Archives, which I like a lot. Her argument about conspiracy is that it is not the individual claims of conspiracy theories that are inherently persuasive. So it's not “jet fuel can't melt steel beams”—that piece of information is not inherently persuasive in and of itself to a conspiracy theorist, she claims. It's the inconsistency, and it's the massive chunk of data where all of that is combined together, that is persuasive in conspiracy theory, this big bulk of information. And I think that's part of what's going on with franchises. Franchises, I think, are broadly interesting for lots of people because they are a big block of information. I think Jenny Rice is correct that there's something about scale. There wouldn't be so much information if some of it weren't true—I think that is persuasive to people. I think that is part of what pulls people into conspiracies that might be doing them harm in a very real way. I think that anything in the current era that is asking you to engage with it over a long period of time has to have something in it for you to dig into. One of the reasons reality TV is so good is  you are able to make it very quickly and you're able to cross things over constantly. So you get this novelty across time and space. I don't know if I think that they have an inherent capability to do that, but the way that they structure time and space through effort—the more you put in, the more you get out—that's not really how any other media form works currently. And where you have seen that happen has been, I would say, in franchises. You can put a lot of time into Star Wars. There's a whole thing called Wookiepedia about it. Reality TV has been able to tap into some of that too. To get the full story of Love Is Blind, you gotta follow all these people on TikTok and Instagram. You end your book on this really wrenching note about how, after researching both the history and conspiracy theories referenced by Assassin's Creed games, algorithms on YouTube and other sites have shunted you into harder stuff, which is an extremely common occurrence. Do you have any hope that people will be able to withstand this stuff? Even our basic entertainment patterns, as you've outlined, can make us minor conspiracy theorists. Let me be blue skies here: Regulate the tech industry. Every part of our lives where we engage with the internet is about putting us in a ditch that leads to another ditch that leads to another ditch, right? It will put us into kind of epistemic places that are only engaged with their own ideas. Culturally right now, politically right now, there is no serious discussion of what these platform owners owe to random people. It is seen as a pure paradise of choice. And I have to tell you, we don't treat anything else that way. We don't treat the open road that way. I think being a very influential conspiracy-theorist TikTokker is probably on the whole more dangerous than being a drunk driver for an afternoon. I think it's harming more people in serious and real ways. But we don't take it seriously at all. It's a bipartisan belief that these industries should not be constrained by the law, and by any concern for other human beings. Slate relies on advertising to support our journalism.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manhattan: The recent op-ed opposing a potential rent freeze (“A rent freeze just won't work,” Nov. 23) overlooks key facts about NYC's housing landscape. It ignores the tools landlords already have: tax relief programs, repair incentives and the ability to secure stable rent through voucher programs. Notably, Alex Schwartz sidesteps the city's commitment to fixing CityFHEPS. Reforming the rent subsidy program will reduce long-standing delays, streamline payments and expand voucher access, providing more dependable rental income while helping families remain stably housed. These improvements will do far more to support buildings than another round of rent hikes. Yes, insurance and taxes are rising, but without a remedy like a rent freeze, politicians would keep approving increases without confronting those cost drivers. A freeze forces the real estate lobby and elected officials to address these issues. Lastly, claiming that a rent freeze will cause buildings to fall into disrepair is fearmongering. The small share of distressed rent-stabilized buildings are struggling despite yearly rent increases. Chronic neglect, mismanagement and broader cost pressures — not tenants — are driving deterioration. Blaming a freeze diverts attention from the real issues. And recent Rent Guidelines Board increases don't fund meaningful repairs — 3% or 4.5% won't rehabilitate a building, but can push tenants on fixed incomes into housing insecurity. New Yorkers deserve an honest conversation about affordability and preservation. Manhattan: I'm piling on with Voicer Joseph M. Varon in his praise for current Lt. Gov. Several weeks ago, Delgado spoke at a church in the West Village. He answered every question quickly, always in favor of forceful climate leadership. Staten Island: The Nov. 27 article ” ‘Differences' with Zoh is why I'm leaving — FDNY commish” that outlined why Commissioner Robert Tucker resigned 12 hours after Zohran Mamdani's election is a big nothing-burger. As a Jew and Zionist, your beliefs did not align with his, so you didn't even give him a chance. Jews are quick to scream antisemitism at anyone who doesn't agree with their position on Israel. How is it not the same when applied here to a Muslim you ideologically differ from? You chose to condemn someone elected overwhelmingly by NYC voters. Manhattan: Thank you, regular Voicer JoAnn Lee Frank, for your letters that provide comic relief for left-wing extremists on edge like me. I suspect you are a stand-up comic on the side. Your latest pro-MAGA comment, “Trump has a genuine gift — the art of negotiating,” will have me laughing to myself all day long, hopefully not out loud around other people outside. The only genuine gift President Trump has, in my observation over the last 10 years, is his ability to lift money out of the wallets of his gullible followers for his Trump hats, Bibles, sneakers and other low-quality items made in China, i.e. grift — you know, from people like you. And I suspect that Mamdani, like Vladimir Putin and others, laid the usual “you're the greatest at anything and everything” compliments on thick to cajole our president into his preadolescent, juvenile fawning over Mamdani at that meeting. Woodland Park, N.J.: Trump and his son want to rebrand the Republican Party in their own image. Reluctantly, I'll admit there is one name that actually works: Trumpublican. It neatly fuses “Trump” and “Republican” into a single word that makes far more sense than the rest. West Harrison, N.Y.: I believe that a career in the public domain requires an individual to have an oversized, strong ego. As to Trump's ego, which was inflated from birth, he has managed to enlarge it further by aborting his brain. His opponents must grin and bear the next few years, praying and hoping that he won't damage our democracy beyond repair. So far, it appears that Democrats are making better headway in fending off the misled and ill-informed Republicans running for office. Forest Hills: To Voicer Earl Beale: You had me at the “Marxist mainstream media.” Surely, your adoring and delusional take on Trump is a long-term side effect of the Clorox bleach you must have inhaled or digested to “cure COVID,” as the cult leader suggested back then. Brooklyn: On Wednesday, two National Guardsmen were shot by a gunman in Washington, D.C. A sober Thanksgiving eve and day for their families and soldiers who serve our country. Evidently, people who question having the military in major cities that have rampant crime or riots against ICE enforcement leave the president with no other course of action. Let's pray for the two Guardsmen who were shot. Brooklyn: Please do anything you can to have Congress maintain collective bargaining and union rights for all federal workers, including Veterans Administration nurses, for always! Because all federal workers, including VA nurses, work hard every day they're on the job to help people like me, and therefore must be rewarded by getting a decent salary and union rights for as long as they're working, as well as when they retire. Manhattan: There are more frequent believable reports these days from respected news outlets about unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Also known as extraterrestrials, alien life and unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), the entities are those seen in the sky but not yet identified. Upon investigation, most UFOs are explained away as objects or atmospheric phenomena, yet a small number remain unexplained. Call them what you will, but lately, they've become easier to consider (sort of). Since there may be some truth to the realities and photographs we've recently been privy to, what I'm wondering is if they are out there (or even among us), do we and they worship the same higher power(s) — or do they have a God Almighty of their own?</p>

To understand root causes of chronic illness and disease, we take a multi-factorial approach. Our criminal justice system is tasked with maintaining public safety and upholding the rule of law. Yet far too often, social justice takes a backseat while those in authority violate human rights. See all inspiring news on criminal justice system reform. Considering the vital role money plays both in our lives and in the world, our educational system teaches us very little about how money is created, how banks operate, and what causes the huge banking scandals and bankruptcies that have occurred. Furthermore, rising wealth inequality is a major issue of our time. We delve into all things related to financial system corruption. Technology is a powerful force that has helped shape and define human life since the very beginning. Yet when exploited, technology comes with environmental, human rights, and existential costs while Big Tech corporations profit immensely. Now, the world's biggest tech companies are becoming more powerful than most countries. Becoming aware of the special interests driving what we see, hear, and read can help us navigate censorship, propaganda and misinformation campaigns that serve powerful interests over open, democratic debate. Transforming Media Polarization, One Echo Chamber At A Time | 31-Min Mini-Documentary The mainstream press often downplays how ineffective, harmful, and wasteful our current national security strategy is. While entrenched bureaucracy are partly responsible for this, deeper covert actions and major cover-ups within the military-intelligence complex continue to remain largely hidden from public awareness.

Brief History of Humans Used as Guinea Pigs by U.S. Government and Military There are areas of our lives that have the potential to change our assumptions about reality and what is possible. UFO encounters come in a wide variety of mysterious forms. Some involve experimental military aircraft and secret technologies, while others point to the serious possibility of extraterrestrial or interdimensional life. Over 20+ years, we've documented some of the best, most reliable resources on UFOs. Instead of speculating ourselves, we describe what has been documented and backed by credible evidence. UFO experts and government officials with first-hand experiences have made meaningful contributions to our site.

This thought-provoking piece examines how the primary means for manipulating are through promoting fear, secrecy, and polarization, and through distracting people from their deeper purpose in life. It also provides concrete ways we can turn all of this around. This inspiring essay reminds us in a most eloquent way that we were made for these times. Any small, calm thing that one soul can do to help another soul, to assist some portion of this poor suffering world, will help immensely. Ultra-processed food (UPF) is linked to harm in every major organ system of the human body and poses a seismic threat to global health. UPF is also rapidly displacing fresh food in the diets of children and adults on every continent, and is associated with an increased risk of a dozen health conditions, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and depression. The findings, from a series of three papers published in the Lancet, come as millions of people increasingly consume UPF such as ready meals, cereals, protein bars, fizzy drinks and fast food. For some, especially people who are younger, poorer or from disadvantaged areas, a diet comprising as much as 80% UPF is typical. Evidence reviewed by 43 of the world's leading experts suggests that diets high in UPF are linked to overeating, poor nutritional quality and higher exposure to harmful chemicals and additives. A systematic review of 104 long-term studies conducted for the series found 92 reported greater associated risks of one or more chronic diseases, and early death from all causes. One of the Lancet series authors, Prof Carlos Monteiro ... said the findings underlined why urgent action is needed to tackle UPF. “The first paper in this Lancet series indicates that ultra-processed foods harm every major organ system in the human body. The evidence strongly suggests that humans are not biologically adapted to consume them.” Note: For more along these lines, read our concise summaries of news articles on health and food system corruption.</p>
