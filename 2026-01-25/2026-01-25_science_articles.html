                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to a study published January 21, 2026 in the open-access journal PLOS One, this movement likely helped the plant spread beyond its original habitat. By moving and using this wild potato, they may have begun the earliest stages of domestication while also building a distinctive cultural tradition in the Four Corners region. It is a small but hardy and nutritious wild potato that still grows across southwestern North America today, ranging from southern Utah and Colorado into northern Mexico. Some living populations of the Four Corners potato in this northern area show strong genetic signs that they originated much farther south. Researchers note that repeated use of a plant and its movement beyond its natural range are both key indicators of early domestication. In this case, those behaviors appear to have begun thousands of years ago. Even today, the Four Corners potato holds cultural importance for Indigenous communities. Alongside laboratory work, the research team interviewed 15 Navajo (Diné) elders. These conversations confirmed that the wild potato remains known, eaten, and used for spiritual purposes. Lisbeth Louderback adds: "By combining new archaeobotanical data and elder interviews with transport patterns identified by genetic sequencing of the Four Corners potato, we have defined an anthropogenic range distinct from its natural distribution.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a new perspective published in Biocontaminant, the team explains that these microscopic organisms are gaining ground worldwide, driven by climate change, deteriorating water systems, and limited monitoring and detection efforts. Amoebae are single celled organisms that naturally occur in soil and water. Most are harmless, but certain species can cause severe and sometimes fatal disease. One of the best-known examples is Naegleria fowleri (often referred to as the brain eating amoeba), which can cause a rare but almost always deadly brain infection. Infection can occur when contaminated water enters the nose during activities like swimming. "What makes these organisms particularly dangerous is their ability to survive conditions that kill many other microbes," said corresponding author Longfei Shu of Sun Yat sen University. "They can tolerate high temperatures, strong disinfectants like chlorine, and even live inside water distribution systems that people assume are safe." The researchers also point out that amoebae can act as protective hosts for other disease-causing microbes. Bacteria and viruses can survive inside amoebae, shielded from disinfection processes that would normally eliminate them. This so called Trojan horse effect allows harmful pathogens to persist and spread through drinking water systems and may also play a role in the rise of antibiotic resistance. Several recent outbreaks linked to recreational water exposure have already increased public concern in multiple countries.
