                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As of this snowy New York morning, most Broadway productions are expecting to tough out the state-of-emergency weather, with—so far—only a couple productions (Disney's The Lion King and Aladdin) officially canceling Sunday performances, a situation prompting some actors to express chilliness to the news. Late Saturday night, The Broadway League, the trade organization representing theater owners and producers, posted an Instagram message saying that “most Broadway shows in New York City are currently scheduled to perform tomorrow (Sunday) as planned,” news that some performers thought was pretty cold. “Hey @nycmayor @govkathyhochul can you please tell the Broadway league that there's a literal STATE OF EMERGENCY and it's not safe to be forcing the thousands of theatre workers (and ticket holders who can't cancel because of fine print) to come to shows? Bainbridge's castmate Danny Quadrino, who plays Boq, wrote, “The health and safety of your theatre workers should be at the forefront.” I am urging you to step in here. Theater workers are human beings who deserve to be safe in this weather emergency as well. @broadwayleague – I am urging you to do the right thing today for the safety of your workers and patrons.” As of this writing — the situation, of course, could change as the snow mounts and temperatures drop — only two Broadway shows have canceled Sunday performances: Both The Lion King and Aladdin note on their officials websites that Sunday performances are axed, with the shows resuming performances, as already scheduled, on Tuesday. With subways and buses running, Broadway as a whole rarely shuts down due to weather. The last industry-wide closing due to snow was 10 years ago, when a Jan. 23, 2016, blizzard brought more than two feet of snow to the city. Off Broadway, Heathers: The Musical has canceled today's matinee and evening performances “out of concern for the safety of cast, company and audiences,” the production wrote in a press release. As is standard, ticket holders for canceled performances should return to point of purchase for exchanges or refunds. Other shows are pledging to tough out today's expected eight inches of white stuff. Broadway's Bug, the Manhattan Theatre Club offering, starring Carrie Coon and Namir Smallwood, announced a $45 flash sale for all remaining seats for today's 2pm matinee due to the storm. The musical Two Strangers Carry a Cake Across New York posted an Instagram message saying, “Don't be a stranger! Warm up with us today at 3PM,” and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child wrote on Instagram, “Escape the snow! Stranger Things: The First Shadow has a note on its website reading, “Both performances will play as scheduled on Sunday, January 25, 2026. If you have any questions, please contact your original point of purchase for assistance.” writes on Instagram, “ATTN: all snowmen, ice bastards, etc. on Sunday, January 25 are currently scheduled to continue as planned.” Buena Vista Social Club plans to stay on schedule for its matinee, too, as does Operation Mincemeat, Oedipus, The Book of Mormon and most other Broadway productions. Ticket holders are strongly advised to check the individual websites and Instagram pages of the various shows for updates. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Anyone out there struggling, remember you're not alone. Gonna do it for baby Bambo. If no one told ya today, I love you. No matter how far down the scales we have gone,… The Poker Face star, who battled addiction issues in the early 2000s, had not used drugs since 2006, when she entered drug and alcohol treatment center for a heroin addiction. In 2012, Lyonne underwent open-heart surgery to repair a valve that was previously damaged “as a result of drug use,” she previously admitted. Lyonne added that she would reclaim her sobriety for “Baby Bambo,” a reference to her upcoming project about hockey player Sophie “Bambo” Braverman that she is writing and directing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Natasha Lyonne has stepped forward with a rare and vulnerable confession about her life. She took to her social media account to share that she has relapsed after nearly a decade of sobriety. “Took my relapse public, more to come,” Lyonne, 46, wrote in a post shared Friday, January 23, on X. She later responded to a fan offering support, adding, “Thanks, boss … for the grace, etc. Fans responded with compassion, honesty, and solidarity, applauding Lyonne for her openness. Messages urged her to show herself grace, with one supporter writing, “Go easy on yourself,” while another added, “Hope you're doing okay, that's a tough thing to share.” Addiction and recovery is a LIFELONG process. However… no matter how many steps back you take, it doesn't erase the HUGE leaps forward. You are an inspiration for many of us fighting….relapse or not. Another echoed that sentiment, saying, “Hey, it happens. Several messages came from those on similar paths. “Sending healing energy from one sober person to another ~~,” one supporter shared, while another reminded her gently, “you're only human, living life one day at a time like the rest of us.” In a follow-up post early Saturday, January 24, Lyonne expanded on where she stands in her recovery. Anyone out there struggling, remember you're not alone,” the “Poker Face” star wrote. Gonna do it for baby Bambo. She continued with another message centered on compassion and perseverance. “If no one told ya today, I love you. No matter how far down the scales we have gone, we will see how our experience may help another. Lyonne later thanked fans individually, writing “Love ya back” to one supporter and telling another, “We need better systems and to end shame — bill the Sacklers and stilettos or something but don't @ me for getting honest.” Lyonne has spoken openly for years about her struggles with addiction, which began in the early 2000s and escalated quickly. In a 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly, she reflected on how dangerous and overwhelming that period of her life became. Some things have a very A-to-B scientific effect,” she said at the time. And then, Cocaine plus heroin is bad! She went on to describe the gravity of that chapter with blunt honesty. A lot of people don't come back. That makes me feel wary and self-conscious. I wouldn't want to feel prideful about it. As per EW, Lyonne entered inpatient rehab in 2006 and, after getting sober, slowly rebuilt both her health and her career. She returned to acting with a 2008 off-Broadway production of “Two Thousand Years,” which she later credited as a turning point. “[The play] really got me back on my feet,” she told EW. As her career found renewed momentum, including widespread acclaim for projects such as “Russian Doll,” Lyonne continued to speak openly about recovery, accountability, and self-awareness. In a 2017 interview with The Guardian, she explained why honesty has remained central to her journey. “I'm such an open book that I have no problem talking about it and speaking freely, but I've sort of said my piece on the subject,” she said. Now, as she moves through this latest chapter, Lyonne continues to emphasize honesty, connection, and compassion, both toward herself and toward others navigating similar paths.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Victoria Beckham reunited with the Spice Girls at Emma Bunton's 50th birthday bash after her son Brooklyn Beckham's scathing statement against his family. The beloved girl group, minus Melanie “Mel B” Brown (Scary Spice), cozied up together and smiled widely. “I love you girls so much @gerihalliwellhorner @melaniecmusic xxxxxxx.” “I can only imagine how the spice girls (sic) fans feel 😍 @spicegirls 😍 @victoriabeckham special night celebrating Emma @emmaleebunton x.” Bunton, who celebrated her milestone birthday on Jan. 21, also responded, “Love you all so much ❤️.” “I do not want to reconcile with my family,” he wrote via Instagram last week.

Brooklyn also alleged that Victoria backed out of making Peltz's wedding dress at the last minute, leaving her scrambling to find another. While David and Victoria have yet to address the allegations, the latter reportedly feels “betrayed because she's done everything she can to make” her son and Peltz “feel welcome and love Nicola like another daughter.” However, she now “feels it's been thrown back in her face.” Victoria would normally do anything to avoid a family fallout, but she thinks they're both being unreasonable.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meghan Markle and Prince Harry pulled into 13-degree weather at Park City, UT for the Sundance Sunday AM premiere of the documentary they EP'ed, Cookie Queens. This comes after the pic's world premiere last night in Salt Lake City, UT. The Alysa Nahmias directed documentary follows four ambitious Girl Scouts with big personalities and ambitions, who are competing in a cookie sales industry worth $800 million. WME Independent and Submarine are co-repping sales on the movie. I was a Girl Scout, my mom was a troupe leader, and I think the value of friendship, of being dedicated to a goal as you can see that in Cookie Queens, it's so reflective of how these girls stick with something that's important to them and don't give up. And self belief is an integral value that comes with being a Girl Scout.” Domhnall Gleeson Gives 'The Paper' Season 2 Update: "I've Got The Haircut" Sundance Decries Racist Assault Of Rep. Maxwell Frost During Festival As "Intolerable Behavior" In the documentary, little Olive sells 12,000 boxes (spoiler alert), a record which Markle said she never ever hit. “I don't remember,” beamed the Duchess of Sussex about her Girl Scout cookie sales records, “but it certainly wasn't 12,000! “I think universally, Thin Mints is most people's favorite.” Is Princess Lilibet of Sussex bound to join the Girl Scouts? “I think we'll continue to explore whatever feels right,” said Markle, “Alysa (the director) is a mom of a daughter, and I think for both of us working on this project it's been incredibly special as parents, as mothers to be able to see something our girls will be able to enjoy and watch as well.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amber Heard made a rare comment about the impact she felt after losing her ex-husband Johnny Depp's 2022 defamation trial. During the Sundance Film Festival 2026 Saturday, the “Aquaman” actress made a guest appearance in “Silenced,” a documentary about accused men weaponizing defamation lawsuits to silence women speaking out about abuse. I have lost my ability to speak,” she said during a confessional chat with director Selina Miles, per Variety. “I am not here to tell my story. I don't want to tell my story,” Heard, 39, added. “In fact, I don't want to use my voice anymore. Page Six reached out to Heard's rep for comment but did not immediately hear back. In February 2019, Depp, 62, sued Heard for $50 million for defaming him in a 2018 Washington Post op-ed about abuse. Three years later, the mom of three lost the defamation trial and was ordered to pay her ex $10 million in compensatory damages and $350,000 in punitive damages. She was awarded $2 million in compensatory damages for her counterclaim. Three months after losing the trial, Heard and her eldest daughter, Oonagh Paige, 4, relocated to Spain.

And, look, I understand people who could not stand up [for me], because the most frightening thing to them was making the right choice,” Depp added. “I was like a crash test dummy for MeToo … and I sponged it, took it all in,” he told the outlet. “And so I wanted from the hundreds of people I've met in that industry to see who was playing it safe.</p>

A tender New Jersey romance between second-generation immigrants, Stephanie Ahn's “Bedford Park” comes instantly alive. Sparked by the literal collision of two Korean American families, this dreamy feature debut opens on a short-tempered meet-cute that promises a precise and deeply personal love story unfolding in real time. When physical therapist Audrey (Moon Choi) arrives at her childhood home to care for her mother following a car accident, she develops an intense, slow-burn attraction to Eli (Son Sukku), a local security guard and the stand-offish “other” driver. Ahn introduces the couple's unlikely chemistry through strained carpool rides that gradually give way to intimate, disarming nights. Audrey and Eli's at-first brief interactions are framed by poetic moments of privacy that play like naturalistic portraits: shared silences, cautious humor, looks that linger too long.

Ahn's script grows ever-more ambitious as it goes on, and that sprawl seems intentional. But in overextending her characters' arcs and hearts, this otherwise exceptional filmmaker struggles to hold onto the core intimacy that initially makes her film feel assured. Anchored firmly in the Garden State despite its misleading, Bronx-based title, “Bedford Park” captures distinctly East Coast textures — ironed-on familial obligation, brusk cultural shorthand, simmering lower-class resentment — to create a lived-in world that ultimately feels deeper in its symbolic meaning than the two leads' human emotion. From transplanted Korean-American customs, to a convincingly rendered high school wrestling scene, the soulful specificity is immersive rather than ornamental. The pair's early antagonism is punctuated by petty, almost sibling-like sniping, and their shared world soon emerges as a place of brutal honesty and old ghosts. Moments of levity, including a surprisingly charming “Rocky” soundtrack sing-a-long, sketch a universe forming between people whose experience of U.S. life has long been dictated by stoicism and isolation. Sharing a bed, Audrey and Eli talk about lost potential and childhood abuse with an understated frankness that makes their mutual trust feel all the more earned. Audrey presents like a self-protecting spider — intimidating yet delicate, crawling the fraught emotional web that circumstance has built around her with sly, hand-wringing diligence. Her performance balances restraint with sudden flashes of overwhelming emotion and even fury, effectively embodying a woman whose subtle self-abuse has calcified into habit. Sukku, by contrast, brings a regionally-appropriate directness to Eli that's warm, welcome, and comfortably melancholy. His presence feels as protective and dangerous as a bear hug near Audrey, and when he opens up to her, the vulnerability she discovers is infectious. Eli prompts his love itnerest to extend kindness toward herself she has long withheld. But a spider and a bear, as Ahn seems to know, are poorly suited to lasting harmony, and tension bubbles beneath the surface of nearly every scene. Cycles of destructive behavior (including repeated miscarriages tied to a condition she knows makes pregnancy unsafe and unlikely) gradually recede as Eli's equally troubling past comes into focus. While Audrey's elderly parents are smartly drawn (particularly her father, still mourning a professional life in Korea he lost decades ago), Ahn's flawed effort asks viewers to manage too many threads at once. In that reading, “Bedford Park” becomes brilliantly tragic: a romance smothered not by a lack of attraction but by the weight of real life tearing it down. Still, running more than two hours, “Bedford Park” hangs on too long. Trimming even twenty minutes would sharpen its emotional throughline and leave a more enduring impression. But Ahn is especially attuned to this particular moment, and transportive indie romances arrive at Sundance every year. Better still, it offers companionship in uncertainty, evoking the gentle squeeze of another's hand the moment you realize how perilous it was for either of you to get this far.

Why, his boss wonders, didn't he leave after Willem Dafoe's “dong” got smashed with a giant block of wood? Just how often are there mid-day rep screenings of “Antichrist” in suburban Atlanta, anyway? And in what universe would the mega-millionaire parents of a malevolent teen like Sheridan Foxworth Kimberly (a hyper-punchable Mason Thames, excellent as a pointier young Jessie Eisenberg in pure evil mode) hire a fuck-up like Davis to drive their kid to the rehab center on the other side of the state? Related Stories ‘Bedford Park' Review: Stephanie Ahn's Cloudy New Jersey Romance Eulogizes an American Dream ‘The Invite' Review: You're Going to Want to Attend Olivia Wilde's Crackling, Crazy Entertaining Dinner Party from Hell Or, for that matter, honest people who are just loudly watching drunk people fight each other on YouTube during the middle of their shift at a debt collection agency. Mark (Dave Franco, once again proving his genius for playing unbothered scumbag) was about to get laid off anyway as part of his company's pivot to not paying people, but that little incident helps to expedite the process. And so the world's least qualified transportation team rolls up to Sheridan's parents' mansion in Mark's beat-up red sedan, completely unprepared for the ride of their lives. Davis is a sweet-natured idiot who wants to do good with his life. Mark, basically a more aggro and demented version of the character Franco's brother played in “Pineapple Express,” is a less sweet-natured idiot who wants to do the glorified gas station drugs he's packed into his pockets for the drive. Sheridan, meanwhile, is the antichrist who Lars von Trier foretold, and — as becomes violently clear after he bites and robs the Eastern European stripper (a flinty Kiernan Shipka as Irina) he convinces Mark to call to their motel room — neither of his temporary legal minders are at all prepared for the full extent of his spoiled brat sociopathy. From that point on, “The Shitheads” becomes a meandering and recursive journey to wherever (how far away is this rehab center anyway?) as Sheridan's antics effectively convince all of the workaday people in his path to fight each other for table scraps while he laughs at them from the backseat of Mark's car. ), and later an encounter with some wannabe kidnappers whose members include Peter Dinklage in zombie makeup and a spectacularly committed Nicholas Braun as a lycan-obsessed Soundcloud rapper who calls himself “Pricka Bush Da Werewoof.” A smattering of individual moments achieve the kind of madcap insanity that a movie like this needs for momentum, but “The Shitheads” is plagued by stop-and-start plotting that does more to stifle its energy than build to it, and its complete disinterest in meaningfully developing the relationship between Mark and Davis makes it hard to feel like this road trip is going anywhere — not that we ever really know where it's supposed to be going in the first place. It's a credit to Blair's script that Sheridan doesn't seem to learn anything from this misadventure, which would have been fatal to a film that's only held together by its enduring fascination with how some people choose to retain their decency in a world that rewards the opposite, but he never seems to be much of a real person either, and the shred of humanity the movie wants you to see in him sucks the life out of things just when the story's chaos is peaking. That speaks to the biggest problem with “The Shitheads,” which is that its gap between credibility and comic license is way too wide for Blair to bridge. Despite featuring one of the greatest eruptions of explosive diarrhea in the proud history of motion pictures (it's so good), “The Shitheads” isn't funny enough to earn its heightened cruelties, and — that incredible jet stream of liquid poop notwithstanding, along with a small handful of other memorable highlights — its cruelties aren't heightened enough to justify how little sense they make.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I Wrecked My House” star Jasmine Roth took to Instagram earlier this week, begging fans for help reaching a major milestone. Just days later, she achieved her goal and fans were overjoyed. The HGTV star shared the exciting news that she reached 700,000 Instagram followers and won a friendly competition with husband Brett Roth, on Saturday, January 24. Brett's theory was that his wife “took a screenshot” from somebody else's profile and “put her face on it.” This is 700,000 followers, way before Valentine's Day,” the designer said. The playful competition between spouses began after Jasmine asked her husband to partake in an awkward JCPenney photoshoot for Valentine's Day. After initially saying no, Brett made Jasmine an offer. If the HGTV star could gain 20,000 followers, bringing her Instagram following from 680,000 to 700,000, before Valentine's Day, Brett would agree to the holiday antics. I want this so bad,” Jasmine begged in the video shared on January 20. “Follow, then unfollow, I don't care but please! We have to do this JCPenney photo shoot.” It didn't take long for fans to come through. The comments section of Roth's announcement was flooded with fans who helped make her dream a reality. “That look was TOO funny🤣🎉🎉 Can't wait to see the pictures🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻” one follower wrote. Honestly the algorithms have been sending me your posts for years. I watch and enjoy all of them. However, when the bet video came about, I hit that follow button so fast I sprained my finger,” another commented. A third added, “This is going to be epic! Jasmine, you and the girls need to play along!” Jasmine didn't just reach her goal; she crushed it. As of Saturday afternoon, she's has surpassed 702,000 followers. “Load the camera JCPenney,” another fan chimed in. Jasmine, you, your husband and y'all's girls ROCK!!!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl has hinted at a return to Australia — and confirmed a new album is finished — during the band's one-off Tasmanian show over the weekend. Olivia Dean Tops triple j's Hottest 100 of 2025 With 'Man I Need' Donald Trump Berates Bad Bunny, Green Day Ahead of Super Bowl Performances: 'I'm Anti-Them' “We might have a whole new record of f***ing songs that we just finished the other day,” Grohl told the audience, delivering the first public confirmation that a follow-up to 2023's But Here We Are is complete. “This won't be the last time you see us,” he said. “We'll be back here sooner than you think… and it's before my next birthday.” Grohl's birthday falls on Jan. 14, suggesting Foo Fighters could return to Australia before the end of 2026, though no official tour dates have yet been announced. But Here We Are — Foo Fighters' 11th studio album — debuted at No. 1 in Australia and became one of the group's most critically acclaimed releases to date. Other notable moments from the Launceston show included an appearance by Brent Webb, the Australian miner who made international headlines in 2006 after requesting an iPod loaded with Foo Fighters songs while trapped underground. With a new album now finished and Grohl openly teasing a return, Foo Fighters' next Australian chapter appears firmly on the horizon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alex Honnold isn't sure what meaning viewers will ultimately take from his ropeless, death-defying ascent of Taipei 101 — but he has a few hopes. After briefly pausing to collect his thoughts, Honnold said he had learned from the response to his harrowing, Oscar-winning documentary Free Solo that “people kind of take the message that they need from it.” Harry Styles Reveals Why He Attended Pope Leo's Conclave Election Honnold said he didn't expect Netflix viewers would suddenly feel inspired to take up the uniquely dangerous sport of free soloing after witnessing his example. “If anything, I hope that's what people take from it — that if you work really hard, you can do hard things, and maybe they should try.” Honnold's wife — and the mother of his two children — Sanni McCandless, was by his side at the press conference, just as she had been earlier on Sunday atop an upper balcony of Taipei 101 to embrace him after he descended from the spire. The joy was indeed surprisingly evident throughout Honnold's anxiety-inducing climb, which unfolded over just more than an hour and a half on Sunday morning local time, as he methodically worked his way up the 1,667-foot tower — completing what is now believed to be the world's tallest urban free solo ascent to date. Thousands of spectators gathered outside a large exclusion zone around the base of the building, while hundreds more watched from inside Taipei 101, waving from office windows and observation decks as Honnold passed, occasionally stopping to chalk his hands or flash a quick wave back. The route itself was divided into three distinct sections: a lower, slabby opening stretch of several hundred feet that served as Honnold's “warmup,” a long middle section of repeating “bamboo box” platforms that demanded sustained focus and pacing, and a final, highly exposed upper section featuring ringed overhangs and, at the very top, a narrow spire capped by a small spherical platform barely large enough for one person to stand on. Although it was a gloriously clear and sunny day in Taipei, conditions grew slightly more challenging as Honnold climbed higher, with winds whipping around the building's corners and upper reaches. Skyscraper Live marked Honnold's first time free soloing in front of a large crowd — let alone a global TV viewership — since many of the rock faces he has completed are situated in remote wilderness locations. “It felt more like a celebration than I expected.” Smiling, he added: “That was cool.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

I'd literally give 700 billion dollars to be with you. Colin added that after Greenland replied, “not trying be mean, but I'm not interested,” Trump grew irate: “I'll kill you, you ugly b—h.” Michael Che also made fun of Trump for caving on his tariff-related demands. Trump backed down, Che joked, “after consulting his most trusted advisor: the stocks app.” Donald Trump Won't Attend Super Bowl, Slams Bad Bunny and Green Day: 'I'm Anti-Them' “I get that ICE agents are people, allegedly, and they have a job to do,” Che said, “but at some point while you're pepper-spraying old ladies or shooting at a nurse, you ever stop and ask yourself, ‘Are we dicks? Che also called out Vice President JD Vance for saying that anti-ICE protesters should just write op-eds or debate on social media rather than take to the streets—”You know, just like these young scholars did on Jan. 6,” he joked.
