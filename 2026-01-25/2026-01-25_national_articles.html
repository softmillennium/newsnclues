Mike Waltz joins ‘Fox News Sunday' to discuss the importance of acquiring Greenland, the need for new Arctic defense and ongoing protests in Iran. China's top general has been removed and placed under investigation for misconduct in Chinese President Xi Jinping's latest purge of leading military commanders. Gen. Zhang Youxia is being investigated for allegedly committing severe violations of party discipline and state laws, China's Defense Ministry announced Sunday. The general served as vice-chairman on China's Central Military Commission and was second only to Xi in military authority. Another member of the commission, Liu Zhenli, has also been placed under investigation by China's ruling Communist Party. He was replaced by Zhang Shengmin, a Xi loyalist who survived the latest round of removals. Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, reviews the troops during his inspection of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The staff changes come after President Donald Trump's administration released a new National Defense Strategy on Friday. The document shifts U.S. focus toward dominance in the Western Hemisphere rather than a longtime goal of countering China. "This does not require regime change or some other existential struggle," the document reads. "Rather, a decent peace, on terms favorable to Americans but that China can also accept and live under, is possible." President Donald Trump's administration released a new National Defense Strategy. The document also reflects Trump's ongoing frustration with U.S. allies for failing to adequately contribute to their own defense. It says the U.S. will increasingly expect allied nations to handle their own security. "We will engage in good faith with our neighbors, from Canada to our partners in Central and South America, but we will ensure that they respect and do their part to defend our shared interests," the strategy says. "And where they do not, we will stand ready to take focused, decisive action that concretely advances U.S. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

The family of a missing 15-year-old Long Island boy says their son disappeared two weeks ago after going to New York City to meet someone he met through the online game Roblox. Thomas Medlin left the Stony Brook School around 3:30 p.m. on Jan. 9 and "ran" to the Stony Brook Train station, where he boarded a train to Grand Central Station in New York City, the Suffolk County Police Department said in a news release on Jan. 12. Police released a surveillance image of Thomas at Grand Central Station, where detectives say he was last seen around 5:30 p.m. on Jan. 9. Thomas' mother, Eva Yan, told News 12 Long Island in an interview that detectives believe her son had gone to meet someone who he met through Roblox, an online game. Yan said that behavior was unlike Thomas. "He has never left our side," Yan told the outlet through tears. "I just can't believe why he left in the first place," James Medlin, Thomas' father, told the outlet. Thomas Medlin's parents say this behavior was uncharacteristic of the 15-year-old. A Roblox spokesperson told Fox News Digital in an email statement on Sunday that it is "built with safety at its core" and offers parental controls that allow parents to completely disable the in-game chat function. "We are deeply troubled by this incident and are working with law enforcement to support their investigation," the spokesperson said. "Roblox is built with safety at its core, including robust policies to help protect users that go beyond many other platforms. We have filters designed to block the sharing of personal information and don't allow user-to-user image or video sharing. While no system is perfect, our commitment to safety never ends, and we continue to evolve and strengthen our protections every day. Thomas Medlin traveled from Long Island to New York City by train on Jan. 9, and was last seen at Grand Central Station. Yan said that family and friends have formed search parties in both Long Island and New York City in search of her missing son. "Everyone loves him," she told the outlet. Authorities asked anyone with information on the whereabouts of Thomas to call the Suffolk County Police Department's Fourth Squad Detectives at 631-854-8452.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• DHS account under scrutiny: Administration officials have declined in interviews this morning to provide critical details about their claim that the agent shot Pretti in self-defense. CNN video analysis found that an agent took away Pretti's handgun just before he was shot. At no point in videos reviewed by CNN can he be seen wielding the weapon. • What we know about Pretti: Friends and family say the 37-year-old was an ICU nurse at a local VA hospital. Democratic Rep. Angie Craig, who is running for Senate in Minnesota, urged her colleagues to “stand the line” and refuse to pass a bill that funds the Department of Homeland Security without new restrictions, after a federal agent shot and killed a 37-year-old man in Minneapolis. Craig told CNN's Manu Raju today she thinks Democrats should force a government shutdown over their demands to rein in immigration enforcement. “I mean, are we OK that an authoritarian administration is taking over American cities? Hell no, we're not OK,” she said, warning that if Democrats don't “take a stand now” then the aggressive federal enforcement that has devolved into violence in her state is “coming to a city near you.” “ICE is attacking and terrorizing the people of Minnesota, and they're coming to you, if we don't stop them here,” she said. The Minnesota Democrat, who last week voted against the House-passed bill that included DHS and ICE funds, said her party “cannot keep acting like these are normal times in our country.” “This is a moment in time that history is going to judge every single one of us, including my Republican colleagues, who are complicit in their silence at this moment,” she said. Trump's comments come after a key hearing last week, during which a federal judge expressed deep skepticism that the White House has legal authority to construct the ballroom without express authorization from Congress. “All of the Structural Steel, Windows, Doors, A.C./Heating Equipment, Marble, Stone, Precast Concrete, Bulletproof Windows and Glass, Anti-Drone Roofing, and much more, has been ordered (or is ready to be), and there is no practical or reasonable way to go back. IT IS TOO LATE!” Trump wrote in the lengthy post. He added, “Why didn't these obstructionists and troublemakers bring their baseless lawsuit much earlier?” On Saturday, hours after federal officers shot and killed Alex Pretti, Trump hosted a private screening of the first lady's new documentary, “Melania,” in the East Room. Guests dined on popcorn in custom boxes emblazoned with the first lady's likeness, and listened to a band perform a waltz composed for the film's score. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer made clear yesterday, hours after a Minneapolis man was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent, that Democrats would block a key package that would fund several government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, unless it includes guardrails for immigration enforcement. Sen. Chris Murphy told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union” he would not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security, which he said “is murdering American citizens.” Independent Sen. Angus King, who caucuses with the Democrats, told CBS' “Face the Nation” that while he hates shutdowns, he can't vote to fund ICE due to their actions in his home state of Maine and in Minnesota. King said he believes Senate Majority Leader John Thune should separate DHS' funding from the five other appropriations bills, saying they would pass, and then take up DHS. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen wouldn't directly say whether she plans to support advancing the DHS funding bill, but indicated she wants to see changes. After the situation in Minneapolis rose to emergency levels yesterday, with the state National Guard called in and mutual aid requested, the streets have been reopened and guard members have been relieved, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told CNN's Anderson Cooper Sunday. “It was very volatile situation, but we were able to maintain the peace,” O'Hara said. “People should be able to have an expectation that the federal government can enforce federal immigration law without these poor tactics and really unconstitutional practices,” O'Hara added. “We've seen mass resignations in these different agencies, and just a whole lot of frustration because we have personal relationships with a lot of these agents that are also just distraught over how things are playing out. It doesn't look like there's clear teamwork, tactically, to achieve the same objective,” he said. “It is absolutely not how we train law enforcement in Minnesota.” The situation has taken a severe toll on the officers in his department, O'Hara said, but they will continue to do their jobs. Roads around 26th Street West and Nicollet Avenue are open and vehicle restrictions have been lifted one day after Alex Pretti was fatally shot by federal immigration agents during a protest, Minneapolis officials announced Sunday. The Minneapolis Police Department reported that overnight activity was calm, with no arrests, burglaries or fires. City vehicles involved in these efforts will be clearly marked. At the scene where Alex Pretti was fatally shot by a Border Patrol agent, CNN's Whitney Wild said she continues to see a growing memorial despite subzero temperatures in Minneapolis. You see notes to Alex, signs with his photo. This has been going on since last night,” Wild described. “Last week, I was saying if you were a brown person in this, you are living in a police state,” Reyelts said. You can't have a bumper sticker on your car. You can get pulled out of your car for any reason.” Minneapolis resident BJ Clark told Wild last night he came out to protect Pretti's vigil despite not personally knowing him. He shouldn't be dead right now,” Clark said. So, someone who saved lives died for absolutely no reason. More than 24 hours after a Border Patrol agent shot and killed Alex Pretti, personnel from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension have arrived at the scene. BCA staff are “canvassing and looking to collect whatever evidence may be there,” Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Sunday. “They even got a state search warrant for a public area to conduct their investigation, but they were not allowed in,” he said. BCA Superintendent Drew Evans said Saturday that state and local police were unable to secure the scene and it was overrun by protesters, preventing the BCA from conducting its own examination. Video from Sunday morning shows people in BCA jackets at the scene. Early Sunday morning, a federal judge in Minnesota granted a temporary restraining order blocking federal agencies from destroying or altering evidence related to Pretti's killing. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem alleged that local and state leaders “abandoned” the area of downtown Minneapolis and continued to characterize protestors as “violent rioters.” Noem also alleged, without evidence, that protests only turned violent in Minneapolis after the administration put a spotlight on fraud allegations in the state. “Frankly, this didn't turn violent until we uncovered the fraud in Minneapolis. We were there, ICE and CBP have been there and operating for years in Minneapolis, we saw the violence start to happen when the fraud became uncovered,” Noem said. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that she's “grieved” for the parents of Alex Pretti, who's son was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent in Minneapolis Saturday. And I can't imagine a tragic situation,” Noem said on Fox News' The Sunday Briefing. However, Noem appeared to place blame on Pretti for showing up with a gun and “confronting” officers. Pretti had a concealed carry permit and videos don't show him brandishing the weapon at officers. Asked about First Amendment rights, Noem said individuals should comply with officers who tell them to ” back off.” “When an officer tells you to back off and gives you orders you should comply and explain you shouldn't show up with weapons that no ID and no indication of how they're going to be used, and that aggressive interaction, laying hands on law enforcement officers, clearly, is a crime, and it is something that should not be acceptable,” Noem said. Kevin Stitt told CNN on Sunday that President Donald Trump is “getting bad advice” on immigration enforcement and that “Americans don't like what they're seeing” in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis. “First off, this is a real tragedy, and I think the death of Americans with what we're seeing is causing deep concerns over federal tactics and accountability. Americans don't like what they're seeing right now,” Stitt told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” When pressed by Bash if federal agents should be pulled out of Minnesota, Stitt said “I think the President has to answer that question” and said Trump was “getting bad advice right now.” Though Stitt mentioned Trump was elected in part on his immigration policies he said “now Americans are asking themselves, ‘What is the endgame? We need real solutions on immigration reform,” Stitt said. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Sunday that Alex Pretti impeded a law enforcement operation and defended the agents involved in his death. When he did that, interacting with those agents, when they tried to get him to disengage, he became aggressive and resisted them,” Noem said on Fox News' The Sunday Briefing. When pressed on whether Pretti was disarmed before he was shot by a border patrol agent, Noem said, “That's all part of this investigation. “I can't speak to every single thing that those officers thought but this happened in seconds. As Second Amendment rights have become part of the conversation, Noem said her message to those with legal concealed carry permits is, “Don't go impede law enforcement operations.” FBI Director Kash Patel accused the man killed by a federal officer Saturday of breaking the law by possessing a firearm he had a legal permit to carry, failing to explain what law was broken and refusing to support his claim. During an interview on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo,” Patel said the man, Alex Pretti, was not allowed to bring a firearm to a protest — a notion that gun right groups have heavily criticized. “You don't have that right to break the law and incite violence.” When pressed by Bartiromo on how Pretti was threatening Border Patrol officers, Patel punted, saying that the Department of Homeland Security was leading the investigation. “We will, of course, always protect your First Amendment speech, and if you peacefully protest, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that,” Patel said. Patel did not explain his suggestion that Pretti incited violence — a notion that is not supported by video from the scene, which shows a federal officer spraying Pretti with chemical irritants before several more officers help tackle him to the ground before fatally shooting him. Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino claimed federal agents used de-escalation techniques before fatally shooting Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday, in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash. “Those de-escalation techniques, whether it was physically trying to remove them from … that active law enforcement scene in which law enforcement were going after a violent illegal alien, or the use of pepper spray, which is another de-escalation technique, those techniques did not work,” Bovino told Bash on Sunday. “Officers always try to use the minimum amount of force necessary to either effect an arrest, which in this case was more than likely 18 (US Code) 111, assault on a federal officer,” he said. Bash then pressed Bovino on what evidence supported the claim that Pretti was assaulting the federal officers, noting that Pretti appeared to be helping another bystander who had been pushed to the ground by an agent. Bovino did not cite specific actions by Pretti, responding instead, “We don't need a suspect's help in an active law enforcement scene.” Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino suggested Sunday that Alex Pretti was a victim of “heated rhetoric,” arguing that political criticism of federal immigration agents may have helped place Pretti in a deadly confrontation — despite offering no evidence that Pretti assaulted or threatened officers. “Did he fall victim to that violent and heated rhetoric by Mayor Frey, Governor Walz?” Bovino asked when confronted by CNN's Dana Bash. “So, good job for our law enforcement in taking him down before he was able to do that,” Bovino said. New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani reacted to the killing of two residents of Minneapolis, calling it “horrific” and said he previously told President Donald Trump the ICE raids are “cruel” and “inhumane.” “I will do everything in my power to ensure that we do not see that take place in New York City. They do nothing to serve the interests of public safety,” he said in an interview ABC News' “This Week.” Mamdani said “too many Americans are being asked to not believe their own eyes.” Murphy homed in on an interview Bash conducted with Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino moments earlier, during which Bovino faulted Pretti for approaching agents and carrying a gun. Bovino also claimed that Pretti had “intent to harm,” but when pressed for evidence, he offered no specifics. “(Federal immigration agents) are there to cause a conflict. The International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) has called on the White House to lead discussions to find a “constructive path forward” after the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old US citizen by federal officers in Minneapolis yesterday. “Periods of heightened tension place significant strain on public safety systems and underscore the need for stability, professionalism, and respect for constitutional principles,” it added. “Comprehensive training, investigative integrity, adherence to the rule of law, and strong coordination among federal, state, and local partners” all contribute to “effective public safety,” the IACP said. “In times of uncertainty, elected leaders at all levels play a critical role in de-escalating tensions by using measured, responsible rhetoric that reinforces lawful processes and public trust rather than deepening division,” it continued. Calling on the White House, the IACP asked it to “bring together thoughtful federal, state and local law enforcement leaders for policy-level discussions aimed at identifying a constructive path forward.” New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani said Sunday the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis should shock people and accused the federal government of acting like an enemy toward its own citizens. “To see ICE murder yet another person in this country and any attempt to try and paint this man as an enemy of the state is frankly an attempt to distract from the real question – which is what has the state done to make itself an enemy of the people.” While ICE enforcement is happening in New York, it is not at the large scale that has been reported in other cities. Mamdani has said he tried to dissuade President Donald Trump from increasing enforcement in the city, saying the added enforcement will not ensure public safety. Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino said Sunday that Second Amendment protections do not apply when federal officers believe they are being obstructed or assaulted, even as he offered no evidence that Alex Pretti engaged in such conduct before he was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Saturday. In an interview with CNN's Dana Bash, Bovino said constitutional gun rights are void in situations he characterized as riots or attacks on law enforcement. “We respect that Second Amendment right, but those rights don't count when you riot and assault, delay, obstruct and impede law enforcement officers and, most especially, when you mean to do that beforehand,” he said. Bovino also claimed to support peaceful armed protest, saying, “I've done that myself and fully support that, but not when you perpetrate violence, obstruct, delay or obfuscate border patrol in the performance of their duties.” He did not cite evidence that Pretti committed violence or interfered with agents in those ways, instead repeatedly framing Pretti's presence at the scene as proof of intent. Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino repeatedly declined to provide evidence or specific details during an interview with CNN's Dana Bash this morning, as he defended federal agents who shot and killed ICU nurse and US citizen Alex Pretti yesterday in Minneapolis. Pressed on the Department of Homeland Security's claim that Pretti was “brandishing” a weapon, Bovino said only that Pretti had a gun and faulted him for approaching agents, declining to say whether the weapon was ever fired or how many agents discharged their weapons. Bovino suggested Pretti's presence had justified the agents' response. I can't say that enough, he made the decision to go there. So at some point they knew there was a gun,” he said. “He brought a semiautomatic weapon to a riot, assaulted federal officers … So I do believe the Secretary (Kristi Noem) is 100% spot on in what she said.” Roughly one second later, a shot is heard, followed by at least nine more. At no point in any video reviewed by CNN is Pretti seen wielding a weapon. More from Bovino: The Border Patrol official said investigators are still working to determine Pretti's intent and what occurred in his final moments, but he maintained that federal agents — not Pretti — were the victims of the encounter. Bovino would not share information on how many agents fired their weapons but said the agent involved had extensive training. He said the agents involved “are going to more than likely be on administrative duty” as investigations continue.</p>

Sam Olson, ICE field office director in St. Paul, joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss mass protests after a deadly CBP-involved shooting in Minneapolis and efforts to cooperate with local officials. Celebrities such as Olivia Wilde and Natalie Portman are taking a stand against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after the Minneapolis shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti, the second anti-ICE protester to be shot and killed this month. During an appearance at the Sundance Film Festival on Saturday, Wilde — who was promoting her film "The Invite" — wore an "ICE OUT" pin during her red carpet appearance and shared her thoughts about the "appalling" circumstances. "We're all here getting to celebrate something really beautiful and hopeful in film storytelling," she told Variety. Olivia Wilde, Natalie Portman wore "ICE OUT" pins at the Sundance Film Festival on Jan. 24, 2026. "We can't go another day just sort of accepting this as our new norm. And, I don't want to normalize seeing people being murdered on the internet. And so if we can do anything out here to support the movement to cast ICE out, to delegitimize this unbelievably criminal organization, then that's what we should be doing." "I think so many Americans are [speaking out]. Americans are speaking up in huge numbers, and it's dangerous to be a protester now and people are still going out to the streets, which is incredibly inspiring." Wilde dubbed ICE as an "unbelievably criminal organization." "Stunning and brave," one user wrote on X. "I always knew you were an amazing woman," another quipped. "Boycott her," one social media user wrote on X. Your virtue signaling isn't working anymore," another wrote. Natalie Portman, who was promoting her film, "The Gallerist," opened up about the "devastating" events unfolding in our country. Natalie Portman wore an "ICE OUT" pin while attending Sundance Film Festival on Jan. 24, 2026. "This is such a joyful community celebrating film here and we're so excited to be showing ‘The Gallerist,' but we're also at a moment in our country's history that is quite devastating," Portman told Variety. "It's really impossible not to talk about what is happening right now and the brutality of ICE and how it has to stop immediately. But also, there's a beautiful community that Americans are showing right now. It's a bittersweet moment to celebrate something we're so proud of on the backdrop of our nation in pain." Earlier this month, several celebrities who attended the 83rd Golden Globes protested ICE just days after the fatal shooting of Renée Nicole Good. Stars like Mark Ruffalo, Wanda Sykes, Jean Smart, Ariana Grande, Natasha Lyonne and others wore pins with slogans that read, "BE GOOD" and "ICE OUT." "Of course, this is for the mother who was murdered by an ICE agent, and it's really sad. I know people are out marching and all today, and we need to speak up," Sykes told Variety on the red carpet prior to the show. "We need to be out there and shut this rogue government down, because it's just awful what they're doing to people." The "BE GOOD" pin "aims to honor Renée Macklin Good and Keith Porter while also reminding us what it means to be good to one another in the face of such horror — to be a good citizen, neighbor, friend, ally and human," read the campaign's official description, via People. Celebrities wore anti-ICE pics at the Golden Globes. Golden Globes viewers quickly reacted on social media to the red carpet political protest. "Such bravery," one user wrote on X. "Bravo to those with influence standing up for what's right," another wrote. "They are so pathetic and a bunch of hypocrites," one X user wrote. "If Hollywood is against it, you know to support the opposite," another added. Christina Dugan Ramirez is an entertainment writer for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>His administration is trying to distort the reality of Alex Pretti's killing. On January 23, 2016, Donald Trump notoriously declared, “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters.” That statement was understood at the time as a metaphorical expression of the depth of Republican voters' commitment to him. Ten years and one day later, his administration's agents shot a disarmed man on the street in full view of the public. Perhaps we should have taken him not only seriously but also literally. The dynamic Trump observed is that he had created a bond with his supporters that no outside facts could break, even something as blatant as a cold-blooded killing on an American street. All politicians spin and distort to some extent, of course. Trump's innovation was to grasp that, because the conservative movement had trained its devotees to ignore mainstream media and rely completely on information supplied by its own loyalists, his ability to control his supporters' perceptions effectively had no limit. After Customs and Border Patrol agents shot and killed Alex Pretti in Minneapolis yesterday, the Trump administration immediately branded him a “domestic terrorist.” The specific allegation it employed to support this hyperbolic charge was that, because Pretti was carrying a firearm while filming and then clashing with agents, he intended to massacre federal officers. Even if that were true, it still would not remotely justify the fact that, according to multiple videos of the incident, agents shot Pretti after they had pinned him to the sidewalk and disarmed him. Until very recently, conservative rhetoric has valorized gun ownership as a bulwark against tyrannical government, to the point of fetishization. Conservatives defended Kyle Rittenhouse as a hero for bringing a rifle to a chaotic protest in Wisconsin during the summer of 2020, as well as armed bands of protesters who marched into state capitol buildings during the COVID lockdowns. Tyler Austin Harper: Minneapolis is a Second Amendment wake-up call Their view of the Second Amendment turns out to be no different from their view of the First: one whose protections apply exclusively to themselves. The administration's immediate use of the terrorist label should be understood not just as a hyperbolic accusation of intent but as an umbrella term it applies to political opposition generally. “There is a large and growing movement of leftwing terrorism in this country,” White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has written. His definition of terrorism does not require imputing specific motives to protesters who own a gun or, like Renee Nicole Good, drive a car. He has called forth state power on a scale that is coming to resemble the piecemeal extension of martial law. The administration's allies, not all of whom wish to directly endorse summary executions, have played along with his logic, treating protesters' reaction to the crackdown as though it were its cause. “For months, radical progressive politicians like Tim Walz have incited violence against law enforcement officers who are simply trying to do their jobs,” the National Rifle Association wrote in a statement yesterday. “The Left is in a cycle of constant self-radicalization—the resistance to ICE creates the predicate for tragedies that are used to justify ever-more resistance and the demand for the de-facto nullification of federal immigration law in Minneapolis,” National Review's editor in chief, Rich Lowry, wrote on X. Democratic Party leaders in the state have urged residents to record activity in order to produce a record of these acts. That is why Pretti was holding his phone, not his gun, when he intervened to protect a woman being tear-gassed by CBP agents, who then killed him. Officials' insistence that citizens who record agents are provoking violent retribution is a justification for what is becoming a very literal war on truth. If Trump himself, and not just one of his agents, actually shot somebody on the street, we can guess what would happen.</p>

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — American rock climber Alex Honnold ascended the Taipei 101 skyscraper on Sunday without any ropes or protective equipment. Wearing a red short-sleeve shirt, Honnold waved his arms back and forth over his head. “It was like what a view, it's incredible, what a beautiful day,” he said afterward. Rock climber Alex Honnold raises his fist atop the Taipei 101 skyscraper on Sunday. Honnold, known for his ropeless ascent up Yosemite National Park's El Capitan, climbed up one corner of Taipei 101 using small L-shaped outcroppings as footholds. Periodically, he had to maneuver around and clamber up the sides of large ornamental structures that jut out from the tower, pulling himself up with his bare hands. Divided into eight, each segment has eight floors of steep, overhanging climbing followed by balconies, where he took short rests as he made his way upward. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. Honnold's free solo climb of the iconic building in Taiwan's capital city was broadcast live on Netflix with a 10-second delay. Having a cheering crowd was unusual and a bit unnerving at first for Honnold, whose climbs are usually in remote areas. “When I was leaving the ground, you're like oh it's kind of intense, there's so many people watching,” he said. “But then honestly, they're all wishing me well. I mean basically it just makes the whole experience feel almost more festive, all these nice people are out supporting me and having a good time.” The climb drew both excitement and concern over the ethical implications of attempting such a high-risk endeavor on live broadcast. Honnold isn't the first climber to ascend Taipei 101, but he is the first to do so without a rope. French rock climber Alain Robert scaled the building on Christmas Day in 2004 as part of the grand opening of what was then the world's tallest building.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Millions use sleep-tracking devices, which have become increasingly accurate at gauging sleep. Experts say they highlight trends but shouldn't be seen as definitive health measures.

(AP Photo/Emilie Megnien) Wearable devices, including Apple Watches, can be used to track sleep, Wednesday, Jan. 21, 2026, in Atlanta, Ga. (AP Photo/Emilie Megnien) A patient room for sleep research is seen at the Morehouse School of Medicine Friday, Jan. 16, 2026, in Atlanta, Ga. (AP Photo/Emilie Megnien) ATLANTA (AP) — Your watch says you had three hours of deep sleep. Millions of people rely on phone apps and wearable devices like rings, smartwatches and sensors to monitor how well they're sleeping, but these trackers don't necessarily measure sleep directly. Instead, they infer states of slumber from signals like heart rate and movement, raising questions about how reliable the information is and how seriously it should be taken. The U.S. sleep-tracking devices market generated about $5 billion in 2023 and is expected to double in revenue by 2030, according to market research firm Grand View Research. As the devices continue to gain popularity, experts say it is important to understand what they can and cannot tell you, and how their data should be used. Here's a look at the technology — and why one expert thinks its full potential has yet to be realized. Whether it's an Apple Watch, a Fitbit, an Oura Ring or one of innumerable other competitors, health and fitness trackers largely take the same basic approach by recording the wearer's movements and heart rate while at rest, according to Daniel Forger, a University of Michigan math professor who researches the science behind sleep wearables. The algorithms used by major brands have become highly accurate for determining when someone is asleep, Forger said. The devices are also somewhat helpful for estimating sleep stages, though an in-lab study would be more precise, he said. “If you really want to know definitively how much non-REM sleep you're having versus REM sleep, that's where the in-lab studies really excel,” Forger said. Dr. Chantale Branson, a neurologist and professor at the Morehouse School of Medicine, said she frequently has patients showing up with sleep scores from fitness trackers in hand, sometimes fixated on granular details such as how much REM sleep they got on a certain night. Branson says those patients are taking the wrong approach: the devices help highlight trends over time but should not be viewed as a definitive measure of one's sleep health. “We would have believed them with or without the device and worked on trying to figure out why they can't sleep — and that is what the wearables do not do,” she said. Branson said she thinks people who check their sleep statistics every morning would be better served by spending their efforts on “sleep hygiene” such as creating a relaxing bedtime routine, avoiding screens before bed and making sure their sleep environment is comfortable. He recommends them even for people without significant sleep issues, saying they can offer insights that help users fine-tune their routines and feel more alert during the day. “Seeing if your biological clock is in sync is a huge benefit because even if you're giving yourself the right amount of time, if you're sleeping at the wrong times, the sleep won't be as efficient,” Forger said. Kate Stoye, an Atlanta-area middle school teacher, bought an Oura Ring last summer, having heard positive things from friends who used it as a fertility tracker: “It's so accurate,” she said. Stoye found the ring to be just as helpful with tracking her sleep. But as a metric-driven person, she became “obsessed” enough with her nightly sleep scores that it began to cause her anxiety — a modern condition that researchers have dubbed “orthosomnia.” Barreneche decided not to wear her ring on a beach vacation a few years ago, and when she returned home, she never put it back on. Branson, of the Morehouse School of Medicine, said she's observed similar score-induced anxiety as a recurring issue for some patients, particularly those who set goals to achieve a certain amount of REM sleep or who shared their nightly scores with friends using the same device. Forger thinks the promise of wearables has been underestimated, with emerging research suggesting the devices could one day be designed to help detect infections before symptoms appear and to flag sleep pattern changes that may signal the onset of depression or an increased risk of relapse. “There's this really important story that's about to come out: About just how understanding sleep rhythms and sleep architecture is going to generally improve our lives,” he said.</p>

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? It's been more than eight years since the last nuclear explosion. The last nuclear test took place in North Korea on September 3, 2017. The previous longest period without a detonation was between May 30, 1998, when Pakistan conducted its last test, and October 9, 2006, when North Korea conducted its first. A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world. (For a mesmerizing and disturbing visualization of these nuclear tests, I recommend this time-lapse animation by the Japanese artist Isao Hashimoto, which runs to 1998.) It's difficult for people today to imagine just how constant nuclear detonations were in the first decades after Hiroshima. Most of those tests were done above ground, marked by iconic mushroom clouds. The detonations were the visible backdrop to rising fears of a civilization-ending nuclear war, which at times seemed not just possible but inevitable. Nuclear conflict was a dominant and ever-present theme in global politics, a reality that, for all the geopolitical instability of our current era, most people alive today have never experienced. In addition to being provocative and destabilizing political acts, these tests have, for decades, been linked to increased rates of cancer, autoimmune disorders and other health conditions among the “downwinders” living near testing sites. The effects may be wider-ranging than that: a report released this week by the NGO Norwegian People's Aid estimated that nuclear testing may have caused as many as 4 million premature deaths from cancer and other conditions. It was partially out of growing fear of the radioactive effects of these detonations that the world began gradually phasing out testing, starting with the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty that prohibited above-ground detonations. After the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, we knew that these weapons worked. Some nuclear tests, like the record-setting “Tsar Bomba” set off by the Soviet Union — a 50-megaton warhead that was over 3,300 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima — may have been about projecting a powerful image as much as obtaining practical research data. Those “laboratory methods” have only gotten more sophisticated since then. When the world passed the record on January 14, I happened to be in Los Alamos reporting for a forthcoming story on how the lab that Oppenheimer built is now integrating artificial intelligence into its advanced modeling work, which includes ensuring that America's nuclear weapons will work the way they're supposed to in the hopefully unlikely circumstance that we ever decide to use them. But there are worrying signs that the pause on tests may not last indefinitely. In October, President Donald Trump called for the US to resume nuclear testing. It's not clear if any work has actually begun to make that happen, and it would probably be years before the US would be ready to test again, but the idea is gaining support amid a new nuclear era in which China is building up its arsenal and Russia is increasing its nuclear saber rattling. Next month, New START, the last remaining nuclear arms control agreement between the United States and Russia, will lapse, and there's little momentum toward replacing it. Advocates, including the drafters of the conservative Heritage Foundation's “Project 2025,” argue that a return to testing is necessary not so much for technical reasons, but as a demonstration of the credibility of America's nuclear deterrent. But in a recent essay in Foreign Affairs, Siegfried Hecker, former director of Los Alamos National Laboratory, warned that “a return to testing at this time would likely benefit U.S. adversaries more than it would the United States. Worse still, it might rekindle an even greater and broader arms race than in the first few decades of the Cold War.” We're not there yet, but the recent signs aren't good. US intelligence services have also suggested China may be conducting small nuclear tests, though not at the level that would violate the CTBT. Put those developments together with Iran's set-back but not abandoned nuclear program and increasing support for nuclear weapons among US allies who are less sure than ever about American security guarantees, and the future of the pause is far from certain. We were lucky to survive the era of constant nuclear testing, and we're fortunate to still live in a moment where years can go by without a detonation. But it remains to be seen whether we'll maintain that luck. A version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter.

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes) Some 12% of employed adults say they use AI daily in their job, according to a Gallup Workforce survey conducted this fall of more than 22,000 U.S. workers. That compares with 21% who were using AI at least occasionally in 2023, when Gallup began asking the question, and points to the impact of the widespread commercial boom that ChatGPT sparked for generative AI tools that can write emails and computer code, summarize long documents, create images or help answer questions. Home Depot store associate Gene Walinski is one of the employees embracing AI at work. The 70-year-old turns to an AI assistant on his personal phone roughly every hour on his shift so he can better answer questions about supplies that he is not “100% familiar with” at the store's electrical department in New Smyrna Beach, Florida. The share of Americans working in the technology sector who say they use AI daily or regularly has grown significantly since 2023, but there are indications that AI adoption could be starting to plateau after an explosive increase between 2024 and 2025. In finance, another sector with high AI adoption, 28-year-old investment banker Andrea Tanzi said he uses AI tools every day to synthesize documents and data sets that would otherwise take him several hours to review. Tanzi, who works for Bank of America in New York, said he also makes uses of the bank's internal AI chatbot, Erica, to help with administrative tasks. Another Gallup Workforce survey from last year found that about 6 in 10 employees using AI are relying on chatbots or virtual assistance when they turn to AI tools. Hatzidakis started with ChatGPT and then switched to Google's Gemini when the school district made that its official tool. More people and organizations will need to buy these tools in order to justify the huge amounts of investment into building and running energy-hungry AI computing systems. But not all economists agree on how much they will boost productivity or affect employment prospects. Workers in those mostly computer-based jobs that involve a lot of AI usage “usually have higher levels of education, wider ranges of skill sets that can be applied to different jobs, and they also have higher savings, which is helpful for weathering an income shock if you lose your job,” Manning said. On the other hand, Manning's research has identified some 6.1 million workers in the United States who are both heavily exposed to AI and less equipped to adapt. “If their skills are automated, they have less transferable skills to other jobs and they have a lower savings, if any savings,” Manning said. ”An income shock could be much more harmful or difficult to manage.” A separate Gallup Workforce survey from 2025 found that even as AI use is increasing, few employees said it was “very” or “somewhat” likely that new technology, automation, robots or AI will eliminate their job within the next five years. Michael Bingham, pastor of the Faith Community Methodist Church in Jacksonville, Florida. A chatbot fed him “gibberish” when he asked about the medieval theologian Anselm of Canterbury, and Bingham said he would never ask a “soulless” machine to help write his sermons, relying instead on “the power of God” to help guide him through ideas. Reported AI usage is less common in service-based sectors, such as retail, health care or manufacturing. Home Depot did not ask Walinski to use AI when he got a job at the store last year, after a decades-long career in the car business. “The human interface part is really what a store like mine works on,” Walinski said. The most recent survey of 22,368 employed U.S. adults was conducted from Oct. 30-Nov. 13, 2025. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 1 percentage point.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On the streets of multiple American cities, Bovino – sporting a buzzcut and the Border Patrol's olive green uniform – has been spotted leading patrols, hurling tear gas canisters and verbally sparring with critics. On social media, he's known for sharing photos and cinematic videos that tout Border Patrol agents' determination to carry out their mission. And now, his presence at the podium and on screens around the world is becoming more common as he delivers briefings from Minneapolis. That's where Bovino stood hours after a Border Patrol officer shot and killed a man in that city Saturday, telling reporters that officers had followed their training when faced with an armed suspect who “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” Critics quickly slammed Bovino's statement and others from Homeland Security officials, arguing that videos of the shooting show no evidence the man was trying to harm anyone. But Bovino doubled down on his defense of officers Sunday. “The fact that they're highly trained prevented any specific shootings of law enforcement, so good job for our law enforcement in taking him down before he was able to do that,” Bovino told CNN's “State of the Union.” Pressed to provide evidence, Bovino said more details would emerge as authorities investigate and argued that the man was trying to impede officers. “It's too bad the consequences had to be paid because he injected himself into that crime scene. He made the decision to go there,” Bovino said. The Border Patrol official's account drew sharp criticism Sunday morning from Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy. Videos appear to show federal officer took gun away from Alex Pretti just before fatal shooting, CNN analysis finds Bovino is no stranger to criticisms of his approach. In multiple social media posts and interviews, Bovino has repeatedly used a phrase to describe his officers' tactics. “He calls them ‘turn and burn,'” CNN contributor Lulu Garcia-Navarro says. Supporters of the administration's aggressive mass deportation push see Bovino as a hero. But the forceful, unapologetic approach that's fueled his recent rise to prominence has also drawn fierce criticism from local leaders and protesters in cities his team is targeting. Officials in several cities have described Bovino as leading a law enforcement agency which deploys tactics that are frighteningly authoritarian and used by the president as a cudgel against Democrat-led communities and the people — citizens and noncitizens alike — who live in them. JB Pritzker told CNN in October, accusing Bovino and other federal officials of deliberately inflaming tensions. Heavy-handed tactics, including immigration sweeps in parking lots and smashing car windows, have fueled alarm, including among some in the Trump administration, while also garnering praise from senior Homeland Security officials. When they don't walk a mile in the shoes of law enforcement, then they might want to think a second before full-blown criticism. I've heard a lot of that,” he told CNN in October. “Our officers act legally, ethically and morally in all law enforcement actions.” “People being killed simply for exercising their First Amendment rights is going to be a regular feature in this country. The Trump administration is turbocharging its immigration offensive on three controversial fronts. Bovino's presence in different cities across the country in recent months has become an unofficial barometer of how intense immigration enforcement is expected to get. Originally from North Carolina, Bovino joined the Border Patrol in 1996. In 2023, Bovino was briefly relieved of command from his position in what House Republicans described as a retaliatory measure after he testified critically about conditions along the border under President Joe Biden's administration. The Associated Press reported other factors were also at play – including his social-media presence and an online profile picture of him posing with an assault rifle. Bovino's conduct during the Chicago operation drew stern rebukes from a federal judge, who ruled that his descriptions of events weren't supported by video evidence. But in his deposition, Bovino denied he tackled the man. “I'm imploring (him)…to comply with leaving the area to comply with instructions,” Bovino said, adding, “the use of force was against me.” Lately, another aspect of Bovino's image is also drawing attention: the long green trench coach he sometimes wears. “Greg Bovino dressed up as if he literally went on eBay and purchased SS garb. Greg Bovino, secret police, private army, masked men, people disappearing quite literally, no due process,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said recently, drawing a comparison to Nazi uniforms. “I bought that as a young agent, approximately 1999,” he told News Nation, noting that he was also photographed wearing it for a ceremony during the Biden administration. That interview, Bovino wrote on social media, “cleared up any misconceptions and highlighted the double standard phenomenon.” Whatever happens next, there's little doubt we'll be seeing more of Bovino – and his coat – on America's streets. Slickly produced videos and other social media posts from Bovino's accounts have also drawn criticism. He says the posts are aimed at increasing transparency. “There is a number,” Bovino said, “and it's called all of them.” CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, Michael Williams, Dianne Gallagher and Zoe Sottile contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>European leaders are beginning to believe their continent is the last advocate for a world that isn't governed with a sense of might-makes-right. Between the Russian invasion of Ukraine, U.S. demands for sovereignty over Greenland, and other geopolitical upheavals to global norms, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is lamenting it all as a “shift in the international order” that is both “seismic” and “permanent.” Now, the Old Continent seems to be in agreement that its diplomatic posture will need to change drastically — learning to assert itself with confidence and solidarity in the face of a “world defined by raw power.” This new attitude was on full display at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week — a summit that, for many attending leaders, felt more like a funeral for how geopolitics used to be. For many, this demand, following a year that brought weaponized tariffs, mercurial attitudes toward defending Ukraine, and the abduction of a sitting world leader, proved to be the breaking point. “We were in a very bad position at the moment; we were dependent on the United States, so we chose to be lenient, but now so many red lines are being crossed that you have the choice between your self-respect.” “Every day we're reminded that we live in an era of great-power rivalry,” Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada told the audience. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned that the “new world of great powers” is “not a cozy place,” but that Europeans “do not have to accept this new reality as fate.” “We are not at the mercy of this new world order,” Merz said. To succeed, we must face harsh realities and chart our course with clear-eyed realism.” “Instead of becoming a truly global power, Europe remains a beautiful but fragmented kaleidoscope of small and middle powers,” Zelensky, who is generally prone to flattery and thankfulness, said Thursday. “Instead of taking the lead in defending freedom worldwide — especially when America's focus shifts elsewhere — Europe looks lost, trying to convince the U.S. president to change. Meanwhile, Trump has continued to expand his transnational ambitions unhindered, hosting a slew of world leaders for a signing ceremony that cemented his “Board of Peace,” which will oversee the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip. Trump will hold autocratic executive authority on the board, which has been embraced by a slew of Eastern European and Middle Eastern states but largely ignored by Western Europeans. “Who are the powers targeted by Ursula von der Leyen and other European leaders? Not long after Trump spoke at the Davos summit — a bellicose speech that included explicit jabs at many of the world leaders in attendance, including Carney and French President Emmanuel Macron — an unexpected breakthrough was announced. American, Danish, Greenlandic, and NATO officials agreed to begin negotiations on the future of Greenland that would be mutually satisfactory for all parties. Trump is seeking assurances that U.S. military actions on the island are legally unrestricted and will never expire. Europe just wants to keep Greenland under Danish control. Virtually zero concrete details about these negotiations have been announced, but all sides are celebrating their mere existence as a victory. Macron was arriving in Belgium for an emergency summit planned before the Davos breakthrough, a meeting intended to discuss coercive mechanisms that would punish the U.S. for its Greenland ambitions. With negotiations underway, focus shifted to normalizing trans-Atlantic trade, a priority disrupted by the dispute.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Japanese fans rushed to farewell the country's last two pandas on Sunday ahead of their return to China, in a departure that highlights strained relations between the two countries. Twin cubs Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei will leave Tokyo's Ueno Zoo Tuesday after meeting their fans for the last time on the weekend. They were born in the Japanese capital, but China retains ownership over them, under the rules of Beijing's “panda diplomacy.” The government there treats pandas as national symbols and goodwill ambassadors, loaning them to countries with which they wish to strengthen ties. The duo's departure leaves Japan without any pandas for the first time in more than five decades, at a time when relations between Asia's two biggest economies are at their lowest point in years. “I'm really sad,” visitor Shoken Ikeda told CNN during a recent trip to the zoo with his wife. Another panda fan Yukie Kuyama said she lined up for five hours to see the animals in early December. After winning the lottery, she came to see them again last week. It feels sad that such cute, innocent animals are being used as a trump card – or even a tool – in diplomacy,” she said. The siblings have different personalities, according to their keepers; Xiao Xiao is timid while his sister Lei Lei is fearless and adapts to changes quickly. Japan welcomed its first pandas in 1972 to mark the normalization of diplomatic ties with China. Since then, more pandas have arrived or were born locally, gaining a huge following. Beijing has responded with a flurry of economic pressure, including cutting flights and warning citizens against traveling to Japan. The number of Chinese tourists in Japan dropped by almost a half last month year on year, to around 330,000, Tourism Minister Yasushi Kaneko said last week. Chinese authorities have also suspended seafood imports and banned exports of rare earth elements with military uses, as they demand that Takaichi withdraw her comment. Meanwhile, Takaichi has called an election on February 8 in a bid to reinforce her mandate on a range of policies, potentially including her tougher stance on China, having secured the office by winning an internal contest among her Liberal Democratic Party in October. Last year, China also took back four pandas from the zoo of a Japanese town which relied heavily on panda-related tourism. In Shirahama, a resort destination tucked away on the southern coast of Japan, shops selling panda merchandise, and ramen bars serving up noodles themed on the bears, were left in limbo. China's decision not to renew the leases of those four bears was potentially related to Taiwan as well, one international relations expert told CNN earlier, coming after Shirahama elected a mayor with a pro-Taiwan stance. For now, staff at Ueno Zoo plan to keep the panda facility as it is and hope for the best. “The facilities were designed specifically for giant pandas, so it wouldn't be easy to adapt them for other animals,” said Hitoshi Suzuki, director of animal care and exhibits at the Zoo, who helped raise Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei from day one. He hopes to continue working with China on conservation and breeding research at the very least. But more than anything, he hopes the pandas will come back one day. “They're not only adorable but also fascinating animals, and I would love for many people to have the chance to see them,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a statement on Saturday night, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) vowed a blockade against the legislation if the funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security is not in some way amended, now calling it “woefully inadequate” after a 37-year-old man was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent during an immigration operation. Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill, but because of Republicans' refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE. Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included,” he said. Another government shutdown now looms large, with senators staring down a Jan. 30 deadline to pass the remaining funding bills. Republicans will needs some Democrats' support given the 60-vote threshold to pass the bill and their small majority. The DHS bill narrowly passed the House last week, as Democrats battled over how to address recent incidents involving U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, including the officer-involved shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month. Now, the Senate is poised to grapple with the same question after 37-year-old Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol agent while briefly intervening in an immigration operation. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) and Jack Reed (D-RI), suggested dropping the bill entirely and instead pass the other five remaining bills. Brian Schatz (D-HI) and Jacky Rosen (D-NV), have pitched vague “controls” and “guardrails” to “hold ICE accountable.” While a unified strategy has not yet taken shape, Senate Democrats will reportedly huddle on Sunday evening to discuss strategy ahead of what is a likely shutdown fight.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here's what we know about the shooting in Minneapolis on Saturday. The Department of the Homeland Security said Border Patrol agents were attempting to make an arrest shortly after 9 a.m. in south Minneapolis on Saturday. During that “targeted” operation “against an illegal alien wanted for violent assault,” the agents were approached by a man, identified as 37-year-old Alex Pretti, armed with a “9 mm semi-automatic handgun.” DHS said federal agents attempted to disarm Pretti, but he “violently resisted.” One agent, “fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers,” then fired “defensive shots” at Pretti, who died at the scene. DHS added that Pretti had two gun magazines on him but no identification, concluding that “this looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem later said state Democratic lawmakers were to blame for the increased tensions, while President Donald Trump similarly accused both Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey of “inciting Insurrection” with “their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric” against federal immigration officers. Pretti, holding just his cell phone, briefly intervenes, before being pepper-sprayed by the agent. A scrum then ensues, as at least five other agents attempt to subdue Pretti. While on the ground, one agent notices Pretti's weapon and appears to remove it from his waistband and away from the scene. The victim of the shooting was identified as 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a U.S. citizen with no criminal background and a valid gun permit, according to Minnesota police chief Brian O'Hara. Pretti had worked as an ICU nurse for the Veterans Affairs healthcare system in Minneapolis, and was described by his family as “a kindhearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends and also the American veterans whom he cared for.” Alex was a kindhearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends and also the American veterans whom he cared for as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital. Alex wanted to make a difference in this world. “I do not throw around the hero term lightly. However his last thought and act was to protect a woman. Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump's murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. Please get the truth out about our son. According to the Associated Press, he appeared at protests following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good earlier this month, and was described by family members as upset over Trump's immigration crackdown in Minneapolis. Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill, but because of Republicans' refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE. Schumer's statement sets up another shutdown fight just months after the longest in U.S. history. “What I see with my eyes and what you're going to see with your eyes makes that pretty hard to believe,” he said during a news conference. “I've seen the videos from several angles, and it's sickening.” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey later pleaded for Trump to end the immigration operation in the city, saying it “has to end.” Let's end this operation and, I'm telling you, our city will come back. The state National Guard was also deployed after being mobilized last weekend due to, at times, violent anti-ICE protests.</p>
