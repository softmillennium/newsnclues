                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Whether he's fighting all the demons that hell has to offer in Supernatural or racing against time to stop domestic threats in Countdown, Jensen Ackles has long been a hero in the eyes of his fans. Still, despite being cast as an actual superhero (depending on who you ask) in Eric Kripke's The Boys, the actor has more boxes he'd like to tick off on his superhero checklist. During a recent appearance at a Supernatural panel in Las Vegas, Ackles put himself out there as a would-be willing member of the Justice League should James Gunn be on the lookout for his Bruce Wayne, aka Batman, in the future. I think that is certainly a dream,” Ackles said to the room filled with Supernatural fans. “I've got a few go-tos,” he revealed, “Batman, Wyatt Earp, Robin Hood, that kind of stuff.” All three action-centered roles are ones we'd love to see Ackles take over, but Batman is certainly at the top. Should he enter Gunn's DCU, Ackles would be far from the first Supernatural alumni to step into the comic book world. His co-star, Misha Collins, who was also on stage at the Las Vegas Supernatural panel, previously appeared in The CW series, Gotham Knights, as Harvey Dent, aka Two-Face, a casting that he referred to as a “dream role.” Joking about his potential future with the ever-growing DCU, Collins said, “It's funny you mentioning Batman because playing Two-Face was a dream role. Sebastian Stan just got cast as Two-Face in the next Batman movie, which I did not feel jealous about. With Superman flying into cinemas last summer and Supergirl just around the corner, Gunn and Peter Safran's takeover of DC Studios has been flourishing. As of right now, Gunn hasn't announced moves for a new Batman movie, but Matt Reeves is pushing forward with The Batman Part II, which will see Robert Pattinson reprise his role as the titular vigilante, with Sebastian Stan and Scarlett Johansson also boarding the vehicle. Stay tuned to Collider for more information about the future of Gunn's DCU. Two brothers follow their father's footsteps as hunters, fighting evil supernatural beings of many kinds, including monsters, demons, and gods that roam the earth.

The Signal Mountain Police Department is urging everyone to stay inside and stay off the roads as crews work to clear off the ice.

Several trees are down, including one near the famed Flying Saucer "Spaceship" house.

Sergeant Detective David Holloway says it makes it easier on everyone cleaning up the mountain for people to stay home and not risk traveling.

"It just causes first responders more stress and and our resources have to be pulled in different directions," he told us. "So we're just hoping everybody will heed the call. You know, make a pot of chili, turn on the TV, watch football and and let this weather pass us by."

The storm, which is ever-evolving, has produced snow, freezing rain, and ice everywhere, especially in the higher altitudes like the mountain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At first glance, Princess Diana, Madonna, and Khloé Kardashian seem to share very little. They come from different eras, industries, and worlds of fame. Yet there's a quieter, more personal thread linking them, and it has nothing to do with fashion, headlines, or chart-topping success. From astrology and tarot to psychic readings, these women have explored intuitive practices as tools for clarity, comfort, and self-reflection during some of the most scrutinized moments of their lives. Friends and biographers have described her spiritual curiosity as deeply personal. It's a way to seek reassurance and emotional grounding while navigating extraordinary public pressure. Kardashian, 41, has spoken openly about seeking psychic insight, including appearing on Hollywood Medium with Tyler Henry. Her willingness to share that experience publicly reflects a generational shift toward normalizing spiritual curiosity. According to Trusted Psychics, celebrity openness plays a meaningful role in shaping how the public views spiritual practices. "People often assume celebrities turn to psychics because they want predictions," says Joanne Jones, Astrology and Psychic Expert for the brand. "In reality, it's often about finding perspective and reconnecting with intuition when life feels overwhelming." For women living under constant scrutiny, spiritual guidance can offer privacy, clarity, and a sense of control without dogma or expectation. One shared instinct: when the noise gets loud, look inward. This story was originally published by Parade on Jan 25, 2026, where it first appeared in the Entertainment section.</p>

UAP Drama Club, under the Directorate of Students' Welfare (DSW), successfully staged its 5th theatrical production, “Postmortem,” on Saturday at the National Theatre Hall, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy. Performing on such a prestigious national platform was a moment of great honor and pride for the students of the University of Asia Pacific (UAP).

The event was attended by UAP faculty members, officials, students, guardians, and distinguished guests. Among others, renowned actor Ashraful Ashis, Dhiman Chandra Barman, Assistant Professor, Department of Drama, Tagore University of Creative Arts, and Mohammad Aminul Islam, Advisor of the UAP Drama Club, were present to witness the performance and encourage the young artists.

The story of Postmortem revolves around the life of a young girl, where the real reasons behind her suicide are gradually revealed through a series of incidents, portraying deep social and psychological realities.

The play was written and directed by Fahim Maleque Ivan, Assistant Professor, Department of Drama and Dramatics, Jahangirnagar University. The lighting design was done by Faruk Khan Titu, costume design by Sazia Afrin Lubna, while stage design and music were also designed by Fahim Malek Ivan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former British No 1 Laura Robson has dismissed conspiracy theories that have been floated by some cynics following Jannik Sinner's fortune escape in his match against Eliot Spizzirri. Sinner was gripped by full-body cramps as the extreme heat in Melbourne took its toll on him and it seemed as if he would not be able to get through the match. Inevitably, social media platforms were full of comments from fans of Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic suggesting the rules were bent to ensure Sinner would remain in the event. Former world No 2 predicts dominance of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner will end in 2026 Jannik Sinner makes ‘got lucky' confession after surviving major Australian Open heat scare “There is no way he could have finished this match,” said Robson on TNT Sports. “Once he had time to go off court, the temperature drops in Rod Laver Arena, his core body temperature drops as well and he started to feel a little bit better. He was able to loosen up and find a way through.” Sinner will be grateful that he has two days to recover before his next match, but he will be keen to avoid playing in the daytime slots again as that may well be the biggest threat to his title hopes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>America's most sensitive nuclear sites have been secretly invaded by thousands of unidentified flying objects, a stunning new report has revealed. Crowdsourced platform Enigma revealed to the Daily Mail that there have been more than 2,800 'unidentified aerial sightings' over 90 US nuclear plants or nuclear weapons facilities over the last eight decades. The new report detailed sightings of objects often described as glowing orbs, disks, spheres, cylinders, or triangles hovering or flying in precise patterns within 25 miles of these nuclear sites. One of the most recent reports from April 2025 captured video of a glowing orange ball changing shape while flying over Bear, Delaware, which is located near the Salem Nuclear Power Plant and Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Station in New Jersey. One witness in California from April 2023 said: 'After hovering, it arched sideways and disappeared in the blink of an eye. I felt it was observing Diablo Canyon Nuclear plant.' More than 70 of these reports specifically referenced UFOs with metallic or reflective surfaces flying over bases in broad daylight during the early dawn hours. Enigma added that nuclear sites and missile bases in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Florida saw the biggest clusters of sightings. Enigma said: 'Many of these sightings described structured, light-emitting objects that pulsed or changed color before disappearing - characteristics that closely resemble those attributed to the unidentified drones reported across the region at the time.' One witness near the Salem nuclear power plant claimed that several small objects hovering over the facility seemed to combine into one large UFO in February 2024. 'So I started recording, and you see all these little lights going into the big bright one and not coming back out.' Although the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office is charged with investigating reports of UFOs, the military has maintained that there has never been any physical evidence that proves extraterrestrials or UFOs exist. The new report also detailed how many of the thousands of objects easily violated restricted airspace, raising concerns about how safe America's national security sites really are. What do you think these UFO incursions say about the safety of our nuclear sites and national security? 'If these objects belong to foreign intelligence or advanced programs, they expose vulnerabilities in national defense,' Enigma researchers wrote in a statement. Either possibility demands improved detection, data sharing, and protective measures.' Enigma, which allows people to report sightings and share pictures or videos of UFOs on an app, noted that these incidents include the strange craft seen over Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana in 1967, just as several Minuteman missiles shut down. Researchers detailed how witnesses claimed they saw UFOs over two major nuclear disasters - the 1986 reactor meltdown in Chernobyl, Ukraine and the 2011 accident in Fukushima, Japan. In Chernobyl, a bright cylindrical object was reportedly seen hovering near the burning remnants of the nuclear plant's Reactor 4. Overall, Enigma Labs has collected over 1,800 reports of UFOs flying and hovering near 53 nuclear power plants in the US. Another 1,000 reports specifically mentioned incidents that allegedly took place over 37 US military bases linked to nuclear weapons research or missile launch sites. Half of these sightings claimed that the objects were able to hover or seemed to float through the air, and one-third mentioned suddenly disappearing or vanishing into thin air.</p>
