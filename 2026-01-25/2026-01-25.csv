            Two Palestinian boys have been killed by Israeli fire in Gaza while collecting firewood, according to their families.
    


            The boys were cousins: Mohammad and Suleiman Al Zawaraa. Mohammad was 14; Suleiman a year younger, according to hospital authorities.
    


            They were killed on Saturday morning and their bodies were taken to Al Shifa hospital. Video showed the distraught father of one of the boys cradling his body in his arms.
    


            The two children and their families live in northern Gaza. Their uncle, Salman Al Zawaraa told CNN that the boys were close friends.
    


            “They were full of life and joy, they wanted to help their parents so they went out to collect firewood for cooking and for warming the family in this harsh winter,” Al Zawaraa told CNN on Sunday.
    


            The Israeli military confirmed to CNN on Sunday that “troops operating in the northern Gaza Strip identified several terrorists who crossed the Yellow Line, planted an explosive device in the area, and approached the troops, posing an immediate threat to them.”
    


            It said the incident was the same in which the boys were killed. But a military source claimed that “they were not children,” without offering evidence.
    


            The boys' uncle insisted they were far away from the Yellow Line, “almost at the entrance of Kamal Adwan hospital. What the occupation army says is a lie; those are innocent children they killed in cold blood.”
    


            In parts of Gaza, the yellow line is not clearly delineated or marked.
    


            It's not the first time that children in Gaza out looking for firewood have been killed.
    


            Fadi and Jumaa Abu Assi – eight and 10 years old – went out to fetch firewood for their disabled father in November. They were killed in a drone strike.
    


            The Israeli military acknowledged carrying out that strike in a statement, calling the children “two suspects who crossed the yellow line, conducted suspicious activities on the ground, and approached IDF troops operating in the southern Gaza Strip, posing an immediate threat to them.”
    


            The Palestinian Health ministry said Sunday that over the previous 24 hours three people had been killed by Israeli military action, bringing the total since the ceasefire came into effect in October to 484.
    


            It said that the cumulative death toll in Gaza since October 2023 was 71,657. The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its data.
    


            Last Wednesday, at least 11 Palestinians were killed in a series of attacks, according to UN Human Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT).
    


            It said there was “a broader pattern of post-ceasefire violence and the enduring effects of two years of devastation.”
    


            Among those killed were three Palestinian journalists near the Netzarim area in central Gaza who had been on assignment for the Egyptian Relief Committee (ERC).
    


            OPT said the killing of the three men brought the number of journalists killed in Israeli attacks since October 2023 to 292.
    


            “All vehicles belonging to the Egyptian Committee have the logo of the Egyptian Committee on them, despite that the vehicle was targeted by Israeli aircraft,” committee spokesman Mohamed Mansour told CNN. He said the journalists filmed the site “as usual on a daily basis.”
    


            The Egyptian Relief Committee is a state-run humanitarian organization that operates in Gaza with Israeli authorization “to support the Palestinian people amid the successive crises,” according to the group's website.
    


            In that case, the IDF said troops identified “several suspects” operating a drone they claimed was affiliated with Hamas in central Gaza “in a manner that posed a threat to their safety.” The IDF said it then carried out a strike “in accordance with the required chain of command approvals.”
    


            The incident was “under examination,” the IDF said.
    


            The military did not provide any evidence linking the drone to Hamas nor did it explain how it posed a threat to Israeli troops. On Tuesday – a day before the strike – the Egyptian Relief Committee posted several videos on social media clearly shot with a drone showing the tent encampment near where the journalists were killed.
    


            OPT said three incidents that same day took place near the Yellow Line, and two 13-year old boys were among those killed.
    


            “Repeated Israeli military operations into areas west of the redeployment line have also led to the displacement of civilians and the demolition of residential buildings in those areas,” OPT said.
    


            OPT said it had also recorded at least 80 reported killings of Palestinians by Hamas since the ceasefire, mostly in clashes with rival families and in summary executions.
    


            “People are dying every day, both in Israeli attacks and as a result of continued Israeli restrictions on the entry of humanitarian assistance, in particular shelter, leading to deaths from the cold and under collapsing buildings,” said Ajith Sunghay, Head of UN Human Rights in the OPT.
    


            The Israeli agency in charge of allowing aid into Gaza has rejected UN claims that nearly 80% of the population is facing hunger, describing them as “an attempt to recycle false and misleading claims for political and economic reasons.”
    


            The agency – the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) – said that every day between 600 and 800 trucks, primarily carrying food, enter the Gaza Strip.

            From UFC matches to the US Open, President Donald Trump has had box seats at some of the most high-profile sporting events in the country during his second term. But the president won't be attending football's biggest night: the Super Bowl.
    


            “It's just too far away. I would. I've gotten great hands for the Super Bowl, they like me,” Trump said in an interview with the New York Post on Friday. “I would go if, you know, it was a little bit shorter.”
    


            Super Bowl LX will be held February 8 at Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area.
    


            Four teams are competing Sunday to earn their place in the game. The Seattle Seahawks face the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship, and the New England Patriots face the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship.
    


            While Trump blamed his potential absence on the long flight, it's no secret he is not thrilled about this year's halftime performers, Bad Bunny and Green Day, both of whom backed Kamala Harris in 2024. (The president has frequently traveled long distances in his second term, including to the Middle East, Asia and Europe.)
    


            “I'm anti-them. I think it's a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible,” Trump told the Post.
    


            After the artists were announced in October, Trump told NewsMax he's “never heard of” Bad Bunny, who has nearly 84 million monthly listeners on Spotify, calling the choice “ridiculous.”
    


            Bad Bunny, a Puerto Rican singer and rapper, didn't initially include US stops in his 2025-2026 tour because of fear that US Immigration Customs and Enforcement would target concertgoers.
    


            “There was the issue that … ICE could be outside (my concert venue). And it's something that we were talking about and very concerned about,” Bad Bunny said in an interview with i-D magazine last year.
    


            Green Day's lead singer, Billie Joe Armstrong, has also called out Trump's administration as a “fascist government,” telling his audience at a concert, “It's up to us to fight back.”
    


            Trump has traveled along the East Coast during his second term to attend numerous sporting events, including UFC 314 in Miami, the Ryder Cup golf tournament in New York, the Army-Navy football game in Maryland, a New York Yankees game, and NCAA wrestling championships in Philadelphia.
    


            Trump received a mixed reaction at Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York City for the US Open men's finals, and similarly at Yankees Stadium, with some cheering and others booing.
    


            Another factor for Trump skipping the Super Bowl may be that he does not have any properties in the Bay Area. When traveling the country, Trump rarely stays at hotels that aren't affiliated with his own properties.
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House to see whether Trump has plans for a traditional presidential Super Bowl interview, given his criticisms of former President Joe Biden opting out of one in 2024.

US President Donald Trump has said he would impose a 100% tariff on all Canadian goods if Ottawa follows through on a trade agreement with China. The warning was issued as Trump accused Beijing of seeking to exploit Canada in order to bypass US trade barriers.

Trump has previously used tariffs, or the threat of tariffs, in trade disputes with a number of countries, including Canada. His administration has imposed a range of duties on Canadian exports. Ottawa and Washington were close to a deal last year to ease some of those levies, but the talks ultimately collapsed. Trump has since reiterated that he is prepared to raise tariffs on Canadian goods, although no new measures have taken effect.

“If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the USA,” Trump warned in a post on his Truth Social platform on Saturday.

“If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a ‘Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,” Trump said of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, repeating a moniker he'd created when he called for America's northern neighbor to become the 51st US state.

Earlier this month, Carney traveled to China to reset strained relations and reached what Canadian officials have described as a preliminary agreement or strategic partnership addressing specific trade barriers, rather than a comprehensive free trade deal.

Relations between Washington and Ottawa have further deteriorated in recent weeks following Carney's criticism of Trump's pursuit of Greenland, which the American president has said he wants to become a US territory.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Carney said a rules-based global order was over and argued that “middle powers must act together because if you are not at the table, you are on the menu.”

Trump responded during his own Davos address by saying Canada “lives because of the United States,” a claim Carney rejected. Trump later disinvited Carney from his proposed ‘Board of Peace', a body he has said would be tasked with addressing international conflicts.

In June 2024, a federal jury in Delaware found Hunter Biden guilty of making a false statement to a licensed gun dealer, guilty of making a false statement on a federal firearms purchase form about being an unlawful user of, or addicted to, drugs, and found guilty of possessing a firearm while being an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance. And then his father, former President Joe Biden, pardoned him. But that is just the tip of the iceberg for Hunter Biden. It's well known that the former president's son has had deep state connections to elements in Ukraine pushing for conflict with Russia.

MOSCOW, January 25. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump received an invitation to visit Russia at the Alaska meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in August, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said in an interview with TASS.

""Of course, an invitation was made in Anchorage for President Trump to visit the Russian Federation,"" he noted, commenting on a remark by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had suggested following the Anchorage meeting with Trump that the next meeting be held in Moscow.

However, in Ryabkov's words, there has been no practical development of the idea yet. ""As with other platforms for communication between the Russian and US presidents, our position remains firm: the substantive aspect should come first, followed by an agreement on a venue,"" the senior Russian diplomat added.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, January 25. /TASS/. The US intends to establish a logistical support base for its nuclear submarine fleet in Greenland, military expert Alexander Stepanov told TASS.

""They will be deploying new military infrastructure there. They need to establish a base to support the logistical needs of the nuclear submarine fleet. <…> They must militarize the Arctic as part of the US strategy of presence and dominance in the region. Therefore, Greenland is a priority springboard for them,"" the expert pointed out.

He recalled that the US also has plans to deploy the ground infrastructure of the Golden Dome missile defense project. ""And, of course, with the participation of the American transnational sector lobby, the development of rare earth metals, oil, and gas deposits on the shelf requires maximum government involvement, the establishment of a regulatory framework that corresponds to the interests of the American transnational cluster, and guarantees for future investments in developing the relevant resource base,"" Stepanov added.

However, according to the expert, military objectives are the top priority. ""The Arctic is the territory that will be fought over in the second half of the 21st century. We are already seeing all the signs of the West massively building up its military infrastructure under the auspices of the US,"" he said.

The military expert noted that he sees clear prospects for the expansion of US disagreements with Europe in this area. ""In my opinion, the US will undoubtedly establish jurisdiction over Greenland.

Snow, sleet, freezing rain and perilously cold temperatures forecast to sweep eastern two-thirds of nation

More than 700,000 households and businesses in the US are without power and more than 10,000 flights were cancelled as a monster winter storm moved into the north-eastern states bringing heavy snowfall.

Forecasters said snow, sleet, freezing rain and dangerously frigid temperatures would sweep the eastern two-thirds of the nation on Sunday and into next week. Those warnings came after three people were found dead Saturday afternoon on New York City streets “from weather-related circumstances” amid the brutally cold temperatures, as the local NBC affiliate reported.

Total damage and economic losses due to the storm are expected to exceed $100bn, according to a new preliminary estimate from AccuWeather experts.

“Up to [18] inches will fall over New England, and 0.50 inches of freezing rain over parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Ohio/Tennessee Valleys,” the National Weather Service reported on Sunday with respect to the heavy snow and ice accumulation expected from the winter storm. “Furthermore, heavy rain will develop over the Lower Mississippi Valley on Sunday and parts of the Tennessee Valley on Monday.

“In the wake of the storm, communities from the Southern Plains to the north-east will contend with bitterly cold temperatures and dangerously cold wind chills.”

Calling the storms “historic”, Donald Trump on Saturday approved federal emergency disaster declarations in South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Indiana, and West Virginia.

“We will continue to monitor, and stay in touch with all States in the path of this storm. Stay Safe, and Stay Warm,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.

Seventeen states and the District of Columbia had declared weather emergencies, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said. The DHS secretary, Kristi Noem, at a news conference on Saturday, warned people to take precautions.

“It's going to be very, very cold,” Noem said. “So we'd encourage everybody to stock up on fuel, stock up on food, and we will get through this together.” She added: “We have utility crews that are working to restore that as quick as possible.”

The number of outages continued to rise. As of 6.30am ET (1130 GMT) on Sunday, more than 700,000 US customers were without electricity, according to PowerOutage.us. Nearly 250,000 of those outages were in Tennessee while Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas reported in excess of 100,000.

The Department of Energy on Saturday issued an emergency order authorising the Electric Reliability Council of Texas to deploy backup generation resources at datacentres and other major facilities, aiming to limit blackouts in the state.

On Sunday, the department issued an emergency order to authorise the grid operator, PJM Interconnection, to run “specified resources” in the mid-Atlantic region, regardless of limits due to state laws or environmental permits.

The National Weather Service warned of an unusually expansive and long-duration winter storm that would bring widespread, heavy ice accumulation in the south-east, where “crippling to locally catastrophic impacts” could be expected.

Forecasters predicted record low temperatures and dangerously cold wind chills descending further into the Great Plains region by Monday.

More than 10,500 US flights were cancelled on Sunday, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. Aviation analytics firm Cirium said that as of Sunday morning, the storm is the highest experienced cancellation event since the pandemic.

More than 1,800 flight cancellations have also been reported for Monday. On Saturday, more than 4,000 flights had been cancelled.

 Up to 8in of snow with sleet has been reported in and around Little Rock, Arkansas, and almost three-quarter an inch of ice accumulation was reported near Hall Summit, Louisiana, south-east of Shreveport, according to the Weather Channel, with highest snowfall totals surpassing a foot in New Mexico.

Major US airlines warned passengers to stay alert for abrupt flight changes and cancellations. Delta Air Lines adjusted its schedule on Saturday, with additional cancellations in the morning for Atlanta and along the east coast, including in Boston and New York City. It would relocate experts from cold-weather hubs to support de-icing and baggage teams at several southern airports, the airline said.

JetBlue said that as of Saturday morning it had cancelled about 1,000 flights through Monday. United Airlines said it had cancelled some flights in places with the worst expected weather.

US electric grid operators on Saturday stepped up precautions to avoid rotating blackouts. Dominion Energy, whose Virginia operations include the largest collection of datacentres in the world, said if its ice forecast held, the winter event could be among the largest to affect the company.

37-year-old shot dead by federal agents on Saturday

Angel Reese and Ryan Clark also post about shooting

Hall of famer Alan Page seen at anti-ICE protests

A number of prominent US sports stars have condemned the killing of a registered nurse, Alex Pretti, by federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday.

Pretti, 37, is the second person shot and killed by federal agents in Minneapolis in less than three weeks as protests over Donald Trump's immigration crackdown sweep the city. Senior Trump administration officials have claimed Pretti intended to “massacre” federal officers with a handgun but video of the killing appears to contradict those claims.

Two-time NBA All-star Tyrese Haliburton, one of the best young players in the league, posted about the killing on Saturday. “Alex Pretti was murdered,” the Indiana Pacers guard wrote. Another basketball star, Angel Reese, posted “Praying for our country” on X.

NFL stars also reacted to the shooting. Former Steelers safety Ryan Clark, who won a Super Bowl with Pittsburgh and is now a broadcaster, paid tribute to Pretti on X. “Rest Easy Alex Pretti. Bro was a hero. Prayers to his family & loved ones. Senseless death… AGAIN!!” Clark wrote.

Dwight McGlothern Jr, a cornerback for Minneapolis's NFL team, the Minnesota Vikings, has regularly posted on the recent unrest and did so again on Saturday. “It's not right what's happening in Minnesota,” he wrote.

NFL hall of famer Alan Page, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Trump in 2018, appears to have been protesting against the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis this week. Images circulating on social media show the 80-year-old, who spent much of his career with the Vikings, among protesters.

Saturday's NBA game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and Golden State Warriors was postponed after Pretti's killing. The Timberwolves play less than two miles from the scene of the shooting and the NBA said it made the decision to “prioritize the safety and security of the Minneapolis community”.

NBA figures also spoke out after federal officers shot and killed another US citizen, Renee Good, earlier this month.

“It's shameful, really, that in our country we can have law enforcement officers who commit murder and seemingly get away with it,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said after Good's death.

Pretti's parents have said they are “heartbroken but also very angry” after their son's death.

“The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting. Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump's murdering and cowardly ICE thugs,” they said. “He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper-sprayed.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

US readers said they were feeling anxious and helpless as authorities' brutal crackdown has left thousands dead

Recent protests in Iran have created the most serious and deadliest unrest in the country since the 1979 revolution, prompting eyes from all around the globe to shift to the Middle East.

The Guardian asked Iranians living outside the country to share their views on the current situation in the country and about the possibility of US intervention.

Hundreds of Iranians based in the US described living in a constant state of anxiety and helplessness, consumed by fear for loved ones back home – worsened by the internet blackouts that have cut off communication.

“No one should have to wake up every day wondering whether their loved ones have been executed, imprisoned, or killed in the streets simply for demanding dignity and freedom,” Mahnaz, 36, wrote. “The scale of these atrocities demands more than statements of concern.”

Fereshteh, 45, a lab scientist, described the past weeks as “emotionally devastating”.

“Even from far away, the fear never stops. Many days I wake up terrified to check my phone, afraid of seeing bad news or learning that someone I love has been arrested, injured, or killed, Fereshteh said, adding that many Iranians they speak with “believe that peaceful protests alone are no longer enough”.

“The regime has shown that it will respond only with bullets, prisons, and executions,” they continued. “In this situation, international military intervention may be the only realistic way to stop the killing and dismantle this system of repression. If intervention can end this dictatorship and give people a chance to live freely, many of us believe it is a price worth paying.”

Ellie, 33, described feeling “an intense sense of survivor's guilt” being in the US and is “emotionally paralyzed and often speechless” by the news from Iran.

“A regime that suppresses its own people through violence, fear, and isolation does not remain a local problem,” she said. “It destabilizes regions, fuels extremism, drives forced migration, and normalizes brutality. Ignoring this does not create peace – it postpones a larger crisis.”

Many respondents said they believed some form of international intervention in Iran was necessary.

“I believe words and sanctions have failed for decades,” said Luna Houshmand, a software engineer in her 30s. “If they worked, this regime would not still be killing people in the streets. If the world truly believes in human rights, it must move beyond statements and take real action.”

A woman in New York, who asked to remain anonymous, said her family in Iran told her that people feel “desperate and helpless, and their only hope is foreign assistance”.

“President Trump promised the people of Iran that he would come to save them, and the people have counted on that promise,” she said. “Our only concern right now is that he may not follow through.”

Maryam Tehrani, in Seattle, said she believes Iranians need “not empty statements, but meaningful pressure on the Islamic Republic”.

“Sanctions targeting officials, international isolation, and real accountability matter,” she said. “Military intervention is complicated and risky, but indifference is not an option. The priority should be protecting civilians and supporting the Iranian people's right to decide their own future without repression.”

Sahar Haddadian, a civil engineer in Florida, said that “no one wants war” or “foreign intervention or to see innocent lives lost” but “history has shown that some regimes leave the world with no good options – only difficult ones”.

“You cannot negotiate with a regime that rules through terror,” Haddadian, 36, said, adding that “dialogue, appeasement, and empty diplomacy have failed”.

Haddadian also said the US must “make it clear that it stands with the Iranian people”.

“That means real consequences for regime leaders, full isolation of those responsible for crimes against humanity, and unwavering support for the people of Iran who are bravely demanding freedom,” they said.

Ellie, 42, in Colorado, said that while she is “strongly against war,” the “situation in Iran has reached a point where people are being killed for demanding basic rights” and that “without some form of international intervention, whether political, diplomatic, economic, or strategic pressure, it is difficult to see how this regime can be stopped.”

“If President Trump or any other world leader is willing to take meaningful, non‑military action that helps end the ongoing repression, I would welcome that support,” she said.

An Iranian in California, who asked to remain anonymous, said they have long opposed “foreign military intervention in Iran”, “do not trust US intentions” and are “deeply aware of the damage outside interference has caused in the region”, but now feel torn.

“We are now at such a deadlock that I honestly don't know what to feel anymore,” they said. “When a regime responds to peaceful protests with mass bloodshed, when civilians are gunned down and hospitals overflow with the injured, it forces people like me into impossible moral contradictions.

“I find myself torn between my long-held beliefs and the sheer desperation of watching my people slaughtered with no protection and no voice.”

Tara, a 36-year-old engineer, also described herself as “deeply conflicted” about US intervention.

“I can't predict what would happen to my family, and I fear that any intervention could lead to more death and devastation,” she said. “At the same time, I see no clear alternative for ending the Islamic regime's grip on power. I wish there were a way to remove those responsible without harming ordinary people or destroying our beautiful country.

French skipper Thomas Coville set a new record for the fastest sail around the world, improving the previous mark by more than 12 hours when he yesterday won the Jules Verne Trophy.

Coville and teammates Benjamin Schwartz, Frederic Denis, Pierre Leboucher, Leonard Legrand, Guillaume Pirouelle and Nicolas Troussel crossed the finish line off the French island of Ouessant after 40 days, 10 hours, 45 minutes and 50 seconds at sea in their 32m trimaran Sodebo Ultim 3.

The previous record was 40 days, 23 hours, 30 minutes, 30 seconds, set in 2017 by another Frenchman, Francis Joyon.

Coville and his crew faced dramatic weather conditions on their way to the record, having to lengthen their route in the South Atlantic before they withstood Storm Ingrid near the finish. They set new benchmark times at every Cape — Good Hope, Leeuwin and Horn.

Coville averaged 29.17 knots (54kph) over 45,569km, also improving two intermediate records during the journey. In comparison, Joyon sailed 26,506km at an average speed of 26.85 knots.

Cameroonian big man Embiid scored 32 points, grabbed 15 rebounds and handed out 10 assists, posting the ninth triple-double of his career to help the Sixers end the Rockets' three-game winning streak.
Rockets star Kevin Durant scored 36 points and Amen Thompson added 17, but Thompson was scoreless in the fourth quarter.
Even so, the Rockets led by nine midway through the final frame, Maxey tying it at 115-115 with 40.1 seconds left.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:taipeitimes.com","At Davos, the world rebalanced against a bully","https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2026/01/26/2003851210","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 16:00:00 GMT","

Better late than never: One year into the second term of US President Donald Trump, the world has reached an inflection point, as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney made explicit in his speech at an economic summit in Davos. Having tried and failed to appease Trump's imperialist bullying, middle powers such as his own country must instead “act together, because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu.”

Acting together, would take the form of “variable geometries,” Carney said. Countries, whether traditional friends or foes of the US, might form ad hoc coalitions to pursue specific interests, trade pacts to replace commercial links to the US that Trump has damaged or severed, cooperation in new or existing multilateral forums, or even new military alliances.

This reaction to Trumpism is exactly what international relations theory predicted. In the 1980s, the realist academic Stephen Walt, nowadays at the Harvard Kennedy School, formulated the “balance of threat” hypothesis of world affairs. 

Illustration: Yusha

It said that states tend to form alliances to counter countries that are simultaneously mighty and hostile.

At the time, Walt's insight addressed a shortcoming in conventional wisdom, which stipulated that a balance of power was the default tendency in world politics. That theory fit the 19th century, for example. The problem was that it could not explain the Cold War, when one of the superpowers, the US, attracted rather than repelled many middle and small powers, with no counterbalancing to speak of. The dissonance became even starker after the Cold War, when the US became a hyperpower and still kept adding allies, totaling about 70.

What made the US historically unusual, of course, is that for about eight decades it was a controversial, but largely benevolent hegemon of the international system, one that provided global public goods such as open trade, international law and a modicum of order. To countries from Canada to Denmark and South Korea, the US looked powerful, but protective, rather than threatening.

Trump, as you might have noticed, flipped that stance into powerful and menacing. Not only is he fond of what Jake Sullivan and Jon Finer, the top national security advisers of former US president Joe Biden, call “flamboyant violence” — force for show rather than long-term strategic advantage, as in Venezuela recently. Trump also threatens middle powers that are close allies, such as Canada and Danish Greenland, with annexation — even if this week he seemed to tone down his tariff assault against Europe over Greenland.

The enigma of the past year was that this new phenomenon of an aggressive US did not cause a balance of threat. Aside from the autocrats of China and Russia, who either stared Trump down or strung him along, most leaders from Europe to the Middle East and Asia tried to flatter and kowtow to the US president. They have gifted him golden crowns, luxury jets and crypto deals; nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize; or simply fawned as though trying to win an Oscar. The leader of NATO went so far as to call Trump “daddy.”

Asked whether he was surprised that his balance-of-threat theory did not kick in for a while, Walt said: “Not really,” because “reacting against the US as a threat is costly,” and the countries that Trump has offended or economically harassed are numerous enough to pose a “collective-action problem.” It is only now dawning on allies that “accommodation isn't working,” because Trump is a “predatory hegemon,” and “there is no such thing as a lasting deal with a predatory hegemon.”

Now, though, the penny has dropped and the rebalancing has begun. Some countries are forming new security pacts, as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan recently did. The EU and Mercosur, a South American trade bloc, accelerated talks about a mega-deal after decades of being stuck. India, whose leader used to be chummy with Trump, is warming up ties to China and others. And a whole succession of leaders from countries that are nominally still US allies — the UK, Germany and South Korea — are wooing rather than shunning Beijing to deepen economic cooperation. China, incidentally, just clocked its biggest trade surplus ever, despite Trump's tariffs, after more than replacing its lost exports to the US with exports to the rest of Asia, Europe and other places.

Carney's Canada is a good example. He has been opening commercial and diplomatic doors from Europe to India. He even visited China, after a brief ice age in bilateral relations since 2018 (when Canada arrested a Chinese executive who was wanted in the US and China retaliated by detaining two Canadians). Now, Beijing and Ottawa have a “strategic partnership.” 

The goal, Carney has said, is to wean Canada from its big US neighbor, Carney said.

The hardest and slowest threat balancing is the military sort, because the US' preponderance in hard power is so overwhelming. 

“I don't see a non-US NATO forming an alliance with China,” Walt said. However, as countries in Europe and Asia rearm, they might start thinking twice about buying their kit from the US, and might even consider building their own nuclear arsenals now that the US “umbrella” seems leaky.

“America First” might sooner or later become “America Alone,” I predicted about a year ago. The world, after trying in vain to placate its predatory hegemon, now seems to have started the hard work of rebalancing.

There have been many similar cases, but it is particularly troubling that some of the victims were excluded from the social welfare safety net because they did not meet eligibility criteria. 
According to media reports, the middle-aged daughter had sought help from the local borough warden. Although the warden did step in, many services were unavailable without out-of-pocket payments due to issues with eligibility, leaving the warden's hands

Although the snap election on Feb. 8 might appear to be a domestic affair, it would have real implications for Taiwan and regional security.
Whether the Takaichi-led coalition can advance a stronger security policy lies in not just gaining enough seats in parliament to pass legislation, but also in a public mandate to push forward reforms to upgrade the Japanese military. As one of Taiwan's closest neighbors, a boost in Japan's defense capabilities would serve as a strong deterrent to China in acting unilaterally in the

Taiwan also became the first country to secure most-favored-nation treatment for semiconductor and related suppliers under Section 232 of the US Trade Expansion Act. 
In return, Taiwanese chipmakers, electronics manufacturing service providers and other technology companies would invest US$250 billion in the US, while the government would provide credit guarantees of up to US$250 billion to support Taiwanese firms

We urge all parties to exercise restraint, avoid unilateral actions and resolve issues peacefully without threat or use of force.”
The statement set a firm tone at the beginning of the year for India-Taiwan relations, and reflects New Delhi's recognition of shared interests and the strategic importance of regional stability.

People film U.S. President Donald Trump during his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 21.Markus Schreiber/The Associated Press

A recent conversation around my family's dinner table took a weird turn when my teenaged son started talking about the bunker he wants to build. The adults at the table had been discussing the recent escalation in belligerence from the Trump administration when my 17-year-old calmly announced that it was time to begin stockpiling supplies and preparing for the worst.

I tried to explain that the world is not on the brink of catastrophe – and that we wouldn't be digging or hoarding our way out of the current challenges – but he was already spinning the globe in search of the perfect spot for his future hideout. 

The aggression of our southern neighbour presents a unique challenge to Canadian parents and educators. We want our kids to understand what's going on – from the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to U.S. President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again threats to take control of Greenland or Canada – even as we struggle to do so ourselves.

“Every single day we are given treasures,” says Andrew Champion, a civics, history and economics teacher at Fredericton High School in New Brunswick. By “treasures” he means news items. “Each one is worth days of discussion,” he says. “But they just keep coming.” 

Are Trump's threats making you anxious? Here are six ways to cope

Champion, who has been teaching for 20 years, believes the volume and pace of recent events is having a numbing effect on today's students. “The last five years have been nothing but chaos,” he says, referring to the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Gaza war and devastating climate events – in addition to the increasing unpredictability of the Trump administration and political violence south of the border.

“They open their phones and see Charlie Kirk getting shot in the head, or the Venezuelan president being handcuffed,” says Champion. “Many don't think it's a big deal. They're desensitized.”

Other students may be worried about what they see in the news, or perplexed by the 30-second clips and soundbites that fill their social media feeds.

If you're wondering how to support your teen through these troubled times, here are four strategies to keep in mind. 

1. Help them to tell fact from fiction

Ryland Caravello, a Grade 12 student in Toronto, likes to stay on top of current events but he's aware that information shared on social media is not always trustworthy. “Everyone has a motive,” he says. 

“The biggest thing I teach my students is how to distinguish between facts and misinformation and disinformation,” says Champion. With advances in AI, and the proliferation of doctored images and anti-factual claims, the task gets more complicated by the day. Champion recommends CTRL-F, a digital media literacy resource from the Canadian civic education charity CIVIX, to help guide students toward sources they can trust.

It also doesn't hurt to have old fashioned news media around. As social media becomes more fractious and trickier to decipher, kids may find reassurance in the fact-checked printed word or newscast. 

2. Tie the present to the past

Connecting the events of today to those of the past helps kids contextualize what they are living through. Steve Axworthy, a social studies teacher at Little Black River School and municipal councillor in Victoria Beach, Man., says the single most effective way of helping students understand the current moment of big power aggression is to review the lives of fascist strongmen throughout history. “You teach them about Hitler, Mao, Mussolini, Stalin, Lenin, and they see the pattern,” he says. “And then they understand why history is important.” 

But Caravello, the Toronto high school student, wishes teachers would bring more of the present world into classroom discussions. He's also surprised by how focused his peers are on American politics, and how ignorant they are of the basic facts of Canadian history and governance.

“They're pretty much all anti-Trump,” he says, “but they really don't know what's going on in Canada. It's annoying.”

Four ways to get kids engaged in the political world around them

3. Be honest with them

Global affairs may soon be top of mind for more students. My own teenaged sons are not overly interested in geopolitics, but a recent headline about the Canadian military modelling of a response to a hypothetical U.S. invasion got them thinking.  So did the recent news that Germany, the country of their birth and citizenship, has introduced voluntary military service over concerns about Russian aggression.

As Prime Minister Mark Carney made clear in his speech in Davos, there's no point in pretending that the rupture in global relations is not serious. The challenge is to get kids thinking beyond the immediate impact to themselves and consider the bigger picture. Suddenly democracy and sovereignty are more than abstract notions.

Axworthy makes this point by starting his Grade 8 social science class with required reading of either George Orwell's 1984 or Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451. He says students are astonished by how these dystopian novels, written in 1949 and 1953 respectively, seem to have anticipated so many facets of the world they see around them. Axworthy says their predominant reaction is, “How come nobody is stopping this?” and “Can anything be done?”

While some teachers avoid raising political issues in class because they fear reprisal from parents, or accusations of having overburdened students' young minds, he has the opposite concern: that by “protecting” kids from the facts of history, they will ultimately come to resent their gatekeepers. He sees no evidence that students are worried about an imminent American invasion.

“The only fear I see in my students is the fear of people not doing anything,” he says. “If you give them knowledge, they feel empowered and they realize that they have agency. It sets them on a path.”

4. Promote open discussion

Champion works hard to create a safe space in his classroom where kids know that opposing views are welcome, and that there are no stupid questions. “It's clear that some students are only hearing one political perspective at home,” he says, “and this is a chance for them to hear others.” 

In our family, the younger generation typically opposes their elders at every turn in political discussions. It's part adolescent defiance, part provocation and part test of mettle; before they adopt a position for themselves, they want to make sure it has merit. Heated discussions are productive as long as they remain civil, and civility takes practice.

A dingo at an Australian wildlife park in 1998.Russell Mcphedran/The Associated Press

A pack of dingoes found circling the body of a young Canadian after her death on a beach in Australia will be culled, government officials announced Saturday.

The family of Piper James has said the 19-year-old from Campbell River, B.C., ventured out Monday for an early-morning swim on a beach on K'gari, an island off Australia's east coast.

Family mourns after B.C. teen Piper James found dead in Australia circled by dingoes

Police in the state of Queensland have said her body was found not long after, surrounded and “interfered with” by a pack of about 10 dingoes, a type of wild dog.

In an online statement, a spokesperson from the government's Ministry of Environment and Tourism said Saturday they were aware of initial autopsy findings suggesting dingo bites were likely not James's immediate cause of death.

The statement said rangers monitoring the wild dogs this week have noticed “aggressive” behaviour.

“Following the initial autopsy findings, this pack's involvement in the incident, and observations since, this pack has been deemed an unacceptable public safety risk,” the statement said.

“Dingoes involved in Monday's incident will be humanely euthanized.”

Minister Andrew Powell said in the same statement that while euthanizing the animals was a tough decision, it's the “right call.”

“This tragedy has deeply affected Queenslanders and touched the hearts of people around the world,” he said.

A brief social media post from Todd James, Piper's father, says the announcement is “simply sad, heart-wrenching information.” He notes a final autopsy report has yet to be issued.

He has previously said a “smoke ceremony” for his daughter would be held in Australia, and the family hopes to attend. They are also expected to bring home her remains next week.

A GoFundMe campaign to do so had raised a little more than $20,000 as of late Saturday. 

James had been travelling around Australia since October with a friend, also from Campbell River, and had found a job on K'gari, a world heritage site that is a popular destination for backpackers and other tourists.

K'gari, the world's largest sand island, is known for its population of dingoes. The Queensland government actively warns visitors to be “dingo safe.”

Two beach camping areas have been closed until the end of February, and ranger patrols have increased since James's death.

There has been a series of dingo attacks on K'gari, also known as Fraser Island. In addition to the 2023 incident, they include the fatal mauling of a nine-year-old in 2001.

Australia's most notorious dingo attack – the death of two-month-old Azaria Chamberlain in central Australia in 1980 – inspired the 1988 film “A Cry in the Dark,” featuring Meryl Streep as the infant's mother, who was wrongfully convicted of murder.

Friends and family have said James was a “brave little girl” with an infectious laugh who dreamt of becoming a pilot. Her mother, Angela James, has said her daughter was adventurous and loved motocross, camping and swimming.

A preliminary assessment on James's body, released earlier this week, suggests there were “pre-mortem” bites in addition to evidence consistent with drowning.

The Coroners Court of Queensland has said the coroner is awaiting pathology results to further assist in determining the cause of death.

The process is expected to take several weeks.

In what's been called a victory for free trade, the EU and India are set to agree on ""the mother of all deals"" and a defense pact that aims to lure India away from its close political and military ties to Russia.

At Khan Market in New Delhi, Atul Mehra was optimistic that a deal between the European Union, the world's single largest market, and India, the world's fastest growing major economy, will revive his gems and jewelry business. He lost a quarter of his earnings last year, after US President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on his country. 

""We have suffered massive losses since the tariffs, people in the US were our major clients,"" he told DW. ""And we hope that a deal with the Europeans will help us, and everybody."" 

Vishnu Gupta, a garment shop owner on the same street who has business all over India, said the deal would allow him to expand his trade and find new markets.

While the US has said the high tariffs are meant to dissuade India from buying Russian crude oil, it appears the EU has adopted a different approach to lure India away from Moscow's orbit — more trade and stronger defense ties. 

At a high stakes summit in New Delhi this week, the EU and India are expected to finalize a free trade agreement and sign a new security and defense partnership, the third such agreement between the EU and an Asian country after Japan and South Korea. 

""Despite longstanding arguments in favor of a closer partnership, including shared competition with China and trade incentives for both parties, it was Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Trump's punitive tariffs that have brought momentum to the relationship,"" said Praveen Donthi, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group based in Delhi.

Before the summit, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa will be the chief guests at India's Republic Day celebrations on Monday, when diverse floats from all over country will be on display alongside parading tanks and soldiers. They are the first top EU officials to be invited to take part in the event.

On Tuesday, officials are set to conclude talks on the trade agreement that would create a market for nearly 2 billion people who account for a quarter of the world's GDP. Von der Leyen and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also attend the first EU–India Business Forum, alongside more than two dozen major industrialists from both sides. 

The EU and India are also expected to launch a new cooperation framework on labor mobility, under which the EU hopes to attract high-skilled and seasonal workers from India. ""Of course, in line with what the labor market in the European Union needs,"" an EU official said, on condition of anonymity to speak freely.

In addition, the EU hopes to explore a potential role for India in the EU's flagship research and innovation program, Horizon. 

""Leaders will also touch on connectivity,"" the official added. ""We are particularly focused on the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, IMEC, which would create new transport, digital and energy connections between India and Europe"" via Arab countries and Israel. 

""Europe wants to do business with the growth centers of today and the economic powerhouses of this century,"" von der Leyen said Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, calling the trade agreement with India ""the mother of all deals.""

According to EU data, the EU is India's largest trading partner; trade in goods reached worth €120 billion in 2024, 11.5% of India's total trade. By 2030, India is projected to be the world's third-biggest economy after China and the US.

The EU is hoping India will drop its famously high tariffs on imported vehicles, currently more than 100%, and boost the European car industry in the face of competition from China. And, as Indians move up the ladder in economic mobility, the European alcohol industry stands ready to quench their thirst for fine wines and spirits. Under the trade deal, India is expected to scrap its staggeringly high tariffs on alcohol — as high as 150% on imported wines. 

Last year, under its free trade agreement with the United Kingdom, India agreed to drop tariffs on both cars and alcohol but in phases — to reduce the impact on domestic manufacturers.

For its part, India has demanded easier standards for its pharmaceutical exports, and the same duty-free access for textiles that the EU gives to Asian neighbors like Pakistan and Bangladesh. Delhi hopes this will offset the impact of the US tariffs, which have been especially damaging for India's garment sector. 

India is also hoping to send more professionals to the EU for employment opportunities, and is looking for commitments on joint production in the defense industry.

Lisa Musiol, head of EU affairs at the International Crisis Group in Brussels, said India is the first country with close political and military ties to Moscow to strike a key defense partnership with the EU. 

""Over time, this partnership could open the door for New Delhi to tap parts of the EU's SAFE loan facility for common defense procurement,"" she said, in reference to a €150 billion EU financial instrument called Security Action for Europe, or SAFE, that offers low-interest loans to obtain defense equipment and strengthen EU's defense industry.

Experts told DW that while India is still largely dependent on Russia for its military equipment, that dependence is gradually reducing as New Delhi diversifies its suppliers. France has emerged as a key partner, and India has stepped up talks with Germany on contracts for military transport aircraft and submarines. For its part, India hopes to supply the EU with ammunition, much needed in Ukraine, and could potentially free up European supplies to send across to Kyiv.



Overall, India aims to increase its exports to the bloc, which currently account for just 2.5% of the EU's total imports, and enhance its supply chain integration.

While there is a lot on the table, negotiations are expected to go down to the wire as several sticking points persist. 

As with the recent EU-Mercosur trade deal, agriculture has emerged as a top concern. Nearly half of India's workforce is employed in agriculture, and India is worried that European agricultural products might replace Indian products and threaten the livelihood of millions of people. That had made Delhi reluctant to grant the EU the kind of market access it seeks. 

The topic is also highly politically sensitive for New Delhi. In 2021, when massive farmer protests forced Prime Minister Modi to withdraw a series of agricultural reforms, it was seen as a rare and public political retreat for the powerful leader.

But the EU, battered with its own farmers' protests against the Mercosur deal with South America, is under immense pressure to seek new markets for Europe's agricultural produce.

Brussels is equally hesitant to grant certain Indian agricultural exports unimpeded access to EU markets. Last month, the bloc reportedly decided to limit rice imports from India and other Asian countries to protect domestic rice growers and millers. 

Steel is another major bone of contention, especially since the EU doubled tariffs on foreign steel in October and slashed the quota for duty free imports in half. The spike in tariffs was introduced on top of a new carbon tax that will make Indian steel exports less competitive.

The EU claims its carbon tax is intended to reduce its global carbon footprint, but Indian diplomatic sources say both measures are protectionist.

And yet, both sides agree the only way is forward. 

""We don't see eye and eye on everything, but we do share a set of core interests, "" the EU official said. ""Like stable international order, reduced [trade] dependencies, and diversified supply chains.""

Spiderman called in sick, so Alex Hannold scaled the Taipei 101 — all without ropes, safety nets or spidey webs. Taiwan's president congratulated Honnold on completing the challenge.

An American climber scaled Taiwan's tallest tower on Sunday, without a safety net or a harness, becoming the first person to do so.

Hundreds of spectators gathered as Alex Honnold, 40, began his journey up the ""Taipei 101.""

After an hour and a half, Honnold had successfully climbed 1,667 feet (508 meters), uttering the word ""sick"" as he took in the view. He then rappelled down to his wife Sanni McCandless Hannold.

The risky adventure was captured and broadcast live on streaming platform Netflix.

""Time is finite,"" Honnold said in a press briefing, adding that people should ""use it in the best way."" 

The adventurer rose to fame in 2017 after he climbed Yosemite's ""El Captain"" which is lauded among climbers as the pinnacle of technical difficulty.

Honnold told reporters that it had been a lifelong dream to scale Taipei 101 to his list of achievements.

Honnold said he had considered to scale the building without permission after his first request was denied.

""But ​then ​out of respect for the building and respect for all the people on the team who'd allowed me access to look at it, I was like, well obviously I'm not going to poach this, I'm going to respect the people and just see if it ever comes together,"" he told reporters. 

""For the project to come together more than a decade later... It's so great. What an opportunity, it is such a pleasure.""

Before Honnold, Alain Robert — dubbed the ""French Spiderman"" scaled the building to reach its peak in 2004. But that was with the use of safety ropes.

Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te congratulated Honnold in a Facebook post on Sunday, branding the challenge ""truly moving.""

A new Pentagon strategy paper breaks with much past US defense policy, while ignoring climate change as a growing threat. It also foresees allies receiving less military support from Washington.

The US will concentrate mostly on protecting the homeland and combating the threat posed by China, while expecting allies to look after their own defense with reduced help from Washington, according to a strategy document released by the Pentagon on Friday.

The 2026 National Defense Strategy (NDS), subtitled ""Restoring peace through strength for a new golden age of America,"" differs markedly in its priorities from previous such documents.

It highlights a very different set of threats to US security, with immigration seen as a top danger and that posed by Russia and China downplayed.

The Pentagon document is based on US President Donald Trump's National Security Strategy, which was published last year.  

That strategy foresaw a reassertion of US dominance in the western hemisphere, building up military strength in the Indo-Pacific and a potential reassessment of relations with Europe.

""As US forces focus on homeland defense and the Indo-Pacific, our allies and partners elsewhere will take primary responsibility for their own defense with critical but more limited support from American forces,"" the strategy says.

In the Indo-Pacific region, the document says, the Pentagon is intent on preventing Chinese dominance over the US or its allies, but the strategy urges ""respectful relations"" with Beijing.

It says combating Chinese territorial ambitions ""does not require regime change or some other existential struggle. Rather, ‍a decent peace, on terms favorable to Americans but that China can also accept and live under, is possible.""

Notably, the document does not mention Taiwan, a US ally that China claims as its territory.

The document describes Russia as ""a persistent but manageable threat to NATO's eastern members for the foreseeable future"" and calls on the US's NATO allies to ""take the lead"" in defending Ukraine against Moscow's invasion ""with critical but more limited US support.""

Other points in the strategy include the statement that ""border security is national security,"" with the Pentagon set to ""prioritize efforts to seal our borders, repel forms of invasion, and deport illegal aliens.""

The paper also says that the Pentagon will provide Trump with options to ""guarantee US military and commercial access to key terrain"" in different parts of the world, including in Greenland, which Trump has vowed to take over.

The contrast between the 2026 NDS and its immediate predecessor is made strikingly obvious from the outset, with the current document peppered with pictures of Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, both together and alone.

The previous NDS, released under President Donald Trump's predecessor Joe Biden, did not feature a single picture either of the then president or the defense secretary at the time, Lloyd Austin.

The current strategy document is also full of praise for Trump and his alleged achievements in ""[rebuilding] the American military to be the world's absolute best—its most formidable fighting force,"" while denigrating previous administrations for ""eroding our military's readiness and delaying modernization.""

Very notably, the 2026 NDS makes no mention of climate change as an existential threat, while the one released under Biden contains a whole section on the issue.

Among other things, the 2022 document states: ""Climate change is creating new corridors of strategic interaction, particularly in the Arctic region. It will increase demands, including on the Joint Force, for disaster response and defense support of civil authorities, and affect security relationship with some Allies and partners."" 

The 2022 NDS also accords a much higher priority to the threat posed by China, calling its actions in the Indo-Pacific and beyond the most ""comprehensive and serious challenge"" to US security.

It also emphasized what it called the ""acute threat"" of Russia, accusing Moscow of seeking to ""reimpose an imperial sphere of influence.""

As Iran trembles on the brink of a revolution amid clashes between protesters and the security services, another battle is going on above.

Tehran has attempted to impose internet blackouts to stop footage escaping of its brutal crackdown, which has left more than 5,000 dead, and images of what many think could be a dying regime losing control of its population.

But some Iranians have found a way around this. They can break through this wall of censorship by using terminals which connect to the internet through the Starlink satellite constellation, which is owned by the SpaceX billionaire Elon Musk.

The terminal, the smallest of which measures roughly 12 inches by 10 inches, is positioned with a clear view of the sky, providing broadband from an array of satellites orbiting the Earth. By bypassing fibre-optic cable networks, it can evade internet blackouts imposed by Tehran.

So far, so easy.

The difficult part is actually getting these terminals into the hands of Iranian dissidents in the first place.

Now, American organisations are using a secretive network of smugglers and black market merchants to get Starlink into the country, hidden in boats and on the backs of horses and mules.

Since its revolution in 1979, Iran has seen itself as the bastion of an old order while the rest of the world slides towards liberalism.

But now cracks of light are starting to flood in.

Tehran has tried to impose an internet blackout on its population since Jan 8, as disturbing footage of troops firing at demonstrators and grieving families searching for their loved ones was beamed around the world.

As the bars of the digital prison came down, Donald Trump said he would ask Mr Musk, a former ally who after a brief spell as a critic, now occupies a role akin to an unofficial advisor, to restore coverage.

“He's very good at that kind of thing,” the US president said.

That blackout is under threat thanks to a combination of ancient smuggling routes and 21st-century space technology.

According to Peyman Zinati, a specialist in Iranian smuggling, several routes into Iran have existed at least since the days when the British Empire began patrolling the Persian Gulf to enforce its ban on the slave trade.

One is across the Gulf from a country like Dubai, which at its northernmost point is just a couple of hundred miles from Iran. One is heading west across the harsh terrain from Iraqi Kurdistan. And one is from the eastern border of Afghanistan and Pakistan.

“Any smuggling pathway that previously existed is currently being used,” said Mark Pashmfouroush, who works with Holistic Resilience, a Los Angeles-based non-profit, which has helped smuggle Starlink terminals into Iran since the protests of 2022.

“These networks have existed for decades... harkening back to the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s, my mother tells me about how they would smuggle VHS tapes under the floorboards of boats,” he continued.

The demand for the VHS tapes may have waned in the decades since, but those methods are here to stay.

NetFreedom Pioneers, another non-profit based in California, is also getting Starlinks into Iran. The routes from Iraqi Kurdistan and across the Persian Gulf are “two of the many ways that we try to send the devices into the country”, said Evan Firoozi, its executive director.

The most popular of the smuggling routes is heading across the Gulf via boat, hiding the illicit goods in large shipping containers that dock at the major ports, or in small fishing vessels that go under the radar.

It also allows Starlink couriers to take larger shipments than heading from Kurdistan over the Zagros Mountains, an unforgiving journey that needs to be undertaken on foot or with a horse or mule.

That's not to say you can't carry one of the terminals in a rucksack. Some weigh as little as a couple of pounds, and are so small they are stored in something roughly the size of a pizza box.

“It's so tiny you could get these delivered in, smuggled into Iran in the thousands, and they wouldn't know,” Mr Pashmfouroush said.

Much of the time, of course, somebody knows.

Despite the regime's attempts to clamp down on Starlink smuggling as protests shake its grasp on power, Iran is still deeply corrupt, and some officials are only too ready to have their palms greased.

A well-placed bribe is often enough to make a border guard or customs agent look the other way as the next horse, mule or boat slips in without inspection. Some compare it to a kind of unofficial tax.

Jointly, these efforts are letting hundreds or thousands of Starlink terminals into the country every month, said Mr Pashmfouroush, citing data he has seen from black market merchants.

In December, an industry group based in Tehran estimated there were roughly 100,000 Starlink users in Iran, which has a population of some 90 million people.

Nevertheless, the stakes are high for smugglers. There's a risk if they're caught with Starlink terminals, they could be charged with espionage.

“At the moment, the security is very tight. And it's not only the security. It is that a lot of these people are scared of carrying the devices into the country,” said Mr Firoozi.

NetFreedom Pioneers keeps its network of smugglers secure because none of them are aware of the others' identities, he said. “There are many, many, many of them, and each one of them has their own methods”.

Getting the terminals across the border is only part of the battle: from there, smuggled goods are brought to distribution hubs located in the major cities, like Bandar Genaveh to the south, or Baneh or Piranshahr to the west, before heading out to the rest of the country.

Starlink prices are said to dip as low as around $700 (£518), but during the protests, when demand has been high, they can go for as much as four times that number. Many cannot afford them, one Iranian woman said.

They also have a subscription fee of around $100 (£75) a month, although Mr Musk has reportedly waived this following Mr Trump's plea for help.

Users also take a risk. Under a law passed by the Iranian parliament in June, just days after the 12-day war with Israel, using the terminal is punishable with up to two years in prison.

Importing more than 10 devices “with intent to oppose the Islamic Republic” results in five to ten years' imprisonment. And ominously, “any intelligence, espionage, or operational activity for Israel, the US, or other hostile regimes” is punishable by execution.

One Iranian told The Telegraph that authorities would go “door to door” searching for the terminals and that those found with them could be charged with spying.

Some fear that the regime will be able to work out the identity of protesters and Starlink owners by gleaning geolocation data from footage published online. A road marking or shop sign in the background of a video might be all the security services need to track someone down.

Mr Firoozi said his organisation was collecting the data to bring supporters of the regime to justice “when there is no Islamic Republic”.

Others who believe sunlight is the best disinfectant want the repression laid bare before the world.

Even if Iran's leaders survive the protests engulfing their streets, so will the images of a regime clinging to power and lashing out against its own population.

International solidarity, not liberal imperialism, is the only way to stop Trump's global class war.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

President Donald Trump's National Security Strategy (NSS) is the crudest articulation yet of his authoritarian nationalist project. It promises to smash the so-called rules-based international order Washington has superintended since the end of the Cold War. The U.S., of course, repeatedly violated that order's stated principles, like sovereignty and self-determination, most recently with the Biden administration's support for Israel's genocidal war in Gaza.

Despite its hypocrisy, the U.S. had attempted to integrate the world's states into multilateral economic and political institutions, forge alliances to deter, contain, or overthrow its rivals, and police countries and regions torn apart by its program of free trade globalization. Trump claims that such liberal imperialism overextended the U.S., caused its relative decline, and enabled the rise of its competitors, especially China. His Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, declared, “The postwar global order is not just obsolete, it is now a weapon being used against us.”

To restore U.S. power, Trump's NSS announces a new Trump Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, a so-called Donroe Doctrine. Instead of global hegemony, it aims to carve out an exclusive U.S. sphere of influence in the Western Hemisphere, install pliant regimes, plunder their resources, and wield state power against migrants. The strategy as a whole has already born bitter fruit; Trump's ICE agents killed immigrant solidarity activist Renee Good, his special forces carried out a coup in Venezuela, and his administration threatens to annex Greenland. His strategy will bring not “peace through strength,” but class war, brutal scapegoating of the oppressed, and imperial rivalry over the division of global capitalism.

Trump's strategy is a response to today's asymmetric multipolar order. While the U.S. remains the dominant imperialist power, it faces a global imperial rival in China, an outsized regional power in Russia, and a host of lesser ones like Iran and Brazil. The U.S., China, and Russia have become more assertive of their interests, spurring military aggression as each stakes claims in their regions.

Russia invaded Ukraine to rebuild its former empire and challenge NATO's hegemony in Europe. China has projected its power in the Asia-Pacific region, threatening Taiwan and clashing with, among others, Japan, the Philippines, and, behind them all, the U.S. Washington backed Israel to crush Hamas and destroy Iran's so-called axis of resistance to reassert U.S. dominance over Middle East's strategic energy reserves, which China relies on to fuel its economy.

In response to these developments, Washington abandoned its grand strategy of superintending global capitalism to confront its great power rivals. The Obama administration started this shift with its Pivot to Asia to contain China and plan to reset relations with Russia, but those both failed. In his first term, Trump introduced a new strategy of illiberal hegemony focused on great power competition with China and Russia, but his regime's incompetence and divisions prevented its implementation, leaving the U.S. weaker, its allies alienated, and rivals emboldened.

The Biden administration tried to refurbish U.S. imperialism, rebuild Washington's alliances, and defend the so-called rules-based international order. Biden exploited Russia's invasion of Ukraine to rally its allies together against both Moscow and Beijing. But he undermined this project with his support for Israel's genocidal war on Gaza, which enabled China and Russia to expose Washington's hypocrisy.

Trump's new Donroe Doctrine decisively breaks with the grand strategy the U.S. has pursued since the end of the World War II. It retreats from the pursuit of global hegemony to restore U.S. power within its borders, claim exclusive hegemony over the Western Hemisphere, and establish “a balance of power” against its imperial rivals. At home, the Trump administration aims to rebuild U.S. domestic manufacturing, particularly in high tech and AI, through a program of protectionist tariffs, tax cuts, incentives for corporate investment, and deregulation. To divide and conquer working class resistance, it scapegoats oppressed groups, in particular migrants. Underscoring its determination to split the multiracial, multinational working class, the NSS declares the “era of mass migration is over.”

Abroad, its main goal is to establish neocolonial dominance in the Western Hemisphere. To enforce this naked imperialist goal, it plans to boost the Pentagon budget, if Trump is to be believed, to $1.5 trillion, which would be used to build a high tech military and shield North America with a new “Golden Dome” capable of intercepting nuclear missiles, giving the U.S. the ability to start a nuclear war without fear of retribution. That will enflame the ongoing nuclear arms race between the U.S., China, and Russia. At the same time, Trump demands that U.S. allies shoulder the burden of their own defense, compelling them to raise military spending, setting off regional arms races.

The NSS adopts transactional relations with both allies and rivals, and at least rhetorically deescalates conflict with China and Russia, apparently accepting their hegemony over their own spheres of influence.

Trump promises this strategy will end forever wars and secure peace. The NSS even claims he's already ended eight conflicts and intends to conclude another in Ukraine. That is simply false; the ceasefires he's brokered are either a sham like the one in Gaza, where Israel continues its bombing and siege, or he had little to nothing to do with them like the one between India and Pakistan.

Moreover, Trump's actual policies prove that he's an old-fashioned warmonger. He backed Israel's genocide, bombed Iran's nuclear facilities, ordered an airstrike on a village in Nigeria on Christmas, and staged a coup in Venezuela to seize control of the country's oil. And his new strategy will enflame more imperial conflict with China and Russia over the division of the world into spheres of influence. Remember, the last epoch of great powers fighting to establish empires led directly to World War I and World War II.

The NSS prioritizes the Western Hemisphere, Asia, and Europe, while downplaying the Middle East and, in keeping with Trump's anti-Black racism, almost entirely ignores Africa. In the Western Hemisphere, it invokes as its precedent Theodore Roosevelt's Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, which the “Rough Rider” used to justify gunboat diplomacy, coups, and occupations throughout Latin American and the Caribbean in the early 20th century. Trump's Donroe Doctrine pledges to bolster Washington's allies, replace antagonists with quisling regimes, and claim exclusive access to their markets and resources, especially fossil fuels and rare earths.

While the NSS never names its rivals in the region, except with euphemisms like “Non-Hemispheric competitors,” its main one is obviously China. Beijing has established itself as a key economic power in the region; it invests huge sums of money through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), imports raw materials from a variety of countries, and exports finished products back to them. In the process, China has established alliances with countries like Brazil, which is part of the BRICS alliance, as well as Venezuela, which it depended on before Trump's coup for 4 percent of its oil.

In response to China's encroachment in Washington's backyard, Trump has pressured states to exclude China and its companies. In one example, he forced Panama to leave the Belt and Road Initiative and is demanding that it end its contract with the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports, which operates terminals near the Panama Canal. In another, he seized six tankers and cut off Venezuela's oil exports to China after overthrowing Maduro.

Unsurprisingly, Beijing has objected to Trump's attempt to squeeze it out of the Western Hemisphere. Foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning denounced Trump's abduction of Maduro, saying, “The US' brazen use of force against Venezuela and its demand that the country dispose of its oil resources under an ‘America First' principle constitute [a] typical act of bullying, seriously violate international law, gravely infringe upon Venezuela's sovereignty, and severely harm the rights of the Venezuelan people. China strongly condemns such actions. I would like to stress that the legitimate rights and interests of China and other countries in Venezuela must be protected.”

Trump's threat to seize Greenland has further enflamed rivalries not only with China and Russia, but also NATO countries. These states are engaged in a scramble for the Arctic's territory, military basing rights, shipping lanes, and natural resources. Already, Denmark, which rules over Greenland, has declared that U.S. seizure of the island would spell the end of NATO. In an unprecedented development, several NATO members have deployed troops in Greenland in support of Denmark against the U.S. Russia has also objected to Trump threat to seize the island and police the Arctic.

In the Asia-Pacific, Trump's NSS sustains Washington's commitment to containing China, but it downplays their conflict, holding out hope for commercial deals to rebalance their trade relations, a dramatic climbdown for an administration that had previously launched an all-out trade war with Beijing. China forced Trump to back down. It cut off its exports of rare earth minerals, which are essential for the U.S. automobile and defense industry, and stopped its imports of soybeans from U.S. agribusinesses, a crucial electoral constituency for the GOP.

Facing economic and electoral disaster, Trump chickened out, lowered tariffs on China from 100 percent to 30 percent, still a record high but with countless carveouts and loopholes. For its part, China opposes tariffs and wants free trade to secure markets for its massive export industry. At this point, Trump is trying to avoid a fall out with China in the run up to April's trade talks in Beijing. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly intervened in the drafting of the NSS to mute criticisms of China, overriding hawks like Elbridge Colby and Marco Rubio.

Nevertheless, the Trump administration realizes that China is Washington's main imperial rival. For now, it wants to cut a trade deal, while it overcomes its vulnerabilities, especially its inability to independently extract and process rare earths. To address this, the administration has bought stakes in mining companies while U.S. lawmakers consider investing billions in new processing plants. Once the U.S. finds a way either to manufacture rare earths on its own or to access them through secure supply chains, it will be in a stronger position to confront China.

For now, the NSS upholds current U.S. policy, pledging to maintain its military in the region, support its allies, and cut trade deals with them, while pressuring them all to increase their defense spending. It maintains strategic ambiguity as to whether it would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion but the administration has committed to selling Taiwan arms to defend itself. That puts it at odds with China's assertion of imperial power in the Asia Pacific.

In response, Beijing is trying to overcome its dependence on the U.S. and Taiwan for its high end computer chips, plowing money into its own manufacturing system. It even opted to reject the use of Nvidia's second most advanced chips, pushing its companies to use domestically produced ones instead. It is also diversifying its exports market in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and Africa to make up for those lost in the U.S. because of Trump's tariffs. 

To enforce its economic power, Beijing increased its defense spending by 7.2 percent in 2025 to over $318 billion and has escalated its military exercises around Taiwan and throughout the region. That has in turn further fueled the regional arms race, making war between it and various powers like the Philippines in the South China Sea and Japan in the East China Sea more likely and potentially deadly.

While Trump's strategy seemingly upholds the status quo in Asia, it smashes it in Europe. The NSS criticizes the EU for its allegedly lax immigration policies that supposedly compromise its white, Christian identity. This is all nonsense. EU member countries, whether ruled by the establishment or the right, have increasingly blocked, detained, jailed, and deported migrants.

Trump's NSS also denounces the EU's regulations, which restricts U.S. multinationals' operations on the continent. He is pressuring it to gut its Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act, which The American Prospect reports, “require tech companies to take down illegal content on their platforms, restrict the transfer of user data to multiple platforms run by the same companies, refrain from ‘steering' users toward their own products, and allow for fair competition in app stores and interoperable social media sites.” One of Trump's on-and-off allies, Elon Musk, called for the abolition of the EU after X was hit with a $140 million fine for violating its digital rules.

The NSS also references the EU's establishment parties' refusal to enter into coalition governments with the right and their censorship of hate speech, while calling on Europe to pursue “strategic stability” with Russia.

To secure this rapprochement with Moscow, Trump is trying to force Ukraine into a land for peace deal that rewards Russia's colonial aggression. He's willing to concede Moscow a sphere of influence in its former empire in exchange for lucrative deals for minerals, natural gas, and oil in both Ukraine and Russia, perhaps under the illusion that he can pry Moscow away from Beijing. That's why Putin's spokesperson praised the NSS as “consistent with our vision” and “gratifying.”

At the same time, Trump's demand that Washington's NATO allies shoulder their own security burden will force them into an arms race with Russia. Already, in response to pressure from Trump, NATO members have agreed to increase their military budgets to 5 percent of GDP, while they are imposing austerity, making their working classes pay for the new militarism.

In contrast to the Western Hemisphere, Asia Pacific, and Europe, the NSS gives little attention to the Middle East, which has been main focus of U.S. imperialism since 9/11. The administration hopes to capitalize on Israel's genocide in Gaza, decimation of Iran's so-called axis of resistance, and Washington and Tel Aviv's destruction of Tehran's nuclear program. It wants to push countries to join the Abraham Accords, normalize their relations with Israel, cut commercial deals, and thereby bring stability to the region.

In reality, Israel is a pariah state, and the Middle East remains an explosive tinder box of conflicts within and between its countries. The region's rulers preside over the same deep class inequalities and national oppressions that provoked the Arab Uprisings in 2011 and will set off more waves of revolt for democracy, justice, and equality. Moreover, imperial rivalries, especially between the U.S. and China, will persist as they angle for access to the Middle East resources, markets, and growing finance capital.

The current uprising in Iran against economic inequality and skyrocketing inflation is a taste of the class and social struggles to come. The U.S. and Israel have tried to exploit this revolt for their own purposes, threatening military action against Tehran. Trump has also announced 25 percent tariffs on any country that trades with Iran, including China, India, and the United Arab Emirates. A spokesperson for Beijing responded, saying, “China firmly ‍opposes ⁠any illicit ⁠unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction and will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.” This conflict threatens to disrupt Trump's attempt to calm relations with Beijing before their trade talks. Thus, contrary to Trump's wishful thinking, the U.S. will remain preoccupied with the Middle East and North Africa.

Trump has shattered the old rules-based order and opened a new epoch of great power rivalry for the division of the world and its states into neocolonial spheres of influence. In this titanic conflict, deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller argues, the U.S. will operate with the assumption that “we live in a world … that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.” In this situation, as Thucydides put it, “the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.”

Washington's foreign policy establishment and the Democratic Party have denounced Trump's Donroe Doctrine, arguing that it will compromise Washington's ability to contain China and Russia. They hope to resurrect Joe Biden's strategy — implement a new industrial policy, enact neoliberal deregulation to restore abundance, and rebuild alliances to assert their collective global hegemony. But, under Biden, that program did not restore manufacturing, failed to improve the lives of working class and oppressed people, and led not to peace but continued imperial rivalry between the U.S., China, and Russia as well as genocidal war in Gaza.

The left must oppose both Trump's authoritarian nationalism and the Democrats' liberal imperialism and fight for international solidarity from below against all imperialist states. We in the U.S. have to oppose our own government, which remains the most powerful and deadly force in the world. Our responsibility is to organize a movement against the two sides of Trump's authoritarian nationalism, his war at home against migrants and his war abroad from his coup in Venezuela to his threats against Colombia, Cuba, and Greenland. In doing so we can build multiracial, multinational working-class struggle — like the general strike in Minneapolis — that has the power to stop Trump in his tracks.

At the same time, we should extend our solidarity to the struggles of workers and oppressed people in countries such as China, Russia, and Iran. Such solidarity must include support for all oppressed nations' right to self-determination, regardless of which imperialist power rules over them. That means championing struggles for liberation from Palestine to Puerto Rico, Ukraine, and Taiwan.

In such struggles from below against imperialism, exploitation, and oppression a new international left can be forged that offers an alternative to the right and the capitalist establishment. Their system offers nothing but crisis, militarism, and war. Now more than ever, we need to start building a fight for a world that puts people and the planet first.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

Organizing and rights trainings have helped health care workers protect their colleagues and their patients.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have created a crisis in Minneapolis hospitals since escalating anti-immigrant operations in the Minnesota city in early December.

Health care workers who spoke to Truthout report that the number of agents in hospitals has risen sharply since the beginning of the year, with ailing or injured detainees regularly brought into emergency departments at multiple city hospitals at all hours, including overnight. Meanwhile, workers told Truthout that those federal agents have intimidated hospital staff and disregarded federal law, medical best practices, and hospital policies, often with limited pushback from hospital administrators. Where administrators have seemed reluctant to intervene, however, rank-and-file health care workers are stepping up to protect their colleagues and their patients — thanks to organizing and training efforts that began long before agents descended on the Twin Cities.

“This is a human rights crisis that we will be talking about for years to come in health care and what happened in these hospitals, and at the same time, grassroots organizing is the only thing that has prepared us to begin to respond,” Jamey Sharp, an area health care worker and member of the health justice committee at immigrant advocacy organization Unidos MN, told Truthout.

Several high-profile cases of ICE agents violating patient rights in Minneapolis hospitals have already made headlines.

Several high-profile cases of ICE agents violating patient rights in Minneapolis hospitals have already made headlines. On December 31, 2025, agents entered the Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC) Emergency Department without a valid judicial warrant in an attempt to detain a patient receiving care. The agents reportedly remained by the patient's bedside for over 24 hours, denied their right to family visitation, and, at times, shackled them. The agents left after hospital security “asked for documentation to support their continued presence,” according to a statement from the hospital.

Additional reports have since surfaced of agents shackling at least one other patient in the same hospital, even after health care workers confronted them. Workers at three other area hospitals who spoke to Truthout on condition of anonymity described daily ICE presence on their campuses, as well as multiple cases of agents seemingly guarding patients at their bedsides and violating their rights to have private medical conversations with their care teams.

“I don't think anyone could have expected the onslaught of ICE agents descending on our metro the way that it has,” Alycia Garubanda, an acute rehab therapist at another Minneapolis hospital, told Truthout. “But we've adjusted to meet the moment.”

For many health care workers across the metro area, meeting the moment has meant drawing on knowledge gained from “know your rights” trainings that Unidos MN began offering in March 2025. According to Unidos MN, more than 300 health care workers have participated in the trainings thus far, including many union members. Sources who spoke to Truthout agree that collaboration between community rights groups and local unions, including the Minnesota Nurses Association and chapters of the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), has been central to the success of these trainings and other organizing wins.

Nathan Paulsen, a mental health worker and steward with AFSCME 2474, a Twin Cities union of frontline staff at Hennepin Healthcare, including HCMC, told Truthout that community groups have vital expertise and understand the needs and perspectives of targeted communities. “The labor movement is at its best when we have unity, share resources and knowledge, and grow bonds of trust — not only with one another within the labor movement, but stretching those relationships into the community as well,” he said.

“The labor movement is at its best when we have unity, share resources and knowledge, and grow bonds of trust.”

The “know your rights” trainings for Minneapolis health care workers focus largely on preparing them for two scenarios: how to respond if federal immigration agents arrive at their workplace without a patient to conduct a raid, and how to respond if agents arrive with a patient. That second situation is behind the current surge of agents in Minneapolis hospitals, according to Sharp and two sources familiar with local emergency departments who spoke anonymously to Truthout. When agents bring someone to an emergency department, it could be because the person has suffered a medical emergency or otherwise requires care while already in detention; because a person who was recently arrested reported a medical condition requiring medication or clearance before detention; or because agents injured or brutalized a person during their arrest.

“The main point that we try to help people understand at these trainings is that civil detention [i.e., immigration detention] is very different than criminal custody,” Sharp explained to Truthout. “People who are in civil detention deserve to have all of the rights that any other civilian would have when they go to the hospital.” According to Unidos MN, those rights include family visits, keeping family members apprised of a patient's condition if that patient so chooses, private conversations with the patient's care team, independent medical decision-making, and freedom from being shackled or bound.

Three health care workers at different Minneapolis hospitals, who spoke to Truthout anonymously, said they have observed federal agents seemingly denying patients these rights in their hospitals. “They're not being afforded the same rights as our other patients,” one emergency department nurse said. But with the knowledge and connections gained from “know your rights” trainings, a growing number of health care workers now know that they can push back and report suspected abuses.

Through the trainings, workers have built communication and rapid response networks, developed a system for whistleblowing on violations of patient rights, and learned how to press for improved hospital policies. Employees have also developed a mutual aid network to support each other in various ways, including arranging to arrive at and leave work in groups to deter harassment from federal agents. “The foundation for all of this work, movement, and advocacy is not only a knowledge of rights, but a willingness to embody them with specific actions and participation in a shared project to establish robust rules first and get ICE out of our hospital and state next,” Paulsen told Truthout.

Those communication and rapid response systems kicked into gear following the reports that agents were guarding a patient's bedside at HCMC on December 31, 2025, without a valid judicial warrant. After Unidos MN was notified, it organized a press conference.

Paulsen told Truthout that many AFSCME 2474 members were among the roughly 100 employees, elected officials, and rights advocates who gathered outside HCMC on January 6 “to call attention to the cruelty and injustice of allowing ICE to roam freely in our neighborhoods and in the hospital.” Under pressure following the press conference, HCMC used model policies and best practices provided by Unidos MN to implement new guidelines to better protect patients from warrantless harassment.

Hospitals across the city have done similar in recent months following demands from organized health care workers and community groups. For many workers, improving their workplace policies began with reviewing models. Sharp told Truthout he encourages health care workers to review a model policy from People's Care Collective, a coalition of California unions and rights organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California: “It's not only a best practice, but also legal and possible,” said Sharp. Unidos MN has also produced a shorter version of similar guidelines.

While Minneapolis health care workers continue to observe federal agents in their workplaces and are concerned about ongoing abuses, those who spoke to Truthout said they feel better prepared to confront these situations following training and organizing with colleagues.

“These ICE agents have pushed, they've shackled patients to beds, and they've done a number of things to break the law.”

“These ICE agents have pushed, they've shackled patients to beds, and they've done a number of things to break the law. [They are] trying to see how much they can get away with,” Sharp told Truthout. “But now we have health care workers who feel empowered, [and] that ultimately leads to a better chance that people will at least have one or two people looking out for them and their rights and fighting for them during these impossible situations.”

It is a difference that benefits both patients and staff. Garubanda, the acute rehab therapist, told Truthout that Minneapolis hospitals boast diverse workforces, and the presence of federal agents has scared some of her colleagues of color into bringing their passports to work. “It has been alarming to me to see my colleagues who are immigrants, East African, Latino, or women who wear hijab, terrified to come to work.” Recently, news broke that the Department of Homeland Security is also auditing HCMC employee records, further fueling fears that agents plan to target workers.

Among the guidance in Unidos MN's best practices for navigating ICE presence in hospitals is a rule that staff requests for unit reassignment when ICE is on campus must be accommodated immediately. The policy also recommends barring agents from staff-only spaces, such as break rooms or locker rooms. At HCMC, agents have reportedly been observed in staff break rooms and parking lots.

“We're health care workers with moral and ethical obligations to our patients. We have to push for better rights, care, protections, safety measures.”

For health care workers across the U.S. who may be wondering how best to prepare their own workplaces in case federal agents head their way next, Minneapolis health care workers who spoke to Truthout had a unified message: If you haven't already begun to organize, train, and strengthen policies, the best time to do so is now.

“Speak up within your institution, speak up in department meetings, speak up any time that a group of health care workers is together,” suggests Garubanda. “These institutions want us to feel like we can't say anything, like we're not allowed to talk. That's ridiculous; we're health care workers with moral and ethical obligations to our patients. We have to push for better rights, care, protections, safety measures for patients, families in our communities, and also staff members.”

In the past months ICE and CBP have opened fire nearly 2 dozen times — killing at least 6 people including Alex Pretti.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

As hundreds of Minneapolis residents assembled in Whittier Park Saturday evening to demand once again that federal immigration agents leave Minnesota following the second fatal shooting of a legal observer in less than three weeks, one speaker demanded that the gathering must not simply be “another damn vigil.”

“This is a turning point,” said Edwin Torres DeSantiago of the Immigrant Defense Network.

He spoke to the crowd hours after several federal officers were filmed surrounding Alex Pretti, 37, after he attempted to help a woman one of them had pushed to the ground, and fatally shooting him.

Torres DeSantiago's words were echoed by the Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention, which did not mince words about the agents of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection who have for months roamed the streets of cities including Minneapolis, Chicago, and Los Angeles, arresting immigrants and US citizens and opening fire nearly two dozen times — killing at least six people including Pretti.

The federal agents recruited by the Trump administration with flyers imploring them to choose between their “homeland” and an “invasion,” said the Lemkin Institute, “are loyal agents of Nazis and white supremacists within the Republican Party. They are behaving as enemies both of the Constitution and of the American people and they must be treated as such.”

“The United States is at a crossroads: Either the American people are able to wrest power from the current fascist leaders or those leaders will continue to radicalize, using violence and terror to dismantle democracy and commit even greater mass atrocities,” said the organization. “History is clear about this.”

The warning came as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said it would be investigating the shooting involving its own officers instead of the FBI. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said DHS representatives had blocked them from accessing the crime scene late Saturday, even though officials had obtained a judicial search warrant.

The bureau joined the Hennepin County Attorney's Office in filing a lawsuit to prevent the “destruction of evidence” by DHS.

Edward Ahmed Mitchell, national deputy director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, called on Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey to order the city's police department to “take control of the scene of the latest deadly ICE shooting, launch an independent criminal probe, and protect peaceful protesters at the scene from ICE violence.”

“Calling for ICE to leave is not enough. This shooting happened on a city street in the jurisdiction of the Minneapolis law enforcement and they must lead an independent investigation into what appears to be another horrific, unnecessary execution of a Minneapolis resident,” said Mitchell. “ICE should immediately end its deadly and disastrous siege of Minnesota and turn over all evidence and information about this shooting and the prior shooting of Renee Good to local authorities.”

Meanwhile, Trump administration officials continued pushing a narrative which was contradicted by numerous videos of the shooting and the moments leading up to it, claiming Pretti had “approached” federal agents with a gun. Footage shows Pretti holding only a phone, not a firearm, and one of agents involved in wrestling him to the ground after he was pepper-sprayed reaches into the scuffle empty-handed and then pulls out a gun before the multiple shots were fired.

Third angle of today's shooting of a 37-year-old male by agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota, clearly shows one of the agents running away from the scuffle before the shooting carrying the victim's handgun, a Sig P320. pic.twitter.com/97atyCozQP

Pretti was armed with a gun that he was carrying lawfully and had a permit for, local authorities said.

Despite the video evidence, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem repeated almost verbatim the claim she made earlier this month when an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good in another incident that did not match the administration's description in footage taken by bystanders: “Fearing for his life and the lives of his fellow officers around him, an agent fired defensive shots.”

Stephen Miller, President Donald Trump's homeland security adviser and deputy chief of staff, said without any evidence soon after the shooting that Pretti was a “domestic terrorist” who “tried to assassinate federal law enforcement,” and Trump called Pretti a “gunman.”

He's lost his mind. This response is completely unhinged  from any form of reality. The coverup will be swift and the crackdown on dissent severe. https://t.co/qnvfMoDAjZ

The shooting came days after seven Democrats in the US House joined Republicans in passing a funding bill for DHS without securing restrictions on ICE, despite growing national outrage over federal immigration agents' operations and Trump's mass deportation agenda.

The bill still needs to go through the Senate and is one of several funding measures that need to pass by January 30 to keep the government open.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said in a statement after Pretti was killed that “Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included.”

“What's happening in Minnesota is appalling — and unacceptable in any American city,” said Schumer. “Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill, but because of Republicans' refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE.”

Democratic senators who had been expected to support the $64.4 billion in DHS funding, which includes $10 billion for ICE, said after the shooting that they would not do so.

“I cannot and will not vote to fund DHS while this administration continues these violent federal takeovers of our cities,” said Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.).

Live Updates


            • Minnesota shooting: The shooting of Alex Pretti by a Border Patrol agent yesterday in Minneapolis marked the second death at the hands of federal officers in the city this month, deepening outrage after weeks of protests over the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.
    


            • DHS account under scrutiny: Administration officials have declined in interviews this morning to provide critical details about their claim that the agent shot Pretti in self-defense. CNN video analysis found that an agent took away Pretti's handgun just before he was shot. At no point in videos reviewed by CNN can he be seen wielding the weapon.
    


            • What we know about Pretti: Friends and family say the 37-year-old was an ICU nurse at a local VA hospital. Police said he was believed to be a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.
    


            • State and federal officials at odds: Minnesota leaders have rejected the Trump administration's account of events, and state officials are suing the federal government over access to investigate the shooting.
    


            Democratic Rep. Angie Craig, who is running for Senate in Minnesota, urged her colleagues to “stand the line” and refuse to pass a bill that funds the Department of Homeland Security without new restrictions, after a federal agent shot and killed a 37-year-old man in Minneapolis.
    


            Craig told CNN's Manu Raju today she thinks Democrats should force a government shutdown over their demands to rein in immigration enforcement.
    


            “I mean, are we OK that an authoritarian administration is taking over American cities? Are we OK that our First Amendment, our Second Amendment, and our Fourth Amendment rights under the Constitution are being violated? Hell no, we're not OK,” she said, warning that if Democrats don't “take a stand now” then the aggressive federal enforcement that has devolved into violence in her state is “coming to a city near you.”
    


            “ICE is attacking and terrorizing the people of Minnesota, and they're coming to you, if we don't stop them here,” she said.
    


            The Minnesota Democrat, who last week voted against the House-passed bill that included DHS and ICE funds, said her party “cannot keep acting like these are normal times in our country.”
    


            “This is a moment in time that history is going to judge every single one of us, including my Republican colleagues, who are complicit in their silence at this moment,” she said.
    


            Asked by Raju if Democrats should heed the demands of some progressives to advocate to abolish ICE, Craig responded, “We're always going to need border enforcement at the southern border, but we absolutely have to dismantle Trump and Kristi Noem's version of ICE,” she said.
    


            A phalanx of top Trump administration officials assembled across Sunday morning news shows to defend the shooting of a US citizen in Minneapolis by a federal immigration agent. President Donald Trump's attention, it appears, was elsewhere.
    


            Trump, who is spending the day at a snowy White House, launched a 448-word missive on social media lambasting a lawsuit launched at his sprawling ballroom addition, casting a top historic preservation group as “obstructionists and troublemakers.”
    


            The National Trust for Historic Preservation is asking the judge to issue a preliminary injunction that would grind work on the ballroom to a halt until the public has a chance to weigh in and Congress gives the green light.
    


            Trump's comments come after a key hearing last week, during which a federal judge expressed deep skepticism that the White House has legal authority to construct the ballroom without express authorization from Congress.
    


                    “All of the Structural Steel, Windows, Doors, A.C./Heating Equipment, Marble, Stone, Precast Concrete, Bulletproof Windows and Glass, Anti-Drone Roofing, and much more, has been ordered (or is ready to be), and there is no practical or reasonable way to go back. IT IS TOO LATE!” Trump wrote in the lengthy post.
                





            He added, “Why didn't these obstructionists and troublemakers bring their baseless lawsuit much earlier?”
    


            The president has no public events on his schedule on Sunday, and the White House has issued a lid for the day, meaning he is not expected to be seen.
    


            On Saturday, hours after federal officers shot and killed Alex Pretti, Trump hosted a private screening of the first lady's new documentary, “Melania,” in the East Room. Guests dined on popcorn in custom boxes emblazoned with the first lady's likeness, and listened to a band perform a waltz composed for the film's score.
    


            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer made clear yesterday, hours after a Minneapolis man was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent, that Democrats would block a key package that would fund several government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, unless it includes guardrails for immigration enforcement.
    


Here's what Democrats are saying today:



Sen. Chris Murphy told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union” he would not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security, which he said “is murdering American citizens.”
    


Sen. Amy Klobuchar on NBC's “Meet the Press,” called for new leadership for immigration agencies, an end to “surges across the country,” to train agents “like they were supposed to be trained” and for them to be mandated to wear body cameras.
    


Sen. Adam Schiff told NBC immigration enforcement agencies ned to be “completely overhauled from top to bottom.”
    


Sen. Alex Padilla told MS Now, “To think that on top of tripling their budgets, Republicans want to give them even more to continue this chaos, to continue this craziness, to continue this lawlessness, is what it is” in reference to the additional DHS funds the GOP passed into law last year.
    


Independent Sen. Angus King, who caucuses with the Democrats, told CBS' “Face the Nation” that while he hates shutdowns, he can't vote to fund ICE due to their actions in his home state of Maine and in Minnesota.
    


            King said he believes Senate Majority Leader John Thune should separate DHS' funding from the five other appropriations bills, saying they would pass, and then take up DHS.
    


Sen. Jeanne Shaheen wouldn't directly say whether she plans to support advancing the DHS funding bill, but indicated she wants to see changes.
    


            After the situation in Minneapolis rose to emergency levels yesterday, with the state National Guard called in and mutual aid requested, the streets have been reopened and guard members have been relieved, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told CNN's Anderson Cooper Sunday.
    


            “It was very volatile situation, but we were able to maintain the peace,” O'Hara said.
    


            To have federal law enforcement at odds with local and state officials “is uncharted territory, and it is deeply disappointing, and frankly, it's frustrating,” he said.
    


            “People should be able to have an expectation that the federal government can enforce federal immigration law without these poor tactics and really unconstitutional practices,” O'Hara added.
    


            The police chief said the situation has upended the status quo for law enforcement in the area, where state agencies have long worked hand in hand with his department to make the city safer.
    


            “We've seen mass resignations in these different agencies, and just a whole lot of frustration because we have personal relationships with a lot of these agents that are also just distraught over how things are playing out. It's just not good for anyone,” he said.
    


            The federal agents in the area aren't adhering to the standards set for his department, O'Hara said.
    


            “It looks very untrained. It looks unprofessional. It looks very chaotic. It doesn't look like there's clear teamwork, tactically, to achieve the same objective,” he said. “It is absolutely not how we train law enforcement in Minnesota.”
    


            The situation has taken a severe toll on the officers in his department, O'Hara said, but they will continue to do their jobs.
    


            “They're doing a damn good job at keeping the city safe in really unprecedented in chaotic conditions,” he said.
    


            Roads around 26th Street West and Nicollet Avenue are open and vehicle restrictions have been lifted one day after Alex Pretti was fatally shot by federal immigration agents during a protest, Minneapolis officials announced Sunday.
    


            The vehicle perimeter around the scene has been removed, and the Minnesota National Guard has ended its assignment at the site, the city said in a news release.
    


            The Minneapolis Police Department reported that overnight activity was calm, with no arrests, burglaries or fires. Crews cleared debris to allow emergency access. Area businesses and residents will be visited by Community Planning and Economic Development and Regulatory Services staff to check on conditions and offer support, and graffiti cleanup is planned, according to the release. City vehicles involved in these efforts will be clearly marked.
    


 CNN's Yan Kaner contributed to this report.



            At the scene where Alex Pretti was fatally shot by a Border Patrol agent, CNN's Whitney Wild said she continues to see a growing memorial despite subzero temperatures in Minneapolis.
    


            “You see dozens of bouquets of flowers. You see hundreds of candles. You see notes to Alex, signs with his photo. Here's one. ‘Thank you for loving, serving and saving lives.' This has been going on since last night,” Wild described.
    


            Wild spoke to a woman who said the reason she visited the memorial today is “outrage.”
    


                    “This is so wrong. People are afraid to leave their homes. Children are traumatized. This is a city under siege,” said Mary Reyelts, who lives about a mile away from where Pretti was shot.
                





            “Last week, I was saying if you were a brown person in this, you are living in a police state,” Reyelts said. “This week, I'm thinking it's all of us. You can't have a bumper sticker on your car. You can get pulled out of your car for any reason.”
    


            Reyelts added while she is not changing how she lives her day-to-day life, her son is.
    


                    “My son is brown and he is afraid to go out with his boys in the car, because if he gets pulled out of his car, what happens to his 2-year-old and 3-year-old?” she said.
                





            Minneapolis resident BJ Clark told Wild last night he came out to protect Pretti's vigil despite not personally knowing him.
    


            “He was just here holding his phone. He shouldn't be dead right now,” Clark said. “Apparently, he was a medic from — like a military vet medic. So, someone who saved lives died for absolutely no reason. And ICE is still here, and big man in office doesn't want to let them out. And they need to go.”
    


            More than 24 hours after a Border Patrol agent shot and killed Alex Pretti, personnel from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension have arrived at the scene.
    


            BCA staff are “canvassing and looking to collect whatever evidence may be there,” Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Sunday.
    


            O'Hara said he requested the BCA to investigate immediately after the shooting, but “they were refused entry” by federal agents.
    


            “They even got a state search warrant for a public area to conduct their investigation, but they were not allowed in,” he said.
    


            The scene has since become “contaminated,” O'Hara said, adding the situation is “not ideal” for investigators.
    


            BCA Superintendent Drew Evans said Saturday that state and local police were unable to secure the scene and it was overrun by protesters, preventing the BCA from conducting its own examination.
    


            Video from Sunday morning shows people in BCA jackets at the scene. One person asked those standing nearby to leave the area for about 20 minutes so investigators could document the scene.
    


            The BCA and the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office are both suing the Trump administration after the shooting. Early Sunday morning, a federal judge in Minnesota granted a temporary restraining order blocking federal agencies from destroying or altering evidence related to Pretti's killing.
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem alleged that local and state leaders “abandoned” the area of downtown Minneapolis and continued to characterize protestors as “violent rioters.”
    


            “These are not just agitators anymore. They're violent protests. In fact, the state and the city of Minneapolis abandoned this area in downtown Minneapolis because they couldn't control the situation by the amount of people that have come in, just trying to disrupt and impede law enforcement operations,” Noem said on Fox News' The Sunday Briefing.
    


            Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told CNN that federal officials attempted to prevent local police from accessing the shooting scene.  But O'Hara told his officers to remain on site as part of standard protocol to preserve evidence after a shooting.
    


            Noem also alleged, without evidence, that protests only turned violent in Minneapolis after the administration put a spotlight on fraud allegations in the state. Trump said yesterday, in the aftermath of the shooting, that it was a “cover up.”
    


            “These are not just agitators anymore. They're violent protests,” Noem said.
    


            “Frankly, this didn't turn violent until we uncovered the fraud in Minneapolis. We were there, ICE and CBP have been there and operating for years in Minneapolis, we saw the violence start to happen when the fraud became uncovered,” Noem said.
    


CNN's Josh Campbell contributed to this report. 



            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that she's “grieved” for the parents of Alex Pretti, who's son was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent in Minneapolis Saturday.
    


            “I'm grieved for them. I truly am. I can't even imagine losing a child. And I can't imagine a tragic situation,” Noem said on Fox News' The Sunday Briefing.
    


            However, Noem appeared to place blame on Pretti for showing up with a gun and “confronting” officers. Pretti had a concealed carry permit and videos don't show him brandishing the weapon at officers. They show Pretti was disarmed before he was shot.
    


            “We can't have individuals that are impeding law enforcement operations and then showing up with guns and weapons and no ID and confronting law enforcement, like, that is one of the reasons that we see situations like this unfold,” Noem said.
    


            Asked about First Amendment rights, Noem said individuals should comply with officers who tell them to ” back off.”
    


            “When an officer tells you to back off and gives you orders you should comply and explain you shouldn't show up with weapons that no ID and no indication of how they're going to be used, and that aggressive interaction, laying hands on law enforcement officers, clearly, is a crime, and it is something that should not be acceptable,” Noem said.
    


            Oklahoma GOP Gov. Kevin Stitt told CNN on Sunday that President Donald Trump is “getting bad advice” on immigration enforcement and that “Americans don't like what they're seeing” in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis.
    


            “First off, this is a real tragedy, and I think the death of Americans with what we're seeing is causing deep concerns over federal tactics and accountability. Americans don't like what they're seeing right now,” Stitt told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”
    


            When pressed by Bash if federal agents should be pulled out of Minnesota, Stitt said “I think the President has to answer that question” and said Trump was “getting bad advice right now.”
    


            Though Stitt mentioned Trump was elected in part on his immigration policies he said “now Americans are asking themselves, ‘What is the endgame? What is the solution?'”
    


            “What's the goal right now? Is it to deport every single non-US citizen? I don't think that's what Americans want. We have to stop politicizing this. We need real solutions on immigration reform,” Stitt said.
    


            Additionally, Stitt called for a cooldown in tensions saying that they were “going crazy” and that “we need to calm this down.”
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Sunday that Alex Pretti impeded a law enforcement operation and defended the agents involved in his death.
    


                    “We do know that he came to that scene and impeded a law enforcement operation, which is against federal law. It's a felony. When he did that, interacting with those agents, when they tried to get him to disengage, he became aggressive and resisted them,” Noem said on Fox News' The Sunday Briefing. “Throughout that process, these officers used their training, followed their protocols, and were in fear for their lives and the people around them, and that's how this tragedy unfolded.”
                





            When pressed on whether Pretti was disarmed before he was shot by a border patrol agent, Noem said, “That's all part of this investigation. Every video will be analyzed, everything will be looked at.” She also said officers reacted to people yelling “Gun, gun, gun.”
    


            “I can't speak to every single thing that those officers thought but this happened in seconds. They clearly feared for their lives and took action to defend themselves and the people around them,” she said.
    


            As Second Amendment rights have become part of the conversation, Noem said her message to those with legal concealed carry permits is, “Don't go impede law enforcement operations.”
    


            FBI Director Kash Patel accused the man killed by a federal officer Saturday of breaking the law by possessing a firearm he had a legal permit to carry, failing to explain what law was broken and refusing to support his claim.
    


            During an interview on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo,” Patel said the man, Alex Pretti, was not allowed to bring a firearm to a protest — a notion that gun right groups have heavily criticized.
    


            “You cannot bring a firearm loaded with multiple magazines to any sort of protest that you want. It's that simple,” Patel said. “You don't have that right to break the law and incite violence.”
    


            When pressed by Bartiromo on how Pretti was threatening Border Patrol officers, Patel punted, saying that the Department of Homeland Security was leading the investigation.
    


            “We will, of course, always protect your First Amendment speech, and if you peacefully protest, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that,” Patel said.
    


            Patel did not explain his suggestion that Pretti incited violence — a notion that is not supported by video from the scene, which shows a federal officer spraying Pretti with chemical irritants before several more officers help tackle him to the ground before fatally shooting him.
    


            Following the shooting, the Second Amendment advocacy group Gun Owners of America wrote in a statement that “the Second Amendment protects Americans' right to bear arms while protesting — a right the federal government must not infringe upon.”
    


            Patel said Pretti's firearm was in possession of the FBI, which was handling the physical evidence in the case, while the investigation would be led by DHS — a stark departure from normal procedures that would place the FBI as lead agency in a shooting involving a federal officer.
    


            Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino claimed federal agents used de-escalation techniques before fatally shooting Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday, in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash.
    


            “Those de-escalation techniques, whether it was physically trying to remove them from … that active law enforcement scene in which law enforcement were going after a violent illegal alien, or the use of pepper spray, which is another de-escalation technique, those techniques did not work,” Bovino told Bash on Sunday.
    


            “Officers always try to use the minimum amount of force necessary to either effect an arrest, which in this case was more than likely 18 (US Code) 111, assault on a federal officer,” he said.
    


            Bash then pressed Bovino on what evidence supported the claim that Pretti was assaulting the federal officers, noting that Pretti appeared to be helping another bystander who had been pushed to the ground by an agent. Bovino did not cite specific actions by Pretti, responding instead, “We don't need a suspect's help in an active law enforcement scene.”
    


            “He did not need to be where he was,” he added, once again relying on the assertion that Pretti's presence alone had justified the agents' response.
    


            Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino suggested Sunday that Alex Pretti was a victim of “heated rhetoric,” arguing that political criticism of federal immigration agents may have helped place Pretti in a deadly confrontation — despite offering no evidence that Pretti assaulted or threatened officers.
    


            “Did he fall victim to that violent and heated rhetoric by Mayor Frey, Governor Walz?” Bovino asked when confronted by CNN's Dana Bash. “They're trying to portray Border Patrol agents and ICE agents as Gestapo Nazi and many other words,” he said.
    


            Bovino also questioned Pretti's motives for being at the scene, asking whether he was “simply walking by and just happened to walk into a law enforcement situation and try to direct traffic and stand in the middle of the road and then assault, delay and obstruct law enforcement.”
    


            Bovino praised the agents involved in the incident, crediting their “fantastic training” with preventing “any specific shootings of law enforcement.”
    


            “So, good job for our law enforcement in taking him down before he was able to do that,” Bovino said.
    


            New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani reacted to the killing of two residents of Minneapolis, calling it “horrific” and said he previously told President Donald Trump the ICE raids are “cruel” and “inhumane.”
    


            “I will do everything in my power to ensure that we do not see that take place in New York City. And I've also said clearly to the president that these ICE raids, they are cruel, they are inhumane. They do nothing to serve the interests of public safety,” he said in an interview ABC News' “This Week.”
    


            Mamdani said “too many Americans are being asked to not believe their own eyes.”
    


            “People want to hear the truth. They want to see the truth, and that's why I described that as a murder, because there's no other way to watch that video and come to a different conclusion,” he said.
    


            Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy today criticized the Trump administration's response to the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by a Border Patrol agent yesterday in Minneapolis, claiming on CNN's “State of the Union” with Dana Bash that the administration is lying about the facts surrounding the killing.
    


            Murphy homed in on an interview Bash conducted with Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino moments earlier, during which Bovino faulted Pretti for approaching agents and carrying a gun. Bovino also claimed that Pretti had “intent to harm,” but when pressed for evidence, he offered no specifics.
    


            Bovino also suggested Pretti's presence at the scene had justified the agents' response.
    


            Murphy said he found the interview “bone-chilling,” adding, “I was shaking as I was listening to it.”
    


                    “It takes just an unbelievable amount of gall to lie to the American public,” he said. “It should freak the American public out that the Trump administration lies this easily – will lie to your face when you can see the evidence for yourself.”
                





            Murphy also harshly criticized ICE and CBP, saying Minneapolis is “fundamentally less safe” after the shooting, which was the second death at the hands of federal officers in the city this month.
    


            “(Federal immigration agents) are there to cause a conflict. They are there to create mayhem,” Murphy said. “And it isn't going to be just isolated to Minneapolis as they continue to staff up with officers who are not trained for this kind of work. This is going to be in Philadelphia. This is going to be in Phoenix.”
    


            The International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) has called on the White House to lead discussions to find a “constructive path forward” after the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old US citizen by federal officers in Minneapolis yesterday.
    


            The IACP is “concerned by the ongoing challenges affecting public safety, law enforcement professionals, and the communities they serve,” the organization said in a statement.
    


                    “Periods of heightened tension place significant strain on public safety systems and underscore the need for stability, professionalism, and respect for constitutional principles,” it added.
                





            “Comprehensive training, investigative integrity, adherence to the rule of law, and strong coordination among federal, state, and local partners” all contribute to “effective public safety,” the IACP said.
    


            “In times of uncertainty, elected leaders at all levels play a critical role in de-escalating tensions by using measured, responsible rhetoric that reinforces lawful processes and public trust rather than deepening division,” it continued.
    


                    Calling on the White House, the IACP asked it to “bring together thoughtful federal, state and local law enforcement leaders for policy-level discussions aimed at identifying a constructive path forward.”
                





            New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani said Sunday the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis should shock people and accused the federal government of acting like an enemy toward its own citizens.
    


            “To see ICE murder yet another person in this country and any attempt to try and paint this man as an enemy of the state is frankly an attempt to distract from the real question – which is what has the state done to make itself an enemy of the people.”
    


            Mamdani, part of a growing chorus of lawmakers who have called to abolish ICE, has been critical of immigration operations in other cities. While ICE enforcement is happening in New York, it is not at the large scale that has been reported in other cities.
    


            “These ICE raids are cruel, they are inhumane, they do nothing to serve the interest of public safety,” he added.
    


            Mamdani has said he tried to dissuade President Donald Trump from increasing enforcement in the city, saying the added enforcement will not ensure public safety.
    


            “We have to speak plainly – what we saw in Minneapolis, this is something that should shock all of us. We are speaking about the murder of a person on the street for the crime of standing up for someone else,” Mamdani said.
    


            Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino said Sunday that Second Amendment protections do not apply when federal officers believe they are being obstructed or assaulted, even as he offered no evidence that Alex Pretti engaged in such conduct before he was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Saturday.
    


            In an interview with CNN's Dana Bash, Bovino said constitutional gun rights are void in situations he characterized as riots or attacks on law enforcement.
    


            “We respect that Second Amendment right, but those rights don't count when you riot and assault, delay, obstruct and impede law enforcement officers and, most especially, when you mean to do that beforehand,” he said.
    


            Bovino also claimed to support peaceful armed protest, saying, “I've done that myself and fully support that, but not when you perpetrate violence, obstruct, delay or obfuscate border patrol in the performance of their duties.”
    


            He did not cite evidence that Pretti committed violence or interfered with agents in those ways, instead repeatedly framing Pretti's presence at the scene as proof of intent.
    


            Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino repeatedly declined to provide evidence or specific details during an interview with CNN's Dana Bash this morning, as he defended federal agents who shot and killed ICU nurse and US citizen Alex Pretti yesterday in Minneapolis.
    


            Pressed on the Department of Homeland Security's claim that Pretti was “brandishing” a weapon, Bovino said only that Pretti had a gun and faulted him for approaching agents, declining to say whether the weapon was ever fired or how many agents discharged their weapons.
    


            Bovino suggested Pretti's presence had justified the agents' response.
    


            “He injected himself into that crime scene. I can't say that enough, he made the decision to go there. We didn't make the decision to talk to him,” the Border Patrol official said on CNN's “State of the Union.”
    


            Bovino also claimed that Pretti had “intent to harm,” but when pressed for evidence, Bovino offered no specifics.
    


            “When you show up to an active crime scene, don't leave the crime scene, and you're armed — then you know you've got to the decision-making process for that individual,” Bovino told CNN.
    


            When Bash referenced video that appears to show officers disarming Pretti before he was shot, Bovino declined to address it directly, saying, “We're not going to adjudicate that here on TV in one freeze-frame there.”
    


            “We heard the law enforcement officer say, ‘Gun, gun, gun.' So at some point they knew there was a gun,” he said. “He brought a semiautomatic weapon to a riot, assaulted federal officers … So I do believe the Secretary (Kristi Noem) is 100% spot on in what she said.”
    


Key context: A CNN analysis of video shows an officer retrieving a gun from Pretti's waistband as officers restrain him. Roughly one second later, a shot is heard, followed by at least nine more.
    


            At no point in any video reviewed by CNN is Pretti seen wielding a weapon. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara has said Pretti was believed to be a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.
    


More from Bovino: The Border Patrol official said investigators are still working to determine Pretti's intent and what occurred in his final moments, but he maintained that federal agents — not Pretti — were the victims of the encounter.
    


            Bovino would not share information on how many agents fired their weapons but said the agent involved had extensive training. He said the agents involved “are going to more than likely be on administrative duty” as investigations continue.

            Japanese fans rushed to farewell the country's last two pandas on Sunday ahead of their return to China, in a departure that highlights strained relations between the two countries.
    


            Twin cubs Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei will leave Tokyo's Ueno Zoo Tuesday after meeting their fans for the last time on the weekend.
    


            They were born in the Japanese capital, but China retains ownership over them, under the rules of Beijing's “panda diplomacy.” The government there treats pandas as national symbols and goodwill ambassadors, loaning them to countries with which they wish to strengthen ties.
    


            The duo's departure leaves Japan without any pandas for the first time in more than five decades, at a time when relations between Asia's two biggest economies are at their lowest point in years.
    


            And politics wasn't far from visitors' minds when they paid last visits to the pandas over the past week.
    


            “I'm really sad,” visitor Shoken Ikeda told CNN during a recent trip to the zoo with his wife. “We always said, ‘There's a panda here, so we'll get to see it sometime,' and then this happened. I wish I'd come more often.”
    


            Long lines began to form in the weeks leading up to the pandas' last encounter with the public, prompting the zoo to switch to a lottery system for tickets.
    


            Another panda fan Yukie Kuyama said she lined up for five hours to see the animals in early December. After winning the lottery, she came to see them again last week.
    


            “That's very disappointing. It feels sad that such cute, innocent animals are being used as a trump card – or even a tool – in diplomacy,” she said.
    


            The siblings have different personalities, according to their keepers; Xiao Xiao is timid while his sister Lei Lei is fearless and adapts to changes quickly.
    


            The two pandas were born in 2021 at the Ueno Zoo, to mother Shin Shin and father Ri Ri. The parents were returned to China in 2024, a year after the twins' sister Xiang Xiang was also sent back.
    


            Japan welcomed its first pandas in 1972 to mark the normalization of diplomatic ties with China. Since then, more pandas have arrived or were born locally, gaining a huge following.
    


            But remarks from Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi – suggesting that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan could trigger a military response from her country – has recently drawn ire from China.
    


            Beijing has responded with a flurry of economic pressure, including cutting flights and warning citizens against traveling to Japan. The number of Chinese tourists in Japan dropped by almost a half last month year on year, to around 330,000, Tourism Minister Yasushi Kaneko said last week.
    


            Chinese authorities have also suspended seafood imports and banned exports of rare earth elements with military uses, as they demand that Takaichi withdraw her comment. The Japanese leader said in November that her remarks were “hypothetical” and that she would avoid making similar comments again.
    


            Meanwhile, Takaichi has called an election on February 8 in a bid to reinforce her mandate on a range of policies, potentially including her tougher stance on China, having secured the office by winning an internal contest among her Liberal Democratic Party in October.
    


            Last year, China also took back four pandas from the zoo of a Japanese town which relied heavily on panda-related tourism.
    


            In Shirahama, a resort destination tucked away on the southern coast of Japan, shops selling panda merchandise, and ramen bars serving up noodles themed on the bears, were left in limbo.
    


            China's decision not to renew the leases of those four bears was potentially related to Taiwan as well, one international relations expert told CNN earlier, coming after Shirahama elected a mayor with a pro-Taiwan stance.
    


            For now, staff at Ueno Zoo plan to keep the panda facility as it is and hope for the best.
    


            “The facilities were designed specifically for giant pandas, so it wouldn't be easy to adapt them for other animals,” said Hitoshi Suzuki, director of animal care and exhibits at the Zoo, who helped raise Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei from day one.
    


            He hopes to continue working with China on conservation and breeding research at the very least. But more than anything, he hopes the pandas will come back one day.
    


            “They're not only adorable but also fascinating animals, and I would love for many people to have the chance to see them,” he said.

Two-thirds of the US population is facing a major winter storm that will bring crippling ice and snow to a footprint that stretches over 2,000 miles from Texas to New England through the weekend.

Ice accumulations are expected to weigh down and drop power lines and trees in the most serious icing zones in the South, and hundreds of thousands of people could lose power, potentially for days.

Thousands of flights have already been canceled and travel will be difficult to impossible on roads across the storm's footprint.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","In pictures: The Minneapolis immigration crackdown","https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/23/us/gallery/minneapolis-ice-immigration-crackdown","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 02:51:00 GMT","

Tensions have been flaring in Minnesota since the federal government launched an immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities in December.

A major flashpoint erupted January 7 when an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old US citizen, in Minneapolis. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Good tried to “weaponize her vehicle” and that the agent opened fire out of self-defense. State and local officials have strongly disputed that claim. The deadly shooting, which was captured on video, sparked protests across the country.

Then on January 24 federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident. The Department of Homeland Security said he had a handgun and “violently resisted” when agents tried to disarm him. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said videos show that account to be “nonsense” and “lies.” A CNN analysis of video appears to show an officer removing a gun from Pretti just before he was fatally shot.

The state of Minnesota and the Twin Cities are suing the Trump administration, arguing the immigration operation in the state is “a federal invasion,” according to a lawsuit filed on January 12. The lawsuit claims Operation Metro Surge is not a legitimate law enforcement action, but a retaliation effort against Democratic-led Minnesota, citing the president's disparaging comments toward local officials.

Trump and his administration have said the Constitution gives the federal government broad authority to enforce national immigration laws as the government sees fit.

LONDON (AP) — No more fawning praise. No more polite workarounds and old-style diplomacy. And no one is calling Donald Trump “daddy” now. 

European leaders who scrambled for a year to figure out how to deal with an emboldened American president in his second term edged closer to saying “no,” or something diplomatically like it, to his disregard for international law and his demands for their territory. Trump's vow to take over Greenland and punish any country that resists, seems to have been the crucible. 

“Red lines” were deemed to have been crossed this year when Trump abruptly revived his demand that the United States “absolutely” must rule Greenland, the semiautonomous region that is part of NATO ally Denmark. That pushed even the most mild-mannered diplomats to issue sharp warnings against Trump, whom they had flattered withroyal treatment and fawning praise.

“Britain will not yield” its support for Greenland's sovereignty, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said. Several of the continent's leaders said “Europe will not be blackmailed” over Greenland.

“Threats have no place among allies,” said Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.

The tough diplomatic talk around the showdown last week in Davos, Switzerland, was not the only factor pressuring Trump. U.S. congressional elections are approaching in November amid a sinking stock market and wilting approval ratings. European leaders also are not the first to stand in Trump's way during his second term — see Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. 




But the dramatic turnabout among Europe's elite, from “appeasing” Trump to defying him, offers clues in the ongoing effort among some nations of how to say “no” to a president who hates hearing it and is known to retaliate.

“We want a piece of ice for world protection, and they won't give it,” Trump told his audience at the World Economic Forum. “You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no, and we will remember.”

In recent days, Europe offered abundant refusals to go along with Trump, from his Greenland demand and joining his new Board of Peace and even to what Canada's Mark Carney called the “fiction” that the alliance functions for the benefit of any country more than the most powerful. The moment marked a unity among European leaders that they had struggled to achieve for a year. 

“When Europe is not divided, when we stand together and when we are clear and strong also in our willingness to stand up for ourselves, then the results will show,” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said. “I think we have learned something.”

Federiksen herself exemplified the learning curve. A year ago, she and other leaders were on their heels and mostly responding to the Trump administration. She found it necessary to tell reporters in February 2025, “We are not a bad ally,” after Vice President JD Vance had said Denmark was “not being a good ally.”

Trump is transactional. He has little use for diplomacy and no “need (for) international law,” he told The New York Times this month. Therein lay the disconnect between typically collaborative European leaders and the Republican president when he blazed back into the White House saying he wanted the U.S. to take over Greenland, Panama and perhaps even Canada. 

“In Trump's first term, Europe didn't know what to expect and tried to deal with him by using the old rules of diplomacy, with the expectation that, if they kept talking to him in measured terms, that he would change his behavior and move into the club,” said Mark Shanahan, associate professor of political engagement at the University of Surrey,.

“It's very hard for other leaders who deal with each other through the niceties of a rules-based system and diplomatic conversation,” Shanahan said. “It is hard for them to change.”

Five months after Trump's inauguration last year, with his Greenland threat in the air, European leaders had gotten their heads around Trump management enough to pull off a meeting of NATO nations in the Netherlands. NATO members agreed to contribute more and widely gave Trump credit for forcing them to modernize. 

Secretary-General Mark Rutte, known as the coalition's “Trump whisperer,” likened the president's role quieting the Iran-Israel war to a “daddy” intervening in a schoolyard brawl.

Traditional diplomacy exists to preserve possibilities of working together. That often means avoiding saying a flat “no” if possible. But Trump's Greenland gambit was so stark a threat from one NATO member to another that Greenland's prime minister actually said the word. 

“Enough,” Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a statement shortly after Trump's remarks Jan. 5. “No more pressure. No more hints. No more fantasies about annexation.”

That played a part in setting the tone. Denmark's leader said any such invasion of Greenland would mark the end of NATO and urged alliance members to take the threat seriously.

They did, issuing statement after statement rejecting the renewed threat. Trump responded last weekend from his golf course in Florida with a threat to charge a 10% import tax within a month on goods from eight European nations — Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland. The rate, he wrote, would climb to 25% on June 1 if no deal was in place for “the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland” by the United States.

Trump's fighting words lit a fire among leaders arriving in Davos. But they seemed to recognize, too, that the wider Trump world left him vulnerable. 

“Trump was in a fairly weak position because he has a lot of other looming problems going on,” domestically, including an upcoming U.S. Supreme Court decision on his tariffs and a backlash to immigration raids in Minnesota, said Duncan Snidal, professor emeritus of international relations at Oxford University and the University of Chicago. 

Canada's Carney said no by reframing the question not as being about Greenland, but about whether it was time for European countries to build power together against a “bully” — and his answer was yes. 

Without naming the U.S. or Trump, Carney spoke bluntly: Europe, he said, should reject the big power's “coercion” and “exploitation.” It was time to accept, he said, that a “rupture” in the alliance, not a transition, had occurred.

Unsaid, Snidel pointed out, was that the rupture was very new, and though it might be difficult to repair in the future, doing so under adjusted rules remains in U.S. and European interests beyond Trump's presidency. “It's too good a deal for all of them not to,” Snidel said. 

Before Trump stepped away from the podium in Davos, he had begun to back down.

He canceled his threat to use “force” to take over Greenland. Not long after, he reversed himself fully, announcing “the framework” for a deal that would make his tariff threat unnecessary. 

Trump told Fox Business that “we're going to have total access to Greenland,” under the “framework,” without divulging what that might mean.

Frederiksen hit the warning button again. In a statement, she said, “We cannot negotiate on our sovereignty.”

In other words: “No.”

ATLANTA (AP) — Your watch says you had three hours of deep sleep. Should you believe it? 

Millions of people rely on phone apps and wearable devices like rings, smartwatches and sensors to monitor how well they're sleeping, but these trackers don't necessarily measure sleep directly. Instead, they infer states of slumber from signals like heart rate and movement, raising questions about how reliable the information is and how seriously it should be taken.

The U.S. sleep-tracking devices market generated about $5 billion in 2023 and is expected to double in revenue by 2030, according to market research firm Grand View Research. As the devices continue to gain popularity, experts say it is important to understand what they can and cannot tell you, and how their data should be used.

Here's a look at the technology — and why one expert thinks its full potential has yet to be realized.

Whether it's an Apple Watch, a Fitbit, an Oura Ring or one of innumerable other competitors, health and fitness trackers largely take the same basic approach by recording the wearer's movements and heart rate while at rest, according to Daniel Forger, a University of Michigan math professor who researches the science behind sleep wearables.

The algorithms used by major brands have become highly accurate for determining when someone is asleep, Forger said. The devices are also somewhat helpful for estimating sleep stages, though an in-lab study would be more precise, he said.

“If you really want to know definitively how much non-REM sleep you're having versus REM sleep, that's where the in-lab studies really excel,” Forger said.

Dr. Chantale Branson, a neurologist and professor at the Morehouse School of Medicine, said she frequently has patients showing up with sleep scores from fitness trackers in hand, sometimes fixated on granular details such as how much REM sleep they got on a certain night. 

Branson says those patients are taking the wrong approach: the devices help highlight trends over time but should not be viewed as a definitive measure of one's sleep health. Nor should any single night's data be seen as significant.

“We would have believed them with or without the device and worked on trying to figure out why they can't sleep — and that is what the wearables do not do,” she said.

Branson said she thinks people who check their sleep statistics every morning would be better served by spending their efforts on “sleep hygiene” such as creating a relaxing bedtime routine, avoiding screens before bed and making sure their sleep environment is comfortable. She advises those concerned about their sleep to consult a clinician before spending money on a wearable. 

Forger takes a more favorable view toward the devices, which he says help keep the overlooked importance of sleep front of mind. He recommends them even for people without significant sleep issues, saying they can offer insights that help users fine-tune their routines and feel more alert during the day.

“Seeing if your biological clock is in sync is a huge benefit because even if you're giving yourself the right amount of time, if you're sleeping at the wrong times, the sleep won't be as efficient,” Forger said.

Kate Stoye, an Atlanta-area middle school teacher, bought an Oura Ring last summer, having heard positive things from friends who used it as a fertility tracker: “It's so accurate,” she said. Stoye found the ring to be just as helpful with tracking her sleep. After noticing that the few nights she drank alcohol coincided with poorer sleep quality, she decided to give up alcohol.

“I don't see much reason to drink if I know that it's going to affect how I feel,” said Stoye, who always wears her device except when she is playing tennis or needs to charge it.

Another trend she says she detected in the ring's data: the importance of not eating too late if she wants to get good rest.

“I always struggle with going to bed, and it's often because I eat late at night,” Stoye said. “I know that about myself, and it knows it too.”

Mai Barreneche, who works in advertising in New York City, used to wear her Oura Ring constantly. She said it helped her develop good sleep habits and encouraged her to maintain a daily morning exercise regimen. But as a metric-driven person, she became “obsessed” enough with her nightly sleep scores that it began to cause her anxiety — a modern condition that researchers have dubbed “orthosomnia.”

“I remember I would go to bed thinking about the score I was going to get in the morning,” Barreneche said.

Barreneche decided not to wear her ring on a beach vacation a few years ago, and when she returned home, she never put it back on. She said she has maintained the good habits the device pointed her toward, but no longer wants the stress of monitoring her nightly scores. 

Branson, of the Morehouse School of Medicine, said she's observed similar score-induced anxiety as a recurring issue for some patients, particularly those who set goals to achieve a certain amount of REM sleep or who shared their nightly scores with friends using the same device. Comparing sleep types and stages is ill-advised since individual needs vary by age, genetics and other factors, she said.

“These devices are supposed to help you,” Branson said. “And if you feel anxious or worried or frustrated about it, then it's not helpful, and you should really talk to a professional.”

Forger thinks the promise of wearables has been underestimated, with emerging research suggesting the devices could one day be designed to help detect infections before symptoms appear and to flag sleep pattern changes that may signal the onset of depression or an increased risk of relapse.

“The body is making these really interesting and really important decisions that we're not aware of to keep us healthy and active and alert at the right times of day,” he said. “If you have an infection, that rhythm very quickly starts to disappear because the body goes into overdrive to start fighting the infection. Those are the kind of things we can pick up.”

The technology could be particularly useful in low-resource communities, where wearables could help health issues to be identified more quickly and monitored remotely without requiring access to doctors or specialized clinics, according to Forger.

“There's this really important story that's about to come out: About just how understanding sleep rhythms and sleep architecture is going to generally improve our lives,” he said.

American workers adopted artificial intelligence into their work lives at a remarkable pace over the past few years, according to a new poll.

Some 12% of employed adults say they use AI daily in their job, according to a Gallup Workforce survey conducted this fall of more than 22,000 U.S. workers.

The survey found roughly one-quarter say they use AI at least frequently, which is defined as at least a few times a week, and nearly half say they use it at least a few times a year. That compares with 21% who were using AI at least occasionally in 2023, when Gallup began asking the question, and points to the impact of the widespread commercial boom that ChatGPT sparked for generative AI tools that can write emails and computer code, summarize long documents, create images or help answer questions. 

Home Depot store associate Gene Walinski is one of the employees embracing AI at work. The 70-year-old turns to an AI assistant on his personal phone roughly every hour on his shift so he can better answer questions about supplies that he is not “100% familiar with” at the store's electrical department in New Smyrna Beach, Florida.

“I think my job would suffer if I couldn't because there would be a lot of shrugged shoulders and ‘I don't know' and customers don't want to hear that,” Walinski said. 




While frequent AI use is on the rise with many employees, AI adoption remains higher among those working in technology-related fields. 

About 6 in 10 technology workers say they use AI frequently, and about 3 in 10 do so daily.

The share of Americans working in the technology sector who say they use AI daily or regularly has grown significantly since 2023, but there are indications that AI adoption could be starting to plateau after an explosive increase between 2024 and 2025.

In finance, another sector with high AI adoption, 28-year-old investment banker Andrea Tanzi said he uses AI tools every day to synthesize documents and data sets that would otherwise take him several hours to review.

Tanzi, who works for Bank of America in New York, said he also makes uses of the bank's internal AI chatbot, Erica, to help with administrative tasks.

In addition, majorities of those working in professional services, at colleges or universities or in K-12 education, say they use AI at least a few times a year. 

Joyce Hatzidakis, 60, a high school art teacher in Riverside, California, started experimenting with AI chatbots to help “clean up” her communications with parents.

“I can scribble out a note and not worry about what I say and then tell it what tone I want,” she said. “And then, when I reread it, if it's not quite right, I can have it edited again. I'm definitely getting less parent complaints.”

Another Gallup Workforce survey from last year found that about 6 in 10 employees using AI are relying on chatbots or virtual assistance when they turn to AI tools. About 4 in 10 AI users at work reported using AI to consolidate information or data, to generate ideas or to learn new things.

Hatzidakis started with ChatGPT and then switched to Google's Gemini when the school district made that its official tool. She has even used it to help with recommendation letters because “there's only so many ways to say a kid is really creative.”

The AI industry and the U.S. government are heavily promoting AI adoption in workplaces and schools. More people and organizations will need to buy these tools in order to justify the huge amounts of investment into building and running energy-hungry AI computing systems. But not all economists agree on how much they will boost productivity or affect employment prospects.

“Most of the workers that are most highly exposed to AI, who are most likely to have it disrupt their workflows, for good or for bad, have these characteristics that make them pretty adaptable,” said Sam Manning, a fellow at the Centre for the Governance of AI and co-author of new papers on AI job effects for the Brookings Institution and the National Bureau of Economic Research.

Workers in those mostly computer-based jobs that involve a lot of AI usage “usually have higher levels of education, wider ranges of skill sets that can be applied to different jobs, and they also have higher savings, which is helpful for weathering an income shock if you lose your job,” Manning said.

On the other hand, Manning's research has identified some 6.1 million workers in the United States who are both heavily exposed to AI and less equipped to adapt. Many are in administrative and clerical work, about 86% are women and they are older and concentrated in smaller cities, such as university towns or state capitals, with fewer options to shift careers.

“If their skills are automated, they have less transferable skills to other jobs and they have a lower savings, if any savings,” Manning said. ”An income shock could be much more harmful or difficult to manage.”

A separate Gallup Workforce survey from 2025 found that even as AI use is increasing, few employees said it was “very” or “somewhat” likely that new technology, automation, robots or AI will eliminate their job within the next five years. Half said it was “not at all likely,” but that has decreased from about 6 in 10 in 2023.

Not worried about losing his job is the Rev. Michael Bingham, pastor of the Faith Community Methodist Church in Jacksonville, Florida. 

A chatbot fed him “gibberish” when he asked about the medieval theologian Anselm of Canterbury, and Bingham said he would never ask a “soulless” machine to help write his sermons, relying instead on “the power of God” to help guide him through ideas.

“You don't want a machine, you want a human being, to hold your hand if you're dying,” Bingham said. “And you want to know that your loved one was able to hold the hand of a loving human being who cared for them.”

Reported AI usage is less common in service-based sectors, such as retail, health care or manufacturing. 

Home Depot did not ask Walinski to use AI when he got a job at the store last year, after a decades-long career in the car business. But the home improvement giant also did not try to stop him and he is “not at all worried” that AI will replace him.

“The human interface part is really what a store like mine works on,” Walinski said. “It's all about the people.”

Cheers erupted from a street-level crowd as he reached the top of the spire of the 508-meter (1,667-foot) tower about 90 minutes after he started. Wearing a red short-sleeve shirt, Honnold waved his arms back and forth over his head.

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — American rock climber Alex Honnold ascended the Taipei 101 skyscraper on Sunday without any ropes or protective equipment.

Cheers erupted from a street-level crowd as he reached the top of the spire of the 508-meter (1,667-foot) tower about 90 minutes after he started. Wearing a red short-sleeve shirt, Honnold waved his arms back and forth over his head.

“It was like what a view, it's incredible, what a beautiful day,” he said afterward. “It was very windy, so I was like, don't fall off the spire. I was trying to balance nicely. But it was, what an incredible position, what a beautiful way to see Taipei.”

Honnold, known for his ropeless ascent up Yosemite National Park's El Capitan, climbed up one corner of Taipei 101 using small L-shaped outcroppings as footholds. Periodically, he had to maneuver around and clamber up the sides of large ornamental structures that jut out from the tower, pulling himself up with his bare hands.

The building has 101 floors, with the hardest part being the 64 floors of the middle section — the “bamboo boxes” that give the building its signature look. Divided into eight, each segment has eight floors of steep, overhanging climbing followed by balconies, where he took short rests as he made his way upward.

Honnold's free solo climb of the iconic building in Taiwan's capital city was broadcast live on Netflix with a 10-second delay. The ascent, originally scheduled for Saturday, was delayed for 24 hours due to rain.

Having a cheering crowd was unusual and a bit unnerving at first for Honnold, whose climbs are usually in remote areas.




“When I was leaving the ground, you're like oh it's kind of intense, there's so many people watching,” he said. “But then honestly, they're all wishing me well. I mean basically it just makes the whole experience feel almost more festive, all these nice people are out supporting me and having a good time.”

The climb drew both excitement and concern over the ethical implications of attempting such a high-risk endeavor on live broadcast.

Honnold isn't the first climber to ascend Taipei 101, but he is the first to do so without a rope. French rock climber Alain Robert scaled the building on Christmas Day in 2004 as part of the grand opening of what was then the world's tallest building.

Allies warn of a ‘rupture' in the world order.

President Donald Trump praised the soldiers of the United Kingdom who served alongside the U.S. in Afghanistan on Saturday, clarifying his previous criticism of NATO allies.

Trump had earlier criticized NATO troops who served in Afghanistan, arguing they had stayed ""a little bit back"" from the frontlines during the conflict. His statement was met with outrage in the U.K., however, where Prime Minister Kier Starmer called it ""insulting and frankly, appalling.""

""The GREAT and very BRAVE soldiers of the United Kingdom will always be with the United States of America! In Afghanistan, 457 died, many were badly injured, and they were among the greatest of all warriors,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

""It's a bond too strong to ever be broken. The U.K. Military, with tremendous Heart and Soul, is second to none (except for the U.S.A.!). We love you all, and always will!"" he continued.

The social media post partially walks back his previous criticism of NATO, made during an interview on Fox Business.

""We have never really asked anything of them,"" he said. ""You know, they'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan or this or that, and they did. They stayed a little back, little off the front lines.""

Starmer's office says the prime minister raised the issue with Trump during a phone call this weekend.

""I served there. I made lifelong friends there. And I lost friends there,"" Harry said.

""Those sacrifices deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect, as we all remain united and loyal to the defense of diplomacy and peace,"" he added.

Sam Olson, ICE field office director in St. Paul, joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss mass protests after a deadly CBP-involved shooting in Minneapolis and efforts to cooperate with local officials.

Celebrities such as Olivia Wilde and Natalie Portman are taking a stand against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after the Minneapolis shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti, the second anti-ICE protester to be shot and killed this month. 

During an appearance at the Sundance Film Festival on Saturday, Wilde — who was promoting her film ""The Invite"" — wore an ""ICE OUT"" pin during her red carpet appearance and shared her thoughts about the ""appalling"" circumstances. 

""We're all here getting to celebrate something really beautiful and hopeful in film storytelling,"" she told Variety. ""But the world is hurting right now, and this country is hurting. And it's appalling.""

""I'm appalled and sickened,"" Wilde continued. ""We can't go another day just sort of accepting this as our new norm. It's outrageous. People are being murdered. And, I don't want to normalize seeing people being murdered on the internet. On film. It's. It's hideous. And so if we can do anything out here to support the movement to cast ICE out, to delegitimize this unbelievably criminal organization, then that's what we should be doing.""

Wilde said it was ""inspiring"" to see the anti-ICE protests happening around the country. 

""I think so many Americans are [speaking out]. I mean, you see the marches happening around the country. Americans are speaking up in huge numbers, and it's dangerous to be a protester now and people are still going out to the streets, which is incredibly inspiring.""

People on social media were quick to give their two cents on Wilde's remarks.

""Stunning and brave,"" one user wrote on X. 

""I always knew you were an amazing woman,"" another quipped.

Though others weren't as supportive. 

""Boycott her,"" one social media user wrote on X.

""Give it up, posers in Hollywood. Your virtue signaling isn't working anymore,"" another wrote. 

Wilde wasn't the only celebrity to speak out against ICE at the Park City, Utah-based festival.

Natalie Portman, who was promoting her film, ""The Gallerist,"" opened up about the ""devastating"" events unfolding in our country.

""This is such a joyful community celebrating film here and we're so excited to be showing ‘The Gallerist,' but we're also at a moment in our country's history that is quite devastating,"" Portman told Variety. ""It's really impossible not to talk about what is happening right now and the brutality of ICE and how it has to stop immediately. But also, there's a beautiful community that Americans are showing right now. They're showing up for each other, protecting each other and fighting for their freedom. It's a bittersweet moment to celebrate something we're so proud of on the backdrop of our nation in pain.""

Earlier this month, several celebrities who attended the 83rd Golden Globes protested ICE just days after the fatal shooting of Renée Nicole Good. 

Stars like Mark Ruffalo, Wanda Sykes, Jean Smart, Ariana Grande, Natasha Lyonne and others wore pins with slogans that read, ""BE GOOD"" and ""ICE OUT.""

""Of course, this is for the mother who was murdered by an ICE agent, and it's really sad. I know people are out marching and all today, and we need to speak up,"" Sykes told Variety on the red carpet prior to the show. ""We need to be out there and shut this rogue government down, because it's just awful what they're doing to people."" 

The ""BE GOOD"" pin ""aims to honor Renée Macklin Good and Keith Porter while also reminding us what it means to be good to one another in the face of such horror — to be a good citizen, neighbor, friend, ally and human,"" read the campaign's official description, via People.

Golden Globes viewers quickly reacted on social media to the red carpet political protest.

""Such bravery,"" one user wrote on X. 

""Bravo to those with influence standing up for what's right,"" another wrote.

However, others criticized the display.

""They are so pathetic and a bunch of hypocrites,"" one X user wrote.

The family of a missing 15-year-old Long Island boy says their son disappeared two weeks ago after going to New York City to meet someone he met through the online game Roblox.

Thomas Medlin left the Stony Brook School around 3:30 p.m. on Jan. 9 and ""ran"" to the Stony Brook Train station, where he boarded a train to Grand Central Station in New York City, the Suffolk County Police Department said in a news release on Jan. 12.

Police released a surveillance image of Thomas at Grand Central Station, where detectives say he was last seen around 5:30 p.m. on Jan. 9.

Thomas' mother, Eva Yan, told News 12 Long Island in an interview that detectives believe her son had gone to meet someone who he met through Roblox, an online game.

Yan said that behavior was unlike Thomas.

""He has never left our side,"" Yan told the outlet through tears.

""I just can't believe why he left in the first place,"" James Medlin, Thomas' father, told the outlet.

A Roblox spokesperson told Fox News Digital in an email statement on Sunday that it is ""built with safety at its core"" and offers parental controls that allow parents to completely disable the in-game chat function.

""We are deeply troubled by this incident and are working with law enforcement to support their investigation,"" the spokesperson said. ""Roblox is built with safety at its core, including robust policies to help protect users that go beyond many other platforms. We have filters designed to block the sharing of personal information and don't allow user-to-user image or video sharing. While no system is perfect, our commitment to safety never ends, and we continue to evolve and strengthen our protections every day. Given this involves an ongoing investigation, we cannot comment further at this time.""

National Border Patrol Council president Paul Perez says Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz should ‘resign in shame' on ‘The Big Weekend Show.'

Senate Democrats are ready to break a fragile truce that would avert a partial government shutdown after a Minneapolis man was fatally shot by a border patrol agent Saturday. 

Congressional Democrats were already leery of backing funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) considering the agency's presence in Minnesota and beyond, but the shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti during an immigration enforcement operation has shattered what little unity they had on the bill. 

Now, Senate Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., plan to vote against the legislation, which is included in a broader funding package along with five other spending bills. 

SENATE DEMOCRATS REBEL AGAINST THEIR OWN LEADERSHIP OVER DHS FUNDING PACKAGE, INCREASING SHUTDOWN ODDS

Schumer, in a statement Saturday, said Democrats tried to get ""commonsense reforms"" in the DHS funding bill but charged that ""because of Republicans' refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses"" of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

 ""I will vote no,"" Schumer said. ""Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included.""

Schumer's play call serves as a blow to Senate Republicans, who worked with their colleagues across the aisle to find compromises in the DHS bill, in particular. It also comes as the Jan. 30 deadline to fund the government is rapidly approaching. Further complicating matters is the arctic storm ripping across the country, which has already forced the upper chamber to cancel votes on Monday. 

A senior Senate aide told Fox News Digital Senate Democrats had been saying for weeks they weren't interested in shutting down the government again and had praised the bipartisan nature of the government funding process up until Saturday.

""These bills were negotiated with Dems — they agreed to what's in them,"" the aide said.

HOUSE JAMS SENATE BY ATTACHING REPEAL OF JACK SMITH PROVISION TO $1.2T FUNDING PACKAGE

The agency would be fully funded in the current proposal with several restrictions and reporting requirements that, if not met, would act as triggers to turn off certain cash flows. 

Ripping the bill from the current six-bill funding package would cause a domino effect of headaches in Congress, given that any changes to the package would have to go through the House.

The lower chamber is gone until Feb. 2, making the likelihood of a partial shutdown much higher. 

Before the shooting, a handful of Senate Democrats had already made their opposition to the legislation known, including senators Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Tim Kaine, D-Va.

Kaine notably crossed the aisle last year to join a cohort of Senate Democratic caucus members to reopen the government after the longest shutdown in U.S. history.

He was not the only member of that group of eight to voice opposition. Senators Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., and Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., both came out against the DHS bill's inclusion in the broader package on Saturday. 

""My personal guiding principle has always been ‘agree where you can and fight where you must,'"" Rosen said in a statement. ""And I believe this is a time when we must fight back.""

House lawmakers are on a week-long recess after passing their latest spending package in two chunks Thursday, one standalone vote on DHS funding and another wrapping together funding legislation for the departments of War, Health and Human Services, Labor, Education, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development.

A provision was added to the legislation before it passed the House that would combine the bills into one large package for the Senate to consider at once. It was then expected to be paired with other bills the Senate has not yet considered but which passed the House this month.

Changing that ahead of the Jan. 30 shutdown deadline would mean House lawmakers must return to Washington early to go through multiple procedural hurdles and another vote on the legislation, something House GOP leaders are ruling out, at least for now.

""We passed all 12 bills over to the Senate, and they still have six in their possession that they need to pass to the president,"" a House GOP leadership source told Fox News Digital Saturday evening, referring to the lower chamber completing its portion of Congress' annual appropriations process. ""We have no plan to come back next week.""

Even if House leaders changed their plans, the impending snowstorm would mean lawmakers may not return until Tuesday at the earliest. That would put final passage sometime Wednesday or Thursday, virtually guaranteeing Congress does not complete consideration of the bills until after the Friday deadline.

House GOP leaders would also likely be grappling with attendance issues if they did order a return, with various lawmakers on planned trips and over a dozen busy campaigning for higher office.

A partial government shutdown would mean only agencies that Congress has not yet funded would have to reduce or cease functions. In this case, payment to active duty troops, air traffic controllers and border patrol agents could all be affected.

Rep. Dan Bishop, R-N.C., joined 'The Ingraham Angle' to react to a House Judiciary Committee hearing on gun control. 

The fatal Border Patrol shooting of a man who the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says was armed with a 9mm pistol during a confrontation with agents on Saturday has sparked a clash among gun rights groups, pitting defenses of lawful carry and protest rights against warnings about escalating anti-law-enforcement rhetoric.

Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident, was shot Saturday morning while allegedly protesting an immigration enforcement operation targeting an illegal immigrant with a criminal record.

DHS officials say Pretti approached Border Patrol agents while armed with a handgun and ""violently resisted"" when they attempted to disarm him, leading to the shooting.

State officials said Pretti, who was pronounced dead at the scene, had a lawful Permit to Carry (PTC), and court records obtained by Fox News Digital indicate he did not have a criminal record.

The Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus quickly responded to the shooting, calling it ""deeply concerning.""

""According to local officials, the man was legally armed, a firearm was recovered at the scene, and he is believed to have been a lawful gun owner and permit to carry holder,"" the organization wrote in a statement. 

They added many critical facts remain unknown, as the shooting happened just hours earlier.

MINNESOTA POLICE CHIEFS ALLEGE SOME ICE AGENTS RACIALLY PROFILED US CITIZENS, INCLUDING OFF-DUTY OFFICERS

""We do not yet have an independent account of what initiated the encounter or what triggered the use of deadly force,"" the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus wrote. ""Despite widespread speculation regarding intent, there has been no evidence produced indicating an intent to harm the officers. We are calling for a full and transparent investigation by both state and federal authorities. 

""Every peaceable Minnesotan has the right to keep and bear arms—including while attending protests, acting as observers, or exercising their First Amendment rights. These rights do not disappear when someone is lawfully armed, and they must be respected and protected at all times.""

Contrasting Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus' response, the National Rifle Association (NRA) released a statement on social media blaming Democrat leaders in the blue state for ""incit[ing] violence"" against law enforcement officers, and pleading with Minnesotans to lower the temperature amid ongoing unrest.

NOEM SAYS MINNEAPOLIS SUSPECT COMMITTED ‘DOMESTIC TERRORISM,' ACCUSES WALZ, FREY OF INCITING VIOLENCE

""For months, radical progressive politicians like [Minnesota Gov.] Tim Walz have incited violence against law enforcement officers who are simply trying to do their jobs,"" the NRA wrote in an X post. ""Unsurprisingly, these calls to dangerously interject oneself into legitimate law-enforcement activities have ended in violence, tragically resulting in injuries and fatalities.""

The NRA noted that as with any officer-involved shooting, there will be ""a robust and comprehensive investigation that takes place to determine if the use of force was justified.""

""As we await these facts and gain a clearer understanding, we urge the political voices to lower the temperature to ensure their constituents and law enforcement officers stay safe,"" NRA officials wrote.

Fox News host Kayleigh McEnany discusses Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's memoir and new details about former Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign on ‘America's Newsroom.'

When Kamala Harris wrote in her memoir ""107 Days"" that Pennsylvania governor – and fellow Democrat – Josh Shapiro insisted on being ""in the room for every decision"" if he were to become vice president, an angry Shapiro characterized her account as ""bullsh--"" and ""blatant lies."" But Shapiro's own forthcoming memoir demonstrates that he is not done getting back at Harris. His book includes the explosive and damaging tale that in the Harris team's hostile vice-presidential vetting process, Shapiro was asked if he had ever been an Israeli agent, bringing to mind the ugly association of Jews and dual loyalty.

The story is harmful to Harris in a number of ways. It reinforces the existing impression that she and her team were clumsy, but also adds the dimension that they may have been antisemitic. Indeed, even Joe Biden's former envoys on antisemitism have denounced the Harris team's questioning as ""horrifying."" Shapiro's devastating tale is a reminder of Harris' failure to understand a basic rule of life in the political big leagues: Don't dish it out in your memoirs and get caught unawares when your targets respond.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's new memoir hits back at Kamala Harris of claims in her book ""107 Days."" (Valerie Plesch/Bloomberg via Getty Images; Mario Tama/Getty Images)

In the modern, staff memoir-writing era, there have been numerous instances of aggrieved officials hitting back hard against memoirs that attacked people ostensibly on the same political team. A great example of this kind of revenge happened in the wake of Arthur Schlesinger's Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir of his time in the Kennedy administration, ""A Thousand Days."" Some in the Kennedy camp were annoyed with Schlesinger's account, including former first lady Jackie Kennedy, who told Schlesinger that he had gotten ""too personal"" with some of his revelations. Even more irked was Kennedy's secretary of state, Dean Rusk. Schlesinger wrote that Kennedy had been thinking of firing Rusk and that the ""Buddha-like"" Rusk would say little in White House meetings. Rusk, who was still the secretary of state for Lyndon Johnson when the book came out, let it be known that he was only silent around Schlesinger because Schlesinger was a notorious gossip on the Georgetown cocktail party circuit. 

Sometimes, responses to a book can be less ad hoc and more systematic. Charlie Kolb, a domestic policy aide to President George H.W. Bush, wrote a critical memoir called ""White House Daze,"" which came out in 1993, after Bush had lost to Bill Clinton. The memoir was particularly harsh on Kolb's boss, Roger Porter, as well as Bush's Office of Management and Budget Director Dick Darman, with whom Kolb had clashed in the White House. Bush staffer Tom Scully, who had been an aide to Darman, dismissed the very idea of Kolb having had the access for writing a revealing book, saying, ""Charlie was so cut out of everything that for him to be in a position to write a book was a joke."" Scully was not alone in being unhappy with Kolb, as the Bush alumni collectively froze Kolb out. In 1999, years after the administration ended, Scully – who had endorsed Kolb's hiring to begin with – recounted that ""Nobody's talked to Charlie in seven years that I know of. He's the most unpopular guy as a result of that book.""

Unlike the Kolb book, George Stephanopoulos' ""All Too Human"" came out while President Clinton was still in office. Stephanopoulos' revealing memoir called out the sitting president's behavior in the Monica Lewinsky affair as ""stupid, selfish, and self-destructive."" Clinton staffers responded to Stephanopoulos' best-selling book both on and off the record. Anonymous aides called Stephanopoulos a ""backstabber"" and an ""ingrate."" Clinton ally Mandy Grunwald also sniped that if Clinton hadn't given him the ""opportunity of a lifetime,"" he wouldn't have become a ""multimillion-dollar book writer and commentator.""

KAMALA HARRIS DISPARAGES WASHINGTON POST, LA TIMES OVER NON-ENDORSEMENTS IN 2024

Another damaging memoir that came out during an administration was Scott McLellan's ""What Happened."" McLellan made a number of criticisms of President George W. Bush, writing that Bush ""convinces himself to believe what suits his needs at the moment,"" and that he engaged in ""self-deception."" McLellan also called the invasion of Iraq a ""serious strategic blunder,"" and claimed that the Bush White House made ""a decision to turn away from candor and honesty when those qualities were most needed.""

The Bush White House responded with a seemingly organized effort to dismiss McLellan's book.

After the memoir came out, multiple Bush allies criticized McLellan with similarly crafted talking points. Senior Adviser Karl Rove said, ""This doesn't sound like Scott. It really doesn't. Not the Scott McClellan I've known for a long time.""

These types of pushback are, of course, fair game from those targeted in a negative memoir. John Bolton probably expected President Trump to criticize him and even call him a ""liar"" following Bolton's critical memoir of his time in the first Trump administration, ""The Room Where It Happened."" He probably did not expect Trump's second term, in which Bolton is being investigated for misuse of classified information, an investigation that probably would not have happened but for the book.

Memoir writers do not have to take people on by name, as Harris did to Shapiro. Sometimes memoirists call out anonymous antagonists. Examples of this include John Podhoretz, who created composite characters in his George H.W. Bush book ""Hell of a Ride,"" and Condoleezza Rice, whose memoir of the George W. Bush years, ""No Higher Honor,"" is replete with over 20 uses of anonymous characters. This could be a way to spare someone's feelings, but it could also minimize the odds of someone taking revenge. When someone is criticized by name, as Shapiro was, the odds of blowback are much higher, as Harris has now learned.

Memoirs are part of the game, but Harris should have known that taking on a savvy player like Shapiro was not without cost. If she had paid more attention to history, she might have been aware of the risks she was taking in calling out Shapiro. Her lack of awareness of what other politicos have done in response to poor memoir depictions is just one more sign of her lack of aptitude for politics – and left her vulnerable to Shapiro's revenge.

Senate Democrats have threatened to block the passage of the appropriations bill funding the government after the deadly shooting involving U.S. Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis on Saturday.

In a statement on Saturday night, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) vowed a blockade against the legislation if the funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security is not in some way amended, now calling it “woefully inadequate” after a 37-year-old man was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent during an immigration operation.

“What's happening in Minnesota is appalling — and unacceptable in any American city. Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill, but because of Republicans' refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE. I will vote no. Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included,” he said.

Another government shutdown now looms large, with senators staring down a Jan. 30 deadline to pass the remaining funding bills. Republicans will needs some Democrats' support given the 60-vote threshold to pass the bill and their small majority.

The DHS bill narrowly passed the House last week, as Democrats battled over how to address recent incidents involving U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, including the officer-involved shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month.

Now, the Senate is poised to grapple with the same question after 37-year-old Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol agent while briefly intervening in an immigration operation.

WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE FATAL SHOOTING INVOLVING BORDER PATROL IN MINNESOTA

Some Senate Democrats, including Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) and Jack Reed (D-RI), suggested dropping the bill entirely and instead pass the other five remaining bills. Others, like Sens. Brian Schatz (D-HI) and Jacky Rosen (D-NV), have pitched vague “controls” and “guardrails” to “hold ICE accountable.”

While a unified strategy has not yet taken shape, Senate Democrats will reportedly huddle on Sunday evening to discuss strategy ahead of what is a likely shutdown fight.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Tensions have now reached a boiling point in Minneapolis after a 37-year-old man was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol agent during a physical altercation, the second fatal shooting involving federal law enforcement in the city this month.

Here's what we know about the shooting in Minneapolis on Saturday.

The Department of the Homeland Security said Border Patrol agents were attempting to make an arrest shortly after 9 a.m. in south Minneapolis on Saturday. During that “targeted” operation “against an illegal alien wanted for violent assault,” the agents were approached by a man, identified as 37-year-old Alex Pretti, armed with a “9 mm semi-automatic handgun.”

DHS said federal agents attempted to disarm Pretti, but he “violently resisted.” One agent, “fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers,” then fired “defensive shots” at Pretti, who died at the scene.

DHS added that Pretti had two gun magazines on him but no identification, concluding that “this looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem later said state Democratic lawmakers were to blame for the increased tensions, while President Donald Trump similarly accused both Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey of “inciting Insurrection” with “their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric” against federal immigration officers.

Footage reviewed by the Washington Examiner casts some doubt on the Trump administration's characterization of the shooting.

Video shows a federal agent being approached by a woman, who is then pushed to the ground. Pretti, holding just his cell phone, briefly intervenes, before being pepper-sprayed by the agent. A scrum then ensues, as at least five other agents attempt to subdue Pretti.

While on the ground, one agent notices Pretti's weapon and appears to remove it from his waistband and away from the scene. Seconds later, one agent pulls out his gun and points it at Pretti, with multiple shots then ringing out.

The victim of the shooting was identified as 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a U.S. citizen with no criminal background and a valid gun permit, according to Minnesota police chief Brian O'Hara. While agents had moved to disarm Pretti, open carry of a handgun is legal in Minnesota with a permit.

Pretti had worked as an ICU nurse for the Veterans Affairs healthcare system in Minneapolis, and was described by his family as “a kindhearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends and also the American veterans whom he cared for.”

“We are heartbroken but also very angry. Alex was a kindhearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends and also the American veterans whom he cared for as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital. Alex wanted to make a difference in this world. Unfortunately he will not be with us to see his impact,” his family said in a statement.

They also disputed the Trump administration's characterization of the shooting, calling their account “reprehensible and disgusting.”

“I do not throw around the hero term lightly. However his last thought and act was to protect a woman. The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting. Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump's murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed. Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man. Thank you,” the statement concluded.

According to the Associated Press, he appeared at protests following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good earlier this month, and was described by family members as upset over Trump's immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.

Following the shooting, Senate Democrats pledged to vote against advancing the appropriations legislation to fund the government if no changes are made to the DHS funding bill.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) made the announcement on Saturday night, calling the shooting “appalling” and pledging a united Democrat front in opposing the legislation if the unchanged DHS bill is included.

“What's happening in Minnesota is appalling — and unacceptable in any American city. Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill, but because of Republicans' refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE. I will vote no. Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included,” he said.

Schumer's statement sets up another shutdown fight just months after the longest in U.S. history. The Senate has until Jan. 30 to pass the appropriations bill or the government will shut down.

Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) has trashed the DHS's account of the shooting, calling it “nonsense” and “lies.”

“What I see with my eyes and what you're going to see with your eyes makes that pretty hard to believe,” he said during a news conference. “I've seen the videos from several angles, and it's sickening.”

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey later pleaded for Trump to end the immigration operation in the city, saying it “has to end.”

“So to President Trump, this is a moment to act like a leader,” he said. “Put Minneapolis, put America first in this moment. Let's achieve peace. Let's end this operation and, I'm telling you, our city will come back. Safety will be restored. We're asking for you to take action now to remove these federal agents.”

The state National Guard was also deployed after being mobilized last weekend due to, at times, violent anti-ICE protests. Their role has so far been limited to implementing a temporary vehicle perimeter near the scene of the shooting.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

By inserting himself into the situation in Minnesota, the secretary of defense is only making things worse.

This story was updated on January 24, 2026, at 8:46pm ET.

The Trump administration has once again immersed the United States in a crisis. The officers who are supposed to be protecting America's borders have again been unleashed on an American city—this time, Minneapolis. The authorities in Minnesota want the Border Patrol and ICE forces to leave; the U.S. government's response has been to continue to allow them to operate without any limits. These agents are now behaving like a roving mob, a riot squad in balaclavas desperately in search of a riot—and for the second time in 17 days, they have killed one of the American citizens protesting their police-state behavior.

Today's victim was a 37-year-old ICU nurse named Alex Pretti, shot multiple times while lying on the ground after taking a beating from government agents.

As if to prove that they can always make a terrible situation worse, Trump-administration officials have made a series of statements; some of them are tasteless and immature, while others challenge the intelligence of anyone who has viewed the multiple videos of the killing. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem claimed that the victim walked up to the agents with the intent to slay several of them. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller posted on X that an “assassin tried to murder federal agents.” Neither of these seems to correspond with the video evidence.

Minneapolis police say Pretti had a firearms permit, and that open carry is legal in the state for permit holders. Video of the incident shows him holding a phone, not a gun. Officers do not seem to have realized he was armed until after they pinned him to the ground, and the video does not show them opening fire until after they have taken away his pistol.

The situation looks bad from every angle, which is probably why administration figures are spinning this moment as hard as possible. But what on earth is the self-styled secretary of war, Pete Hegseth, talking about—and why is he talking at all?

Late this afternoon, Hegseth posted this from his personal account on X:

Thank God for the patriots of @ICEgov — we have your back 100%. You are SAVING the country.

Shame on the leadership of Minnesota — and the lunatics in the street.

ICE > MN

What, exactly, does this mean? (A Pentagon spokesperson said the department had “nothing to provide beyond the Secretary's tweet.”) The leader of the U.S. military is telling the agents of another government department—one of whom is on video pumping at least five bullets into a man who'd already been shot and was lying on his face—that “we have your back.” Does Hegseth intend to protect these men if they are charged by city or state authorities? Or is he itching to get the U.S. military into the streets, to back up ICE's undertrained civilians with professional soldiers and heavier hardware?

Worse, the secretary seems to be implying that the government of Minnesota is an enemy of the United States. “ICE > MN” might mean that ICE is … better than Minnesota? Sovereign over Minnesota? Whatever the intent of this formulation, Hegseth thinks ICE is “saving the country,” apparently from the elected leaders of Minnesota and the “lunatics” in the street. (These “lunatics” are also known as “American citizens.”)

Hegseth has neither the legal authority nor the right—and certainly not the moral standing—to make such claims. Statements by incompetent appointees like Noem are bad enough, but Hegseth committing the United States military to “have the backs” of men who shot to death a citizen lying in the street, before the shooting has even been investigated, is beyond irresponsible. Unfortunately, such recklessness is to be expected from a man, and an administration, that treats any city, state, or government agency not controlled by Trump loyalists as an enemy.

Perhaps Hegseth was only showing off. He is an immature and undisciplined man, and he may be trying to prove that he, too, can say something terrible in the wake of a shocking moment of violence. But the secretary of defense is supposed to be the steward of the American military. He is supposed to keep the armed forces out of all but the most dire civil disturbances; instead, Hegseth is trying to involve them in a lawless mess created by another government department. He is supposed to keep the military professional, ready, and apolitical; instead, Hegseth has identified a bunch of rogue civilians as brothers-in-arms, and promised to protect them. He is supposed to keep the American military ready to fight foreign enemies; instead, Hegseth is lashing out at state officials in Minnesota.

Hegseth's apparent desire to get involved in the Minnesota debacle is dangerous not only to the lives of innocent Americans, but to American democracy itself. The military should not be involved in domestic policing. Cops and border agents and soldiers are different from one another, and they are kept separate in a democracy for good reason. And most important, the Pentagon's top official should not use his office to identify elected leaders who disagree with the president as enemies who will destroy the nation.

Pete Hegseth has one of the most important jobs on the planet, and it carries a world of obligations to the soldiers of the United States, and to the American people. For now, he might consider adding another task to his many duties, one that would be of immense help to the nation and to the armed forces: He should shut up.

His administration is trying to distort the reality of Alex Pretti's killing.

On January 23, 2016, Donald Trump notoriously declared, “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters.” That statement was understood at the time as a metaphorical expression of the depth of Republican voters' commitment to him. Ten years and one day later, his administration's agents shot a disarmed man on the street in full view of the public. Perhaps we should have taken him not only seriously but also literally.

The dynamic Trump observed is that he had created a bond with his supporters that no outside facts could break, even something as blatant as a cold-blooded killing on an American street. And that is the nub of the crisis into which we have plunged over the past decade. All politicians spin and distort to some extent, of course. Trump's innovation was to grasp that, because the conservative movement had trained its devotees to ignore mainstream media and rely completely on information supplied by its own loyalists, his ability to control his supporters' perceptions effectively had no limit. And because his supporters would believe anything, he could do anything.

After Customs and Border Patrol agents shot and killed Alex Pretti in Minneapolis yesterday, the Trump administration immediately branded him a “domestic terrorist.” The specific allegation it employed to support this hyperbolic charge was that, because Pretti was carrying a firearm while filming and then clashing with agents, he intended to massacre federal officers. Even if that were true, it still would not remotely justify the fact that, according to multiple videos of the incident, agents shot Pretti after they had pinned him to the sidewalk and disarmed him.

Until very recently, conservative rhetoric has valorized gun ownership as a bulwark against tyrannical government, to the point of fetishization. Conservatives defended Kyle Rittenhouse as a hero for bringing a rifle to a chaotic protest in Wisconsin during the summer of 2020, as well as armed bands of protesters who marched into state capitol buildings during the COVID lockdowns.

Tyler Austin Harper: Minneapolis is a Second Amendment wake-up call

For Trumpists to infer homicidal intent from the exercise of a right they have fetishized is a Fifth Avenue–level mental reversal. Their view of the Second Amendment turns out to be no different from their view of the First: one whose protections apply exclusively to themselves.

The administration's immediate use of the terrorist label should be understood not just as a hyperbolic accusation of intent but as an umbrella term it applies to political opposition generally. “There is a large and growing movement of leftwing terrorism in this country,” White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has written. “It is well organized and funded. And it is shielded by far-left Democrat judges, prosecutors and attorneys general. The only remedy is to use legitimate state power to dismantle terrorism and terror networks.”

Miller wrote that message in October. His definition of terrorism does not require imputing specific motives to protesters who own a gun or, like Renee Nicole Good, drive a car. He has called forth state power on a scale that is coming to resemble the piecemeal extension of martial law. The more abusive the power of the state, the more angry people will become, which the administration then uses as a pretext to crack down harder.

The administration's allies, not all of whom wish to directly endorse summary executions, have played along with his logic, treating protesters' reaction to the crackdown as though it were its cause.

“For months, radical progressive politicians like Tim Walz have incited violence against law enforcement officers who are simply trying to do their jobs,” the National Rifle Association wrote in a statement yesterday. “Unsurprisingly, these calls to dangerously interject oneself into legitimate law-enforcement activities have ended in violence, tragically resulting in injuries and fatalities.”

Read: The truth about ICE's recruiting push

“The Left is in a cycle of constant self-radicalization—the resistance to ICE creates the predicate for tragedies that are used to justify ever-more resistance and the demand for the de-facto nullification of federal immigration law in Minneapolis,” National Review's editor in chief, Rich Lowry, wrote on X.

In reality, Minnesotans are taking to the streets to warn passersby of ICE's actions and to record them because, as multiple reporters have documented, federal immigration agents appear to be routinely violating the law. Democratic Party leaders in the state have urged residents to record activity in order to produce a record of these acts. That is why Pretti was holding his phone, not his gun, when he intervened to protect a woman being tear-gassed by CBP agents, who then killed him.

The phone, not the gun, is the weapon the administration fears. The phone produces evidence of its agents' misconduct, which is what the administration seems determined to destroy. Officials' insistence that citizens who record agents are provoking violent retribution is a justification for what is becoming a very literal war on truth.

If Trump himself, and not just one of his agents, actually shot somebody on the street, we can guess what would happen. He would call the victim a terrorist. His allies would say the victim had provoked their own death and blame Democrats for inciting the violence. A decade ago, Trump intuited at some level that the end point of his power to command the minds of his followers would be a killing on the street. What was once seen as a joke has attained the status of a prophecy.

Trump's authoritarianism is becoming less subtle — and more vicious.

By this point, you've probably seen the videos — or at least heard about what's in them. They show a man named Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse who is filming ICE activity in Minneapolis, intervening when federal agents assault a woman. In response, the agents grab Pretti, force him to the ground, beat him, and ultimately shoot the defenseless man repeatedly. Pretti was pronounced dead on the scene.

The footage of Pretti's killing, shot from different angles by different bystanders, looks disturbingly similar to scenes in places like Syria and Iran — where people rising up against authoritarian regimes were silenced by baton and bullet. The resonance is especially chilling given the Trump administration's response.

In a well-functioning liberal democracy, acts of official brutality against citizens are taken seriously by public officials. Yet the Trump administration responded almost immediately by smearing Pretti and lionizing his killer. In its statement on the incident, the Department of Homeland Security claimed that Pretti was armed and was “violently resisting” arrest — that the officer who killed the man “fired defensive shots.” Stephen Miller called Pretti “a domestic terrorist [who] tried to assassinate federal law enforcement.”

These are verifiable lies — the same kind of lies deployed against Renee Good when she too was killed by federal agents. While Pretti was indeed armed, carrying a gun openly is legal in Minnesota, and he had a permit to do so. At the beginning of the incident, he is holding a cell phone; at no point does he draw his gun. In fact, independent analysis of the footage confirmed that federal agents had secured Pretti's gun before firing on him.

So it's not only that federal agents kill an American citizen like authoritarian thugs, but their superiors in Washington justified that killing with the kind of bald-faced lie that recalls Tehran and Moscow.

These resonances suggest America is at a grim tipping point. The Trump administration's actions augur an increasingly violent crackdown, one in which they attempt to secure power less by legal manipulation than by application of brutal force.

Such a violent approach is unlikely to succeed in a country like the United States: Our domestic security forces are not equipped for the level of extreme brutality necessary to make it work in the face of growing public outrage.

But how Trump responds to the democratic outpouring in the streets of Minnesota, and the growing unease among even some in his party, will determine just how dark and brutal the next few months will be.

There are two broad routes to turning a previously democratic society into an authoritarian one.

One is subtle and mostly lawful: The executive accrues increasing levels of power through legal shenanigans, and deploys it to make elections become less and less fair over time. The other is brutally overt: bald suspensions of political rights and civil liberties paired with brutal repression of dissenters and disfavored groups. Viktor Orbán's Hungary is an archetypal example of the first; Stalin's Soviet Union a classic case of the second.

The first strategy depends on subtlety, hiding its authoritarian policies behind legal veneers that hide their true nature in order to avoid widespread citizen outrage. The second depends on being brutally, nakedly violent — making a bloody example out of dissenters to show anyone who challenges the state risks the same fate.

These two logics are obviously in tension: It's a lot harder to successfully hide authoritarian intent from most people when your security services are engaging in overt violence. Yet the second Trump administration has attempted both strategies at once. Sometimes, they employ tactics like a nationwide gerrymandering push that fit squarely in the Orbánist playbook; sometimes, they abduct lawful residents and send them to be tortured in El Salvador.

Saturday's developments — and the Minneapolis crackdown more broadly — mark a potentially decisive move in the latter direction.

It is now undeniable that this kind of violence is the direct consequence of sending a paramilitary force to occupy an unwilling city. If the Trump administration wished to avoid the appearance of democratic crisis, they would both change their policy and pursue real accountability for the agents involved.

Pulling back ICE and conducting a real investigation into Pretti's killing would be the more strategic approach if they wished to go the Orbánist route: It would help them maintain the democratic veneer that is so vital to legitimizing subtle power grabs.

But the immediate defense by administration figures of the immigration officers involved in the shooting, without even a credible pretense of mobilizing government resources to conduct an impartial investigation, clearly suggests a doubling down on brazen repression.

In such a context, Stephen Miller's recent comments on global politics — that the “iron laws” of the world mean it is one “that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power” — take on a sinisterly domestic cast.

The Trump administration's most effective moves to consolidate power, like using regulatory power to help the billionaire Ellison family control a growing chunk of the American media, have all followed in Orbán's footsteps. By contrast, the thuggish ICE deployments have done little to repress dissent — and much to inflame public sentiment against the government.

This is true in Minnesota, obviously, but also in Los Angeles, Chicago, DC, and other major cities. In each case, an organizational infrastructure has emerged to oppose the crackdown that didn't exist a year ago. And these activists were winning even prior to Saturday: Trump's poll numbers are plummeting, including on his formerly strong issue of immigration.

Saturday's events are all but certain to accelerate this dynamic.

We've already seen Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, called the killing “incredibly disturbing” and demanded a “full joint federal and state investigation.” Gun rights activists are criticizing attempts to blame Pretti's weapon for his killing. And these are just the cracks inside the ruling coalition; Democrats are on the brink of shutting down the government over ICE killings, and we've yet to see what response nonviolent activists from across the counry put together.

Controlling this level of public resistance by force is unthinkable in the United States. Evidence from history shows that, once mobilized, mass publics don't retreat in the face of isolated incidents of violence. It takes overwhelming amounts of force — something akin to the recent crackdown in Iran, where state security forces killed thousands of protestors in the street to subdue a mass uprising. Barring such butchery, which is difficult even for some hardened authoritarian regimes to pull off, the Trump administration will not be able to force restive Americans to accept their rule.

But their attempts to impose their will by force, however haphazard, already has a body count of at least two in Minneapolis. If they double down on unrestrained ICE occupations of cities, refusing to give an inch in the face of nonviolent public defiance, this kind of scene will play out again and again.

“Extrajudicial killings are not the sign of a strong regime,” the political scientist Paul Musgrave writes. “But they may be the portent of a bloody one.”

This is what we in America now have to prepare for: a hostile government that has lost patience with establishing sufficient control by more subtle means and is now increasingly turning to violent ones.

The surprising embrace of prenuptial agreements by millennials and zoomers, explained.

Prenuptial agreements, long exclusive to celebrities and the ultra-rich, have trickled down to the rest of us.

A 2023 Axios/Harris poll found that half of US adults say they're open to signing a prenup, and that younger people are driving the trend.

Forty-one percent of Gen Z and 47 percent of millennials who are engaged or have been married said they entered a prenup, according to the poll.

There might be several things driving the trend: new apps that make it easier and cheaper to draw up prenups, influencers touting the value of prenups on social media and in podcasts, and young people being more likely to be the children of divorced parents and therefore more realistic about the possibility that their marriage won't last.

The New Yorker staff writer Jennifer Wilson did a deep dive into the world of prenups, speaking to divorce lawyers, married couples, and others to better understand why prenups are growing in popularity. She shared some of her findings with Today, Explained host Noel King.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

What got you thinking and writing about prenups?

I just noticed them all over. You've seen prenups on TV shows like Sex and the City or reality shows like Real Housewives. And in those contexts it makes sense because we're talking about people with a lot of money. The stereotype is that you've got a rich guy and he wants to figure out a way to screw his gold-digging younger partner out of her share of the assets.

But I started seeing prenups appear on shows like Love Is Blind. There was a contestant who worked in HR and she wanted her fiance to sign a prenup, and neither of them really had much money. And I expected the conversation on social media to be sort of making fun of this a little bit. Like, “Come on girl, like, we don't have any money. We've blown it all on avocado toast.” But everyone's saying, “Absolutely, this is just financial hygiene. This is just being responsible.”

All over TikTok, there were these personal finance influencers, often female. There's one who goes by the handle Your Rich BFF, her name's Vivian Tu, and she had a viral video that said, “What's in my prenup and in my purse?“ It was a very cutesy conversation about prenups. And she got a lot of support from people online saying, “Yes, every woman should push for a prenup.”

And also just the numbers of people getting prenups have just risen dramatically. So there was a 2023 Axios/Harris poll that showed that 40 percent of millennials and Gen Z claimed that they had signed a prenup. That number struck a lot of the lawyers I spoke to as way too high, although they all told me that they have seen a big uptick in younger couples asking for prenups. So I just wanted to dig into this phenomenon.

You have laid out what my understanding of a prenup always was, which is, there's a rich guy, he's coming to the marriage with all the money, the woman has no or less money. And so the idea is basically, “I'm going to protect myself from this woman just in case,” a very gendered scenario that I just laid out but, I also think, rooted in some truth. You said it was a woman on Love Is Blind who was like, “I want a prenup,” and she didn't have money. So what are the differences that we're seeing here?

You're right that there is a really big gendered shift. One of the things I researched for this piece are these apps that have just kind of proliferated across the market. Many of their founders are women. One is Hello Prenup. One is called First and that was actually launched by Sheryl Sandberg's former chief of staff at Facebook, a woman named Libby Leffler. And she absolutely has used very much like “lean in” kind of language around prenups.

The same way that Sheryl Sandberg was telling women, “You've got to negotiate your salary,” now her protege is saying, “Well, you should renegotiate your marriage contract. You would never take on a new job without knowing your compensation package. Why would you enter a marriage without the same know-how?”

I think that one thing that's really important here to understand is we're talking about a particular generation, millennials and Gen Z, who are used to thinking about divorce and separation. Twenty-five percent of millennials are the children of divorce or separation. So they're coming to their new relationships with a certain amount of trauma. And so there was a little bit of that, but not nearly as much as you would think. I think that this generation is just a bit more realistic, that “happily ever after” or “until death do we part” are not realistic ways to think about marriage.

When you were learning about the details of people's prenups, what surprised you? What really raised your eyebrows or made you go, “Oh damn, they really thought of something there”?Companies like Hello Prenup, they are offering all sorts of new clauses. So something called a social media image clause, what that does is you can, in your prenup, say for any disparaging content about your ex that you post on social media, you have to pay a financial penalty. And I think that's because we've seen people's careers be affected by information about what happened in their relationship becoming public.

So it's not totally irrational. Millennials are also getting married later. So things like IVF have come up. Hello Prenup also has an embryo clause where you can decide how you want to, for instance, divide embryos in the event of a divorce, and even who's going to pay for storage fees.

Even [with] classic clauses like the infidelity clause, you have to be very particular about how you define infidelity these days. I mean, we're living in an era of ethical non-monogamy. More people are thinking differently about what infidelity is. I interviewed for the piece a divorce lawyer who said that relationships with an AI chatbot, those could conceivably violate an infidelity clause. And she actually said that she's already telling her clients to be careful about how much, for instance, you even divulge to some of these chatbots because she said you can actually subpoena those conversations and they can come up in a divorce, but also in custody.

So you heard all of the arguments for prenups, and I imagine, you found some of them very convincing. What are the arguments against prenups?

I think on one level, it feels like people are giving up on a broader kind of social repair to the way that divorce happens now. It's a privatized solution.

I also think these are really complicated legal documents, and I don't think that everyone knows what they're doing when they press these buttons on an app. For instance, I interviewed a woman who is a theater actress. She does not make a lot of money. She picks up shifts as a cater waiter and at Lululemon, and she married a finance bro, and she insisted on a prenup. She wanted whoever paid the down payment on an apartment or house and covered most of the financials that they would get that property in the event of a divorce. And I thought, what? Why would you do that if you're the lesser-earning partner? And she said, well, what if I book a show? What if I get a movie?

I also think that there's a lot of manifesting that can happen in these prenups. I spoke to a researcher who studied something called the optimism bias, and she said that prenup signers suffer from this. So what does that mean? It means that when someone says, you and your partner, do you think you'll ever get divorced? You're going to say no. And that actually can impact what you get in a prenup, what you think that you want in a prenup, because you might agree to less favorable terms. You might even ask for less favorable terms because you want to show your partner that you're not in it for the money.

I do wonder sometimes what it means to go into the messiness of marriage, thinking so much about “what's mine, what's yours?” I do wonder how that works on a day-to-day basis when you're living complicated lives and things go awry. And life is so unpredictable and I felt really often that the people I was interviewing knew that and they were almost using the prenup to create some certainty.

It's been more than eight years since the last nuclear explosion. How long will the pause last?

The post-war international order may be tearing apart at the seams and international law is increasingly looking like a polite fiction, but we did just pass one notable milestone of global peace and stability: As of this month, the world has gone the longest time without a nuclear explosion since the atomic era began more than 80 years ago.

The last nuclear test took place in North Korea on September 3, 2017. The previous longest period without a detonation was between May 30, 1998, when Pakistan conducted its last test, and October 9, 2006, when North Korea conducted its first. We reached the new record on January 14, and are now at eight years, four months and 21 days.

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

Though they've only been used in war twice since their creation in 1945, Dylan Spaulding of the Union of Concerned Scientists noted in a recent blog post that “at least eight countries have detonated more than 2,000 nuclear weapons” over the years, all in tests. (For a mesmerizing and disturbing visualization of these nuclear tests, I recommend this time-lapse animation by the Japanese artist Isao Hashimoto, which runs to 1998.)

It's difficult for people today to imagine just how constant nuclear detonations were in the first decades after Hiroshima. At the height of the testing era in the late 1950s and early 1960s, dozens of nuclear tests were taking place every year. Most of those tests were done above ground, marked by iconic mushroom clouds.

The detonations were the visible backdrop to rising fears of a civilization-ending nuclear war, which at times seemed not just possible but inevitable. (The Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg, who worked for the national security think tank the Rand Corporation in the late 1950s, wrote in his memoir that he never joined the company's retirement fund, because he assumed the world would end in nuclear holocaust.) Nuclear conflict was a dominant and ever-present theme in global politics, a reality that, for all the geopolitical instability of our current era, most people alive today have never experienced.

In addition to being provocative and destabilizing political acts, these tests have, for decades, been linked to increased rates of cancer, autoimmune disorders and other health conditions among the “downwinders” living near testing sites. The effects may be wider-ranging than that: a report released this week by the NGO Norwegian People's Aid estimated that nuclear testing may have caused as many as 4 million premature deaths from cancer and other conditions.

It was partially out of growing fear of the radioactive effects of these detonations that the world began gradually phasing out testing, starting with the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty that prohibited above-ground detonations. That treaty — the first time global powers agreed to shared limits on nuclear weapons — set the stage for more comprehensive nuclear arms control agreements between the US and Soviet Union.

The end of the Cold War arms race dramatically reduced the pressure for more field experiments involving nukes. One hundred and seventy-eight countries have ratified the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), which prohibits all nuclear testing. The United States signed the treaty under President Bill Clinton but has never formally ratified it. Nonetheless, it has observed a moratorium on testing since its last detonation, conducted underground in Nevada in 1992. The last Russian test was in 1990.

From the earliest days of the nuclear era, scientists questioned whether these tests were necessary at all. After the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, we knew that these weapons worked. Robert Oppenheimer, the “father of the atomic bomb,” declined to attend the first postwar US nuclear test at Bikini Atoll in 1946, writing to President Harry S. Truman that testing wouldn't reveal anything about the bomb that couldn't be deduced from “simple laboratory methods.”

Some nuclear tests, like the record-setting “Tsar Bomba” set off by the Soviet Union — a 50-megaton warhead that was over 3,300 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima — may have been about projecting a powerful image as much as obtaining practical research data.

Those “laboratory methods” have only gotten more sophisticated since then. When the world passed the record on January 14, I happened to be in Los Alamos reporting for a forthcoming story on how the lab that Oppenheimer built is now integrating artificial intelligence into its advanced modeling work, which includes ensuring that America's nuclear weapons will work the way they're supposed to in the hopefully unlikely circumstance that we ever decide to use them.

But there are worrying signs that the pause on tests may not last indefinitely. In October, President Donald Trump called for the US to resume nuclear testing. It's not clear if any work has actually begun to make that happen, and it would probably be years before the US would be ready to test again, but the idea is gaining support amid a new nuclear era in which China is building up its arsenal and Russia is increasing its nuclear saber rattling. Next month, New START, the last remaining nuclear arms control agreement between the United States and Russia, will lapse, and there's little momentum toward replacing it.

Advocates, including the drafters of the conservative Heritage Foundation's “Project 2025,” argue that a return to testing is necessary not so much for technical reasons, but as a demonstration of the credibility of America's nuclear deterrent. But in a recent essay in Foreign Affairs, Siegfried Hecker, former director of Los Alamos National Laboratory, warned that “a return to testing at this time would likely benefit U.S. adversaries more than it would the United States. Worse still, it might rekindle an even greater and broader arms race than in the first few decades of the Cold War.”

We're not there yet, but the recent signs aren't good. In 2023, Vladimir Putin withdrew Russian ratification of the CTBT, citing the US failure to ratify the treaty. US intelligence services have also suggested China may be conducting small nuclear tests, though not at the level that would violate the CTBT.

Put those developments together with Iran's set-back but not abandoned nuclear program and increasing support for nuclear weapons among US allies who are less sure than ever about American security guarantees, and the future of the pause is far from certain.

We were lucky to survive the era of constant nuclear testing, and we're fortunate to still live in a moment where years can go by without a detonation. In many ways, given how dire things looked in the past, it's the ultimate good news story. But it remains to be seen whether we'll maintain that luck.

A second fatal shooting by federal officers in Minneapolis on Saturday has further inflamed tensions in the city.

Immigration agents, in full view of filming protesters, tackled 37-year-old Alex Pretti to the ground before one shot him multiple times. The Minneapolis resident and ICU nurse died at the scene.

The shooting occurred as thousands of protesters converged in downtown Minneapolis to rally against the Department of Homeland Security's Operation Metro Surge, which has flooded Minnesota with ICE agents since December. Tensions have been high since officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good on January 7.

Caught in the middle of all this are the city's small businesses, which are typically grappling with a quiet January.

Dan Marshall, the owner of Mischief Toys in neighboring St. Paul, said he usually spends the month cleaning up after Christmas, painting the walls, and doing his taxes.

This year, though, ""that's not what we're being called to do,"" he said. Marshall co-owns the toy and game store with his wife and daughter.

Instead, he said the store has distributed about 4,000 3D printed whistles, which Minnesotans have been using as an alert and protest system against ICE. Marshall said that the store has also served as a space for the community to come in, relax, and process what they've been seeing.

""Retail feels totally different right now,"" Marshall said. ""It feels like a way of connecting with our community that we haven't really felt before. It's very raw.""

For small business owners in Minnesota, it's been an eventful — and not necessarily lucrative — January, as they instead turn their attention to supporting their communities.

Many businesses also opted into an income hit on January 23, when unions and faith leaders called for a suspension of work, school, and shopping to protest ICE's actions. Local news site Bring Me The News compiled a growing list of over 200 local establishments' social media posts about their plans to participate in the economic blackout day. Some said they planned to donate that day's revenue; others shuttered completely or opened as a free community space.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a January 20 press release, ""Since President Trump took office, DHS has arrested over 10,000 criminal illegal aliens in Minnesota, and we are NOT slowing down. Our law enforcement officers are saving countless American lives."" ICE did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

In a statement, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that the Trump administration's immigration operations ""have resulted in countless dangerous criminal illegals being removed from the streets.""

""Making American communities safer will create an environment in which all businesses can thrive in the long term and their customers can feel safe,"" Jackson said.

Catzen Coffee, a specialty coffee shop with an attached cat lounge, will not be doing business on Friday, but plans to open for those who need a space to hang out — free coffee and cat cuddles included.

Catzen owner Vanessa Beardsley said that the irony of being a business owner and opting out of business for a day never crossed her mind; not making revenue was never part of the calculus.

""We've got to do what we can do right now,"" Beardsley said.

""January always sucks,"" Matt Cole, the owner of Oh Yeah! Cookie Company, said. ""As a business owner, especially in retail business, people spend a lot of money in December and November, and they usually don't spend a lot of money in January. So January is always a month that's hurting — and now it's really hurting.""

National Retail Federation's spending data shows an average drop in retail sales of 17.3% from December to January over the last five years. January through March has also typically seen the lowest average monthly employment for small businesses across the past few years. An analysis from consumer research firm Consumer Edge of credit and debit card data found that spending in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area by households earning under $100,000 has tracked lower than the national average over the four weeks ending January 10.

This year, Cole estimates he's donated around $300 worth of cookies to groups distributing treats to kids who can't go to school amid ICE's presence. He said that if he does make any money right now, he'll donate 10% of his sales. The full-time role he works in addition to his homemade baking business has been keeping him afloat.

Cole isn't the only one pivoting from normal business.

JP Pritchett, the owner of adult store Smitten Kitten in Minneapolis, said that they usually devote January to ramping up for Valentine's Day, which they described as the ""Super Bowl"" for adult stores.

""Typically in January, we're ramping up inventory, getting the store stocked, just getting ready to do commerce,"" Pritchett said. ""But this year, I don't care about that. Nobody cares about that.""

Instead, Pritchett said, ""We stopped all regular business and created a free store inside Smitten Kitten where people could come get food or send a trusted friend or neighbor to come get food, toiletries, lots of diapers, formula, baby wipes — all the things that are really important to sustain life if you're in hiding.""

Marshall, the owner of Mischief Toys, said that after promoting the store's whistle distribution, he received a notice from ICE requesting verification of his workers' employment eligibility. He said that shuttering on the 23rd sends a message ""that our community is much more important than our bottom line,"" which he believes is a positive.

""We'd like to sell toys,"" Marshall said, adding that he'd prefer to spend January cleaning and painting ""because it's so damn cold here,"" but with heightened tensions in the city, ""we're going to step up as much as we can.""

The robotaxi takeover — assuming they take over — will also be a real estate story.

As Waymo, Uber, Tesla, and other competitors race to flood the streets with fully autonomous cars, robotaxi operators will need to find places to park, charge, and maintain their vehicles.

Voltera, a charging infrastructure company based in Palo Alto that has partnered with Alphabet-backed Waymo, is buying up real estate now to prep for the AV boom.

""We need to get shovel-ready assets in the ground,"" Brett Hauser, CEO of Voltera, told Business Insider in an interview. ""You need to buy property in advance of customers.""

The hard part isn't finding an empty parcel of land. Robotaxis serve dense, highly populated regions and are all-electric, which means depots need to be close to customers and near a power grid.

Once the depots are running, there's no guarantee they'll peacefully co-exist with their neighbors.

San Francisco residents previously reported Waymo's incessant nighttime honking at a charging depot, which the robotaxi company had to fix. In December, the city of Santa Monica filed a lawsuit demanding Waymo halt nighttime charging operations after residents complained about the noise and light pollution. Voltera, which manages Waymo's Santa Monica depot, was also included in the suit.

""I fully believe that's going to have a favorable outcome,"" Hauser said of the legal battle.

A spokesperson for Waymo did not respond to a request for comment.

Hauser spoke to Business Insider on how his company is preparing for a rapid influx of robotaxi operations, the challenges behind getting a depot ready for service, and whether the United States' infrastructure is ready for the robotaxi revolution.

The interview was edited for length and clarity.

Tell the readers a little bit about Voltera

Voltera is a developer and operator of charging depots for electric fleets. We've been focusing on the light-duty segment and AVs in particular for the last 12 to 14 months. To date, we have 10 sites operational, mostly geared toward robotaxis — about 400 charging stalls and about 37 megawatts of power. We've got about double that in development right now.

Our approach is to go in and, first of all, buy the real estate. If you control the real estate, you control the timelines. Owning it — and getting the power in a timeline with certainty — is what our customers and the industry need.

I think that is kind of the trickiest part of this.

You've said building charging depots can feel like ""hand-to-hand combat."" Why is that?

It'd be great if there were a national framework for identifying a site, ensuring the zoning is correct, ensuring power is available, and then bringing your construction team in behind it. But every city has its own zoning codes, and what's permissible is going to be different. Every utility has its own process for figuring out where power is available, and what the timeline is to get power, and who pays for it is very different.

It's not only different city to city, but within a city, it can be very different. In Los Angeles, for example, one side of a street could be Department of Water and Power territory, and the other could be Southern California Edison.

The other piece of this is we don't have the luxury of always going to where the power is. Data centers can generally look to where power is available and build there. We have to be in and around urban infill areas because you don't want ""deadhead miles,"" where vehicles aren't carrying a passenger and have to go back to base to charge. The depots need to be in and around where the drop-offs and pickups are happening, and that is not easy to find at the right price point.

So it's really about the orchestration. Any one of those things — finding the real estate, dealing with utility companies — can cause you a problem, so you have to be good at all of it. What works in Los Angeles may not work in Phoenix or Atlanta. The biggest risk is the timeline for getting the power. That's the biggest risk factor in getting these sites out and running.

If we're talking about hundreds of thousands of robotaxis in the next five years, is the US ready for that?

I don't know that we have that capacity today. If companies like Voltera are out there buying properties and entitling them now — and can give a customer a site within 12 months — then it becomes possible. But for a lot of people, perfecting the ability to find sites and bring power takes much longer. Some people can take 36 to 48 months, but depending on power availability and whether substation upgrades are needed, it can take longer.

So I think it's aspirational. We can knock a big piece of that out, but I don't know that you can have purpose-built depots at that scale in that timeframe.

Santa Monica has become a high-profile example of community friction with robotaxi and robotaxi depots. Was that something Voltera anticipated? And does it change Voltera's definition of the right location?

I think that's a very fair question. Let me start by saying that everything was done properly — zoning, permitting, above board, and by the book at this site. A couple of neighbors are frustrated and might remain so, no matter what gets done. I can't get into their head and discuss that.

Community outreach and engagement are important, and we did do that in this case. I think people are, for the first time, experiencing robotaxis: the joys, the benefits, and sometimes some of the challenges.

With Santa Monica, I think we've built a very good site — to code and to spec —and you've got partners willing to do the right things on behalf of the city and residents. I fully believe that's going to have a favorable outcome.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Trump accounts get supercharged by employer matches — some companies offer up to $1,000","https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/25/trump-accounts-employer-matches.html","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 13:35:01 GMT","



Soon, parents and guardians can open a Trump account for their children — and a number of large employers are piling on the incentives to get set up. 

For starters, babies born in 2025 through 2028 may receive a one-time $1,000 contribution from the Department of the Treasury. There are no income requirements, and all U.S. families are eligible for the initial seed money. But, in some cases, that is just the half of it. 

To help fund these savings accounts from the outset, a growing list of companies, including SoFi, Charter Communications, BNY, BlackRock, Investment Company Institute, Robinhood and Charles Schwab, announced they will match the federal $1,000 contribution for employees' children. 

While the goal is to kick-start wealth-building opportunities, experts say employer matches, particularly from firms in the financial services industry, may not help reduce the U.S. racial wealth gap.

""Those are higher income earners, so it's not clear to me how likely that is to help wealth building writ large,"" said Madeline Brown, senior policy associate at the Urban Institute, a Washington-based think tank.

Other funds may also be available, depending on certain criteria. Children 10 or under and born before Jan. 1, 2025, — who wouldn't qualify for the $1,000 initial deposit from the Treasury — could get a $250 contribution thanks to a $6.25 billion pledge made by tech CEO Michael Dell and his wife, Susan. 

Children in Connecticut may qualify for an additional donation from billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio and his wife, Barbara. Philanthropists in other states could follow suit as part of a ""50-state challenge,"" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at a White House press conference last month. 

As it stands, those additional donations are geared toward families who live in a ZIP code where the median income is less than $150,000. 

Trump accounts, also known as Section 530A accounts, were created to encourage early wealth building as part of President Donald Trump's ""big beautiful bill,"" which Congress passed in July.

To open the account, an election must be made on IRS Form 4547, named for Trump's presidential terms. The form also includes a check box for the $1,000 Treasury contribution for children born between 2025 and 2028.   

Form 4547 can be filed separately or with your 2025 tax return as soon as Jan. 26, which marks the official start of the 2026 tax filing season. 

Later in the year, this election can also be made via Trumpaccounts.gov.

Once an account is established, parents, guardians, grandparents and others can contribute up to $5,000 a year in after-tax dollars up until the year before the beneficiary turns 18. The annual contribution limit adjusts for inflation after 2027.

As part of the $5,000 limit, employers can contribute up to $2,500 per worker per year, which won't count as taxable income, according to the IRS. This figure also adjusts for inflation after 2027.

Qualifying charitable organizations and state and local governments can also make contributions that do not count toward the $5,000 limit.

Experts say the additional Trump account contributions could make a difference over time. 

For example, let's say a family receives $1,000 from the Treasury and a $1,000 matching contribution from their employer for a total of $2,000 during their baby's first year.

That account could be worth about $6,800 after 18 years, assuming 7% annual returns, according to certified financial planner Ivory Johnson, founder of Delancey Wealth Management in Washington. He is also a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council.

Many experts encourage families to accept ""free money"" from the Treasury, an employer or other sources. But beyond that, families can also weigh other investing options, such as 529 college savings plans and taxable brokerage accounts, among others, depending on their goals and timeline.

More than 850,000 customers in the U.S. as far west as New Mexico were without electricity ‍and over 10,000 flights were canceled on ‍Sunday during a monster winter storm ‍that paralyzed eastern and southern states with heavy snow and ice.

As snow, freezing rain and dangerously frigid temperatures swept into the eastern two-thirds of the nation on Sunday, the number of power outages continued to rise. As of 10:47 a.m. EST (1547 GMT) on Sunday, more than 850,000 U.S. ‌customers ‌were without electricity, according to PowerOutage.us, with at least 290,000 in Tennessee and ​over 100,000 each in Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana. Other states affected included Kentucky, Georgia, Virginia and Alabama.

More than 10,200 U.S. flights scheduled for Sunday were canceled, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Over 4,000 flights were canceled on Saturday.

Washington, D.C.'s Ronald Reagan National Airport said airlines had canceled all flights at the airport on Sunday.

Delta Air ⁠Lines on Sunday said that it intended to operate on a reduced schedule ""subject to real-time frozen precipitation and afternoon storm conditions.""

The airline had adjusted its schedule on Saturday, with additional cancellations in the morning for Atlanta and along the East Coast, including in Boston and New York City, and said it would move experts from cold-weather hubs to support de-icing and baggage teams at several southern airports.

The National Weather Service's latest forecast for Sunday through Monday morning calls for heavy snow from the Ohio Valley to the Northeast, including up to 18 inches in New England. Much of the Southeast and parts of the Mid-Atlantic are expected to get rain and freezing rain.

Forecasters predicted ""bitterly cold temperatures and dangerously cold wind chills"" from the southern plains to the Northeast in the wake of the storm, bringing ""prolonged hazardous travel and infrastructure impacts.""

Calling the storms ""historic,"" President Donald Trump on Saturday approved federal emergency disaster declarations in South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Indiana, and West Virginia.

""We will continue to monitor, and stay in touch with all States in the path of this storm. Stay Safe, and Stay ‍Warm,"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.

Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have declared weather emergencies, the Department ‌of Homeland Security said. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, at a news conference on Saturday, warned Americans to take precautions.

""It's ⁠going to be very, very cold,"" Noem said. ""So we'd encourage everybody to stock up on fuel, stock up on food, and we will get through this together.""

The Department of Energy on Saturday issued an ‍emergency order authorizing the Electric Reliability Council of Texas to deploy backup generation resources at data centers and other major facilities, aiming to limit blackouts in the state.

On Sunday, the DOE issued an emergency order to authorize grid operator PJM Interconnection to run ""specified resources"" in the mid-Atlantic region, regardless of limits due to state laws or environmental permits. U.S. electric grid operators on Saturday stepped up precautions to avoid rotating blackouts.

Dominion Energy, whose Virginia operations include the largest collection of data centers in the world, said if its ice forecast held, ⁠the winter event could be among the largest ‌to affect the company.

Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said on Sunday her government will take necessary steps against speculative market moves, in the wake of a yen spike that heightened traders' alert over the chance of currency intervention.

Japanese government bonds and the yen have sold off in recent weeks on concern Takaichi's expansionary fiscal policy and the slow pace of interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan could lead to additional debt issuance and too-high inflation.

After sliding near the psychologically important line of 160 to the dollar, the yen jumped suddenly on Friday after the New York Federal Reserve conducted rate checks, a move some traders saw as heightening the chance of joint U.S.-Japan intervention to halt the ailing currency's slide.

""I won't comment on specific market moves,"" Takaichi told a Fuji Television talk show, when asked about the bond selloff and the yen's declines.

""The government will take necessary steps against speculative or very abnormal market moves,"" she said without elaborating. A weak yen has become a source of headaches for Japanese policymakers as it pushes up import costs and broader inflation, hurting households' purchasing power.

Takaichi has compiled a big spending package to cushion the blow from rising living costs and vowed to suspend for two years the 8% sales tax on food, triggering a spike in bond yields that increases the cost of funding Japan's huge public debt.

In the television programme, she said her government will aim to start the two-year tax suspension sometime during the fiscal year beginning in April. 

Takaichi has been under pressure to deal with the bond market rout, which has accelerated with her decision to call a snap election on February 8 to seek a mandate to gear up her expansionary fiscal policies. 

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signalled Washington's displeasure over the repercussions from the rising Japanese yields, saying last week that it was ""very hard to disaggregate the market reaction from what's going on endogenously in Japan."" 

""I've been in touch with my economic counterparts in Japan, and I am sure that they will begin saying the things that will calm the market down,"" Bessent said at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

Since then, Takaichi has stressed that Japan can secure enough funds for the tax suspension without issuing debt.

BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda on Friday signalled the central bank's readiness to work closely with the government to contain sharp rises in yields, including by conducting emergency bond-buying operations.

The market moves are emerging as a key topic of debate in the election.

While most parties are calling for a cut to the consumption tax, several opposition parties have proposed investing the BOJ's holdings of exchange-traded funds and government reserves set aside for currency intervention, and using the proceeds to fund a consumption tax cut.

The BOJ could speed up the selling of ETFs so that the proceeds can be used more quickly to fund government spending, Makoto Hamaguchi, a senior official of the opposition Democratic Party for the People, told a Sunday talk show on public broadcaster NHK.

Takaichi's ruling coalition appears cautious of the idea.

""Using reserves set aside for currency intervention would require selling U.S. Treasuries,"" Takayuki Kobayashi, a senior official of Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), told the NHK programme. ""That could affect markets and cause a lot of problems.""

Alex Saito, a senior official in the LDP's coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party, known as Ishin, pointed to problems that could emerge by tapping the BOJ's ETF holdings to fund a tax cut.

""Tapping BOJ assets risks undermining the central bank's independence, and would be a dangerous step that could further weaken the yen and push up long-term interest rates,"" Saito told NHK.

In September, the BOJ decided on a plan to sell its huge ETF holdings, accumulated during its decade-long stimulus programme, at an annual pace of 330 billion yen ($2.1 billion).

In this article

The head of Airbus has warned staff that the plane maker must be ready to adapt to unsettling new geopolitical risks after facing ""significant"" logistical and financial damage from U.S. protectionism and U.S.-China trade tensions last year.

""The beginning of 2026 is marked by an unprecedented number of crises and by unsettling geopolitical developments. We should proceed in a spirit of solidarity and self-reliance,"" CEO Guillaume Faury said in an internal letter seen by Reuters.

""The industrial landscape in which we operate is sown with difficulties, exacerbated by the confrontation between the U.S. and China."" Airbus declined comment on internal communications.

Faury did not identify geopolitical developments in the memo, which was circulated last week against the backdrop of disunity between Washington and allies over Greenland and the role of NATO. Airbus is a major European defense supplier.

He said multiple trade pressures had already ""caused significant collateral damage, logistically and financially"". 

Last April, U.S. President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs, prompting Chinese restrictions on rare earth exports. Washington later temporarily froze exports of engines and other key components to China, which uses them for its C919 jet. U.S. parts are also needed for Airbus jets assembled in China. 

Aerospace has won a partial reprieve from U.S. tariffs.

Despite trade upheaval, Faury congratulated the group's 160,000 staff for what he termed ""good results"" overall in 2025 without elaborating. Airbus publishes results on February 19.

Airbus Defence and Space ""is now on a much stronger footing thanks to its deeper restructuring,"" he said. Airbus Helicopters is ""remarkably consistent in the strength of its performance"".

Faury said it was ""imperative"" that Airbus learn from its biggest ever recall in November, involving a software upgrade.

Days later, Airbus was forced to cut delivery goals due to flawed fuselage panels but maintained financial goals - due in part, Faury said, to progress on a commercial cost-cutting plan.

""We must be more rigorous in managing our systems and products in general,""

Faury said. The chief executive said post-COVID supply chains had improved but remained a source of disruption.

""Our most serious difficulties have been with the Pratt & Whitney and CFM engines,"" he said. 

Recently retired commercial CEO Christian Scherer said earlier this month that A320-family engines continued to arrive late and singled out Pratt & Whitney, which declined to comment. 

Faury signalled a focus on the bottom line for the rest of this decade, building up a warchest as Airbus and Boeing gird for their next aircraft development battle. 

The 2030s will be dominated by development of an A320 successor to enter service in the ""latter part of the decade"", he said. Boeing is widely expected to follow a similar path, though it has said its near-term priority is reducing debt.

""Achieving profitable growth in the second half of the 2020s is essential: we need to approach this crucial (2030s) period in truly 'Olympic' shape,"" Faury told employees. ""The future of Airbus will depend on our ability to execute this strategy.""

In this article

The Trump administration is taking a 10% stake in USA Rare Earth as part of a $1.6 billion debt-and-equity investment package aimed at helping the company develop a domestic mine and magnet facility, two sources familiar with the deal told Reuters.

The deal and a separate $1 billion private investment will be unveiled on Monday and Oklahoma-based USA Rare Earth will host a morning conference call with investors to discuss the terms, according to one of the sources who was briefed on the plans.

The White House did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. USA Rare Earth declined to comment.

China is the largest global processor of rare earths, a group of 17 minerals used to make a range of electronics and military equipment. The U.S. produces only small volumes of rare earths, which has sparked a push in recent years from Washington to increase output.

USA Rare Earth has been developing a mine in Sierra Blanca, Texas, with Texas Mineral Resources — slated to open by 2028 and which has a magnet manufacturing facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma — that is expected to launch later this year.

As part of the USA Rare Earth investment, Washington will receive 16.1 million shares in the company along with warrants for an additional 17.6 million shares, according to the sources. Both would be priced at $17.17 a share, near where the company's stock traded earlier this month.

The Financial Times first reported on the investment.

The deal is the latest move by the Trump administration to move into the critical minerals space after taking equity stakes last year in MP Materials, Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals.

A senior Trump official said last month that the administration was planning more ""historic deals"" with the U.S. mining sector to increase production of lithium, rare earths and other critical minerals used in national defense, artificial intelligence and other related areas.

USA Rare Earth has hired Cantor Fitzgerald, a financial services firm chaired by Brandon Lutnick, the son of U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, to help with fundraising efforts, one of the sources said.

Building a healthy romantic relationship takes time and intention. Over time, meaningful experiences, personal disclosures and authentic conversations create closeness and intimacy.

To genuinely know someone, you must understand what matters to them — their likes and dislikes, passions, limits — and respecting those traits even when they differ from your own.

In fact, many strong couples come to appreciate differences, recognizing that a person's history, quirks and tendencies are what make them unique. Here are eight phrases couples who are truly close use when talking about each other, and they should be relationship goals for all of us.

Your partner's mistakes aren't yours to carry, and their successes aren't yours to claim. They are their own person living alongside you, not an extension of you.

Similar phrases:

When you really understand your partner, you're not likely to be taken aback by what they say or do. If friends are shocked by a comment or action they make, you might just smile and shrug. 

Similar phrases: 

Everyone has their own quirks, odd habits or routine preferences, from how they drink coffee to how they fold their towels. These are little things that no one else probably knows about them. But if you really know your partner, you notice those details and often find affection in them.

Similar phrases:

Deep knowledge builds trust. When you know your partner, you trust them to act authentically and responsibly, whether you're together or apart.

Similar phrases:

Intimacy means understanding your partner's fundamental ideas, beliefs and principles. Even when you disagree, you can acknowledge what truly matters to them without dismissing or demeaning it.

Similar phrases:

Knowing someone deeply means understanding their fears, vulnerabilities and emotional triggers. When those struggles surface, you respond with empathy rather than judgment or defensiveness.

Similar phrases:

Knowing your partner means accepting that you can't — and shouldn't — try to change who they are, even if it's something you really dislike about them. True growth only happens if they choose it.

Similar phrases:

Even in long-term relationships, there's always more to learn. When couples truly know each other, discovering something new feels like an opportunity to grow, not a threat.

Similar phrases:

Here are a few ways to start:

The answer to real intimacy is simple: You have to understand and choose each other, every day.

The U.S. government is nearing the brink of a partial shutdown by the end of the week after federal immigration agents shot and killed a U.S. citizen in Minnesota on Saturday, the second such incident this month.

The Senate is set to vote this week on a massive House-passed $1.2 trillion package to fund the Department of Homeland Security, along with a wide swath of government, before the Jan. 30 deadline. But the shooting of 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis is now threatening to derail the funding package as a growing chorus of Democrats warns they will oppose it unless funding for the Department of Homeland Security is stripped out. 

""I can't vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances,"" said Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats and helped end last year's 43-day shutdown, on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday.  

""Take up DHS by itself, let's have an honest negotiation, put some guardrails on what's going on, some accountability, and that would solve this problem. We don't have to have a shutdown,"" he said. 

King's comments significantly raise the likelihood of a shutdown over DHS funding by the end of the week. He voted repeatedly to open the government during the last shutdown as his Democratic colleagues pushed for an extension of Obamacare subsidies.

The House of Representatives, which left Washington last week for a pre-scheduled recess after passing the bill, would need to return to approve any changes the Senate makes before the shutdown deadline. It's unclear whether Republicans who control the House can or will do so. 

Meanwhile, Senate Democrats have broadly threatened to tank the funding measure if it includes DHS funding.

""Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in a statement on Saturday night. 

The funding package needs 60 votes to overcome the filibuster and pass the Senate. Republicans hold a 53-47 vote majority in the Senate, meaning Democratic support will be needed to pass the measure. Of the 47, two are independents who caucus with Democrats. 

Some Democrats were already opposed to the funding measure, which, in addition to DHS, includes the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Education, State, and Treasury. 

But Pretti's death is rapidly galvanizing Democratic opposition to the measure. 

""No, I am not voting for this funding,"" said Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. ""Our Republican colleagues have to stand up and stop this.""

The top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, has also said she will oppose the package if it includes DHS funding. Murray warned earlier in the week that the ""suggestion that a shutdown in this moment might curb the lawlessness of this administration is not rooted in reality.""

""Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences,"" Murray said on X Saturday. ""I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands. The DHS bill needs to be split off from the larger funding package before the Senate—Republicans must work with us to do that.""

It's unclear if the Senate can split the DHS portion off from the rest of the funding bill to minimize a partial shutdown. While the House passed the DHS bill separately from the rest of the bills, they were all tied together into one bill to be sent to the Senate, meaning the majority Republicans would need to support splitting the bill up. 

It's still possible that enough Democrats join with Republicans to pass the funding bill and avoid a shutdown. Many of the other agencies in the package are important to Democrats. 

DHS may also be less hindered during a shutdown if it taps the hundreds of billions of dollars that congressional Republicans injected into the agency as part of their ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" law passed last summer. 

But that's far from a guaranteed outcome. Several Democrats who joined with Republicans last year to end a record 43-day government shutdown have warned they will oppose the bill if it includes funding for DHS.

""I will not support the current Homeland Security funding bill,"" said Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., who is one of the Democrats who joined Republicans to end the last shutdown. ""Let's pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans' constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement's essential role to keep us safe.""  

Complicating matters further is a massive snowstorm over Washington, D.C., and wide stretches of the U.S. The Senate canceled votes on Monday due to the storm, shortening an already tight timeline to avoid a shutdown.

Bitcoin slipped below the $88,000 level on Sunday as crypto markets weakened in thin weekend trading, extending a pullback that has weighed on the crypto market over the past week.

BTC traded around $87,800 in U.S. afternoon hours, down roughly 2% over 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. Ether fell toward $2,880, while solana, XRP and cardano each posted losses of between 3% and 5% on the day. Most major tokens remain down sharply on a seven-day basis, reflecting the fragile state of sentiment across the market.

The move caused $224 million in liquidations on bullish bets, led by $68 million on bitcoin-tracked futures and $45 million on ether-based futures. 

Weekend moves are often driven less by fresh information and more by positioning adjustments, particularly after periods of heightened volatility earlier in the week.

Traders are entering the new week on heightened alert for possible intervention in the Japanese yen after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi warned against “abnormal” market moves, comments that followed a sudden reversal in the yen late Friday. 

The currency's sharp rally raised caution across Asian trading desks, even as officials stopped short of confirming any action, per Bloomberg.

Elsewhere, political risk in the U.S. added to an already unsettled backdrop. 

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said his party would block a major spending package unless funding for the Department of Homeland Security is removed, increasing the risk of a partial government shutdown. 

While such standoffs are familiar, they can tighten near-term liquidity conditions and weigh on sentiment across risk assets, particularly during periods of elevated positioning.

The latest dip follows a stretch that saw bitcoin briefly lose the $90,000 handle amid heavy liquidations and broader macro uncertainty. More than $1 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out earlier in the week as traders reduced exposure following sharp moves across currencies and bond markets.

Attention now turns to the week ahead, with investors also looking ahead to a heavy earnings week that includes results from several megacap technology firms. 

The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold rates steady at its upcoming meeting, reinforcing a wait-and-see tone after last year's easing cycle.

Senior Contributor.

01/25 update below. This post was originally published on January 23

Bitcoin has limped into 2026, flailing in the wake of a gold price boom that's catapulted it to an eye-watering $34 trillion market capitalization (triggering predictions of even more gains to come).

The bitcoin price, which plummeted under $100,000 per bitcoin in November, has struggled to regain its early 2025 momentum as Bank Of America's chief executive issues a serious $6 trillion warning.

Now, with bitcoin and crypto primed for an imminent, “massive” shock, bitcoin-backing BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder has become a surprise favorite to be named as U.S. president Donald Trump's pick as Federal Reserve chair.

""I think [bitcoin] will take the place of gold to a large extent? Yeah, I do, because it's so much more functional than passing a bar of gold around,” Rieder, whose odds of being named as the next Fed chair have rocketed to almost 40% this week on the Polymarket prediction platform, told CNBC in 2020, adding, “I think bitcoin is here to stay.”

“Rick Rieder's odds of being next Fed chair have increased dramatically,” Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered Bank, said in emailed comments. ""He will run the economy hot which should help crypto.""

01/25 update: Rick Rieder has continued to climb the odds on the Polymarket and Kalsi prediction platforms to succeed Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, becoming the surprise favorite and topping former Fed governor Kevin Warsh. 

Rieder's odds topped 60% on Polymarket and Kalshi this weekend before dropping back slightly, while the previous front runner Warsh saw his odds fall sharply to around 30%.

“Until an announcement is made by President Trump, any reporting about the Federal Reserve chairman nominations process is pointless speculation,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to the Financial Times.

Speculation over who will take over from Powell at the Fed has fueled bitcoin, crypto and stock market moves over the last year, with traders betting U.S. president Donald Trump's eventual appointee will lock in lower interest rates.

“Bitcoin got off to another weak start … having failed repeatedly to break back and hold above $90,000,” David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments, warning the market is “struggling to sustain upside without fresh catalysts,” and pointing to lower exchange-traded fund (ETF) interest as holding back the market.

“This has been a disappointing two days for crypto bulls who could have reasonably expected bitcoin … to have regained upward strength given the rebound in global equities since Wednesday afternoon.”

Meanwhile, the gold price has continued to outperform on the back of the so-called debasement trade that sees investors opt for scarce assets due to expectations the Fed will cut rates this year and government spending will spiral out of control.

""Expectations for at least two Fed cuts in 2026 continue to undermine the dollar, while concerns over U.S. public finances, political pressure on the Fed, and lingering global risks keep gold well bid on dips,"" Morrison said. 

“Despite short-term overbought signals, gold is on track for a strong weekly gain, and price action suggests pullbacks are being treated as opportunities rather than trend breaks. This is a high-risk trading environment.”

The gold price has soared to $5,000 per ounce, leaving bitcoin and everything else in the dust so far in 2026.

“Gaining nearly 7% since Monday, gold is recording its strongest nominal growth in history and one of its most powerful weeks in terms of momentum,” Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro chief market analyst, said in emailed comments, calling its current level “unthinkable"" just a couple of years ago.

“The rally is driven by geopolitics, fiscal problems, the associated debasement trade, lower rates and capital outflows from other markets,” Kuptsikevich said. 

“When the Fed began tightening monetary policy in 2022, money market fund holdings stood at $5.5 trillion. By the end of 2025, they had increased to $7.7 trillion. As interest rates fall, money will flow into other assets. But to where? Stocks are fundamentally overbought, and bitcoin has fallen out of favour due to declining volatility.”

BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, led a Wall Street bitcoin and crypto adoption charge in 2023, with the company spearheading a campaign to bring a fully-fledged bitcoin exchange-traded fund to market.

BlackRock's bitcoin ETF has rocketed to become one of the fastest growing ETFs of all time following its early 2024 launch, holding almost 800,000 bitcoin worth $70 billion on behalf of investors.

In September last year, Rieder said he thought the bitcoin price is “going to go up,” advising investors to hold bitcoin alongside gold to give them “a little bit of ballast in the portfolio against potential for currency depreciation.”

Fears of further currency depreciation have fueled the so-called debasement trade in recent months, propelling the gold price towards $5,000 per ounce, while investors have also piled into silver.

Trump has teased his decision for current Fed chair Jerome Powell's replacement for almost a year now, throwing out different names and keeping traders guessing.

Trump said Rieder was “very impressive,"" in an interview with CNBC this week. “I'd say we're down to three, but we're down to two. And I can probably tell you, we're down to maybe one, in my mind,” Trump said. 

Former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, who has also been a vocal supporter of bitcoin and crypto, remains the front runner, according to Kalshi and Polymarket contracts, after former favorite Kevin Hassett, Trump's national economic council director, was all but ruled out of the race.

Expectations that interest rates may fall sharply in 2026 once Trump replaces Powell have supported bitcoin, crypto and equity markets in recent months, with Trump repeatedly saying his Fed chair pick will have to promise to heavily cut interest rates.

“Undermining the Fed's independence makes holding the greenback a less attractive safety play,"" Samer Hasn, senior market analyst at XS.com, said via email.

""For the crypto markets, this ""politicized dollar"" narrative serves as a long-term bull case, even if current prices are dipping. If investors lose faith in U.S. government debt and the Fed's autonomy, decentralized assets like bitcoin and ""hard"" assets like gold, which has already seen skyrocketing prices, become the logical hedge against institutional decay.""","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Analyst Says You're Not Bullish Enough On Ethereum","https://www.tradingview.com/news/newsbtc:fd9e8f6a0094b:0-analyst-says-you-re-not-bullish-enough-on-ethereum-what-does-he-mean/","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 01:00:00 GMT","

A growing number of analysts believe Ethereum's current price action is being misunderstood. Although frustration is growing due to Ethereum's inability to hold above $3,000, some technical analysts are quick to point out that the structure forming beneath the surface tells a very different story. According to one analyst, the real risk right now is not being bullish on Ethereum and trying to short in anticipation of a downside breakout.

Higher Lows And A Structure That Keeps Tightening

The analyst's technical view on Ethereum is focused less on short-term momentum and more on the structure developing on the chart, which he argues is even clearer than what is currently visible on Bitcoin's chart.

Notably, Ethereum's price action is carving out a series of higher lows on the daily candlestick timeframe chart to form a tightening triangular pattern since December 2025. This kind of behavior shows that each pullback is being absorbed at progressively higher levels, which is how strong trends reset before continuation.

Ethereum needs to avoid a breakdown below key support zones in order for this trend continuation setup to still be valid. According to the analyst, a dip under $2,860 would begin to weaken the pattern, while a close below $2,780 would invalidate the higher-low structure. 

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,950, which is dangerously close to the lower boundary of this setup. Therefore, some traders will be tempted to short Ethereum at this level, but the analyst called it the dumbest thing to do here.

As long as those levels ($2,860 and $2,780) hold, the analyst sees no technical justification for betting against ETH, especially near the lower boundary of the channel where buyers have repeatedly stepped in. 

If support holds, the next move would be a gradual return to the upper trendline of the channel, which is just below $3,340. A move into that region would bring price back into direct contact with overhead resistance and set the stage for a breakout if buying pressure continues to increase.

The Bigger Picture Behind Ethereum's Price Action

Ethereum is entering 2026 without clear bullish momentum, a reality that has dampened sentiment across the spot and derivatives markets. Spot ETF inflows into Ethereum and Bitcoin have slowed down, and issuers have been highlighted with consistent days of outflows.

Nonetheless, major asset managers are still holding huge amounts of Ethereum and are working on diversifying their activities on Ethereum. BlackRock, for example, filed with the SEC in December to launch a staked Ethereum exchange-traded fund, a move that will bring in more institutional investors into the Ethereum ecosystem.

Speaking of staking, BitMine Technologies recently amped up its ETH staking to over $5.71 billion worth of Ethereum. On-chain data from Arkham Intelligence shows that the firm has staked an additional 171,264, worth $503.2 million, pushing its total stake to over 1.94 million ETH.

Bitcoin (BTC) is hitting cycle highs while Ethereum (ETH) is still far from its last peak, and one prominent Ethereum bull says the divergence is structural, not a failure.

Liquid Capital founder JackYi said on Friday that Ethereum's underperformance in comparison to Bitcoin reflects macro conditions and shifting market structure, rather than weakness in Ethereum's fundamentals. 

On X, JackYi responded to questions about why Ethereum remains nearly 50% below its prior cycle peak while Bitcoin trades roughly 40% above its previous high. He said the current cycle has been shaped by aggressive rate hikes, which limited performance across most crypto assets except Bitcoin.

According to JackYi, past crypto cycles show Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin during easing phases rather than tightening cycles. He said he expects that pattern to re-emerge once monetary conditions shift, adding that Ethereum has historically delivered larger gains during bull markets. 

Ethereum (ETH) was trading at $2938, down by 0.5% over 24 hours. On the other hand, Bitcoin was trading at $88,663, down by 0.9% over 24 hours. On Stocktwits, retail sentiment around Ethereum dropped from ‘bearish' to ‘extremely bearish' territory, but chatter remained at ‘normal' levels over the past day.

Bitcoin reached new all-time highs in October 2025 while most altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH), lagged, but the rebound occurred in quarter three of 2025, when Ethereum rose by 66%, reaching an all-time high of $4,946 in August. 

JackYi said the traditional four-year crypto cycle has weakened due to structural changes, including the rise of stablecoins, shifting crypto policies, and growing institutional participation. He argued that Ethereum benefits most from these changes as the primary settlement layer for stablecoins and on-chain financial services.

He also addressed concerns around prolonged consolidation, saying Ethereum has spent months stabilizing near the $3,000 level. JackYi said he views this range as a base rather than a breakdown, noting that precise market bottoms are only clear in hindsight.

Responding to leverage concerns, JackYi said his positions are structured to withstand volatility, adding that his strategy allows borrowed exposure to be reduced if needed. He said Ethereum remaining above $1,000 would keep his positions “absolutely safe.”

He added that he does not expect his buying activity to influence market direction, describing his approach as positioning rather than price-setting.

Trend Research, backed by Jack Yi, has been one of the largest Digital Asset Companies (DATs) that has invested in Ethereum. Most recently, the firm borrowed $20 million USDT again and then put the money into Binance to buy 6,656 ETH, which were then sent to Aave (AAV). Trend Research owns 651,310 ETH, which is worth about $1.91 billion.Read also: Bitcoin Environmental Debate Intensifies After New Scientist Labels It ‘One Big Disaster'

Bitcoin's underwhelming price performance continued into the weekend, with another dip to $88,000 registered earlier today.

Most altcoins are in the red as well on a 24-hour scale, with ETH solidifying its place below $3,000. XMR has dropped the most from the larger-cap alts.

It was a week ago when the tension between the US and the EU escalated rapidly with new tariff threats and finally some opposition from the bloc. BTC remained still at first and traded above $95,000 during the weekend, but dumped hard on Monday morning when the Asian stock and most futures markets opened.

At first, the $92,000 support remained intact, but the bears were more persistent and continued driving the asset further south. The culmination took place on Wednesday when bitcoin slumped to $87,200, which became a new multi-week low.

Then came a rollercoaster of a trading period with a run toward $90,000, subsequent rejections, and another attempt at that coveted level as Trump took the main stage at Davos and made some controversial remarks. He refuted previous statements that he might use force to take over Greenland, hinted at a potential deal with Denmark, and cancelled the aforementioned tariffs.

However, he threatened a 100% tariff on Canada yesterday if the country signs a big deal with China. BTC failed to decisively reclaim $90,000 and even dipped to $88,000 earlier today before recovering some ground.

It now trades below $89,000, with a market cap of $1.770 trillion. The dominance over the alts is close to 57.5% on CG.

Ethereum fell from over $3,400 to under $3,000 in the past ten days or so, and has been unable to turn that resistance into support since then. BNB is well below $900, while XRP stalls at $1.90. XMR has plunged by over 7% daily to $480. ADA, BCH, DOGE, LINK, HYPE, and XLM are also in the red daily.

CC is among the few larger-cap alts in the green, gaining 5% to almost $0.16. RIVER has rocketed by another 23% and now sits above $60. In contrast, HASH has dumped by 11% to under $0.023.

The total crypto market cap is down by over $40 billion to $3.080 trillion on CG.

Bitcoin price went on a bearish trend last week, dropping from the peak of $96,000 toward a monthly low of $88K. Analysts believe that Bitcoin's recent bearish pullback might be a trigger for an altcoin rally in the coming week. As traders rotate their money into newer altcoins, Solana Mobile Seeker (SKR), Pump.fun, and Official Trump are expected to show bullish momentum this week.

Bitcoin has been facing significant bearish volatility over the last seven days. BTC price dropped from the peak of $96K toward $88K, flashing a 7% drop last week. Coinglass data reveals that Bitcoin continues to face increased liquidation as it triggered over $25 million in total liquidations in 24 hours. Of this, buyers closed nearly $24.5 million worth of positions.

Analysts say that while Bitcoin's drop may not have a major impact on an altcoin rally, it could give a small lift to newer altcoins this week. As a result, the SKR token, PUMP, and TRUMP coins are expected to show a bullish pattern.

SKR token fell below its moving averages after recording over 200% gain last week. Though the price achieved a peak above $0.05 following listings on multiple tier-1 exchanges, it faced sharp selloff later. As of writing, Solana Mobile Seeker trades at $0.028, declining over 15% in the last 24 hours.

The slowdown in the surge of moving averages and the RSI hovering near 50 show no clear edge for either buyers or sellers. However, SKR's drop below EMA20 trend line hints at a bearish control currently. If the price holds below EMA20, sellers could take control, potentially pushing the SKR/USDT pair down to the $0.02 low.

For buyers to regain strength, the price needs to break above $0.035. If that happens, the pair could rise toward $0.05.

Pump.fun is finding support near the $0.0024 level, showing that buyers are stepping in at lower prices. As of writing, PUMP price trades at $0.0026, surging over 5.2% in the last 24 hours.

Any recovery is likely to meet selling pressure around the descending resistance line. If the price drops sharply from that level, it could increase the chances of falling below the $0.00235 support, with the PUMP/USDT pair possibly sliding toward $0.0017.

On the other hand, a move above the resistance line would signal a potential comeback by buyers. In that case, Pump.fun price could rise toward $0.0033, where strong resistance is expected.

TRUMP faced significant drop last week as it touched a low below EMA20 trend line. However, this unlocked strong accumulation around the dip, preparing Official Trump coin for a potential breakout this week. As of writing, TRUMP price trades at $4.88, declining over 0.7% in the last 24 hours.

The price of TRUMP dropped sharply on Monday and closed below the 20-day EMA, suggesting the TRUMP/USDT pair may have reached a short-term peak. If weakness continues, the pair could retrace fully and fall to around $4.4-$4.1.

Buyers face a tough challenge. Any short-term rebound is likely to run into selling pressure near the 20-day EMA. However, buyers are currently accumulating, preparing the TRUMP price to break its consolidation above $5. A close above $5 would be a sign that buyers are regaining control, pushing the price toward $5.7.

BySean Stein Smith,

Contributor.

Crypto volatility continues to define the sector, and the recent spate of articles documenting how President Donald Trump continues to profit from recent investments into an array of crypto activities highlights how political this space remains. On top of the (now usual) intense political discourse that surrounds the sector, even the long-awaited market structure bill (The CLARITY Act) has stalled with significant issues being raised by both the banking lobby and prominent crypto exchanges such as Coinbase. Crypto and crypto investors are not strangers to volatility and headwinds, but it would be reasonable for some level of discouragement to start creeping in as the Davos summit is in full swing.

That said, a headline that has been simmering for significant period (not talking about stablecoins and on-chain payments launched by TradFi) is finally just about ready to come to fruition. The NYSE has recently announced plans to launch a 24/7 blockchain-based tokenized exchange for stocks and ETFs to launch operations later in 2026. Given the speculation around the total potential size of tokenized securities could achieve a market capitalization of $400 billion in 2026, with room to grow further to a multi-trillion size market in the forthcoming years.

Putting more assets on-chain might strike some crypto advocates and investors as less-than-exciting new, but this headline has the potential to shake up the financial markets more than virtually any other crypto development to date.

Although the NYSE is, justifiably so, leading the headlines in the coverage of this news it is a part of the broader aspect of the strategy being undertaken by Intercontinental Exchange, which in turn is (almost surely) spurred forward by similar efforts underway at Nasdaq to support 24/7 trading options for certain products. In addition to the efforts underway at the NYSE, Intercontinental Exchange is also working with banking giants such as BNY and Citi to integrate tokenized deposits to assist with the clearing and money management processes occurring outside of TradFi banking hours.

BNY itself has made significant investments into blockchain and tokenized products, including a real-time blockchain-based auditing tool, a tokenized deposit service, and expanding crypto custody offerings to existing customers. Even as regulation grinds along and policymakers continue to debate crypto, the TradFi sector has continued to move the baton forward to mainstream adoption and utilization.

In another win for the stablecoin sector these assets are positioned to play an important role on the proposed platform. As stablecoins continue to achieve policy and institutional wins and adoption the benefits associated with increased integration of stablecoins into real-world tokenized assets platforms become clear. Since stablecoins are both pegged to fiat currencies and operate on-chain, traders and investors are able to conduct transactions, including cross-border trades using a tool combines the traceability and speed of crypto with the predictability of existing fiat currencies. Following the launch of the NYSE initiative, which will undoubtedly be followed by other efforts, will only increase demand for stablecoins following a year (2025) in which they subset of crypto achieve substantial growth and adoption.

Coupled with the GENIUS Act looking set to take effect more fully potentially as soon as January 2027, 2026 looks like it setting up to be a major year for stablecoin deployments, testing, and onboarding by TradFi institutions in the U.S. and abroad.

One of the largest benefits of the launching of initiatives such as the one put forward by the NYSE is that, be default, bringing on-chain transactions and on-chain assets to the forefront will also inevitably bring great transparency and scrutiny to on-chain initiatives. To obtain SEC approval the proposed exchange initiative must ensure compliance with existing securities laws and investor protection rules. These include custody, reporting and settlement practices that must adhere to the existing, and stringent standards currently in place. As a higher number of TradFi institutions embrace and deploy proprietary blockchain solutions, tokenized assets of all kinds will increasingly become a mainstream option for both retail and institutional investors.

A critical aspect of this transparency and associated compliance will be the need for the multiple ledgers and/or chains that are utilized by the multiple firms that have already launched blockchain-based platforms to obtain seamless integration across these systems. In other words, compliance, attestations, and internal controls will only become more important moving forward.

TradFi continues to lead the push for mainstream crypto adoption, and  invvestors should take notice.  ","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

In a world where money moves faster than ever, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has dropped a bold idea. He sees the future of finance built on  technology. But here's the twist: it's not about Bitcoin. This vision could change how we buy homes, trade stocks, and handle everyday money. Let's dive into what Fink means and why it matters for everyone from big investors to regular folks.

Larry Fink runs BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager. They handle trillions of dollars. When Fink talks finance, people listen. Recently, he shared his thoughts on blockchain in interviews and events. He said real-world assets like property and bonds will live on blockchain. This makes them easy to trade, split, and own 24/7.

Fink calls this tokenization. It's like turning a house into digital shares anyone can buy a piece of. No more slow banks or paperwork. Blockchain makes it fast and clear.

Fink has been clear: “Everything is going to be tokenized.” He sees  as the backbone of future finance. In one talk, he explained how stocks, bonds, and even art could become tokens. These tokens trade instantly on a secure ledger.

But he draws a line at Bitcoin. Fink views Bitcoin as “digital gold.” It's good for storing value but not for daily finance. Bitcoin lacks the speed and features needed for real economy use. Blockchain, on the other hand, powers smart contracts and real asset links.

“The next step for markets is tokenization of securities.” – Larry Fink

Bitcoin started the crypto wave, but it's limited. It handles few transactions per second. Blockchain tech has evolved. Platforms like Ethereum offer scalability and tools for complex deals.

Bitcoin? It's more like gold bars – store it, but don't build with it.

BlackRock isn't just talking. They launched a Bitcoin ETF, pulling in billions. But now, they're deeper into . Their BUIDL fund tokenizes US Treasury bills on Ethereum. It's the first big step for tokenized money markets.

Other players like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs agree. They're testing blockchain for settlements. Fink predicts this will cut costs and errors in global finance.

Imagine buying a share of a skyscraper with your phone app. Or getting loan interest paid instantly. Tokenization makes this real:

This opens doors for billions excluded from finance today.

It's not all smooth. Regulators must catch up. Questions like “Who owns the token?” need answers. Tech hurdles like high fees exist, but layer-2 solutions fix them.

BlackRock works with SEC for rules. Fink pushes for clear laws to speed adoption.

Experts predict $10 trillion in tokenized assets by 2030. BlackRock leads with pilots. If Fink is right, finance shifts from banks to blockchains.

What about Bitcoin? It stays as a hedge, but  steals the show for utility.

Larry Fink's view puts  at finance's heart – not Bitcoin. This means cheaper, faster, fairer money systems. Watch BlackRock and follow tokenization news. The future is here, and it's on chain.

Stay tuned for more on crypto shifts. What do you think of Fink's prediction? Share below!

Coinbase is proactively preparing for a future threatened by quantum computing, today establishing an Independent Advisory Board on Quantum Computing and Blockchain comprised of leading experts from Stanford and the University of Texas at Austin. The move acknowledges the potential for large-scale quantum computers to undermine the cryptographic foundations of blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, demanding preemptive action. “At Coinbase, security is our highest priority, and preparing for future threats, even those many years away, is crucial for our industry,” says Yehuda Lindell, Coinbase Head of Cryptography. The board, featuring researchers like Professor Scott Aaronson and Professor Dan Boneh, will publish position papers and issue recommendations to safeguard the crypto ecosystem against long-term quantum risks, marking a significant step towards bolstering blockchain resilience.

The foundations of modern blockchain security are facing a potential disruption from the rapid development of quantum computing, demanding proactive measures from the cryptocurrency industry. “Preparing for that future requires collaboration across disciplines, rigorous cryptographic research, and proactive planning well before quantum computers become practical,” notes Coinbase, who are establishing an Independent Advisory Board to address this emerging threat. Coinbase is already implementing “product enhancements today,” including updates to Bitcoin address handling and internal key management, to bolster existing protections.

This initiative extends to long-term cryptographic research, specifically advancing support for post-quantum signature schemes like ML-DSA within secure multiparty computation systems. The company's post-quantum roadmap emphasizes independent oversight, with the newly formed Advisory Board tasked to guide both Coinbase and the wider crypto ecosystem. The board's first position paper, due in the coming months, will establish a baseline assessment of quantum risk.

The initiative recognizes that advancements in quantum computing pose a future, yet significant, threat to the cryptographic foundations of digital assets. Justin Drake, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, and Professor Sreeram Kannan, founder of EigenLayer, also contribute their expertise. The board's mandate encompasses publishing position papers and issuing recommendations for safeguarding against long-term quantum risks. This proactive approach complements Coinbase's post-quantum roadmap, including product enhancements and long-term cryptographic research into schemes like ML-DSA.

By bringing together the foremost experts in the world, Coinbase is ensuring that the blockchain ecosystem is prepared, not just reactive.

This initiative acknowledges that while current blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are secure, advancements could “weaken or break” their foundations, according to company statements. The board will publish position papers, issue recommendations, and provide real-time analysis of quantum computing breakthroughs, ensuring proactive guidance for the industry.

Four people were arrested in connection with the theft of digital property certificates, known as NFTs, totaling approximately 1.4 million euros, NOS reported. The suspects are also under investigation for money laundering.

The Zeeland Police Department launched an investigation after receiving a tip about the stolen digital assets. Authorities identified the suspects as two men and a woman from Axel and a woman from Terneuzen. All four suspects were released after questioning, though the investigation remains ongoing.

Earlier this week, police conducted a raid on a home in Axel. Investigators seized digital storage devices, cash, and three vehicles. The property itself was also placed under seizure. 

NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are unique digital certificates linked to artwork, music, or video, providing proof of ownership. These certificates can be stolen through hacking or phishing.

The popularity of NFTs surged a few years ago, with millions of digital works traded in 2021, often for substantial sums. A Malaysian businessman purchased the first-ever tweet posted on March 21, 2006, by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey for nearly 2.5 million euros, marking one of the earliest high-profile NFT transactions.

It has emerged a senior PSNI officer authorised civilian staff to provide an incorrect report to the Information Commissioner (ICO) who initially supported the refusal to respond to enquiries over failures around Jonathan Creswell and how he managed to evade detection for a serious sexual incident in 2016, despite the victim warning he was dangerous.

This matter occurred after he was imprisoned for the horrendous abuse of his previous partner Abi Lyle in 2010 and before the murder of Katie Simpson in 2020.

Creswell was living in Caledon, County Tyrone at the time, travelling daily to an Antrim stable yard where he exposed himself to a female co-worker and threatened her partner.

The couple – who we are calling Sarah and Ian – came to work in the yard from their native Scotland but quickly learned Creswell was “worshipped” and his toxic behaviour was never addressed, allowing it to fester.

Sarah described him boasting of being in jail over Abi and saying his only mistake was “not finishing the bitch off”

She set out Creswell's behaviour in graphic detail which culminated in the grotesque incident of exposure and highly sexualised conduct.

The yard owners had no interest in addressing this which only served to embolden Creswell further.

Ian confronted Creswell who responded with threats to kill and other vile abuse.

Ironically, he threatened to “snap” Ian's neck – something he had a propensity for with his previous victim Abi who was repeatedly strangled and latterly, Katie.

Disgusted by Creswell's vulgarity and lack of action to address it, the couple returned to Scotland, reporting the matter to police in January 2016.

But Creswell was never traced.

Somehow, he discovered police were investigating Sarah and Ian's report and quickly flitted over the Border to his father's home in Donegal.

“I warned the police he was dangerous, but I wasn't believed,” said Sarah.

She maintains if police had acted on her complaint Katie may well still be alive.

“At the very least Creswell would have had some level of monitoring and the exposure charge would have brought sexual offending registration with restrictions and controls.”

After learning of Katie's murder Sarah complained to the Police Ombudsman but this was rejected as PSNI maintained efforts to locate Creswell were unsuccessful as he was believed to be in the Republic of Ireland.

But evidence countering this was presented to the Ombudsman and Sarah's complaint was reopened last year.

Multiple FOI enquiries to PSNI were deemed too expensive to answer and with upfront payment declined, it was clear efforts were underway to shield potentially uncomfortable truths.

Critically, it was rejected enquiries about Gardai contact demonstrated the efforts PSNI were prepared to go to stop disclosure.

By now, unknown to PSNI, the requested information had been obtained through other means tragically confirming no attempt was made to alert Gardai to either detain Creswell or activate safeguarding given the new allegations were sexual and threatening in nature.

But rather than admit this, PSNI contended it would take more than the permitted 18 hours to retrieve the data. which the ICO accepted.

In fact, it took slightly over five minutes.

Further enquires revealed the erroneous response to the ICO was provided by a civilian staff, however given the organisational structure, it required sign-off by a serving officer.

Surprisingly, the PSNI confirmed a Detective Superintendent authorised the response adding the request was handled by two executive civilian staff and police officers ranging in rank from constable to superintendent.

Therefore multiple civilian and serving staff knew on some level that the reason to refuse information was incorrect.

In line with procedures, complaints have been submitted to the Deputy Chief Constable Bobby Singleton around civilian staff while the Detective Superintendent has been referred to the Ombudsman.

The Policing Board have also been informed, and the Chair Mukesh Sharma has written to Chief Constable Jon Boucher who has yet to respond.

The PSNI were asked if an internal investigation is/will be underway are the actions of the Detective Superintendent and the civilian staff considered to be misconduct.

A spokesperson replied: “PSNI will continue to cooperate fully with the ICO, and as is usual procedure, due process will be followed in relation to any complaint received. It would not be appropriate to comment further while proceedings regarding a complaint are ongoing.”","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}","cryptocurrency"

As of January 25, 2026, a seismic shift is brewing in the global financial landscape that could reshape the world order as we know it. The BRICS nations—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—are intensifying efforts to create a unified Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), a move that some experts believe could chip away at the US dollar's long-standing reign as the world's reserve currency. With Bitcoin trading at $88,569 (down 1.05% today, per CoinGecko data), the crypto market is already reflecting investor jitters, as the Fear & Greed Index sits at a chilling 25, signaling ""Extreme Fear."" This development isn't just a headline—it's a potential turning point that could impact everything from international trade to your personal portfolio. What does a BRICS CBDC mean for the future of money, and how might it affect your financial decisions? Let's dive into this unfolding story and uncover the stakes for investors everywhere. For deeper insights, check the AI analysis to stay ahead of the curve.

The BRICS alliance isn't new, but their latest push for a shared CBDC has sent shockwaves through financial markets. Representing over 40% of the world's population and nearly a quarter of global GDP, these nations are no small players. Their combined GDP of $24.5 trillion rivals that of the United States ($25.3 trillion, according to World Bank data), and their foreign exchange reserves—totaling $4.8 trillion—give them significant firepower to challenge the dollar's dominance.

The motivation is clear: reduce dependency on the US dollar, which currently accounts for about 60% of global reserves and over 80% of international trade transactions. A BRICS CBDC could enable direct trade settlements among member nations, bypassing the dollar and potentially weakening its global grip. Recent discussions at BRICS summits have underscored a unified resolve, with China's digital yuan already in pilot stages and Russia pushing for alternatives amid Western sanctions.

Market sentiment, however, remains cautious. The crypto Fear & Greed Index at 25 reflects deep uncertainty, while Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have dipped slightly, failing to emerge as clear safe havens. Stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD-Coin (USDC), pegged to the dollar, remain steady at $0.998525 and $0.999604 respectively, suggesting that trust in dollar-backed assets hasn't yet eroded. But could this be the calm before the storm?

For investors, the rise of a BRICS CBDC isn't just geopolitical noise—it's a signal to reassess your portfolio. If the dollar's dominance wanes, even marginally, the ripple effects could be profound. A reduced demand for dollars in international trade might pressure its value, impacting everything from US Treasury yields to equity markets. For those holding dollar-denominated assets, this could mean potential losses if devaluation occurs.

On the flip side, a BRICS CBDC could open new opportunities. Emerging market currencies and assets tied to BRICS economies might see increased demand as trade within the bloc grows. Cryptocurrencies, often viewed as hedges against fiat instability, could also gain traction if trust in traditional currencies falters—though current market trends suggest hesitation.

The key takeaway? Diversification is more critical than ever. Consider exposure to non-dollar assets, monitor geopolitical developments, and keep an eye on crypto as a potential barometer of risk sentiment. For data-driven guidance, get AI-powered insights to navigate these uncertain waters with confidence.

The US dollar has been the linchpin of global finance since the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1944. Its status grants the US unparalleled economic leverage—think sanctions, control over international payment systems like SWIFT, and the ability to borrow at low rates due to global demand for Treasuries. But for BRICS nations, this dominance feels like a straitjacket.

Russia, for instance, has faced severe economic restrictions due to sanctions, often enforced through dollar-based systems. China, the world's second-largest economy, seeks greater autonomy over its monetary policy without the shadow of US interest rate decisions. India, Brazil, and South Africa, meanwhile, want cheaper trade without the cost of dollar conversions. A CBDC offers a way out—a digital currency that could facilitate direct, cross-border payments within the bloc, slashing costs and sidestepping US influence.

Yet, the dollar isn't going down without a fight. Its strength lies in the depth of US financial markets, the stability (relatively speaking) of its economy, and its role as a safe haven during crises. Even with a staggering $31 trillion in national debt, the dollar remains the default for global trade and reserves. Can a BRICS CBDC truly compete with this entrenched system? The odds seem long, at least in the short term.

Financial experts are split on the implications of a BRICS CBDC. According to a recent Financial Times analysis, some economists argue that a successful digital currency could accelerate “de-dollarization,” especially if major oil exporters within or allied with BRICS begin pricing commodities in the new currency. “If oil trades in a BRICS CBDC, that's a game-changer,” noted a senior analyst at Goldman Sachs in a recent report.

Conversely, others caution against overhyping the threat. JPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou recently stated, “The dollar's network effects are too strong. A BRICS CBDC might carve out a niche, but it won't displace the dollar anytime soon.” Industry leaders echo this sentiment, pointing to the logistical nightmare of coordinating a multi-nation digital currency amid differing political priorities and technological capabilities.

The impact on industries could be uneven. International banking, heavily reliant on dollar transactions, might face margin pressures if trade shifts away from the greenback. Meanwhile, fintech companies specializing in cross-border payments could see a boom if they adapt to a BRICS CBDC framework.

A BRICS CBDC, if widely adopted, could reduce global demand for dollars, particularly in trade among member nations and their partners. This might lead to a gradual depreciation, raising the cost of imports for Americans and potentially stoking inflation. US borrowing costs could also rise if foreign demand for Treasuries weakens, exacerbating the already ballooning national debt burden.

For savvy investors, this uncertainty spells opportunity. Gold, often a refuge during currency turmoil, might see renewed interest—tokenized versions like PAX Gold (PAXG) could be worth monitoring. Cryptocurrencies, despite current bearish sentiment, remain a wildcard; Bitcoin's historical role as “digital gold” could shine if fiat trust erodes. Emerging market equities and bonds tied to BRICS economies might also offer upside as their financial clout grows.

Stablecoins, currently pegged to the dollar, provide a fascinating lens. Their stability (Tether at $0.998525, USD-Coin at $0.999604) suggests lingering faith in the dollar, but a shift in pegs to a BRICS CBDC could signal a tectonic change. To explore these dynamics further, see AI price predictions for key assets in this volatile landscape.

Let's break down the current crypto market as a proxy for investor sentiment amid these macroeconomic shifts. Bitcoin, at $88,569 (down 1.05%), is hovering below key resistance levels, suggesting limited bullish momentum. Ethereum, at $2,936.01 (down 0.64%), mirrors this weakness, with trading volume declining over the past week, per CoinGecko data.

Altcoins paint a similar picture of caution. Binancecoin (BNB) is down 1.40% at $878.84, while Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) have slipped 1.13% and 1.07% to $0.355318 and $1.89, respectively. Solana (SOL) shows relative resilience at $126.36 (down 0.54%), but Monero (XMR) has tanked 5.85% to $488.84, likely due to regulatory headwinds around privacy coins.

Here's a snapshot of key crypto metrics:

Technical indicators like RSI and MACD suggest oversold conditions for Bitcoin, hinting at a potential rebound if sentiment shifts. For a deeper dive into these metrics, view AI signals for Bitcoin.

Looking ahead, the trajectory of a BRICS CBDC hinges on several factors. First, adoption: will non-BRICS nations, especially commodity exporters, embrace it for trade? Second, technology: can the bloc overcome cybersecurity and interoperability challenges to build a trusted system? Third, geopolitics: escalating tensions could either accelerate de-dollarization or reinforce the dollar as a safe haven.

Analysts at the IMF suggest that even a moderately successful BRICS CBDC could reduce dollar usage in global trade by 5-10% over the next decade. While not a collapse, this would still mark a historic shift. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might benefit from any ensuing uncertainty, though current “Extreme Fear” sentiment indicates investors aren't yet ready to bet big on digital assets.

The most likely scenario? A gradual erosion of dollar dominance rather than a dramatic fall. The US economy's fundamentals remain robust, and no alternative currency—digital or otherwise—matches the dollar's liquidity and trust. Still, the BRICS initiative is a wake-up call, signaling a multipolar financial future.

ETH Crypto Chart

A BRICS CBDC refers to a proposed Central Bank Digital Currency developed collectively by the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa). It would be a digital form of fiat currency, backed by central banks, aimed at facilitating trade within the bloc and reducing reliance on the US dollar.

While it poses a potential challenge, most experts believe a complete displacement of the dollar is unlikely in the near term. The dollar's entrenched role in global finance, backed by the US economy's size and stability, provides a strong defense. However, a BRICS CBDC could reduce dollar demand in specific trade corridors.

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could see increased interest if trust in fiat currencies wanes due to geopolitical or economic shifts. However, current market data shows hesitation, with prices trending downward amid “Extreme Fear” sentiment. Stablecoins pegged to the dollar remain stable, reflecting lingering confidence in the greenback.

It's wise to monitor developments around a BRICS CBDC and diversify holdings to mitigate potential risks from dollar depreciation. Consider non-dollar assets, emerging market exposure, and alternative stores of value like gold or crypto. For tailored guidance, get professional AI analysis to inform your strategy.

Key challenges include technological coordination across diverse economies, cybersecurity risks, and balancing privacy with government control. Political disagreements within the bloc could also delay or derail implementation, as could resistance from global financial systems tied to the dollar.

Follow updates from credible financial news sources and track market indicators like the Fear & Greed Index or crypto price movements. Additionally, leverage analytical tools to anticipate trends. For real-time insights, see what the AI predicts about market reactions to these global shifts.

The prospect of a BRICS CBDC is more than a speculative headline—it's a glimpse into a future where the US dollar might not be the sole king of global finance. While a total collapse of the dollar remains unlikely, even a partial shift in trade dynamics could reshape markets, influence asset values, and alter investment strategies. For now, the crypto market's “Extreme Fear” sentiment and stablecoin resilience suggest that investors are watching and waiting, not panicking.

As this story unfolds, staying informed and agile will be your greatest assets. Whether you're eyeing cryptocurrencies, emerging markets, or traditional safe havens, the key is to anticipate change rather than react to it. For a head start, check AI fair value estimates to guide your next move in this complex, ever-shifting landscape.

·

A cryptocurrency specialist has sounded the alarm on dangerous tactics fraudsters use to steal digital assets worth millions from unsuspecting investors across Britain. Recent reports reveal that AI-fueled crypto scams soared 456% between May 2024 and April 2025, so now really is the time to improve your crypto security. 

Muhammad Talha, Lead Analyst at CryptoWinRate, explains how scammers are increasingly using sophisticated schemes to trap cryptocurrency holders, and the steps you can take to prevent them. 

The most basic defense against theft starts with verifying where you trade, Talha says. “Legitimate cryptocurrency exchanges maintain proper registration with financial authorities and display clear contact information,” he said. “Before depositing any funds, check if the platform has appropriate licences from regulatory bodies, such as the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK.”

Hundreds of British investors lost their life savings to fake platforms that disappeared after receiving deposits. Talha highlighted established exchanges with substantial trading volumes and solid user ratings as safer options for anyone buying or selling digital currencies.

“The absence of physical address details or customer service options should raise immediate alarm bells,” he noted. “A simple check can save your entire investment.”

Claims of guaranteed returns ranked high among warning signs in Talha's assessment. “Cryptocurrencies remain highly volatile assets, and no legitimate investment can guarantee specific returns,” says Talha. The analyst spotted promises of fixed high yields with minimal risk discussion as telltale signs of scams targeting newcomers to digital currency markets.

Talha advised traders to reject any opportunity claiming guaranteed profits regardless of market conditions. “If someone guarantees you 20% monthly returns on your crypto investment that person is not being truthful with you. Markets simply do not work that way.”

Keeping access credentials secure forms another critical safety measure. “Your private keys should never be shared with anyone under any circumstances,” Talha warned. “Store them offline in hardware wallets whenever possible.”

The security of cryptocurrency holdings depends completely on protecting private keys from unauthorized access. Many victims reported criminals posing as technical support staff requesting wallet access or seed phrases to “fix” non-existent problems.

Hardware wallets received strong backing from Talha for storing larger cryptocurrency amounts away from online threats. “For smaller amounts consider using reputable mobile wallets with two-factor authentication enabled at minimum,” he advised.

Understanding what you're buying represents an essential protection layer. “Take time to understand the cryptocurrency project before investing your money,” says Talha. “Read the whitepaper, examine the team backgrounds, and check independent code audits.”

The crypto expert stressed investors should grasp basic blockchain concepts before putting money into any digital asset. Sophisticated scams often use technical jargon to mask fraudulent schemes aimed at people unfamiliar with cryptocurrency fundamentals.

His warning left no room for misunderstanding: “If you cannot explain what problem the project solves or how it works, you should not invest in it.”

Strong account protections round out the defense strategy. “Two-factor authentication should be considered the bare minimum security measure for any crypto account,” says the CryptoWinRate expert. He favored authenticator apps over SMS verification that scammers can bypass through SIM swapping attacks.

Strong, unique passwords for each platform remain essential, according to the expert who dismissed typical excuses for password reuse. “Password managers make this easy, so there is no excuse for reusing passwords across different exchanges,” he stated.

Knowledge stands as the best defense against cryptocurrency scams, Talha concluded. “The technology is still new, and scammers exploit knowledge gaps. Taking time to learn the basics will protect your investments far better than chasing quick returns.”

The decentralization of power in the financial world came with the emergence of cryptocurrencies. In traditional finance, the decision-making power was centralized and vested in the government or other regulatory organizations. On the contrary, the power is distributed among all the stakeholders and users in decentralized finance. 

So, what is decentralization in crypto? At its simplest level, decentralization in the context of cryptocurrency refers to the distribution of authority, decision-making, and control across a global network of independent nodes. A decentralized network operates based on predefined protocols and consensus mechanisms.

The architecture of decentralization is such that the larger the number of nodes, the more resilient the network. The authenticity of the decentralized network depends on the larger number of individuals or organizations that control the network, which nullifies the monopoly of one over the others. Moreover, the individual nodes must logically work together to bring the desired effect. 

Decentralization in blockchain technology distributes control and data across a network of independent nodes rather than relying on a central authority. The core mechanism behind decentralization is explained further. Nodes, which are computers running blockchain software, maintain identical copies of the ledger and collectively validate transactions through consensus algorithms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). When a user initiates a transaction, nodes verify its validity, group it into a block, and add it to the chain only after network-wide agreement, preventing unauthorized changes. The communication between the nodes is peer-to-peer; that means nodes communicate directly, eliminating intermediaries and reducing single points of failure. 

Decentralized finance (DeFi) refers to the use of blockchain technology in finance to eliminate intermediaries like banks. It enables peer-to-peer transactions through smart contracts and offers global access to lending, borrowing, and trading.

DeFi operates on public blockchains, ensuring transparency via immutable ledgers and user control through private keys. Smart contracts automate processes, reducing costs and enabling programmable financial products like yield farming. Interoperability allows seamless interactions across protocols, fostering an open ecosystem.

Decentralized finance works through Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs). DEXs, such as Uniswap, allow users to trade digital assets directly from their own crypto wallets. This “non-custodial” approach means you always retain control of your private keys and your funds.

Decentralized finance gives you greater control over your finances through increased security and lower fees. It is the best way to include the unbanked population in the global financial sector. 

To better understand decentralized finance, you should be familiar with how it compares and contrasts with centralized finance. The table below shows the differences between the two. 

The major benefits of decentralization in blockchain technology include high security, transparency, censorship resistance, and higher autonomy to the user. Data is distributed among all nodes, and decision-making takes place with collective consensus, making it impossible for attackers to tamper with the data.

All the transactions that take place on blockchains are recorded on public ledgers and are made visible for all stakeholders. This makes blockchain technology transparent and immutable. Since no centralized entity controls data transfer in blockchain technology, it is censorship-resistant. Users have direct control over their assets and data, and they can bypass traditional gatekeepers like banks. Moreover, transactions become less costly due to the lack of intermediary support. 

Despite the great benefits offered by decentralization, it also poses certain challenges to the users. The key challenges include high energy use, difficult governance for upgrades, regulatory uncertainty, high implementation costs, security risks, and privacy conflicts. 

Scalability comes as an issue in decentralized finance, where currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum often slow down due to network slowdown or high fees. The high energy requirements come with consensus mechanisms like proof-of-work used by Bitcoin. Governance decision-making can be slow, as reaching a consensus among a decentralized community for network changes can be contentious.

Most national regulators are still apprehensive about DeFi and often take measures to curb their free flow. Decentralization, being technology-intensive, will require high-cost implementation. Security risks such as smart contract bugs and 51% attacks and conflicts between the privacy concerns and data recording on public ledgers are also causes of concern. 

Decentralization is a futuristic technology that, when combined with AI, Blockchain, and Web3, will determine the way finance, data transfer, governance, and supply chains will work. With enhanced security, transparency, and autonomy, decentralization makes technology user-friendly. 

Integration with Web3 will bring in helpful changes in the finance, gaming, and healthcare sectors. In the case of integration with AI, AI will automate decentralized governance and data management, while decentralized AI platforms will offer more user-centric, less profit-driven algorithms. Apart from finance, decentralization in blockchain will bring in new forms of business contracts, supply chain transparency (e.g., tracking goods), and digital ownership. Decentralization will boost the overall trust, security, and resilience of technology and make technology user-friendly.

Here is what it means for everyday users","https://www.coindesk.com/news-analysis/2026/01/25/the-big-u-s-crypto-bill-is-on-the-move-here-is-what-it-means-for-everyday-users","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 13:02:50 GMT","

If U.S. laws finally define how federal regulators can touch digital assets, cryptocurrencies will be easier to manage, keep track of and transact in, and more investors will probably get involved, potentially increasing the worth of each token. But a lot has to happen before that's true, and the work to get laws through Congress is at a messy crossroads.

Crypto enthusiasts have long seen themselves as cutting-edge investors, eager to challenge the system and pursue a stake in something outside the mainstream. But what lawmakers are working on now is meant to put crypto very much into the establishment. The distinctions between digital assets and traditional finance would become much narrower, and in some cases, vanish entirely.

Crypto platforms such as Coinbase and Kraken would be registered with federal regulators, who will insist the businesses follow strict rules when handling your assets. Stablecoin issuers such as Circle and Tether would have to follow their own tight regulations akin to banking standards.

In the event of a sweeping new law, your crypto assets are likely to become significantly safer from financial disasters, though much more closely tracked and managed, and you'll be more likely to get help from the government when you have disputes with businesses. If you're among the narrower group that keeps your own custody and uses platforms without human management, your corner of the crypto sector would be subjected to more rules meant to head off criminals.

And if you are accustomed to getting a return on your crypto holdings, such as through a program like Coinbase's USDC Rewards, there's some uncertainty as to what they may look like in the future, depending on how the negotiations go.

So where are we at with this potential law?

If you follow the ins and outs of how the U.S. government wants to treat crypto, you've seen a dizzying array of headlines from the Senate lately. This one piece of legislation carries the fate of crypto activity, but it's at a place in the lawmaking process that tends to surge and ebb like the tides. Efforts in one committee get close to action, then fall apart. Efforts in another committee rise up to take the lead.



Congress has two chambers, the Senate and House of Representatives, and the House has already passed its own Digital Asset Market Clarity Act with overwhelming support. But the House hasn't been the biggest problem area for crypto. The Senate is typically the bottleneck. And in this case, the crypto bill is grinding through two committees that have to sign off before it can steam toward the books as a U.S. law.

A lot of different interested parties have a wide range of preferences for this bill, including both political parties, the White House, the crypto industry and the Wall Street banks who see both benefits and dangerous threats from the sector. For a regular crypto investor, many of these questions might not seem like a big deal either way, but the outcomes have the ability to wreck or enrich various businesses or projects, so intensity is high among the lobbyists and lawmakers in the trenches.

In the end, the law could get punted again. It happened with the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) effort in the previous congressional session. That was the predecessor of today's bill. But the Clarity Act has made it farther than FIT21, and it's still possible that a series of deals and compromises can be struck to get it done.

The checklist goes like this:

The crypto industry has been waiting a long time for those dominoes to fall. But crossing off the last item — a White House signature — won't be the end of the process for the investor. Before all these new rules are able to start turning digital assets into a new node of the U.S. financial system, a bunch of federal agencies have to dig through what Congress sends them.

There's a process to writing regulations that can take months or sometimes even years. If you conduct your crypto business over an exchange like most investors, it's likely you'll start to see the companies comply with expected rules even before they're finished and formally put into place.

As an example, the GENIUS Act governing stablecoins was signed into law by Trump last July. The Treasury Department and its various agencies have begun publishing proposed regulations, but are still awaiting public feedback. None of these proposals has been finalized yet.

In the meantime, while everybody with cryptocurrencies waits to see what's happening with U.S. rules, there probably won't be much drama for most investors. The federal regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, have stopped going after crypto businesses and are trying to cobble together some friendly treatment in the absence of Congress' law.

So, it's likely the situation coasts along a while longer, whether or not the bill passes, without fireworks for most people. The biggest concerns for crypto investors may, in fact, be how to properly file tax returns on their digital asset gains. But that's a different story (and one that promises to bring yet another congressional fight down the road).

Let's say an investor has a house in Switzerland and a beach house in Miami. They're worth, perhaps, $10 million. But what they are really looking for right now is a line of credit for some time on the slopes at St. Moritz, a trip to the Cannes film festival and a few upgrades to the yacht.

In traditional finance, they might be able to approach their bank and use those assets to secure a flexible, short-term loan. However, if a substantial part of the investor's assets is in crypto, it's likely much harder.

And it seems there are a large number of ultra-rich people who made their fortunes in crypto. In 2025 alone, a survey by Henley & Partners found that the global population of crypto millionaires had reached 241,700, up 40% from the previous year. 

So how do these crypto-rich investors use their fortune to supplement their lavish lifestyle? Their traditional bank likely won't even touch crypto, and if selling those crypto assets is out of the question, where do they turn?

This is when a sophisticated decentralized finance (DeFi) lending strategies comes into play, said Jerome de Tychey, the founder of Cometh, a DeFi-for-businesses facilitator that recently became one of the few firms in France to gain a Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) license.

For someone who is crypto native, they could simply take their ether ETH$2,937.59 tokens, add them to a lending platform like Aave and withdraw stablecoins. However, for someone who made their fortune by just buying crypto and watching it grow, and who is not familiar with the DeFi process, it can be bewildering, de Tychey said. 

“This is still a bit too complicated and too sophisticated for the layman, and so it's typically the kind of thing we do to help family offices, for example, who have a good amount of crypto and want a credit line,” he said in an interview at the CfC St Moritz crypto conference.

On a day-to-day basis, wealthy clients often use collateral loans, also known as Lombard loans or Lombard credit, to secure loans against their assets. These are flexible, short-term loans secured by the pledge of assets such as stocks, bonds, or investment portfolios. They allow borrowers to access cash quickly without selling their investments, thereby avoiding capital gains tax and retaining benefits such as dividends.

Typically, these clients have wealth in the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, and their objective is to keep their assets stable while funding their lifestyle and expenses at the lowest rate possible.

De Tychey, who is also the founder of the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC), said his firm adds a DeFi component to the equation that could involve bitcoin BTC$87,807.80 on Aave, USDC on Morpho, or perhaps providing liquidity on ether ETH$2,937.59 to BTC on Uniswap, for example.

Borrowing using crypto assets also offers perks, such as a faster lending process. For example, a loan backed by bitcoin could be processed in as little as 30 seconds on some platforms, whereas a Lombard loan, using traditional assets as collateral, at a private bank might take up to 7 days. 

Also, traditional loans require credit checks and tax returns, while DeFi loans are permissionless (where code is the law and it doesn't care who the borrower is in some platforms), so anonymity is an additional perk for those who seek it. 

It also has some drawbacks. For example, crypto loans depend on counterparty risk and could be more volatile depending on the price of the crypto asset. For example, if the price of a digital asset suddenly drops, the smart contract or code could automatically liquidate a borrower's collateral. 

However, it all comes down to using an investor's crypto asset to secure a loan through a faster, more seamless process, rather than going to a traditional bank, where crypto might not be considered an asset to borrow against. 

Having snagged a MiCA license in France, Cometh is also working on ways to use DeFi strategies for stocks, bonds and derivatives using their identifying International Securities Identification Numbers (ISIN).

To access debt using an account holding Tesla shares, for instance, ISIN-based codes need to be held in a dedicated fund, de Tychey said.

“We are looking at these sorts of approaches done through dedicated private debt products that anyone with a title account can access. So that's a way of doing tokenization but the other way around; it's really a kind of 'tradfi-cation' of DeFi,” de Tychey said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists call for urgent action as dangerous amoebas spread globally","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260124003856.htm","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 08:08:32 GMT","

Environmental and public health researchers are drawing attention to a little-known group of pathogens that may pose a rising global danger: free living amoebae. In a new perspective published in Biocontaminant, the team explains that these microscopic organisms are gaining ground worldwide, driven by climate change, deteriorating water systems, and limited monitoring and detection efforts.

Amoebae are single celled organisms that naturally occur in soil and water. Most are harmless, but certain species can cause severe and sometimes fatal disease. One of the best-known examples is Naegleria fowleri (often referred to as the brain eating amoeba), which can cause a rare but almost always deadly brain infection. Infection can occur when contaminated water enters the nose during activities like swimming.

Why These Amoebae Are So Hard to Control

""What makes these organisms particularly dangerous is their ability to survive conditions that kill many other microbes,"" said corresponding author Longfei Shu of Sun Yat sen University. ""They can tolerate high temperatures, strong disinfectants like chlorine, and even live inside water distribution systems that people assume are safe.""

The researchers also point out that amoebae can act as protective hosts for other disease-causing microbes. Bacteria and viruses can survive inside amoebae, shielded from disinfection processes that would normally eliminate them. This so called Trojan horse effect allows harmful pathogens to persist and spread through drinking water systems and may also play a role in the rise of antibiotic resistance.

Rising global temperatures are expected to make the problem worse by allowing heat loving amoebae to spread into regions where they were once uncommon. Several recent outbreaks linked to recreational water exposure have already increased public concern in multiple countries.

A Call for a One Health Response

The authors urge a coordinated One Health strategy that brings together public health, environmental research, and water management. They emphasize the need for better surveillance, faster and more accurate diagnostic tools, and advanced water treatment technologies to reduce risks before infections occur.

""Amoebae are not just a medical issue or an environmental issue,"" Shu said. ""They sit at the intersection of both, and addressing them requires integrated solutions that protect public health at its source.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A natural aging molecule may help restore memory in Alzheimer's","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260124003829.htm","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 07:25:21 GMT","

Singapore ranks among the countries with the longest life expectancy in the world. Even so, many people spend close to their final ten years coping with poor health. Researchers at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore (NUS Medicine) are working to change that reality by studying whether the biological process of aging itself can be altered to prevent age-related conditions, including Alzheimer's disease.

In a study published in Aging Cell, scientists led by Professor Brian K Kennedy from the Department of Biochemistry and Chair of the Healthy Longevity Translational Research Programme (TRP), NUS Medicine, identified a promising role for calcium alpha-ketoglutarate (CaAKG). This naturally occurring and widely studied metabolite, known for its links to healthy aging, was found to restore key brain functions tied to memory that are disrupted in Alzheimer's disease.

The research set out to determine whether CaAKG could improve synaptic plasticity in the Alzheimer's brain, restore memory-related signaling, protect neurons from early degeneration, and support healthier cognitive aging overall. These findings point toward a shift in medical thinking, opening the door to geroprotective strategies -- treatments that target the biology of aging itself rather than addressing symptoms one disease at a time.

Researchers See New Potential for Alzheimer's Treatment

""Our findings reveal the exciting potential of longevity compounds in addressing Alzheimer's disease,"" said Prof Kennedy. ""The research suggests that safe, natural compounds like CaAKG may one day complement existing approaches to protect the brain and slow memory loss. Because AKG is already present in our bodies, targeting these pathways may offer fewer risks and broader accessibility. Thanks to that, we may have a powerful new strategy to delay cognitive decline and support healthy brain aging.""

The study showed that CaAKG improves how brain cells communicate in Alzheimer's disease models. It helped repair weakened signaling between neurons and restored associative memory, one of the earliest cognitive abilities affected by Alzheimer's. Since AKG levels naturally decline with age, restoring this molecule could be a promising way to support brain health over time and reduce the risk of neurodegenerative disease.

How CaAKG Supports Learning and Brain Health

To uncover how CaAKG produces these effects, the research team examined long-term potentiation (LTP), a process that strengthens connections between neurons and is essential for learning and long-term memory. In Alzheimer's disease, LTP is severely disrupted. The researchers found that CaAKG restored this process to normal levels.

CaAKG also increased autophagy, the brain's internal ""clean-up"" system that removes damaged proteins and helps neurons stay healthy. The molecule acted through a newly identified pathway, improving neuronal flexibility by activating L-type calcium channels and calcium-permeable AMPA receptors, while avoiding NMDA receptors that are often impaired by amyloid buildup.

Importantly, CaAKG restored synaptic tagging and capture, a critical mechanism that allows the brain to link experiences and form associative memories. This suggests the compound may support not only basic memory function but also higher-level learning abilities that tend to decline early in Alzheimer's disease.

Linking Longevity Science to Brain Protection

""Our goal was to determine whether a compound originally explored for extending healthy lifespan could be helpful for Alzheimer's disease,"" said Dr. Sheeja Navakkode, first author of the study and research scientist at Healthy Longevity TRP, NUS Medicine. ""Understanding the cellular mechanisms of how CaAKG improves synaptic plasticity sheds light on new ways to protect memory and slow brain aging.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists twist tiny crystals to control electricity","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260125081138.htm","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 13:49:47 GMT","

Scientists at the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science, along with their collaborators, have developed a technique for building three dimensional nanoscale devices directly from single crystal materials. The method relies on a focused ion beam instrument that can precisely remove material at extremely small scales. Using this approach, the team carved tiny helical structures from a topological magnetic crystal made of cobalt, tin, and sulfur, with the chemical formula Co3Sn2S2. Tests showed that these structures behave like switchable diodes, meaning electric current travels more easily in one direction than the other.

Electronics built with complex three dimensional shapes could be smaller, more efficient, and more powerful than today's flat devices. Despite this potential, researchers have had limited ways to create such structures. Existing fabrication methods often restrict which materials can be used and can compromise the quality of the final device.

Precision Cutting With Focused Ion Beams

In the new study, published in Nature Nanotechnology, the researchers addressed these challenges by using a focused ion beam capable of cutting with sub micron precision. This level of control allows, in principle, the creation of three dimensional devices from nearly any crystalline material. The process resembles sculpting, where material is carefully removed from a solid block until the desired form is achieved.

To demonstrate the capabilities of the method, the team fabricated helical nanodevices from the magnetic crystal Co3Sn2S2. Based on the known properties of this material, they expected the twisted geometry to produce a special diode effect called nonreciprocal electrical transport, driven by the chiral shape at the nanoscale. Experiments confirmed this prediction. Electric current flowed more easily in one direction, and the effect could be reversed by changing the magnetization or switching the handedness of the helix. The researchers also observed the reverse interaction, where strong electrical pulses could flip the magnetization of the structure. Diodes are essential components in modern electronics and are used in AC/DC conversion, signal processing, and LED devices.

How Shape Controls Electron Motion

By comparing helices of different sizes and measuring their behavior at various temperatures, the researchers traced the diode effect to uneven scattering of electrons along the curved, chiral walls of the devices. These findings show that the physical shape of a component can directly influence how electricity moves through it. The results suggest that geometry itself can be used as a design tool, enabling low power, shape engineered components for future memory, logic, and sensing technologies.

According to Max Birch, the first author of the study, ""By treating geometry as a source of symmetry breaking on equal footing with intrinsic material properties, we can engineer electrical nonreciprocity at the device level. Our newly developed focused ion beam nanosculpting method opens up a wide range of studies on how three dimensional and curved device geometries can be used to realize new electronic functions.""

Yoshinori Tokura, who leads the research group, added, ""More broadly, this approach enables device designs that combine topological or strongly correlated electronic states with engineered curvature in the ballistic or hydrodynamic transport regime. The convergence of materials physics and nanofabrication points to functional device architectures with potential impact on memory, logic, and sensing technologies.""

One year into President Donald J. Trump's second term, NASA reports measurable gains across human spaceflight, scientific research, aeronautics, and advanced technology development. Agency officials say these achievements signal the early stages of a renewed period of American leadership in space, supported by defined national priorities and major investment through the Working Families Tax Cut Act.

Since President Trump took office as the 47th President of the United States, NASA has refined its mission in alignment with his national space policy. That direction has emphasized U.S. leadership in space while speeding progress in exploration, scientific discovery, and innovation. With increased focus on human spaceflight, research excellence, and national capability, the agency says its work is advancing with renewed purpose.

Key Space Initiatives Launched During the First Term

NASA's recent momentum builds on actions taken during President Trump's first term. During that period, the United States established the U.S. Space Force, launched the Artemis campaign, and created the Artemis Accords, which now include 60 participating nations and continue to expand. The administration also oversaw the return of American astronauts to space from U.S. soil following the end of the space shuttle program.

With a formal National Space Policy and the Working Family Tax Cut Act now in place, NASA has the guidance, funding, and authority it says are necessary to pursue an ambitious long-term strategy.

Missions, Aircraft, and Expanding Exploration Efforts

During the first year of the President's second term, NASA completed two human spaceflight missions and launched 15 science missions. The agency also successfully test flew a new experimental X-plane. At the same time, work accelerated across a wide range of priorities, including lunar exploration, Earth science, planetary defense, next-generation aeronautics, and technologies intended to support future missions to Mars.

NASA is also preparing for a major upcoming milestone. The agency plans to launch the Artemis II mission, which will send astronauts around the Moon for the first time in more than 50 years. That flight is designed to prepare for a sustained American return to the lunar surface. Agency leaders say these accomplishments reflect a workforce encouraged to move quickly, pursue ambitious goals, and deliver tangible results.

NASA Leadership on Direction and Momentum

""In the first year of this administration, NASA has moved with clarity, purpose, and momentum, advancing President Trump's bold vision for American leadership in space,"" said NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman. ""From strengthening our focus on human spaceflight and preparing for the first deep space exploration by NASA astronauts in more than half a century, to accelerating innovation across science, technology, and national capability, the President has provided the clearest executive direction for NASA since the Kennedy era. President Trump's National Space Policy sharpened our mission, aligned our priorities, and empowered our workforce to move faster and think bigger. Because of that leadership, NASA is confidently delivering on a future of American space superiority for generations to come.""

Plans for the Moon, Science Missions, and Deep Space Technology

NASA officials say the agency is well positioned to continue building on its recent progress. Under President Trump's leadership, American astronauts are expected to return to the Moon by 2028 and begin establishing a long-term human presence supported by a lunar base. NASA will also continue launching science and discovery missions, including bringing the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope into operation before the end of the year.

In support of future deep space exploration, the agency is advancing nuclear power and propulsion technologies designed to expand mission capabilities and enable travel farther into the solar system.

With a clearly defined mission, a motivated workforce, and strong partnerships with industry and international allies, NASA enters the second year of President Trump's second term focused on extending American leadership in space and pursuing discoveries that could shape humanity's future for decades to come.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Ancient people carried a wild potato across the American Southwest","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260125081143.htm","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 14:11:47 GMT","

More than 10,000 years ago, people living in the southwestern United States carried a wild ancestor of the modern potato across long distances. According to a study published January 21, 2026 in the open-access journal PLOS One, this movement likely helped the plant spread beyond its original habitat. The research was led by Lisbeth Louderback of the University of Utah, U.S., along with her colleagues.

The findings suggest that Indigenous communities played an active role in shaping the plant's future. By moving and using this wild potato, they may have begun the earliest stages of domestication while also building a distinctive cultural tradition in the Four Corners region.

The Four Corners Potato and Its Ancient Use

The plant at the center of the study is known as the Four Corners potato (Solanum jamesii). It is a small but hardy and nutritious wild potato that still grows across southwestern North America today, ranging from southern Utah and Colorado into northern Mexico.

To learn how the potato was used in the past, researchers examined ground stone tools from 14 archaeological sites. These sites span a wide stretch of time, from several hundred to many thousands of years old. The tools were tested for tiny starch granules left behind when plants were processed for food.

Stone Tools and Genetic Clues Tell the Story

Starch from the Four Corners potato was identified on tools from nine of the sites. Some of the evidence dates back as far as 10,900 cal BP. Most of these locations sit near the modern northern edge of the potato's range, along the borders of Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico.

Earlier genetic research adds another layer of evidence. Some living populations of the Four Corners potato in this northern area show strong genetic signs that they originated much farther south. This supports the idea that people carried the plant across the region, extending its range north into Utah and Colorado, where it still grows today.

Early Domestication and Living Cultural Traditions

Researchers note that repeated use of a plant and its movement beyond its natural range are both key indicators of early domestication. In this case, those behaviors appear to have begun thousands of years ago.

Even today, the Four Corners potato holds cultural importance for Indigenous communities. Alongside laboratory work, the research team interviewed 15 Navajo (Diné) elders. These conversations confirmed that the wild potato remains known, eaten, and used for spiritual purposes.

Lisbeth Louderback adds: ""By combining new archaeobotanical data and elder interviews with transport patterns identified by genetic sequencing of the Four Corners potato, we have defined an anthropogenic range distinct from its natural distribution. This reveals a unique cultural identity developed by ancient transport of this species -- one that continues into the present day.""

Cynthia Wilson adds: ""The mobility of Indigenous foodways was driven by kinship-based practices across the landscape. Indigenous knowledge holders, especially matrilineal women, held on to these seedlings and stories across generations to sustain ties to ancestral land and foodways.""

Funding: This work was funded by the National Science Foundation (Award BCS-1827414). General funding was also received from Red Butte Garden and the Natural History Museum of Utah.

Astronomers have identified powerful winds of vaporized metals inside a vast cloud that blocked the light of a distant star for almost nine months. The finding was made using the Gemini South telescope in Chile, one half of the International Gemini Observatory, which is partly funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and operated by NSF NOIRLab. The observation offers a rare look at energetic and chaotic activity that can continue shaping planetary systems long after they form.

In September 2024, a star located about 3000 light-years from Earth abruptly dimmed to just one-fortieth of its normal brightness. That dramatic drop persisted until May 2025. The star, known as J0705+0612, closely resembles our Sun, which made the event especially striking to astronomers.

""Stars like the Sun don't just stop shining for no reason,"" says Nadia Zakamska, a professor of astrophysics at Johns Hopkins University. ""So dramatic dimming events like this are very rare.""

Months of Observations Capture a Rare Event

Realizing that this unusual dimming could reveal something important, Zakamska and her colleagues began an extended observing campaign. They used the Gemini South telescope on Cerro Pachón in Chile, along with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5-meter telescope and the 6.5 meter Magellan Telescopes. Their results are described in a paper published in The Astronomical Journal.

By combining new observations with archival data on J0705+0612,[1] the researchers concluded that the star was briefly hidden behind an enormous, slowly drifting cloud of gas and dust. The team estimates that the cloud sits about two billion kilometers (1.2 billion miles) from the star and spans roughly 200 million kilometers (120 million miles) across.

A Massive Companion Holds the Cloud Together

The data suggest that the cloud is not free-floating. Instead, it appears to be gravitationally bound to a second object that orbits the star far from its center. Although the exact nature of this companion remains uncertain, it must be massive enough to keep the cloud intact.

Observations indicate that the object has at least several times the mass of Jupiter, and possibly much more. It could be a giant planet, a brown dwarf, or an extremely low-mass star.

If the object turns out to be a star, the cloud would be considered a circumsecondary disk, meaning a debris disk orbiting the smaller member of a two-star system. If it is a planet, the structure would be classified as a circumplanetary disk. In either scenario, seeing a star temporarily blocked by a disk surrounding a secondary object is extremely uncommon, with only a few known cases.

Probing the Cloud With a Powerful New Instrument

To learn what the cloud is made of, the team turned to Gemini South's newest instrument, the Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph (GHOST). In March 2025, GHOST observed the dimming event for just over two hours, splitting the starlight into a detailed spectrum that reveals the elements within the cloud.

""When I started observing the occultation with spectroscopy, I was hoping to unveil something about the chemical composition of the cloud, as no such measurements had been done before. But the result exceeded all my expectations,"" says Zakamska.

The spectra revealed multiple metals -- elements heavier than helium -- mixed into the gas. Even more striking, the precision of the data allowed the team to track how the gas was moving in three dimensions. This marked the first time scientists have directly measured internal gas motions within a disk orbiting a secondary object such as a planet or a low-mass star.

The measurements show an active and turbulent environment, with winds of gaseous metals including iron and calcium flowing through the cloud.

""The sensitivity of GHOST allowed us to not only detect the gas in this cloud, but to actually measure how it is moving,"" Zakamska says. ""That's something we've never been able to do before in a system like this.""

""This study illustrates the considerable power of Gemini's newest facility instrument, GHOST,"" notes Chris Davis, NSF Program Director for NOIRLab, ""and further highlights one of Gemini's great strengths -- rapidly responding to transient events like this occultation.""

Evidence Points to a Disk in the Outer System

The detailed wind measurements show that the cloud is moving independently of the star itself. Combined with the long duration of the dimming, this confirms that the object blocking the star is a disk surrounding a secondary companion, orbiting in the outer regions of the system.

The star also shows an excess of infrared radiation, which is often linked to disks of material around young stars. However, J0705+0612 is more than two billion years old, making it unlikely that the disk is leftover material from the system's original formation.

A Possible Planetary Collision

So where did the disk come from? Zakamska suggests that it may have formed after a major collision between two planets in the outer part of the system. Such an impact could have blasted out enormous amounts of dust, rock, and gas, creating the massive cloud now seen drifting in front of the star.

Why This Discovery Matters

The findings demonstrate how new instruments are opening fresh ways to study hidden and short-lived phenomena in distant planetary systems. GHOST, in particular, is allowing astronomers to examine structures that were previously impossible to probe in detail.

""This event shows us that even in mature planetary systems, dramatic, large-scale collisions can still occur,"" says Zakamska. ""It's a vivid reminder that the Universe is far from static -- it's an ongoing story of creation, destruction, and transformation.""

Within minutes of Alex Pretti being shot and killed by a federal immigration officer in Minneapolis on Saturday, the Trump administration, backed by right-wing influencers, launched a smear campaign against the victim, labeling him a “terrorist” and a “lunatic.”

Pretti, 37, was killed during a confrontation with multiple federal immigration agents. Pretti was an American citizen and a registered nurse who worked in the Department of Veterans Affairs, according to a colleague who spoke to the Guardian. Video from a bystander shows Pretti was attempting to help a woman who had been pepper sprayed by an immigration agent when officers tackled him.

Pretti's killing comes 17 days after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross shot Renee Nicole Good, a mother of three. Good was also 37 at the time of her death.

Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara said during a press conference on Saturday that information about what had led up to Pretti's fatal confrontation was limited, but at a separate press conference, Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol commander overseeing federal operations in Minneapolis, claimed to have a full assessment of what had taken place.

Bovino claimed Pretti had approached officers with a 9mm handgun, resisted disarmament, and was shot in what he described as a clear act of self-defense. He claimed the man had two loaded magazines and lacked identification, and alleged that Pretti intended to “massacre law enforcement,” while the Border Patrol agent who killed Pretti, he said, had extensive training.

The Department of Homeland Security reiterated Bovino's claims in a post on X that has been viewed over 17 million times at the time of publication, and the narrative was carried unquestioningly by right-wing outlets, like the Post Millenial, which published a story headlined: “Armed agitator Alex Pretti appeared to want 'maximum damage' and to 'massacre' law enforcement when shot by BP in Minnesota.”

Key portions of these claims are contradicted by publicly available evidence.

Multiple videos shared on social media in the moments after the shooting show no indication that Pretti's gun was visible when he was approached by the officers. Analyses by The New York Times and Bellingcat found that Pretti was clearly holding a phone, not a gun, when the federal officers approached him and forced him to the ground.

On Truth Social, President Donald Trump weighed in to blame Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. “The Mayor and the Governor are inciting Insurrection, with their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric,” Trump wrote in a post that included an image of a gun DHS claimed Pretti was carrying at the time he was killed.

Vice President JD Vance backed up Trump's criticism of local leadership, sharing a screenshot of the president's Truth Social post and writing on X: “When I visited Minnesota, what the ICE agents wanted more than anything was to work with local law enforcement so that situations on the ground didn't get out of hand. The local leadership in Minnesota has so far refused to answer those requests.”

Also posting on X, defense secretary Pete Hegseth added to the criticism of Frey and Walz, as well as denigrating the victim: “Shame on the leadership of Minnesota — and the lunatics in the street. ICE > MN.”

Walz, in a press conference, referred to the federal narrative as “nonsense.”

“Minnesota's justice system will have the last word” on Pretti's killing, Walz said, adding, “the federal government cannot be trusted with this investigation.”

Trump's homeland security adviser, Stephen Miller, went further in a pair of posts, labelling Pretti an “assassin” and a “terrorist.”

The Trump administration's smear campaign against the victim was quickly repeated by supporters on social media. Nick Sortor, one of a group of right-wing influencers camped out in Minneapolis to cover ICE's campaign there, falsely referred to Pretti as an “illegal alien” and added that he “was armed with a gun and attempted to PULL IT on agents as he was being apprehended.”

Pretti was a US citizen and born in Illinois, according to family members, who had no criminal record. Sortor's claims are contradicted by video evidence.

Quoting a video of the shooting, Jack Posobiec, a right-wing influencer with close ties to the White House, wrote on X: “It is most certainly illegal to disrupt federal law enforcement operations and doing so while armed is not only unlawful, it is a good way to get shot.”

Minneapolis police chief O'Hara clarified in a press conference that he believed Pretti was “a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.”

Despite the Trump administration's talking points, not everyone on the right was on board. While right-wing podcaster Tim Pool labeled Pretti “a radicalized leftist” in a post on X without providing any evidence, he also disagreed with Bovino's claim about killing multiple law enforcement officers: “There's no reason to think he was trying to massacre LEOs,” Pool wrote, referring to law enforcement officers.

Dave Smith, a comedian who endorsed Trump in 2024, went further, suggesting in an X post that immigration agents' killing of a second US citizen in the space of just over two weeks could be a tipping point for Trump's supporters.

“I'm an immigration restrictionist. I believe that we have the right to remove any and all people who entered our country illegally,” Smith wrote. “Also, ICE is out of fucking control. A bunch of pussies, drunk on power going around intentionally escalating violent interactions and intimidating US citizens.”

From the moment a pixelated Gengar and Nidorino faced off in the opening animation of the first Pokémon games on the original Game Boy back in 1996, the Pokémon franchise has been a perennial favorite of kids and adults alike. With 2026 marking Pokémon's 30th anniversary, Lego's first-ever collaboration with the enduringly popular monster-catching megahit is perfectly timed—a crossover of pop culture titans with just one problem: Anyone who isn't an ultra-fan with cavernously deep pockets isn't invited.

The recent announcement of a line of Lego Pokémon wasn't a surprise—the Danish brick brand first revealed it had entered into a “multi-year partnership” with The Pokémon Company back in March 2025—but the makeup of the range itself was. Despite the mass appeal, Lego is launching with just three sets, and every single one is age-rated 18+. In short, it's exclusively aimed at and priced for the “Adult Fan of Lego” (AFOL) market.

The most affordable set is Eevee, a 587-piece model for $60. Franchise mascot Pikachu takes up the mid-tier, price-wise, with the 2,050-piece Pikachu with Pokéball set, at an MSRP of $200. Lastly, the signature statement piece is a colossal three-in-one set of Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise—the final evolutions of the first game's starter Pokémon—which clocks in at a massive 6,838 pieces for $650.

Beyond the steep prices, all three sets target nostalgic adults by drawing exclusively from the first-generation Pokémon games, and are designed for presentation over play—the assembled models result in display pieces with minimal articulation or posability. It all begs the question—are kids still welcome when it comes to Lego?

Lego being expensive or targeting adult collectors is nothing new—2025's $1,000 Star Wars Death Star hit a lofty new price threshold, while the $400 USS Enterprise-D from Star Trek: The Next Generation—a 38-year-old show—now looks a bargain compared to Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise. Nor is it unusual for Lego's collector sets to be shown off once built, rather than played with—look, but don't touch.

However, Lego's other collaborations with cross-generational charm typically offer something for everyone. The Super Mario range makes for a pertinent comparison here, based on another Nintendo property, with plenty of kid-friendly Mario Kart racers and larger playsets to contrast the collector-grade Mario and Kart or the replica Lego Game Boy. Yet Lego Pokémon has nothing at all for younger builders at launch, nor, at the time of writing, anything announced to reach that audience. Given Pokémon has such broad appeal across age ranges, Lego's decision to exclusively chase the lucrative collector's market is all the more striking—and some experts think it risks undermining the brand's standing as being for everyone.

“Pokémon and Lego have multi-generational fanbases, yet there's no explicit narrative about multigenerational play, which runs counter to Lego's ethos,” says Katriina Heljakka, a senior researcher of toy and play cultures at the University of Turku in Finland. “The new sets emphasize novelty, collectability, and fandom, which aligns with AFOL preferences, but provide little substantive commentary on how people actually play together.”

Playing together is something Lego has been pushing for a while, with a selection of sets that are designed to be built collaboratively using the Lego Builder app's “Build Together” feature. The family-targeted mode splits instructions into smaller parts, so multiple people can build their own sections, then combine for the final build. Yet of the announced Pokémon sets, it's only the smallest, Eevee, that—per the announcement—“presents fans with the ability to build together with friends and family.” Another departure from Lego's universal appeal.

The result, says Heljakka, is that “licensed collectibles risk being perceived as display pieces for solitary play rather than as tools for shared play,” adding that the upcoming sets are “closed-object products that behave more like 3D jigsaw puzzles than platforms for co-play by building together.”

Further cementing the Lego Pokémon range as being for adults only is a pair of collectibles that money literally can't buy. A 233-piece Mini Pokémon Center is only available through the Lego Insiders Club membership scheme, redeemable for 2,500 points accrued through other purchases made on Lego's website or in its stores, while the Kanto Region Badge Collection, a 312-piece “Gift With Purchase” set recreating the eight gym badges players earned in Pokémon Red/Blue, was only available to those who preordered the priciest trio evolutions set directly from Lego.

The scarcity of that badge set in particular has worked in Lego's favor—a desirable set produced in limited quantities, tied exclusively to the most expensive set in the line, propelled the $650 evolutions trio to sell out almost immediately in most territories. Professional Lego YouTuber Bamidele “JANGBRiCKS” calculated that it made Lego $30 million in just 24 hours.

Targeting adult collectors with high price, low quantity goods—let alone unbuyable exclusives—has an unfortunate knock-on effect, though: predatory scalpers. With stock snapped up in moments, resellers are already listing the Kanto badge set alone for upwards of $300 on eBay, long before it's even in hand. Some have the Venusaur/Charizard/Blastoise set and the badges together for $1,500 or more. While Lego has confirmed that some stock of the GWP will be reserved for launch day, even legitimate adult fans wanting the piece for their collections won't be guaranteed to secure a copy.

WIRED reached out to Lego to ask if it employed any strategies to mitigate scalpers; a Lego representative said, “Unfortunately, we're unable to provide comment on this occasion.”

Some of these trends are side effects of the wider toy industry's growth, largely coming from adults. Figures from market research group Circana found that toy sales in the US for the first half of 2025 were up for the first time since 2022, and that “adults continue to drive market growth in toys, with sales increasing by 18 percent for recipients aged 18 and older.”

There's increasing awareness of the benefits of play for adults. Both the National Institute for Play in the US and the British Psychological Society have emphasized this importance, with the NIFP specifically highlighting that “engaging in playful activities helps adults cope with stress and enhances mood,” which appears to be reflected in the toy sales data. But with money on the table, it's little surprise that both the primary and secondary markets have homed in on that demographic to the seemingly growing exclusion of kids.

Also notable was Circana's finding that “every top growth property is connected to licensing, content, or movie releases in some form. Video game properties were dominant among the top 10 gainers, including Pokémon.” It's not that Pokémon fans are uniquely easy marks—legacy brands from Masters of the Universe and Transformers to My Little Pony and Barbie have long targeted the collectors market—but the monetized nostalgia of that particular audience does go some way to explaining Pokémon Trading Card Game cards selling for ridiculous prices, or repeatedly being stolen due to their value to adult collectors.

Adult-driven growth in the toy sector goes back further, though, and Lego has long been paying attention to the trend. At its Lego Fan Media Days event in 2020, the company revealed its own research finding that the number of adults buying sets for themselves had quadrupled over the previous decade. The same year saw Lego launch its “Adults Welcome” campaign, directly targeting grown-up customers.

With so much money up for grabs with adult fans, it might be unsurprising that Lego has aimed Pokémon at them. “This mirrors a broader toyification of culture and an industry shift in which toys increasingly function as lifestyle objects or markers of fandom,” Heljakka says.

Perhaps the hints that Lego Pokémon would be adult-targeted were there all along. In that March 2025 licensing announcement, it was only “fans” that were mentioned, with the press release saying the sets would allow “fans to build beloved Pokémon in Lego brick form,” while Gaku Susai, chief product and experience officer at The Pokémon Company International, was quoted as saying it would “surprise and delight fans.”

So, is there any hope of younger Pokéfans, or even more casual adult collectors, getting their hands on some Lego Pocket Monsters in the future? Lego repeated that it was “unable to provide comment on this occasion,” but there are some hints. The FAQ on Lego's landing page for the Pokémon range suggests it will expand, saying the “first three” sets are “display pieces aimed at adult collectors,” and that it is “always releasing new sets across all our themes.” Elsewhere, the dedicated Lego site Brick Fanatics lists more than a dozen unconfirmed sets expected to launch from summer 2026 onward.

Some of these suggest more play-focused sets, with several “versus” sets replicating Pokémon's signature monster battles, and kits themed around a specific Pokémon's evolutions. Whisper it, but these sound as though Lego might be taking a page from rival Mattel's Mega brand (AKA Mega Bloks, AKA Mega Construx), which held the license for brick-built Pokémon from 2017 until 2025. While Mega has never managed to build the same cultural cache that Lego enjoys, its Pokémon range at least catered to kids and included a few collector's editions for older fans.

The rumors for future Lego Pokémon also include at least two sets incorporating the manufacturer's new Smart Play Brick technology, both centered on mascot Pikachu. One, a purported “Smart Play: Pikachu's House,” even has a rumored price of $70. That's in line with the confirmed pricing of the Smart Play Darth Vader's TIE Fighter, but also noteworthy is that the entire Smart Play line is tailored toward all ages. If these Smart Play Pokémon sets do exist, it stands to reason they'd be similarly targeted—and could be the link between Pokémon fans young and old, packing in engaging new tech alongside, hopefully, some compelling Lego builds.

Bridging that divide, and ensuring Pokémon Lego is accessible to all, is essential if Lego wants to prove it's not only interested in big-spending adult collectors. As Heljakka says, “Intergenerational play is one of the few remaining spaces where digital-native kids and analog-nostalgic adults can collaborate creatively without screens mediating the experience. Play can be slow, messy, and remain unfinished. It doesn't need winners, judges, or mastery narratives to be meaningful—but building worlds together matters more than ever in the present day.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","No One Is Quite Sure Why Ice Is Slippery","https://www.wired.com/story/no-one-is-quite-sure-why-ice-is-slippery/","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 12:00:00 GMT","

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

The reason we can gracefully glide on an ice-skating rink or clumsily slip on an icy sidewalk is that the surface of ice is coated by a thin watery layer. Scientists generally agree that this lubricating, liquidlike layer is what makes ice slippery. They disagree, though, about why the layer forms.

Three main theories about the phenomenon have been debated over the past two centuries. Last year, researchers in Germany put forward a fourth hypothesis that they say solves the puzzle.

But does it? A consensus feels nearer but has yet to be reached. For now, the slippery problem remains open.

In the mid-1800s, an English engineer named James Thomson suggested that when we step on ice, the pressure we exert melts its surface, making it slippery. Under normal conditions, ice melts when the temperature rises to 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). But pressure lowers its melting point, so that even at lower temperatures, a layer of water might form on the surface. This theoretical relationship between melting point and pressure was experimentally confirmed by Thomson's younger brother William, better known as Lord Kelvin.

In the 1930s, though, Frank P. Bowden and T. P. Hughes of the Laboratory of Physical Chemistry at the University of Cambridge cast doubt on the pressure melting theory. They calculated that an average skier exerts way too little pressure to significantly alter ice's melting point. To do so, the skier would have to weigh thousands of kilograms.

Bowden and Hughes suggested an alternative explanation for the formation of the water layer: that it melts because of heat generated by friction caused by whatever is sliding against it.

They tested their theory in an artificial ice cave in the Swiss Alps, using a complex contraption to measure the friction between ice and other materials. They found that the friction was higher with materials that are good at conducting heat, such as brass, than with poor conductors like ebonite. From this, they concluded that when ice is rubbed by a material that easily absorbs heat, less heat is available to melt the ice, making it less slippery. This supported their theory that frictional melting is responsible for ice's slipperiness.

Although this explanation still appears in textbooks, many scientists disagree with it. “The problem with that is you only melt the ice behind you, not the ice you are actually skating on,” said Daniel Bonn, a physicist at the University of Amsterdam. Ice can be slippery the moment we step on it, before any motion has occurred that could cause frictional heating.

Daniel Bonn's group at the University of Amsterdam created a microscopic ice-skating rink to investigate the slipperiness question.

To test the friction hypothesis, Bonn and his team created a microscopic ice-skating rink. They rotated a piece of metal (standing in for the blade of a skate) at different speeds, each time measuring the force required to move the metal and the force that the metal exerted on the ice. The ratio of these forces gave them a measure of the ice's slipperiness. The scientists found that the slipperiness did not depend on the speed, suggesting that frictional heating—which should increase with speed—isn't what makes ice slippery.

There's another possibility: that ice's surface is wet even before anything makes contact with it.

In 1842, the English scientist Michael Faraday observed that two touching ice cubes will freeze to each other, and even a warm hand will stick to ice. He attributed this phenomenon to a thin, premelted layer that sits on ice's exposed surface, and that freezes again when covered up. Faraday couldn't explain why it happens, and it took almost a century for other scientists—notably Charles Gurney and Woldemar Weyl—to propose why “surface premelting” might occur.

They intuited that molecules near the surface behave differently from those deep within the ice. Ice is a crystal, which means each water molecule is locked into a periodic lattice. However, at the surface, the water molecules have fewer neighbors to bond with and therefore have more freedom of movement than in solid ice. In that so-called premelted layer, molecules are easily displaced by a skate, a ski or a shoe.

Today, scientists generally agree that the premelted layer exists, at least close to the melting point, but they disagree on its role in ice's slipperiness.

A few years ago, Luis MacDowell, a physicist at the Complutense University of Madrid, and his collaborators ran a series of simulations to establish which of the three hypotheses—pressure, friction or premelting—best explains the slipperiness of ice. “In computer simulations, you can see the atoms move,” he said—something that isn't feasible in real experiments. “And you can actually look at the neighbors of those atoms” to see whether they are periodically spaced, like in a solid, or disordered, like in a liquid.

They observed that their simulated block of ice was indeed coated with a liquidlike layer just a few molecules thick, as the premelting theory predicts. When they simulated a heavy object sliding on the ice's surface, the layer thickened, in agreement with the pressure theory. Finally, they explored frictional heating. Near ice's melting point, the premelted layer was already thick, so frictional heating didn't significantly impact it. At lower temperatures, however, the sliding object produced heat that melted the ice and thickened the layer.

“Our message is: All three controversial hypotheses operate simultaneously to one or the other degree,” MacDowell said.

Or perhaps the melting of the surface isn't the main cause of ice's slipperiness.

Recently, a team of researchers at Saarland University in Germany identified arguments against all three prevailing theories. First, for pressure to be high enough to melt ice's surface, the area of contact between (say) skis and ice would have to be “unreasonably small,” they wrote. Second, for a ski moving at a realistic speed, experiments show that the amount of heat generated by friction is insufficient to cause melting. Third, they found that in extremely cold temperatures, ice is still slippery even though there's no premelted layer. (Surface molecules still have a dearth of neighbors, but at low temperatures they don't have enough energy to overcome the strong bonds with solid ice molecules.) “So either the slipperiness of ice is coming from a combination of all of them or a few of them, or there is something else that we don't know yet,” said Achraf Atila, a materials scientist on the team.

Materials scientists at Saarland University in Germany showed in computer simulations that as two blocks of ice slide against each other, an amorphous layer in the middle gradually thickens.

The scientists looked for alternative explanations in research on other substances, such as diamonds. Gemstone polishers have long known from experience that some sides of a diamond are easier to polish, or “softer,” than others. In 2011, another German research group published a paper explaining this phenomenon. They created computer simulations of two diamonds sliding against each other. Atoms on the surface were mechanically pulled out of their bonds, which allowed them to move, form new bonds, and so on. This sliding formed a structureless, “amorphous” layer. In contrast to the crystal nature of the diamond, this layer is disordered and behaves more like a liquid than a solid. This amorphization effect depends on the orientation of molecules at the surface, so some sides of a crystal are softer than others.

Atila and his colleagues argue that a similar mechanism happens in ice. They simulated ice surfaces sliding against each other, keeping the temperature of the simulated system low enough to ensure the absence of melting. (Any slipperiness would therefore have a different explanation.) Initially, the surfaces attracted each other, much like magnets. This was because water molecules are dipoles, with uneven concentrations of positive and negative charge. The positive end of one molecule attracts the negative end of another. The attraction in the ice created tiny welds between the sliding surfaces. As the surfaces slid past each other, the welds broke apart and new ones formed, gradually changing the ice's structure.

The scientists repeated the simulations, replacing one of the ice surfaces with other materials that are either attracted or repelled by water. Again, molecules on the surface of the ice were displaced with sliding, but more so when the other substance attracted the ice.

In another simulation by the German team, a more realistic, rough surface slides across the ice, displacing surface molecules.

The simulations indicated that sliding mechanically destroys the ordered crystal lattice of ice, creating an amorphous layer that thickens as the sliding goes on. The team says that this, rather than melting, explains ice's slipperiness—especially at low temperatures.

MacDowell trusts the results from Atila and collaborators, although he thinks amorphization occurs only at high sliding speeds (the authors disagree, but simulating low sliding speeds requires a prohibitive amount of computational power).

Bonn also supports the new explanation, which he says aligns with experimental studies of objects sliding on ice conducted by his group in 2021. Those experiments and the new simulations both suggest that ice is slippery because of structural changes in its surface, though the researchers characterize what's happening in different terms. Atila believes that the changes are driven by the mechanical displacement of water molecules, whereas Bonn focuses on how mobile the surface molecules are to begin with. He compares the surface to a floor filled with little balls: “Because they're so mobile, it's impossible to stay upright if you're in such a room. Just as it's very difficult to stay upright when you're on ice.”

The difference between their descriptions “is a semantic issue,” according to Bonn, but Atila's coauthor Sergey Sukhomlinov disagrees. “I believe these are different mechanisms, even though they may look similar,” he said.

We're surely getting closer to settling the seemingly simple, centuries-old question of why ice is slippery. At this point, the lack of a shared vocabulary among researchers might be one of the biggest hindrances to resolving the issue. Similar effects might get different names, suggesting different hypotheses. Bonn also blames the fact that “ice researchers do have different and contradictory opinions, but they don't really tell each other that they disagree with each other.

Most CISOs believe they have a reasonable grasp of their organization's no-code footprint. They know employees are building small automations to streamline tasks. They assume a few dozen or a few hundred workflows are running quietly across the business. But when security teams finally gain real visibility, a different reality emerges.

One global enterprise expected to find a couple of hundred business-user workflows. The actual number was over 3,000. Another discovered that a single finance employee, someone with no engineering background, had created more than 150 automations. Still another found a workflow silently forwarding an employee's corporate email to a personal Gmail account. None of these were logged, inspected for security risks, or monitored.

These aren't anecdotes; they are symptoms of a structural shift. Enterprises are now increasingly exposed to a shadow infrastructure that is unseen, unmanaged, and unprotected.

Traditional AppSec programs are optimized for code stored in repositories, pushed through pipelines, and deployed through CI/CD, not for no-code apps, connectors, and automations created on platforms like Power Platform, ServiceNow, Salesforce, and UiPath.

Meanwhile, most organizations assume business-user automations are simple, low-risk, and limited in scope. The reality is more complex. Citizen developers now outnumber traditional software developers by an order of magnitude. Plus, they are wiring together data sources, triggering multi-system workflows, and calling APIs, not just building basic macros or departmental utilities.

Because these automations are created outside engineering governance, traditional monitoring tools never see them. They do not pass through security code reviews, undergo threat modeling, or generate the types of logs that SIEMs expect. Yet they perform actions that directly impact production data and business processes.

This blind spot often results in credentials embedded directly into workflows. It can also create SQL and OData exposure in tools like Microsoft Power BI, automations that bridge environments meant to remain isolated, and sensitive data exposed externally. In the worst cases, AI agents may gain access to entire database tables because a default configuration option was never changed.

None of these security risks represents malicious intent. They are the inevitable consequence of a system optimized for convenience rather than oversight.

Once security sees the scale of no-code development, a deeper problem emerges: ownership.

Many no-code workflows are tied to generic service accounts, each with hundreds of automations. Others belong to former employees. Ownership gaps persist because business units build independently, IT provisions access without governing logic or data flows, and security only has visibility into assets that touch their tooling.

AI agents amplify this issue. When employees can describe a goal in natural language, “summarize transactions,” “route exceptions,” “pull customer records,” and the platform automatically generates the workflow, authorship becomes abstract. An AI-generated workflow may be iterated on without clear ownership over time. The question “Who owns this?” becomes materially harder to answer.

These ownership gaps make incident response nearly impossible. If a workflow begins exfiltrating data, or a connector suddenly escalates its privileges, security teams don't know who understands the logic, who made the design choices, or whether the behavior is expected. The only recourse is to disable workflows wholesale, disrupting critical processes along the way.

Once they recognize this problem, most organizations reach for familiar AppSec tools, SAST, DAST, IAST, penetration testing, and policy reviews. These approaches often break down because no-code automations rarely produce code that scanners can parse or run in environments scanners can safely execute against:

Even identity governance systems struggle, since workflows often run under long-lived service identities that no human can be tied to.

What emerges is a shadow layer of business logic that sits entirely outside the boundaries of traditional AppSec, DevSecOps, and identity programs. As long as ownership remains fragmented and discovery elusive, security debt continues to grow unchecked.

No-code development isn't going away; in fact, AI-assisted workflow generation is only accelerating it. Clamping down on citizen development will only stifle innovation and is not a viable option. A better approach is to gain visibility and establish governance where none currently exists. Here is a five-step process to consider:

We're entering an era where the most dangerous vulnerabilities aren't in the code AppDev teams write, but in the thousands of workflows and automations business users build on their own. The sooner organizations recognize and confront the invisible no-code estate, the faster they can reduce the security debt accumulating inside their infrastructure.

If your Gmail account didn't seem to be working properly Saturday, you were not alone. But Google says the issue has been be resolved.

The official status dashboard for Google Workspace suggests that problems began at around 5am Pacific on Saturday morning, with users experiencing both “misclassification of emails in their inbox and additional spam warnings.”

For me, that meant my Primary inbox was filled with messages that would normally appear in the Promotions, Social, or Updates inboxes, and that spam warnings were appearing in emails from known senders. Other users complained on social media that “all the spam is going directly to my inbox” and that Gmail's filters seem “suddenly completely busted.”

The Google dashboard was updated with messages throughout the day on Saturday saying that the company was still working to resolve the issue. Later on Saturday evening, Google posted that the issue had been “fully resolved for all users.”

“Some Gmail users experienced a misclassification of emails in their inbox, delays in receiving email,” the company said in a dashboard update. “Additionally, misclassified spam warnings from the incident may persist for existing messages received before the issue resolution.”

The company also said that it will “publish an analysis of this incident once we have completed our internal investigation.”

This post was first published on January 24, 2026. It has been updated to include Google's statement that the issue has been resolved.

Twelve-year-old Milan-based tech conglomerate Bending Spoons has quietly become one of the tech industry's most prolific buyers, now owning Meetup, WeTransfer and many others, but it remains largely unknown to the general public.

So what exactly is Bending Spoons? Despite its catchy name, the company has stayed remarkably under the radar, and it typically makes headlines only when it adds another recognizable brand to its portfolio — the latest in date being Eventbrite, which it agreed to buy for $500 million last December.

But Bending Spoons isn't a traditional private equity firm or a pure financial investment vehicle. Its focus is on acquiring underperforming but popular tech brands, then transforming them to serve millions of users more efficiently. 

The company tends to make news when it restructures these acquired companies, often through significant layoffs, or makes controversial changes to beloved products — as it did with both Evernote and WeTransfer.

Still, Bending Spoons remains largely unknown, even though its roster of products has served more than a billion people, with over 300 million monthly active users and 10 million paying customers. Here's what you need to know about the company reshaping some of the internet's most recognizable brands.

Bending Spoons describes itself as a company that acquires and transforms digital businesses. Having grown to a headcount of 400 to 500 employees (whom the company calls “Spooners”), its main focus is on making improvements to products and services that others have created.

However, it didn't start that way — Bending Spoons' founders had taken a stab at building their own apps and products before eventually shifting their focus.

The little-known backstory is that Bending Spoons was born out of the remains of Evertale, a Copenhagen-based startup that participated in Disrupt SF 2011's Startup Alley and raised seed funding for its photo-sharing app, Wink. 

Evertale failed not long after, and investors were able to exit, but its founders and a couple of employees kept working together, initially on in-house apps. Soon enough, the team made its first acquisition, followed by many others, CEO and co-founder Luca Ferrari told the venture podcast 20VC in a rare interview. 

In 2020, Bending Spoons made an exception when it created and donated Immuni, Italy's official COVID-19 contact-tracing app. But other than that, it has mostly been honing a formula: Bending Spoons identifies a popular product it thinks it can improve inside and out, and buys it from owners who have reached their limits.

After the acquisition, Bending Spoons is anything but a passive owner, making changes to the products' user experience and features, as well as to the underlying tech; monetization strategy, including pricing; and team organization, including headcount.

While this focus on efficiency and revenue overlaps with private equity strategies, Bending Spoons claims a key difference: It “aims to hold forever, and has never sold an acquired business.” It is building a live portfolio, not collecting internet relics or presiding over a tech graveyard.

To be clear, Bending Spoons' acquisition targets so far haven't necessarily been failing businesses — many still had substantial user bases and revenue. But they've tended to be stagnant, neglected, or had owners looking to exit. Let's recap these key deals, and what happened in their aftermath.

While Bending Spoons acquired several companies between 2014 and 2021, including the AI-powered photo enhancer Remini, its most notable acquisitions happened more recently.

In 2022, it acquired Filmic, known for its popular video- and photo-editing apps, and laid off the entire staff in December 2023.

In a deal also announced in 2022 and finalized in early 2023, Bending Spoons also acquired Evernote, the note-taking app that had reportedly reached a $1 billion valuation before hitting trouble. Layoffs followed the acquisition, as well as cuts to Evernote's free offering.

The first half of following year, 2024, was particularly active, with the acquisition of Meetup, app maker Mosaic Group, and Hopin's StreamYard all happening within six months. 

In July 2024, it went on to acquire the publishing platform Issuu and the file transfer service WeTransfer, where it later cut staff and made changes to its free plan, introducing stricter limits. In December 2025, WeTransfer's cofounder Nalden criticized Bending Spoons' decisions and said he was building another file transfer service.

In November 2024, Bending Spoons announced it would spend $233 million on an all-cash take-private deal to acquire video platform Brightcove. 

The acquisitions have continued apace in 2025, with acquisitions that include the route planner Komoot and management software maker Harvest. 

Bending Spoons also announced its intention to acquire Vimeo in a $1.38 billion all-cash deal, and soon after, to acquire AOL from Yahoo for an undisclosed amount. (Disclosure: Both AOL and Yahoo are former owners of TechCrunch, in which Yahoo retains a small interest.) 

At the time, Bending Spoons said the acquisitions of AOL and Vimeo were expected to close by the end of 2025, subject to standard closing conditions and regulatory approvals; including, in the case of Vimeo, approval by its stockholders, which they have recently granted. 

Layoffs also followed the completion of Vimeo's acquisition. The information was confirmed to Business Insider by Bending Spoons, which declined to say how many people would lose their jobs.

In December 2025, Bending Spoons announced it would acquire yet another well-known brand: Eventbrite. Once again, it may pay much less than Eventbrite was once worth — only some $500 million, a far cry from the company's $1.76 billion valuation when it went public in 2018.  

However, there might be more hurdles. Earlier this month, Eventbrite stockholders filed a lawsuit in Delaware to upend the take-private deal over voting rights, and Eventbrite is currently fighting an effort to fast-track this challenge.

Since October 2025, Bending Spoons has been one of Europe's rare tech decacorns (companies valued at more than $10 billion). 

This comes on the heels of Bending Spoons' latest funding round: $270 million from investors, including T. Rowe Price and earlier backers Baillie Gifford, Cox Enterprises, Durable Capital Partners, and Fidelity, plus a $440 million secondary share sale by existing shareholders.

The company last raised at a $2.8 billion valuation in 2024, making its updated $11 billion valuation a significant step up — also for its four co-founders, who joined the billionaire ranks as a result.

Ferrari's stake in Bending Spoons is now reportedly worth $1.4 billion, while co-founders Matteo Danieli, Luca Querella, and Francesco Patarnello each hold stakes worth $1.3 billion, according to Forbes estimates based on shareholder data published by the Italian Business Register.

It's unclear whether any of the co-founders sold stock in the secondary transaction. Bending Spoons has declined to comment on its co-founders' stakes.

Though long bootstrapped, Bending Spoons had previously raised equity financing several times, including in September 2022 and early 2024. It also has VIPs on its cap table, including tennis and entertainment stars Andre Agassi and Bradley Cooper; tech industry bigs Eric Schmidt, Mike Krieger, and Xavier Niel; and performers The Weeknd, The Chainsmokers, and Maluma.

Upon announcing its new funding in October 2025, Bending Spoons said it would support future acquisitions and investment in its proprietary technology and AI capabilities. This comes in addition to the $2.8 billion in debt financing the company disclosed when it announced its intention to acquire AOL, debt that will fund the AOL deal and future acquisitions.

Bending Spoons said it intends to continue pursuing new acquisitions that expand its portfolio of consumer and enterprise digital products, and it now has funding to afford more prominent targets going forward — as confirmed by its decision to acquire Eventbrite.

AOL and Vimeo already carry far more name recognition than earlier targets, though the AOL terms remain undisclosed. The properties also have some reach. In announcing the AOL deal, Bending Spoons claimed that AOL remains one of the top 10 most-used email providers in the world, with 8 million daily active users and 30 million monthly active users. (Not long before acquiring AOL, Bending Spoons was also rumored to be eyeing app maker Elysium and Typeform, the Barcelona-based SaaS company known for its form creation tools.)

Presumably to support its continued efforts to acquire companies, it also has openings across various roles, with new hires initially working from its Milan headquarters before gaining the option to work from offices in London, Madrid, and Warsaw, or remotely. 

In fact, despite warning candidates that Bending Spoons is a “demanding environment,” the company has said it already received more than 600,000 job applications in 2025, a figure that will likely climb as its recent deals generate additional attention.

Candidates aside, Bending Spoons is also interviewing banks. According to reports, the company is holding talks with several financial entities to launch an IPO on the NYSE. In November, Ferrari had told Reuters that should it decide to go public, Bending Spoons would probably list in the U.S., where tech companies tend to achieve higher valuations.

This went on for months.  Then one day we had a power outage.  Two months later, every single machine failed at the same time.  I checked the logs and it was 49 days and few hours since that outage.  It didn't take me too long to figure out what the underlying programming error inside the TPM was.  At least we could then describe exactly what the problem was to our PC vendor.

Back in the day it was Windows, that had a hard limit on how long it could run in one pass. I forgot when it began and ended, but happily AI helped out to investigate back in time.The bug primarily affected the Windows 9x family of operating systems:Windows 95 (all versions)Windows 98 (original release)Windows 98 Second Edition (SE)While there were separate reports of similar 497-day overflows in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000, the ""classic"" version of this bug that most people remember is the 49.7-day limit on Windows 95 and 98.Why 49.7 days?
The issue was a classic integer overflow. Windows used a 32-bit counter to track the number of milliseconds since the system started. 
This counter was used by the Virtual Device Driver (VMM) to manage system timers.The maximum value for a 32-bit unsigned integer is: 2^32 - 1, which equals: 4,294,967,295 millisec.If you convert those milliseconds into days: 4,294,967,295 / 1,000 = 4,294,967 seconds
4,294,967 / 60 / 60 / 24 ~ 49.71 daysWhen the counter hit that maximum value, it would ""wrap around"" to zero. Because many system services and drivers were waiting for the counter to increase to a certain target time, they would suddenly find themselves waiting for a number that had already passed or was now mathematically impossible to reach in their logic. This caused the ""hang""—the mouse might still move, but the OS could no longer process tasks.When did it start and end?
Started: With the release of Windows 95 in August 1995.Ended: Microsoft officially fixed the bug with a patch in 1999 (Knowledge Base article KB216641). Windows Me (released in 2000) was the first in that specific family to ship with the fix included, and the transition to the Windows NT architecture (Windows XP and later) eventually rendered the specific underlying cause obsolete for home users.

This means that every single device would seemingly randomly completely break: touchscreen, keyboard, modems, you name it. Everything broke. And since the modem was part of it, we would lose access to the device — very hard to solve because maintenance teams were sometimes hours (& flights!) away.It seemed to happen at random, and it was very hard to trace it down because we were also gearing up for an absolutely massive (hundreds of devices, and then a couple of months later, thousands) launch, and had pretty much every conceivable issue thrown at us, from faulty USB hubs, broken modems (which would also kill the USB hub if they pulled too much power), and I'm sure I've forgotten a bunch of other issues.Plus, since the problem took a week to manifest, we couldn't really iterate on fixes quickly - after deploying a ""potential fix"", we'd have to wait a whole week to actually see if it worked. I can vividly remember the joy I had when I managed to get the issue to consistently happen only in the span of 2 hours instead of a week. I had no idea _why_, but at least I could now get serviceable feedback loops.Eventually, after trying to mess with every variable we could, and isolating this specific issue from the other ones, we somehow figured out that the issue was indeed a bug in the kernel, or at least in one of its drivers: https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/5088 . We had many serial ports and a pattern of opening and closing them which triggered the issue. Upgrading the kernel was impossible due to a specific vendor lock-in, and we had to fix live devices and ship hundreds of them in less than a month.In the end, we managed to build several layers on top of this unpatchable ever-growing USB-incapacitating bug: (i) we changed our serial port access patterns to significantly reduce the frequency of crashes; (ii) we adjusted boot parameters to make it much harder to trigger (aka ""throw more memory at the memory leak""); (iii) we built a system that proactively detected the issue and triggered a USB reset in a very controlled fashion (this would sometimes kill the network of the device for a while, but we had no choice!); (iv) if, for some reason, all else failed, a watchdog would still reboot the system (but we really _really_ _reaaaally_ didn't want this to happen).In a way, even though these issues suck, it's when we are faced with them that we really grow. We need to grab our whole troubleshooting arsenal, do things that would otherwise feel ""wrong"" or ""inelegant"", and push through the issues. Just thinking back to that period, I'm engulfed by a mix of gratitude for how much I learned, and an uneasy sense of dread (what if next time I won't be able to figure it out)?

The first version was built pretty much that way, with a tiny microcontroller and extremely optimized code. The problem then became that it was very hard to iterate quickly on it and prototype new features. Every new piece of hardware that was added (or just evaluated) would have to be carefully integrated and it really added to the mess. Maybe it would have been different if the code had been structured with more care from the get-go, who knows (I entered the project already in version 2).For version 2, the micro-controller was thrown out, and raspberry-pi based solutions were brought in. Sure, it felt like carrying a shotgun to fire at a couple of flies, but having a linux machine with such a vast ecosystem was amazing. On top of that, it was much easier to hire people to work on the project because now they could get by with higher level languages like python and javascript. And it was much, much, much faster to develop on.The usage of the raspberry pi was, in my view, one of the key details that allowed for what ultimately became an extremely successful product. It was much less energy-efficient, but it was very simple to develop and iterate on. In the span of months we experimented with many hardware addons, as product-market-fit was still being found out, and the plethora of online resources for everything else was a boon.I'm pretty sure this was _the_ project that really made me realize that more often than not the right solution is the one that lets the right people make the right decisions. And for that particular team, this was, without a doubt, a remarkably successful decision. Most of the problems that typically come with it (such as bloat, and inefficiency) were eventually solved, something which would not have been possible by going slowly at first.

High Bandwidth Flash (HBF) got submitted 6 hours ago! It's a great article, fantastic coverage of a wide section of the rapidly moving industry. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46700384 https://blocksandfiles.com/2026/01/19/a-window-into-hbf-prog...HBF is about having many dozens or hundreds of channels of flash memory. The idea of having Processing Near HBF, spread out, perhaps in mixed 3d design, would be not at all surprising to me. One of the main challenges for HBF is building improved vias, improved stacking, and if that tech advanced the idea of more mixed NAND and compute layers rather than just NAND stacks perhaps opens up too.This is all really exciting possible next steps.

  The KAIST professor discussed an HBF unit having a capacity of 512 GB and a 1.638 TBps bandwidth.

PCIe x8 GPU bandwidth is about 32GBbps, so HBF could be 50x PCIe bandwidth.

I'm not ""hiding"" behind anything.  I made the assertion that what Palantir does (and discusses publicly [1] [2] [3]) is ""creepy"".  I'm disappointed in your second grade teacher if you don't know what an ""opinion"" word is, but I guess I will assume the duty: subjective terms, like ""creepy"", are terms that typically describe a subjective perspective.  As there's no claim of objectivity there's also no need to ""prove"" this, though it can be justified by specific claims, as were linked below.  You are of course free to not think that stuff is creepy, that's fine, but I do think it's creepy and I doubt I'm the only one.I don't accuse everyone who disagrees with me as simping.

Picking and choosing US big tech in this context is pointless, they're all as much of a risk as each other.

The truth is there's thousands if not tens of thousands of people on here for whom it is incredibly convenient to imagine their vests were granted in a completely different universe to the likes of Palantir. Deep down they know their companies realistically play an unfathomably bigger role in surveillance capatalism, crippling addictions, furthering of current US Party  strongarming and a whole lot more. Exactly why many find it so cathartic to latch on to these threads and reinforce that cognitive dissonance.I didn't even mention Meta who bring about as much harm in a day as Palantir wish it could do in a year - make no mistake, I'm not suggesting the latter is for a lack of trying.

Recently I was made aware by colleagues of a publication by authors of a new agent-based modeling toolkit in a different, hipper programming language.  They compared their system to others, including mine, and made kind of a big checklist of who's better in what, and no surprise, theirs came out on top.  But digging deeper, it quickly became clear that they didn't understand how to run my software correctly; and in many other places they bent over backwards to cherry-pick, and made a lot of bold and completely wrong claims.  Correcting the record would place their software far below mine.Mind you, I'm VERY happy to see newer toolkits which are better than mine -- I wrote this thing over 20 years ago after all, and have since moved on.  But several colleagues demanded I do so.  After a lot of back-and-forth however, it became clear that the journal's editor was too embarrassed and didn't want to require a retraction or revision.  And the authors kept coming up with excuses for their errors.  So the journal quietly dropped the complaint.I'm afraid that this is very common.

I recommended that the journal not publish the paper, and gave them a good list of improvements to give to the authors that should be made before re-submitting. The journal agreed with me, and rejected the paper.A couple of months later, I saw it had been published unchanged in a different journal. It wasn't even a lower-quality journal, if I recall the impact factor was actually higher than the original one.I despair of the scientific process.

This is one of the reasons you should never accept a single publication at face value. But this isn't a bug — it's part of the algorithm. It's just that most muggles don't know how science actually works. Once you read enough papers in an area, you have a good sense of what's in the norm of the distribution of knowledge, and if some flashy new result comes over the transom, you might be curious, but you're not going to accept it without a lot more evidence.This situation is different, because it's a case where an extremely popular bit of accepted wisdom is both wrong, and the system itself appears to be unwilling to acknowledge the error.

Well, I'd argue the system failed in that the bad person is not removed. The root is then bad hiring decision and bad management of problematic people. You can do a blameless postmortem guiding a change in policy which ends in some people getting fired.

reply

In theory maybe, but in my experience the blameless postmortem culture gets taken to such an extreme that even when one person is consistently, undeniably to blame for causing problems we have to spend years pretending it's a system failure instead. I think engineers like the idea that you can engineer enough rules, policies, and guardrails that it's impossible to do anything but the right thing.This can create a feedback loop where the bad players realize they can get away with a lot because if they get caught they just blame the system for letting them do the bad thing. It can also foster an environment where it's expected that anything that is allowed to happen is implicitly okay to do, because the blameless postmortem culture assigns blame on the faceless system rather than the individuals doing the actions.

Not necessarily, although certainly people sometimes fall into that trap. When dealing with a system you need to fix the system. Ejecting a single problematic person doesn't fix the underlying problem - how did that person get in the door in the first place? If they weren't problematic when they arrived, does that mean there were corrosive elements in the environment that led to the change?When a person who is a cog within a larger machine fails that is more or less by definition also an instance of the system failing.Of course individual intent is also important. If Joe dropped the production database intentionally then in addition to asking ""how the hell did someone like him end up in this role in the first place"" you will also want to eject him from the organization (or at least from that role). But focusing on individual intent is going to cloud the process and the systemic fix is much more important than any individual one.There's also a (meta) systemic angle to the above. Not everyone involved in carrying out the process will be equally mature, objective, and deliberate (by which I mean that unfortunately any organization is likely to contain at least a few fairly toxic people). If people jump to conclusions or go on a witch hunt that can constitute a serious systemic dysfunction in and of itself. Rigidly adhering to a blameless procedure is a way to guard against that while still working towards the necessary systemic changes.

It's a good thing to take a look at where the process went wrong, but that's literally just a postmortem. Going fully into blameless postmortems adds the precondition that you can't blame people, you are obligated to transform the obvious into a problem with some process or policy.Anyone who has hired at scale will eventually encounter an employee who seems lovely in interviews but turns out to be toxic and problematic in the job. The most toxic person I ever worked with, who culminated in dozens of peers quitting the company before he was caught red handed sabotaging company work, was actually one of the nicest and most compassionate people during interviews and when you initially met him. He, of course, was a big proponent of blameless postmortems and his toxicity thrived under blameless culture for longer than it should have.

1) the immediate action _is more important immediately_ than the systemic change. We should focus on maximizing our ""fixing"" and letting a toxic element continue to poison you while you waste time wondering how you got there is counterproductive. It is important to focus on the systemic change, but once you have removed the person that will destroy the organization/kill us all.2) I forgot. Sorry

If Joe dropped the production database and you're uncertain about his intentions then perhaps it would be a good idea to do the bare minimum by reducing his access privileges for the time being. No more than that though.Whereas if you're reasonably certain that there was no intentional foul play involved then focusing on the individual from the outset isn't likely to improve the eventual outcome (rather it seems to me quite likely to be detrimental).

This is exactly the toxicity I've experienced with blameless postmortem culture:Hiring is never perfect. It's impossible to identify every problematic person at the interview stage.Some times, it really is the person's own fault. Doing mental gymnastics to assume the system caused the person to become toxic is just a coping mechanism to avoid acknowledging that some people really are problematic and it's nobody's fault but their own.

I'm not saying you shouldn't eventually arrive at the conclusion you're suggesting. I'm saying that it's extremely important not to start there and not to use the possibility of arriving there as an excuse to shirk asking difficult questions about the inner workings and performance of the broader organization.> Doing mental gymnastics to assume the system caused the person to become toxicNo, don't assume. Ask if it did. ""No that does not appear to be the case"" can sometimes be a perfectly reasonable conclusion to arrive at but it should never be an excuse to avoid confronting uncomfortable realities.

A good human in a bad system is more likely to make bad choices via adherence to systemic rules, just as a bad human in a good system is likely to find and exploit weaknesses in said system for personal gain.  You cannot ascribe blame to one or the other, but rather acknowledge both separately and together.  Think ""Good Place"" logic, with all of its caveats (good people in bad systems overwhelmingly make things worse by acting in good faith towards bad outcomes) and strengths (predictability of the masses at scale).5) ""Historical Morality"": a system or person is net good or bad because of repeated patterns of behaviors within the limitations (incentives/disincentives) of the environment.  A person who routinely exploits the good faith of others and the existing incentive structure of a system purely for personal enrichment is a bad person; a system that repeatedly and deliberately incentivizes the exploitation of its members to drive negative outcomes is a bad system.

It's not enough to merely identify a given cause and call it a day, you have to do something to change or address it to reduce the future likelihood of negative behaviors and outcomes; it's how I can rationalize not necessarily faulting a homeless person in a system that fails to address underlying causes of homelessness and people incentivized not to show empathy or compassion towards them, but also rationalize vilifying the wealthy classes who, despite having infinite access to wealth and knowledge, willfully and repeatedly choose to harm others instead of improving things.Villainy and Heroism can be useful labels that don't necessarily simplify or ignorantly abstract the greater picture, and I'd like to think any critically-thinking human can understand when someone is using those terms from the first rung of the ladder versus the top rung.

The act itself, of saying something other than the truth, is always more complex than saying the truth. ← It took more words to describe the act in that very sentence. Because there are two ideas, the truth and not the truth. If the two things match, you have a single idea. Simple.Speaking personally, if someone's very first contact with me is a lie, they are to be avoided and disregarded. I don't even care what ""kind of person"" they are. In my world, they're instantly declared worthless. It works pretty well. I could of course be wrong, but I don't think I'm missing out on any rich life experiences by avoiding obvious liars.

Personally, I do believe that there are benefits to labelling others as villains if a certain threshold is met. It cognitively reduces strain by allowing us to blanket-label all of their acts as evil [0] (although with the drawback of occasionally accidentally labelling acts of good as evil), allowing us to prioritise more important things in life than the actions of what we call villains.[0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect#The_reverse_halo_e...

If you were in their exact life circumstance and environment you would do the same thing.

On the one hand, it is possible to become judgmental, habitually jumping to unwarranted and even unfair conclusions about the moral character of another person. On the other, we can habitually externalize the “root causes” instead of recognizing the vice and bad choices of the other.The latter (externalization) is obvious when people habitually blame “systems” to rationalize misbehavior. This is the same logic that underpins the fantastically silly and flawed belief that under the “right system”, misbehavior would simply evaporate and utopia would be achieved. Sure, pathological systems can create perverse incentives, even ones that put extraordinary pressure on people, but moral character is not just some deterministic mechanical response to incentive. Murder doesn't become okay because you had a “hard life”, for example. And even under “perfect conditions”, people would misbehave. In fact, they may even misbehave more in certain ways (think of the pathologies characteristic of the materially prosperous first world).So, yes, we ought to condemn acts, we ought to be charitable, but we should also recognize human vice and the need for justice. Justly determined responsibility should affect someone's reputation. In some cases, it would even be harmful to society not to harm the reputations of certain people.

It's a paradox. We know for an absolute fact that changing the underlying system matters massively but we must continue to acknowledge the individual choice because the system of consequences and as importantly the system of shame keeps those who wouldn't act morally in check. So we punish the person who was probably lead poisoned the same as any other despite knowing that we are partially at fault for the system that lead to their misbehavior.

People are on average both bad and stupid and function without a framework of consequences and expectations where they expect to suffer and feel shame. They didn't make a mistake they stood in front of all their professional colleagues and published effectively what they knew were lies. The fact that they can publish lies and others are happy to build on lies ind indicates the whole community is a cancer. The fact that the community rejects calls for correction indicates its metastasized and at least as far as that particular community the patient is dead and there is nothing left to save.They ought to be properly ridiculed and anyone who has published obvious trash should have any public funds yanked and become ineligible for life. People should watch their public ruin and consider their own future action.If you consider the sheer amount of science that has turned out to be outright  fraud in the last decade this is a crisis.

We should also change environments to promote good and oppose evil so the pressures are pushing in the right direction.

For example, you assume that guy trying to cut the line is a horrible person and a megalomaniac because you've seen this like a thousand times. He really may be that, or maybe he's having an extraordinarily stressful day, or maybe he's just not integrated with the values of your society (""cutting the line is bad, no matter what"") or anything else BUT none of all that really helps you think clearly. You just get angry and maybe raise your voice when you're warning him, because ""you know"" he won't understand otherwise. So you left your values now too because you are busy fighting a stereotype.IMHO, correct course of action is assuming good faith even with bad actions, and even with persistent bad actions, and thinking about the productive things you can do to change the outcome, or decide that you cannot do anything.You can perhaps warn the guy, and then if he ignores you, you can even go to security or pick another hill to die on.I'm not saying that I can do this myself. I fail a lot, especially when driving. It doesn't mean I'm not working on it.

reply

That wasn't how I read it. Neither sympathize nor sit around doing nothing. Figure out what you can do that's productive. Yelling at the arsonist while he continues to burn more things down isn't going to be useful.Assuming good faith tends to be an important thing to start with if the goal is an objective assessment. Of course you should be open to an eventual determination of bad faith. But if you start from an assumption of bad faith your judgment will almost certainly be clouded and thus there is a very real possibility that you will miss useful courses of action.The above is on an individual level. From an organizational perspective if participants know that a process could result in a bad faith determination against them they are much more likely to actively resist the process.

Assuming good faith tends to be an important thing to start with if the goal is an objective assessment. Of course you should be open to an eventual determination of bad faith. But if you start from an assumption of bad faith your judgment will almost certainly be clouded and thus there is a very real possibility that you will miss useful courses of action.The above is on an individual level.

I mean, do not put the others into any stereotype. Assume nothing? Maybe that sounds better. Just look at the hand you are dealt and objectively think what to do.If there is an arsonist, you deal with that a-hole yourself, call the police, or first try to take your loved ones to safety first?Getting mad at the arsonist doesn't help.

Academics that refuse to reply to people trying to replicate their work need to be instantly and publicly fired, tenure or no. This isn't going to happen, so the right thing to do is for the vast majority of practitioners to just ignore academia whilst politically campaigning for the zeroing of government research grants.

Some Nobel laureates even authored papers rejecting established theories.

Other than just the label being difficult to apply, these factors also make the argument over who is a ""bad person"" not really productive and I will put those sorts of caveats into my writings because I just don't want to waste my time arguing the point. Like what does ""bad person"" even mean and is it even consistent across people? I think it makes a lot more sense to label them clearer labels which we have a lot more evidence for, like ""untrustworthy scientist"" (which you might think is a bad person inherently or not).

On my side-project todo list, I have an idea for a scientific service that overlays a ""trust"" network over the citation graph. Papers that uncritically cite other work that contains well-known issues should get tagged as ""potentially tainted"". Authors and institutions that accumulate too many of such sketchy works should be labeled equally. Over time this would provide an additional useful signal vs. just raw citation numbers. You could also look for citation rings and tag them. I think that could be quite useful but requires a bit of work.

The idea failed a simple sanity check: just going to Google Scholar, doing a generic search and reading randomly selected papers from within the past 15 years or so. It turned out most of them were bogus in some obvious way. A lot of ideas for science reform take as axiomatic that the bad stuff is rare and just needs to be filtered out. Once you engage with some field's literatures in a systematic way, it becomes clear that it's more like searching for diamonds in the rough than filtering out occasional corruption.But at that point you wonder, why bother? There is no alchemical algorithm that can convert intellectual lead into gold. If a field is 90% bogus then it just shouldn't be engaged with at all.

1) Anyone publishes anything they want, whenever they want, as much or as little as the want.  Publishing does not say anything about your quality as a researcher, since anyone can do it.2) Being published doesn't mean it's right, or even credible.  No one is filtering the stream, so there's no cachet to being published.We then let memetic evolution run its course.  This is the system that got us Newton, Einstein, Darwin, Mendeleev, Euler, etc.  It works, but it's slow, sometimes ugly to watch, and hard to game so some people would much rather use the ""Approved by A Council of Peers"" nonsense we're presently mired in.

This is a frustrating aspect of studies. You have to contact the authors for full datasets. I can see why it would not be possible to publish them in the past due to limited space in printed publications. In today's world though every paper should be required to have their full datasets published to a website for others to have access to in order to verify and replicate.

Straight-up replications are rare, but if a finding is real, other PIs will partially replicate and build upon it, typically as a smaller step in a related study. (E.g., a new finding about memory comes out, my field is emotion, I might do a new study looking at how emotion and your memory finding interact.)If the effect is replicable, it will end up used in other studies (subject to randomness and the file drawer effect, anyway). But if an effect is rarely mentioned in the literature afterwards...run far, FAR away, and don't base your research off it.A good advisor will be able to warn you off lost causes like this.

If IFR is low then a lot of the assumptions that justified lockdowns are invalidated (the models and assumptions were wrong anyway for other reasons, but IFR is just another). So Ioannidis was a bit of a class traitor in that regard and got hammered a lot.The claim he's a conspiracy theorist isn't supported, it's just the usual ad hominem nonsense (not that there's anything wrong with pointing out genuine conspiracies against the public! That's usually called journalism!). Wikipedia gives four citations for this claim and none of them show him proposing a conspiracy, just arguing that when used properly data showed COVID was less serious than others were claiming. One of the citations is actually of an article written by Ioannidis himself. So Wikipedia is corrupt as per usual. Grokipedia's article is significantly less biased and more accurate.

There's the other angle of selective outrage. The case for lockdowns was being promoted based on, amongst other things, the idea that PCR tests have a false positive rate of exactly zero, always, under all conditions. This belief is nonsense although I've encountered wet lab researchers who believe it - apparently this is how they are trained. In one case I argued with the researcher for a bit and discovered he didn't know what Ct threshold COVID labs were using; after I told him he went white and admitted that it was far too high, and that he hadn't known they were doing that.Gellman's demands for an apology seem very different in this light. Ioannidis et al not only took test FP rates into account in their calculations but directly measured them to cross-check the manufacturer's claims. Nearly every other COVID paper I read simply assumed FPs don't exist at all, or used bizarre circular reasoning like ""we know this test has an FP rate of zero because it detects every case perfectly when we define a case as a positive test result"". I wrote about it at the time because this problem was so prevalent:https://medium.com/mike-hearn/pseudo-epidemics-part-ii-61cb0...I think Gellman realized after the fact that he was being over the top in his assessment because the article has been amended since with numerous ""P.S."" paragraphs which walk back some of his own rhetoric. He's not a bad writer but in this case I think the overwhelming peer pressure inside academia to conform to the public health narratives got to even him. If the cost of pointing out problems in your field is that every paper you write has to be considered perfect by every possible critic from that point on, it's just another way to stop people flagging problems.

If this isn't bad people, then who can ever be called bad people? The word ""bad"" loses its meaning if you explain away every bad deed by such people as something else.

You guys are saying that drink driving does not make someone a bad person. Ok. Let's say I grant you that. Where do you draw the line for someone being a bad person?I mean with this line of reasoning you can ""explain way"" every bad deed and then nobody is a bad person. So do you guys consider someone to be actually a bad person and what did they have to do to cross that line where you can't explain away their bad deed anymore and you really consider them to be bad?

With the above, I think we've empirically proven that we can't trust mathmeticians more than any other humans  We should still rigorously verify their work with diverse, logical, and empirical methods. Also, build ground up on solid ideas that are highly vetted. (Which linear algebra actually does.)The other approach people are taking are foundational, machine-checked, proof assistants. These use a vetted logic whose assistant produces a series of steps that can be checked by a tiny, highly-verified checker. They'll also oftne use a reliable formalism to check other formalisms. The people doing this have been making everything from proof checkers to compilers to assembly languages to code extraction in those tools so they are highly trustworthy.But, we still need people to look at the specs of all that to see if there are spec errors. There's fewer people who can vet the specs than can check the original English and code combos. So, are they more trustworthy? (Who knows except when tested empirically on many programs or proofs, like CompCert was.)

These probably have bigger chance of being published as you are providing a ""novel"" result, instead of fighting the get-along culture (which is, honestly, present in the workplace as well).  But ultimately, they are (research-wise! but not politically) harder to do because they possibly mean you have figured out an actual thing.Not saying this is the ""right"" approach, but it might be a cheaper, more practical way to get a paper turned around.Whether we can work this out in research in a proper way is linked to whether we can work this out everywhere else? How many times have you seen people tap each other on the back despite lousy performance and no results?  It's just easier to switch private positions vs research positions, so you'll have more of them not afraid to highlight bad job, and well, there's this profit that needs to pay your salary too.

reply

They are pushed to publish a lot, which means journals have to review a lot of stuff (and they cannot replicate findings on their own). Once a paper is published on a decent journal, other researchers may not ""waste time"" replicating all findings, because they also want to publish a lot. The result is papers getting popular even if no one has actually bothered to replicate the results, especially if those papers are quoted by a lot of people and/or are written by otherwise reputable people or universities.

That's not right; retractions should only be for research misconduct cases. It is a problem with the article's recommendations too. Even if a correction is published that the results may not hold, the article should stay where it is.But I agree with the point about replications, which are much needed. That was also the best part in the article, i.e. ""stop citing single studies as definitive"".

However there are two problems with it. Firstly it's a step towards gamification and having tried that model in a fintech on reputation scoring, it was a bit of a disaster. Secondarily, very few studies are replicated in the first place unless there is a demand for linked research to replicate it before building on it.There are also entire fields which are mostly populated by bullshit generators. And they actively avoid replication studies. Certain branches of psychology are rather interesting in that space.

When a junior researcher, e.g. a grad student, fails to replicate a study, they assume it's technique.  If they can't get it after many tries, they just move on, and try some other research approach.  If they claim it's because the original study is flawed, people will just assume they don't have the skills to replicate it.One of the problems is that science doesn't have great collaborative infrastructure.  The only way to learn that nobody can reproduce a finding is to go to conferences and have informal chats with people about the paper.  Or maybe if you're lucky there's an email list for people in your field where they routinely troubleshoot each other's technique.  But most of the time there's just not enough time to waste chasing these things down.I can't speak to whether people get blackballed.  There's a lot of strong personalities in science, but mostly people are direct and efficient.  You can ask pretty pointed questions in a session and get pretty direct answers.  But accusing someone of fraud is a serious accusation and you probably don't want to get a reputation for being an accuser, FWIW.

We need to throw all of this out by default. From public policy to courtrooms, we need to treat it like any other eyewitness claim. We shouldn't beleive anything unless it has strong arguments or data backing it. For science, we need the scientific method applied with skeptical review and/or replication. Our tools, like statistical methods and programs, must be vetted.Like with logic, we shouldn't allow them to go beyond what's proven in this way. So, only the vetted claims are allowed as building blocks (premises) in newly-vetted work. The premises must be used how they were used before. If not, they are re-checked for the new circumstances. Then, the conclusions are stated with their preconditions and limitations to only he applied that way.I imagine many non-scientists and taxpayers assumed what I described is how all these ""scientific facts"" and ""consensus"" vlaims were done. The opposite was true in most cases. So, we need to not onoy redo it but apply scientific method to the institutions themselves assessing their reliability. If they don't get reliable, they loose their funding and quickly.(Note: There are groups in many fields doing real research and experimental science. We should highlight them as exemplars. Maybe let them take the lead in consulting for how to fix these problems.)

Catholic and Orthodox Christianity do not focus as much on the Bible as Protestant Christianity. They are based on the tradition, of which the Bible is only a part, while the Protestant Reformation elevated the Bible above the tradition. (By a tortured analogy, you could say that Catholicism and Orthodoxy are common law Christianity, while Protestantism is civil law Christianity.)From a Catholic or Orthodox perspective, there is a living tradition from the days of Jesus and the Apostles to present day. Some parts of it were written down and became the New Testament, but the parts that were left out were equally important. You cannot therefore understand the Bible without understanding the tradition, because it's only a partial account.

Currently I use Telekom's 5G for my home internet connection in Hungary as Telekom is the only company who has a cable in my street, but they refused to sell me wired internet due to the hole they use to take their underground cable up to the houses being already over capacity (it turns out this ""hole"" serves like the entire street with cables being run across everyone's attic...).I previously used yettel/telenor's 4G (basically as fast as Telekom's 5G because their 5G is a scam, although Yettel's 5G is even more scammy, it is slower than their 4G) but they broke their routers, I had comical packet loss and they refused to fix it (technically, when you pay for a cellular connection, the required uptime in the contract is zero). They also started CGNAT-ing in order to supposedly ""improve security"" (wtf..) just before I switched (this now means that their ""internet-focused"" plans have just CGNAT-ed IPv4, while their ""non-internet focused"" cellular plans have CGNAT-ed IPv4 AND IPv6 (makes sense).In any case, I now use Telekom's 5G with CGNAT-ed IPv4, just a single /64 IPv6 and forced separation (it is illegal to have a stable internet connection, they disconnect you just before reaching 24h of uptime).

The best part about ISPs, is that usually who have very few choices, sometimes only one! Where I grew up, we had the choice of ""broadband"" (via antennas between an island and mainland) with one ISP, or modem with any telephone company. Eventually, proper cables where put, and we had a choice between 6 different operators.Where I live now, I only have 3 options for ISPs with fiber, even though I live right outside a huge metropolitan area.

But depending on local rules, you can sometimes route around the monopoly: trench your own last-mile (at least on private land), do a neighborhood co-op, connect buildings, etc. It's sometimes expensive and you'll hit permits/right-of-way bureaucracy, but it's totally doable if you've got a few (rich) friends or a business willing to back it.“the conduit is full” is often just BS and a super convenient excuse for incumbents to block competition indefinitely.Romania is a good example of what happens when lots of small operators aggressively wire dense apartment blocks: brutal competition, low barrier to entry, and suddenly everyone has insane internet.If digging is blocked, wireless works too. Point-to-point links, WISP stuff, even satellite. The main thing is: you don't necessarily need your local ISP as your upstream, you just need a path out.

It's the same in the US. The ISP fiber network falls inside their security boundary in my experience - you can't BYOD. They install a modem (these days often including an integrated router, switch, and AP) and you receive either ethernet or wifi from them.I think the only major change in that regard has been that coaxial cable providers here will often let you bring your own docsis modem these days.I never found any of this concerning until quite recently. With the advent of ISPs providing public wifi service out of consumer endpoints as well as wifi based radar I'm no longer comfortable having vendor controlled wireless equipment in my home.

Telekom Speedports also have a modem only mode (the ones for non-fiber, dunno about the ones for fiber, but it looked like those are only modems and not a router as well). I don't make use of it since I manage the wifi for my family, but I do know it exists.

Im actually quite okay with that. Why should I have to pay for specialized hardware that won't be usable if I move and the new apartment uses DSL or docsis.
Give me an rj45 (or sfp for some fiber connections) and let me put whatever Router I want behind it.

reply

The common rationale behind this I'm aware of is that an ONT device is technically a computer with persistence, hosting arbitrary code and data that you cannot (or at least not supposed to) audit or alter, despite being on your premises, operated on your cost (electricity, cooling, storage), and specifically deployed for your use. These properties hold for SFP modules too in general, not just SFP ONTs (they're all computers with persistence).The catch is that this is further true for all of these kinds of modems.The counter-catch is that despite that, for DSL specifically, you could absolutely bring your own modem, hw and sw both.The counter-counter-catch is that with DSL, you were not connecting to a shared media, but point-to-point. This is unlike DOCSIS and GPON, where a misconfigured endpoint can disrupt service for other people, and possibly damage their or the provider's devices and lines.That's all the lore I'm aware of at least.

This needs crazy accurate timing for the upstream.  The head end needs to know the exact delay to your particular box to give it a ""grant"" to transmit at exactly the right time so transmit bandwidth is not wasted by idle time or multiple boxes transmitting at the same time and corrupting each other.You don't want brand X modems with dodgy configurations in this.  Of course as a consumer you'd want ""as little modem as possible"" i.e. just give me an ethernet port running DHCP or PPPOE and let me do the rest.

There's also a EU law which says that users should be able to bring their own modems / routers, so AFAIK providers say that this particular terminal device is still ""on their side of the network"".I've seen such devices come in two varieties.One is a separate device which plugs on the optical network, does the encryption and stuff, and then exposes an ethernet port which is connected to the actual router which does wifi, etc. With SFR and Bouygues, it was trivial [0] to replace the ISP-provided router with one of your choosing. You get the normal external IPs and you do your thing. The ISP router sleeps in its box in storage. This was my setup up until a few years ago, with both these providers. Now SFR has moved to CGNAT, but the setup is the same, so I expect users to still be able to switch routers (but I haven't tested, since I'm not a client anymore).Then there's Free, who provides a single device that connects to the fiber, does routing, wifi, etc. In this case, it's possible to flip a switch in its settings for it to act as a bridge (don't know how wifi behaves in this case, if it stays on). It then only accepts a single downstream client, which gets the external IP. SFR had a similar setup for DOCSIS.I'm not familiar with how Orange, the biggest operator, functions. But I understand they have a general tendency to be a PITA so YMMV with them.---[0] For Bouygues, this device only talked on a tagged VLAN100 for some reason.

This is the physical boundary of a network, in telecommunications. This is the junction where the service provider can point and say ""that's our equipment on this side"". So it helps to narrow down the troubleshooting.Often, if you have a telephone landline, you will see your demarc take the form of a gray RJ11 box with a small self-plug in it. It would be common practice to plug a phone into that box directly, then you've eliminated the ""inside wiring"" in the house.

In the case where the terminating equipment is a small box that exposes ethernet, with no routing or otherwise interfering the function of my own router, I think it's good enough. An argument could be made for the all-in-one devices, like saving some power.I get the geek factor, and it's one of the reasons why I run my own router, but for this specific bit, which needs to be fairly well integrated with the ISP's network, combined with their usual abysmal support, I think it's a better bet to just leave it alone.

FTTH here in Australia is the same, you're stuck using the network providers device, which just provides an Ethernet port, and a POTS port if you're in to that sort of thing, with your LAN device connected behind it.There was fierce lobbying back in the day (shout out to Simon Hackett / Internode) for our national broadband network to be simple dark fibre and that ISPs could build on top of that to provide innovation and differentiation.Instead what we got was a bunch of ISPs that resell the National Broadband Network's expensive wholesale plans with little in the way of either differentiation or innovation.Edit to add: what the sibling comments said too.

Now customers can choose. Nearly every ISP chooses the easy way and has the customer connect through Swisscom's XGS-PON but Init7 in particular has instead built out their own routers in POPs around Switzerland so that customers can have a physical fibre directly to their network. It's just plain ethernet with DHCP so you can use whatever equipment you want. It's also allowed Init7 to do something none of the other providers can do: offer 25Gbps symmetric service at no extra cost (beyond a one-off installation cost for the more expensive SFP modules).

For practical purposes there's the problem (at least a few years ago?) though that Akamai in particular uses DNS to steer you to the correct portion of its CDN and the default IPs returned by independent DNS resolvers tended to have relatively abysmal peering with the Telekom network that was getting completely overloaded at peak times.Unfortunately ""use <insert favourite DNS provider here> everywhere except for Akamai CDN, for which use the Telekom DNS"" isn't something that consumer routers support, so you'd have to start running your own custom DNS resolver to work around that problem…

It states that customers are bound not to setup servers on their internet connection point without prior aproval by the ISP. It sounds against the law to forbid this, albeit ianal.

Would you also say your mobile phone operator is violating net neutrality by putting you behind CGNAT that you can't forward arbitrary ports through? You can pay a bunch of money to get a private APN and get public IPv4 addresses. Would you call that an unblock fee?

In France, CG-NAT is getting widespread even for fixed, FTTH links. I'm typing this connected to SFR, which provides a static IPv6 /56, but IPv4 is behind CG-NAT. I can't host anything on IPv4. I think there's an option to get a fixed, internet routable address, but not on the ""discount"" plan I'm on. I hear you maybe can ask support to get you out of CG-NAT, but that doesn't seem very reliable.Free (local ISP), by default, doesn't give a static IP for fiber, but you can ask for one for free through your online account page (you just need to tick a box).

There are no sane and legitimate reasons for running an SMTP server on a residential connection. Even most server providers will block it unless you give them some very good reasons.Blocking 53 is just weird though.

There is no such thing. A connection to the internet should be equal to any other connection to the internet, modulo BGP peering. Noone has a right to dictate what services I run or don't run, what protocols I speak or don't speak, what traffic I accept or deny, but *me*. That's the whole point of being on the internet rather than Prodigy or Compuserve or something.The physical location of that connection is irrelevant. Maybe I feel my servers are safer in a datacenter. Maybe I feel they're safer in my basement. In my case, it is very much the latter, and again, you don't get to make that call. I do.

Although the GP wrote ""53/tcp"" that is a weird situation, because most (not all) DNS is over UDP.One day I suddenly found my DNS resolver logs were very active with veritable gibberish. And it seems that my router had been pwned and joined some sort of nefarious botnet.I only found this out because I was using NextDNS at the time, and my router's own resolver was pointed there, and NextDNS was keeping meticulous, detailed logs of every query.So I nipped it in the bud, by determining which device it was, by ruling out other devices, and by replacing the infected demon router with a safe one.But yeah, if your 53/udp or 25/tcp is open, you can pretty much expect to join a botnet of the DNS or SMTP-spam varieties.

Restricting ports also doesn't mitigate it, as a port scanner can easily find out I'm running this or that vulnerable server software on a non-standard port.It's none of the ISP's business to restrict the ports I should be using.

DTAG is bar none the worst ISP to work with. Everything they do is politics, they may decide to 'forget' to increase the bandwidth on a PNI until you take a meeting with german regulators. Almost every other ISP views PNI as the best way to uphold customer satisfaction without breaking the bank over a more expensive IX and will happily add ports when needed, DTAG on the other hand often requires concessions and selective agreements with a lot of strings attached.I don't think Germans realize just how much DTAG is holding the experience back for end users (given it's partially state-owned)

The providers are then free to either move out of the EU market, or let their non-EU traffic flow via the (then likely larger) unrestricted pipes at DECIX and AMSIX. If they think that routing everything via EU is cheaper instead of just peering better in the other parts of the world to deliver traffic locally, then be it, that is their own economic freedom to decide so.But they will realistically not do that. Also, SDNs will likely never go back to serving content in Europe from e.g. the US. Good connectivity is just generally the economically better option.That being said, T1 companies like Deutsche Telekom who also serve a large consumer base via broadband and mobile and not just other large business networks are probably more vulnerable to such legislation than an exclusive transit provider.

Legislation could focus on the following general rules, without favoring some providers over the others:* If you participate on an IX node, there is no reasonable technical or financial reason not to peer with the other participants at that node. Of course this would also mean that participants have to be protected against price-gouging of IXs when they need to scale up their uplink for that reason.* Alternatively, you could conditionally allow paid peering, but in that case require certain availability guarantees on your general transit connection.* If you do not want to do business with a certain party, it should be all or nothing. Blacklist them organization-wide. No misleading to consumers that a content provider just appears slow, announce that you do not want to play with e.g. Netflix anymore and if your customers do not like it, they will switch.* If you want to opt out of all of this regulation, you are free to run fiber yourself and just directly connect with everybody you are interested in. That is expensive? Too bad.

They recognised where the monopoly was: the incumbent telcos with millions of customers that had to go through them to get anywhere else.So the government insisted that such incumbents make available space in their exchanges for third parties (not for free!), and to allow their customers to use the third parties for telephone and/or internet service, rather than themselves.A similar argument and regulation could be made today. It could only apply to ISPs with a significant number of endpoint customers. It could require that the ISP make peering available to third parties, at the third party's cost, but the resulting transit should be settlement-free. It could require that if a peer asks the ISP to upgrade, because the ISP is deliberately underprovisioning, the ISP is compelled to allow the third party to pay reasonable costs to upgrade both sides (so the ISP can't sit on its hands, can't brazen it out, and can't set an impossible price)

Just nearly everybody except Telekom is doing this on a liberal and informal not-even-handshake basis. On ISP scale, you either invest in infrastructure, or pay rent for network ports or cross-links, and you generally want your traffic usage to be smooth without spikes, and also go to the destination without going through your expensive ports more than once. So general connectivity is more important than any kind of traffic metering.

reply

This also describes transit and describes getting internet service at home. I wouldn't say my cellphone peers with my provider. My cellphone is very much subordinate to my provider, not a peer.DT thinks it's important enough that it can extort everyone.A good policy for ISPs is to peer as many places and networks as possible, and carry traffic between your peers and customers, and customers and customers, and transit and customers, but not between peers and peers, or peers and transit. This way one end is paying for all traffic you carry. If you are a bully, you can try to make both ends pay.

Well no. Transit means that you use another AS (usually by a larger ISP) to get connectivity to a certain AS. And as for your internet service at home, unless you announce an AS, you are not peering with anyone.

Nowadays, the parts of the ministry that were back then regulating EM spectrum, allowable phones (basically phone police, you had to rent from Bundespost or go to jail) and generally being corrupt (relations of the former ministry to copper manufacturers is why they botched the first fibre rollouts in '95 and then ignored the topic for 20 years). Nowadays, the ""Regulierungsbehoerde"", staffed with the same people, is supposed to regulate their former colleagues at Telekom. Telekom got all the networks and was never split up, so it still has a (~85%?) monopoly on everything copper basically, as well as on customers, using this monopoly to bully other ISPs as well as it's own customers and extending this monopoly into future tech. And the state has a financial interest in this regulation being as lax as possible. So you can imagine how this goes...

2022 Russia controversyIn March 2022, media reported that OneWeb was scheduled to launch a batch of 36 satellites from Baikonur cosmodrome days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. There were calls for the UK to cancel the launch. Russia said the launch had already been paid for and would not be refunded, and would be cancelled from the Russian side unless OneWeb provided additional assurance that the satellites would never be used for military purposes and the British Government disposed of its shares in the company. The British government refused this demand and the launch was cancelled, along with other Russian launches. OneWeb tried through negotiations to get the stack of 36 satellites back, stranded in Kazakhstan due to political reasons. However, these negotiations never progressed. As OneWeb was on the verge of completing its 1st generation satellite network, they gave up hope in March 2023 on further attempts to get their satellites back, potentially scrapping the batch. The satellites were insured for $50 million, and OneWeb received the insurance money for them.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutelsat_OneWeb#:~:text=2022%2...

Sounds needlessly complicated.Apparently Amazon's constellation should be available for consumers within the next 6 months as well. Qianfan not until next year (I didn't realize they had hit delays). So there should be direct-to-consumer Starlink alternatives SOON™.

Obviously the satellites were never modernized. But it does work, for a few thousand terminals for all of Europe with 2x to 10x the ping Starlink provides.It's like a lot of things in the EU: on the one hand the EU absolutely requires this infrastructure, or they become dependent on foreign nations for critical infrastructure. But they won't pay. It's not even that expensive. Starlink was built with budgets that would be double-digit millions per year per EU country. But the main problem always repeats: they can't agree who gets the money/business.If you calculate the lifespan and cost of a Starlink satellite you will come to the obvious conclusion: it will be very hard for Starlink to break even. Of course, the same can be said for most of Musk's businesses (perhaps all. I'm not actually aware of any exceptions)

So I went to YouTube and rented Greenland (2010). It was a hoot! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland_(film)I wrote ""it's the second funniest rom-com I've ever seen"". But seriously, it was filmed in close collaboration with the United States Air Force. (Much like Mission: Impossible was a collab between US Gov and US Mil units.)It is kind of a fun ride if you're willing to suspend that much disbelief.But I just found it hilarious that a pair of films named and set in Greenland should be produced in this way, while the actual country is in our news cycle now. I almost feel like it's a ""PR buzz campaign"".

It then runs code which auto detects the car model (fairly easy from the messages on the bus), and has a database of the messages to send/inhibit to change the behaviour in the desired way.Because so many cars use electronics that are common across a whole manufacturer of cars - ie. all GM cars, or all cars with a Bosche ECU - there won't be awful lot of work making it compatible with hundreds of models of car.Such devices already exist for faking data for engine tuning, and for faking 'zero faults, all monitors pass' to pass government tests.

> Blown gaskets on ICE engines like E25s leak both oil AND coolant, no?This is way, way too broad of a statement.   The Subaru EJ25 tends to leak oil externally from the valve covers.  When they have head gasket problems it tends to be combustion gas into coolant which blows the coolant out the expansion tank until equilibrium is reached.  Typical head gasket failures cause some degree of that but  coolant mixing with oil is more typical.  Many V engines have intake gaskets that can leak coolant into the intake or oil or both.Regardless, if you can taste coolant in the exhaust the car is basically at the point of ""fix it now""> I might be mixing up blown heads with cracked manifolds which often go hand in hand since temp extremes in engines fissure cast parts like the manifold.A sizable minority of cars don't even use cast manifolds anymore.  While it's possible for cast manifolds to crack in a way that makes them leak that's rare and it's more common for them to crack their mounting tabs off.  Steel exhaust tubing can and does sometimes break after many years of vibration, say nothing of rust.While cylinder heads can crack it usually takes the kind of overheating that requires major work to fix in order to make it happen so just about nobody is driving around with a cracked head.

This is why forklift trucks and Zambonis run on propane instead of petrol or diesel. If you burn gas, you get no carbon monoxide or unburnt fuel because it runs ever so slightly lean and all the fuel is burnt.This means keeping the air clear is just a case of getting rid of carbon dioxide and water, so you can open some vents (warehouses have great big vents, big enough for trucks to drive in and out...) and let the place air out. You won't die if you breathe it, unlike the CO and unburnt fuel from petrol and diesel engines.It's a simple and inexpensive conversion, too.

(Edited to add) Hmm actually people are already doing LPG conversions today as it's cheaper. Not sure if all LPGs are as pollution free, though.

reply

You can get ones with a complete set of LPG injectors and an ECU that takes its timing from the petrol injectors, and these are incredibly efficient. They're a bit harder to install (you need to drill holes in the intake manifold, it's a faff) but the engine can be mapped for even more power than on petrol and a tiny amount of pollution.There's still a lot of CO2 and water vapour, but as previously discussed you're burning all this shit anyway so you might as well extract useful work from it.The time to have done this was 25 or 30 years ago, when it was ridiculously cheap to buy gas and there were a lot of old-fashioned carburettor-fed cars that were incredibly badly polluting.

There are cars that zoom through, practically every night, whose cats or mufflers are seriously wack. And probably on purpose. They put off some awful percussive noise as they vroom along, and it sounds like they are speeding (speed limit here is 35mph).There are also fireworks going off fairly often now. Since Christmas definitely. They are not the legal ones: somehow people smuggle out the rockets and the flying airburst ones, and set them off in our parking lot, or very nearby.I am fairly sure that I heard authentic gunfire on NYE.My hypothesis is that the cars are deliberately making ""rat-a-tat-tat"" noises that sound sorta like gunfire, in order to cover or mask real gunfire, should it ever occur. That the motorists with those cars are probably gangstas who are assigned to just lay down aural cover for whatever hijinks may or may not transpire that night.

Some people remove catalytic converters when they install a performance exhaust. Nobody is doing it for louder noises because the muffler portion is what dampens the sound.Also I wouldn't say it's “a lot of Americans”. We have emissions inspections in most major cities and your car won't pass if you remove the catalytic converter. They can now detect modified ECUs, too. Someone would have to be so determined to do this that they'd swap the exhaust in and out every time they had to do emissions inspections.

It's important to realize the reason for that.Crashes by human drivers are hugely disproportionately by people who are driving drunk or with insufficient sleep or significant distractions etc. In other words, it's not a difference in the cars, it's a difference in the drivers. Waymo can beat a drunk driver, and therefore can beat the human driver arithmetic mean which has the drunk drivers averaged in.That doesn't mean it's any safer than driving an ordinary car when you're not drunk.

Which leads to ""fun"" situations when that battery runs out, like not being able to get into your car or start it.

This puts a cap on how much the ""smart"" systems can do because it dramatically increases cycle count and thus the risk of the 12v battery losing the ability to produce enough voltage to start the car, leaving the driver marooned somewhere.It could also result in a noticeable ""vampire"" drain on the high voltage battery which looks bad and could put you at a disadvantage vs. competitors.

More like, more people should understand how EVs can easily work for them, and then try to shoehorn gas-powered vehicles into the few niche they need to be in.How often does someone need a 400 mile range again? Towing? When is the last time you towed something 400 miles? The most I ever towed was... using a rental truck and a rental trailer when I moved. (Anecdotes are not data!) But why in a rational purchasing decision would I need an 800 mile EV battery for a car just because sometimes it's cold out?

So yes, you want 400-500 miles of range, but that's because you've doubled the 250 for weather, safety margin, etc.

for this to happen the EVs depreciation needs to drastically improve compared to ICE. I don't see this. On top of this EVs tend to push ideas from Software/Tech companies, such as recurring revenues (because the underlying technology lends itself to it better).Personally I'm unsure that this will be accepted by all consumers as much as is needed. After all the automotive marketing has since Ford insisted that driving was about ""freedom"". So some pivot needs to happen in the messaging. Suppose decades is a lot of time to change it. Personally I think EVs are nonsense, and a better utopia would be making sure public transport is abundant, high-quality and free.

Sometimes, for special errands, I rent a car. For example, I intended to move across town last year, so I rented a car for 3-4 days.It was the most excruciating pain I could have. I chose a little Mitsubishi Mirage, and firstly, it was the middle of July in the Sonoran Desert, and the A/C hardly worked, so I was sweating, and the car would heat up real good in parking lots. No sun shades, dark upholstery. Also, the USB connection was flaky, so sometimes my phone didn't charge, and whether or not, it was directly exposed to the Sun and overheating.By the second day, my legs hurt a lot. I had spent an unexpected amount of time on my feet and walking around, despite the vehicle. Do you know how big parking lots are these days?!I tried sitting down at every opportunity. I have a running gag/dispute at my bank to see whether they will allow me to ""sit down"" at the ""ADA/Disabled"" teller window.Driving home at night on the last night, my leg cramped up really bad. I was in such pain, I nearly pulled over because it was my accelerator/brake leg and I was going to lose control of the car.Thankfully I was able to hold it together, and returned the car the next day, but boy I did not want such a vehicle ever again. And it was not a stick-shift; it was an automatic transmission.Next time I'm going to be really sure that the USB and A/C work. And that my legs are super-comfortable and has cruise control.

I find those claims highly suspect: I own an EV and haven't had to change the tires more often than I did on a gasoline-powered car. My EV bought in 2021 still runs on original tires and they're fine (although I do change from winter to summer tires, so that's 2 sets technically).I suspect black PR, and there is always a grain of truth in black PR: emissions are indeed likely to be higher. Probably not ""much higher"" and probably not in a way that really matters.

1) this is not the only or even the overriding factor when comparing the two. There are engine emissions (none for EVs) and braking (EVs have regen braking)2) There is a trend for larger, heavier ICE vehicles in the USA as well. Big trucks and SUVs. It is very selective to argue against EVs in this way without also arguing against these.

reply

One thing that differs is brake wear. My car is ten years old and still on its original brake pads and discs. The regen braking is amazing for avoiding mechanical braking. So that means less particle emission from brakes, compared to ICE.

reply

Well no, it's not ""the same"". We have things like physics to tell us that more torque and more weight means more tire wear, despite your anecdote. There are even studies on this.

For example EVs depend on charging, so we're seeing more public charge points, as well as more home chargers, work chargers and so on.ICE depends on gas stations (which is the tip of the gasoline distribution industry.) It also depends on ICE mechanics. As demand for those services drop off, so they'll become harder to find. (To be clear, that's not happening soon, there are a LOT of ICE cars out there...)But 50 years from now most of that ICE infrastructure will have disappeared.

I'm guessing it will be already in 20-30 years from now. In 5-10 years from now, no-one will buy an ICE vehicle. Add to those 10 years a lifetime of 10-20 years for the last sold ICE vehicle and you get 20-30 years. So 20-30 years from today there will not be many ICE cars rolling on the streets and most gas stations and other needed infrastructure will be gone as it is not economical to stay in business.

Battery swapping changes the game entirely. Imagine a national network of exchange stations (co-located with existing petrol infrastructure, you can use the overhead canopy for solar). Standard pack sizes scaled by vehicle class: compact cars get 2 cells, vans get 4, lorries get 8.Whoever owns these battery packs now has skin in the game for longevity. Their profit depends on keeping packs in service for 20+ years, not selling you a new car.Suddenly the R&D money flows towards batteries that last, obsolescence now costs them money, and isn't a happy accident that keeps you hooked on buying more cars.You'd still have the option to buy your own packs outright if you only ever charge at home, but the network creates the economic pressure for genuine improvement of longevity in battery tech that's completely missing today.I'm aware that a company called “Better Place” failed. But they were a startup trying to strong-arm the automotive industry. A nationally coordinated infrastructure concern is different, and the air quality data from this study suggests we can't afford to keep muddling through - and I really think that peoples concerns about batteries are not misplaced.Perfect is the enemy of good, but damned if we can't at least align incentives for better.

Meanwhile, battery longevity is essentially a solved problem. Manufacturers do have an incentive to improve it due to customer demand, and modern NMC chemistry, cooling and BMS have improved significantly to the point where they're expected to maintain 70-85% capacity after 10 years[1], far from worthless. At this point, components like the motor likely fail before the battery does.Given the much lower failure rate of everything else in an EV, TCO is dramatically better than ICE cars even with degradation[3].Manufacturers like Mercedes even guarantee 70% health after 8 years (a worst-case estimate).There is a significant commercial incentive for aftermarket battery repair shops.

13 years old dead luxury cars are worthless, yes, especially when the tech is quickly evolving. That doesn't say anything about how long it takes for them to die or how reliable the tech is.



There aren't many 10+ year old EVs yet, and demand is limited. This is changing, and EVClinic will be the first of many aftermarket EV repair shops.

The Nissan Leaf 15 years ago came with a 5-year/100,000km battery warranty, now Toyota are at 10-year/1,000,000km.

As it stands the Nissan Leaf is an outlier only in Norway, where it was practically a free car due to subsidies, otherwise their growth is pretty much in line with other EVs.

It needs to be fixed, because aside from someone being left with the economic bag of disposing of the vehicle, it is actually an environmental issue to build these batteries.Just not as bad of an issue as running ICE cars for the same period of time.People tend not to think more than a certain amount of time away for some reason.

We saw this play out with phones. We used to have easily swappable batteries. And since battery chemistry was (and hopefully still is and will continue) improving, by the time you actually swapped the battery there were ones around with a higher capacity than the battery the phone shipped with. And typically for little money.Now everything is glued and messy to swap so the manufacturer can sell you a battery swap for much much more money than it used to cost.I believe cars should have swappable somewhat standardized batteries. Even if not swappable by the user, it should not be a more than 1h job at the mechanic (ANY mechanic, not just the manufacturer).Imagine picking a car and not caring about battery at all. You want a Tesla but BYD batteries are better - so get a Tesla without a Battery and put a BYD one it it. Or maybe Tesla has the best batteries right now, so you get that. And once you have to swap the battery, you again just pick the best manufacturer at the time - who might not even be a car manufacturer at all but rather someone specialized in batteries exclusively.And since hopefully 10 years have passed since you bought the last battery, chemistry has improved so you pick from options that are all (hopefully a lot) better than the battery you had initially.We could have some proper competition where manufacturers would have to compete on pricing and performance.But car manufacturers don't care. They want as much of your money as they can get. And opening their cars to third party batteries and not keeping up as many walls as they can is the opposite of that.So until forced by regulation every manufacturer will continue to put batteries in their cars that only they themselves will sell and put a slightly different one in every car. So guess what, even if you swap your battery in 10 years, they will sell you the same battery you can buy right now. Because the newer stuff is for new cars only and compatible with your car.

I agree that discussing weight with regard to EVs, without acknowledging that (in the US) the fashion is for big heavy ICE cars is just as polluting is disingenuous.That said, outside the US the trend is for smaller cars, and equally the weight of a small EV is not hugely dissimilar to a common ICE car.Frankly I'm not sure there's a whole lot to say about tire dust- cars need tires. EVs generate less brake dust. If there's a tire dust discussion to be had, then that discussion is independent of the vehicle fuel source.

Wikipedia lists the 3rd-gen Prius Prime at roughly 3,500 pounds curb weight, and the Tesla Model Y at 4,100-4,600 pounds, I assume depending on the battery it's equipped with.The Prius Prime has 40+ miles of all-electric range, and it can reach highway speeds with the gas engine off. So your day-to-day driving is all electric, then you still have an engine for harsh winter days, power outages, and you have 600 miles EPA range on gas for sudden road trips.People are really sleeping on hybrids. Even a used non-plug-in Prius will get 50 city and 50 highway MPG. No gas sedan can do that.

Yes, EVs have a weight penalty of ~250-500kg of battery currently.Battery technology is rapidly advancing, when Na-ion batteries are introduced more widely, the whole range anxiety issue will become moot, because a recharge will take as long as refueling an ICE vehicle.The weight difference will also start to reduce, both due to newer batteries, but also moving to lighter weight construction and increased use of alternatives to steel.Arguing for ICE technology in 2025 is like Blackberry/Nokia users complaining about the loss of keyboards & T9 texting.

Ultimately, it was way more worth it to go all the way up to an F150 Lightning than to go with a good PHEV, partly due to up-front cost, but mostly due to ongoing cost: I will need to change the oil on the electric motors maybe every 150,000miles, and I never need an emissions test again. PHEVs require keeping the gas engine up, and getting it emissions-tested.A whole category of cost just straight-up disappeared, for cheaper than I could get a RAV4 Prime too.

Which unfortunately also increases tire wear from regen braking during periods when an ICE vehicle would be coasting without braking.EVs are much (much much) better for CO2, much better for brake dust, and much worse for tire dust.

EVs could coast if a manufacturer chose to make one that allowed that without shifting into neutral. In practice, when letting off the accelerator, existing EVs will instead regen brake.

Unfortunately, no such EVs are currently manufactured. Even the ones that allow you to ""turn off"" regen braking will generally apply 1-2kW of regen if your foot is off the accelerator.

In a gas car that means the car is using the brakes and gas engine (obviously) but it's a jarring experience compared to a BEV or hybrid.  The regenerative braking and smooth acceleration are much more pleasant.

reply

Hyundai and Kia EVs have a 5 level setting for what happens when you lift up on the accelerator, either partially or fully.At level 0 the regeneration is so low that I don't notice a difference between that and being in neutral. It slows down way less than an ICE does when not in neutral.> If you just take your foot off the accelerator, any modern EV will apply some amount of regenerative braking.

You can reduce the total braking force needed by extending the time, in which case aerodynamic forces and rolling resistance will contribute some more to the reduction in speed.In an EV with one-pedal driving you can still stop quickly or slowly. In an ICE car you can stop slowly with more coasting or quickly with more braking force.I don't see how the drivetrain is going to make a difference to the amount of braking needed to stop and thus force exerted on the tire. The added weight of most EVs would be the larger factor.

The responses tend to be either ""actually regen braking wears tires just as much as using brake rotors"" by people who didn't actually read, or ""surely manufacturers wouldn't do that, it doesn't match the mental model in my head"" by people who've never paid close attention to the power readouts while driving an EV.Your own response was ""actually one manufacturer does have a setting that will avoid the effect if someone sets it, therefore the whole concept must be wrong"".

If instead those 80 passengers each drove alone in a Kia Niro EV it would be about 4 000 pounds each, so an axle weight of 2000, so the damage would be proportional to 160 x 2000^4 = 2.56 x 10^15.That's 125 times less road damage than the bus!Another interesting 4th power calculation is EV vs ICE. My car is available as an ICE, a hybrid, or an EV. I've got the EV which weighs more than the ICE.Based on the 4th power law I should be doing about 40% more damage than I would if I had bought the lighter ICE model.But wait! With the ICE model I'd need to regularly by gasoline, and that gasoline is delivered by a tanker truck. Tanker trucks, especially when they are traveling between wherever they load and wherever they unload, are very heavy.I calculated what would happen in a hypothetical city where everyone drove the ICE version and then all switched to the EV version, and how many tanker truck gas deliveries that would eliminate. I don't remember the exact numbers but it was something like if mid sized tankers were used for gas delivery then if they had to drive more than a few miles from wherever they loaded up to wherever they unloaded the elimination of those trips by everyone switching to EV would reduce road damage by more than the damage caused by the EVs being heavier than the ICE cars.

I wasn't talking about passenger buses, because thats unlikely going to happen in US. Almost all of damage is done by 18-wheelers. A fully loaded 18-wheeler: 80,000 lb. Everytime a discussion comes on ICE vs EV, the fossil fuel proponents immediately jump to but EVs weigh more (debatable) and cause more damage. The damage they cause is insignificant compared to 18-wheelers. I'm not entirely sure if EVs weigh more either, maybe the earlier models did, but energy density keeps increasing. Also, there is no compelling reason to have 300+ mile range batteries when most of the trips are under 3 - 5 miles.

BUT I don't think switching to EVs will help reduce CO2 in any way - not even if all the EVs are charged using 100% solar/wind. The narrative usually is ""I get an EV instead of an ICE, charge it with regenerative energy and have 0 emissions, thus not burning oil and saving on CO2"".But that is not how a globalized world with free markets works. In order to save on CO2, we would need to keep that oil not burned by the EV underground, but that does not take place. The market reality is that oil price will just drop with less demand from ICE vehicles. But with falling prices, other business models that require refined oil will become viable and the oil is still burned - just somewhere else. No one so far has made a good argument why the Saudis or Russians would leave their ressources underground, just because demand from ICE vehicles drop.

That is not true. Reduced price leads to higher demand.

And countries like Saudi Arabia and Russia have a very high incentive to keep extracting oil and sell it, because their economy relies on it.

OK.And did you go to Economics 201?Because there, you might have learned that the basic economic principles you describe as ""economics 101"" are the equivalent of the ""spherical cow in a frictionless vacuum""-type examples you get in introductory physics classes.In the real world, demand is affected by all kinds of things, and sometimes, a product or service is just no longer desired by the population. Do you think that if you were selling buggy whips for $0.05 each, you'd be able to make a profit on them today? Of course not, because people don't need them. You'd barely sell any, and those purely as a novelty.While there's still a lot of work to do to make it fully possible, and certain political groups are actively working against it, the world at large recognizes that getting off of fossil fuels is an important goal. Demand for oil is going to continue to drop—maybe not monotonically, but overall—regardless of what the price of oil does.

And when the pollution is centralized in one power plant it's also more economically feasible to apply filtration or particle capture isn't it?

I drive a Polestar 2, and someone asked if it was my favorite car I've owned. And I said, no that's a Mazda 3 hatchback... 6-speed manual. Lovely vehicle to drive. Economical, but luxurious for the price. Very practical, too.But... if you asked me if I'd go from the Polestar 2 back to the Mazda 3? I'd say no. I'll keep the electric. Of course it's not a fair comparison... one had an MSRP of $27k and the other $67k. One has 186HP and the other 476HP (and all-wheel drive).One had a lot of routine maintenance of the engine, while the other has needed wiper blades and tires. And one requires standing outside in 10° F days like today pumping gas, while the other one is charging in my garage (and warms up the cabin from the press of a button on my phone.)The Mazda 3 was more of a driver's car, and if I had bought either new, it would be a very different equation. (I bought the 3 w/ 8K miles on it for $20k; I bought the Polestar w/ 20K miles on it for $29K.)

But today we've got basically the opposite.I would disagree with the idea that petroleum would run everything out there if EVs came first but I won't argue that point super hard with you. I can see and understand how petroleum is a lifeline for things like oil heat, generators, etc.Still, batteries are very well-suited to off-grid usage, and EV batteries can even power your house for a week or more in the event of a power outage. Let's not forget that solar panels exist.There are entire islands that have switched from imported diesel fuel power generation to grid scale solar+battery and they have had a great deal of cost savings and reliability benefits.

I can see and understand how petroleum is a lifeline for things like oil heat, generators, etc.Still, batteries are very well-suited to off-grid usage, and EV batteries can even power your house for a week or more in the event of a power outage.

Plus now you have problems moving tonnes of food, water, ammunition on BEV vehicles that no longer have reliable charging access. Being unable to supply your military is more or less a death knell for any fighting force.Even setting aviation aside, a lot of the reason why gas engines were adopted was because agriculture was among the first to do so, they were less finicky then ox and horses. Rural areas didn't have access to electricity like cities did at the time though; It was a lot easier to have a tin of whatever liquid fuel (gasoline was a byproduct of kerosone production at the time).

Again the hypothetical was modern EVs with modern infrastructure.And this hypothetical isn't that crazy. Many Chinese car buyers' first vehicles are electric, and many of those people buying cars are quite used to electric scooters as their transportation method.Speaking of wars, how many wars for oil would be avoided if there wasn't a widespread dependency on cheap oil? If the gas price ever goes above $5-7/gallon in America it basically triggers a recession.

A few cars from Stellantis that are available in ICE and EV variants are now actually cheaper in the EV variant. This reflects the reality that batteries are now cheap and EVs don't have a lot of moving parts. So, they should be easier and cheaper to assemble. That's a trend that is spreading across all price segments in the next few years. Driven by component and cheap battery availability.Used EVs are widely available now as well. You can get some amazing deals on cars that mostly still have their drive trains + batteries under warranty. Lots of cars coming out of lease programs are sold on second hand. EVs have been very popular for car leasing for the last 6-7 years now. These are mostly still the relatively expensive models from a few years ago.The cheap EVs that are now on the market will inevitably start penetrating the second hand market in larger and larger numbers. Cheap ICE cars are disappearing rapidly from the market as models are being discontinued by manufacturers and as the market shares for ICE vehicles keep on shrinking. That means they'll also start getting more scarce in the second hand market in a few years. You'll still be able to get your Ford Fiesta. But it will be a model from before it was discontinued a few years ago. Or the new electric model that they are rumored to launch soonish.

You are making my point. Most folk can't afford that for transportation. 10k is already a stretch.

This is still a net positive even in poorer countries. If you can't afford a new car, you buy as close to a new car as you can afford. The newer the car is, the higher the EURO standard is that it had to abide by when it was sold brand-new, achieving the same result of reducing pollution.I live in one of those poorer ones where most people can't afford new cars, but even if you can, the percentage of brand-new ICE cars that are even available for purchasing is going down pretty fast in recent years. So those better off are slowly being pushed towards EVs (or at least hybrids), and the vast majority of others still relies on importing like 15 years old second-hand cars (EURO 5 standard) to replace their 25yo cars (EURO 3 standard). In the capital, cars below EURO 4 are even banned when air pollution gets really bad, but the vast majority doesn't even realise this rule exists because their cars are now EURO 4 or above.

That won't happen until they design a normal truck.  The Lightning sold more than the CT and it still ended up getting canceled(ish).  It isn't going to be Tesla that does it, it will probably be someone else, and the driving factor is battery capacity.  We've got a ways to go yet.  It would help to have 400+ kWh batteries and megawatt chargers.

At current prices, the standard range battery in a Lightning (which is nominally about 107kWh or so) should cost under $10K.  They will not be able to shrink the battery enough to offset the cost of putting in an engine and generator.  For one, they have to stay competitive with the Dodge EREV pickup, which will have a ~90kWh battery.My guess is they leave out one or two modules from the standard range pack and price the truck starting at $70K.  They won't make a ton of money, but they might be able to get a nice boost in volume to make up for it.

It's not a hard sell: no more oil changes, no more annual emissions-testing bill, no transmission to ever worry about, and a massive chunk of storage under the hood where the gas engine would be – plus a bunch of outlets all over for powering or charging tools. When I then tell them that I spend about $30/month on charging the thing (at home) compared to my former gas budget of ~$150-200/month, it becomes even more of a no-brainer.And none of this has anything to do with climate change. It's just plain and simple practicality.They tend to ask about range. I get around 300 miles on a full charge when road-tripping, and Buc-ees has some pretty cheap chargers (still cheaper than gas would be) that get me back on the road in about the time it takes me to use the bathroom, grab and eat some brisket, and change the baby's diaper. I've done some shortish road-trips a few times now, and not had any problems. I've got some longer ones planned this year, now that I know that I can find chargers along the way.

That's simply not true.  Oil used someplace else would have been used someplace else either way.There is a supply/demand effect where reduced oil demand would lower its price and therefore arrest the loss of oil demand from cars by other consumers of oil, but the net effect would still be that less oil is burned and used.

You're missing that the supply drops as well since it is not economical to produce the same amount of oil as before at a lower price.As long as the supply curve does not change (and nothing about EV usage changes the supply side here), a reduction in demand leads to lower consumption.Edit: And in addition, your chart doesn't show anything like you purport it to show. By your claim, oil consumption by non-Western countries should have been drastically higher in 2000-2007 when oil prices were lower than they are today. Yet the opposite is true.Oil consumption is up over time, including in non-Western countries, but that was driven by organic changes in demand, not changes in supply.  Switching to EVs would act as a reduction in demand and therefore reduce overall oil usage, at least as compared to a world where vehicle transport required ICE vehicles.

Whenever I see a toy robot, I feel like a kid again. Not because of Transformers, but because I—a millennial and self-proclaimed Cartoon Network kid—grew up on Dexter's Lab, and man, did that show burrow its way into my brain. Who knows? Maybe if I hadn't been so awful at doing useful stuff like math and chemistry, Dexter might have compelled me to become a scientist or an engineer.

As you may have gathered from reading this, though, I didn't do that. I did, however, do the next best thing, apparently: I chose to write about technology. I say “next best” because this road, unbeknownst to me at the time, is one that led me straight to something that scratches that childhood itch just as much as lab coats and beakers: a big friggin' robotic Transformer.

Robosen Soundwave G1

The Soundwave G1 is an impressive robot with bad sound. For the Transformers superfans only.

Pros

Cons

When I first saw Robosen's new ultra-expensive, elaborate Transformer robot, the Soundwave G1, it was hard not to get excited. Not just because (duh) it's a Transformer robot, but because Soundwave shapeshifts into a speaker—a functional one.

In case you didn't catch my missive when this thing was launched, the Soundwave G1 takes Robosen's robotic Transformers (yes, there are many) a step further and features a Bluetooth speaker mode that can be used when Soundwave is all crumpled up in its cassette player form. That's sick for hardcore Transformer fans since it brings the original schtick of Soundwave to life, but also for me personally because I pay my bills in part by reviewing speakers.

In short, my interests collided here in a big way, which means I got a chance to test out Soundwave myself, and boy, do I have some thoughts.

There are really two ways you can review Robosen's Soundwave G1: as a toy and as a speaker. I'm going to try to do both right now, and for the sake of all the potential Transformers fans out there reading this, I am going to start with the fun stuff first. How, you might ask, is the Soundwave G1 as a toy? Answer: kind of sick.

This thing is a Robot, man—capital “R” intended. When you pick it up, you can feel all the robotics inside, which is because there are a lot. According to Robosen, there are “28 high-precision intelligent servo motors” and 84 custom microchips. That means when Soundwave starts moving around and doing his Transformer thing, it's really moving. The feet articulate, the arms move in two joints, the head pops out, and the shoulder-mounted “sonic cannon” articulates and lights up. Even the cassette player portion pops out for dramatic effect, though you cannot actually play real tapes with it, which is a bummer. In Robosens' defense, I can only imagine fitting a tape deck in this thing would be an engineering nightmare. In terms of look and feel, it's the robot toy most people my age wanted as a kid, and for $1,400, it damn well should be.

The Soundwave G1 also understands quite a few commands. With the help of a built-in microphone, you can shout at your expensive robot and get it to do things. Altogether, there are 48 pre-programmed voice commands that include stuff like “attack” or “defend,” which make the robot shoot with its included toy gun and gesture. There are also more Transformers-specific commands like “Megatron” or “Laserbeak,” in which the Soundwave G1 says stuff from the show while gesticulating. A fun fact here is that they got the original Soundwave voice actor, Frank Welker, to come in and do some voice acting for the robot.

The most impressive command of them all is the transform one, though. By shouting “Hey Soundwave, transform,” you get to watch the robot dramatically bend all of its limbs up and curl into a tape player from a robot mode or vice versa. It's wild, but also that leads me to my first and biggest downside of the Soundwave G1.

While I love the inclusion of a voice command feature, this was also easily the biggest point of frustration when playing the robot. I fear Soundwave, after all the years of laser battling with Autobots, may be a little hard of hearing. Time after time, I was forced to scream at this giant hunk of plastic, begging it to do stuff. I don't know what my record was for shouting “Hey Soundwave” without the robot acknowledging me, but I'm pretty sure I hit over a dozen. C'mon, Robosen; if I wanted to be agitated by a voice assistant, I would just talk to my Nest speaker at home.

To add to the frustration, I also find it really hard to understand what Soundwave G1 is saying. That's partially because canonically, Soundwave talks in a vocoder-like voice that blends synth and human speech, but also because the speakers aren't the best (which is something I'll get into more later).

With all that said, there is an app where you can punch in commands on your phone. These definitely work fine, and if you're sick of screaming into the void, they may actually be the best way to use the Soundwave G1. There's other stuff you can do in the companion app, too

Here, you can use a touchscreen D-pad to tell Soundwave to walk around (it can move left, right, forward, or backward), and you can even program your own actions. Action programming, I must warn you, is pretty far from intuitive, though I did have some minor success with using the block-based programming UI to get Soundwave to do simple stuff like twist its arms. It's a nice touch, but I'm willing to wager that most people aren't going to want to spend loads of time in the app programming this thing.

There's also an audio mode that, when selected in the app, automatically transforms the robot into the cassette mode and lets you play about two dozen tracks from the original cartoon. Honestly, that may be my favorite app-based touch since I'm a big fan of the original score with all of its obnoxious guitar and '80s riffage.

Lastly, there's a “mini theater” mode where Soundwave is meant to do what amounts to a short demo while you watch a video in the app, but I couldn't really get the feature to work correctly. After launching the mini theater feature and waiting for the demo to load, Soundwave did some thrashing about, but the in-app video wouldn't load. In Robosen's defense, I was using an early version of the app to test Soundwave, so maybe that had something to do with it? Either way, no dice for me.

As I mentioned before, there are two ways to review the Soundwave, and the second is as a Bluetooth speaker. By shouting at Soundwave to transform, you can use Robosen's robot as a Bluetooth speaker. All you have to do is pull up your phone's Bluetooth and connect, and boom, you're in business.

As I wrote when this robot was first announced, I was curious about whether the Soundwave G1 would actually sound decent. I mean, it's a toy, to be sure, but it is also $1,400, so decent sound isn't totally out of the question, right? Right?..

I'm sad to say my first inclination was correct; the Soundwave G1 sounds sort of bad. It's not unlistenable, but definitely not a speaker that you're going to want to use for anything other than the novelty of it all. Sound is pretty flat and one-dimensional, and for what I assume are engineering reasons, the sound actually emanates from the back of the robot when it's in cassette mode, which is not ideal for fidelity.

I will say, though, I think unintentionally, the crappy sound kind of works? It almost sounds lo-fi. It's bad enough that I sort of wish that Robosen had leaned into the badness, applying some kind of tape-like effect to the audio you listen to that makes it feel as though the '80s are alive and well. I mean, this thing doesn't actually play tapes, but what if it sounded like you were playing tapes? Now that'd be righteous.

A nice touch is the inclusion of physical buttons on the Soundwave G1, which can be pressed and used as you would on a tape player. There's a track skipping button (forward and back) as well as a play button and a stop button. There's also a record button that can actually record your voice! I may have to redact the exclamation point here, though, because I couldn't get Soundwave to record anything I said.

When I pressed the record button, it prompted me to record after the beep. I did. Then I pressed stop to stop the recording. When I listened back to my recordings in the app, though, or tried to play them from the robot by pressing the play button, I didn't hear much of anything. Maybe the microphone on my robotic son is defective? Maybe it's just poor quality? I don't know, but nothing I seemed to do forced Soundwave to listen to me. I don't speak Decepticon, apparently.

And even if I did speak Decepticon, I wouldn't have to speak very much of it. The battery on the Soundwave G1 is perhaps just as bad as batteries were in 1984 when Transformers aired. I think, if you're lucky, you'll get an hour and a half out of the Soundwave G1, and that's at lower volumes. I got 2 hours, but only 25 mins of that were actually spent playing music; the rest of the time, the Soundwave G1 was just chilling there in cassette mode. That bad battery can be a little dangerous, too. A few times while using the Sondwave G1, the battery ran out while the robot was standing, and the whole thing went limp, causing it to fall to the ground like a sack of robotic potatoes. Ouch.

This is all to say that you do not want to use the Soundwave G1 as a Bluetooth speaker in any sort of serious way, which is probably fine for most people. But if you, like me, entertained the idea that Soundwave would sound decent, you can rid yourself of that fantasy now.

Listen, who am I to tell you what to do with your money? I don't know how you live. To me, $1,400 is a lot of money. That's more than a brand new iPhone 17, or two Nintendo Switch 2s, or almost half the price of a Chevy Chevette in 1984.

But maybe you've been robbing banks with the Decepticons and have money to blow. And maybe you want to use a little bit of that cash on a robot that you can impress your friends with for five minutes. If you're that person, then I guess go for it: the Soundwave G1 is an impressive robot when it works, and you don't have to shout at it 400 times to transform. The Bluetooth speaker stuff is definitely a parlor trick, but as long as you know that going in, I'm going to say no harm, no foul.

I don't know, call me soft, but it's just hard to get mad at a robot transformer that I don't think most people are expecting to do much other than, well, transform. If you want a good Bluetooth speaker, go buy that; if you want a robot that makes you feel like a kid again, and you're wealthier than I'll ever be, then I guess do as Megatron does and go with the Soundwave G1.

This year marks the 40th anniversary of the Dragon Ball anime, which has persisted from Z to GT, Super, and the most recent series, Daima. For its next outing, we're returning to Super, with a brand new arc in the works dubbed Dragon Ball Super: The Galactic Patrol.

Announced during Japan's Dragon Ball Genkidamatsuri event, the new adventure will find Goku and Vegeta working with the titular organization. The Patrol are the galaxy's peacekeepers, and they need the help of the two Saiyans to face the arc's big bad, “Planet-Eater” Moro. It's currently in production and featured in an anniversary video highlighting the various anime shows and films spanning the franchise's history.

In the more immediate future, the anime's being continued with Dragon Ball Super: Beerus, an “enhanced” remake of the 2013 film, Battle of the Gods. This new version promises to be more faithful to Akira Toriyama's original ideas and make a better villaion out of Beerus. Look for it to hit this fall.

Finally, we got a look at the latest video game from Bandai Namco, codenamed “Age 1000.” The teaser opens with a white-haired man wearing a uniform with the Capsule Corp logo, after which “Akira Toriyama Presents” appears onscreen—and when the character's fingers flex and he comes to life, it suggests this game will have some of the last (if not the last) original characters made by Toriyama before his passing.

After he punches some holographic dummies, our unnamed character decides it's time to go Super Saiyan. The camera then zooms into his eyes, showing the outlines of franchise characters like Frieza, Cell, and Goku (obviously). It's that last one that gets our character revved up, but does that mean he's a descendant of Goku? We'll have to wait to find out more: the game itself comes out in 2027, and more info will be revealed at April's Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour.

With just a few months left before Super Mario Galaxy comes out, Nintendo held another Direct to reveal new information about the film, and show off a trailer.

Picking up after the first one, Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) have settled nicely into being the protectors of the Mushroom Kingdom. But when Bowser Jr. (Benny Safdie) comes looking to spring his dad (Jack Black) out of tiny prison, the brothers have to travel the cosmos to stop them. Along with a returning Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) and Toad (Keegan-Michael Key), they've a new ally in Brie Larson's Rosalina, another princess who lives in outer space and raises the Lumas.

But this new trailer is actually about Yoshi, and highlights how he'll fit in with the brothers and Toad. He's not the only dinosaur that'll be showing up: there's a brief tease of Birdo and a T.Rex that longtime Mario fans will remember from 2017's Super Mario Odyssey. During the stream, Shigeru Miyamoto teased that Yoshi and other “many familiar characters…will play active roles” in the film, so that's something to look forward to. Well, that and the new merch that'll be made for each of them.

Super Mario Galaxy arrives in theaters on April 1.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:tomshardware.com","Modder turns RTX 2080 Ti Hall of Fame into a supercharged 900W Titan RTX with transplanted core and memory — fully unlocked TU102 die with a 900W power limit hits 18k on 3DMark TimeSpy Extreme","https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/modder-turns-rtx-2080-ti-hall-of-fame-into-a-supercharged-900w-titan-rtx-fully-unlocked-tu102-die-with-a-900w-power-limit-hits-18k-on-3dmark-timespy-extreme","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 12:20:00 GMT","

The modder also unlocked the full bus width of the core, upgrading the GPU from 11GB of GDDR6 to 24GB.

The RTX 2080 Ti HoF is one of the most powerful RTX 20 series graphics cards that exists, but the artificial core and memory bus limits on the TU102 core always meant that the hardware has extra untapped potential under the hood. Modder Jiachen Liu on X decided to remedy this issue by transplanting an RTX Titan core and 24GB of GDDR6 memory. While he was at it, he also modified the power limit from 300W to 900W.

Armed with all these upgrades, the modified RTX 2080 TI HoF (or supercharged Titan RTX, whatever you want to call it) was recorded pushing a whopping 18,038 points on the graphics score for 3DMark TimeSpy Extreme. To understand just how crazy this score is, the average score for two Titan RTX graphics cards in SLI is around 17,000 points, and an average RTX 3090 score is around 14,000 points in TimeSpy Extreme.

The RTX 2080 Ti was the most powerful consumer-focused Turing graphics card for the RTX 20 series. The GPU came with 68 SMs, 4352 CUDA cores, 68 RT cores, 544 Tensor Cores, 272 TMUs, 5.5MB of L2 cache, 250W TDP, and 11GB of GDDR6 operating on a 352-bit interface. The Titan RTX was the most powerful Turing graphics card made that was geared towards prosumers, featuring 72 SMs, 4608 CUDA cores, 72 RT cores, 576 tensor cores, 288 TMUs, 6MB of L2 cache, and 24GB of GDDR6 operating on a 384-bit interface.

The only problem with the Titan RTX (just like past Titans) is that Nvidia never allowed AIB partners to make exotic variants with robust power delivery and high-end coolers capable of overclocking the Titan RTX to the same levels as other 20-series GPUs. Jiachen Liu's mod works around this problem by putting a Titan RTX core and 24GB of GDDR6 on a 2080 Ti HoF PCB. The modder chimed in a following X post that the HoF PCB and cooler allowed them to hit a sustained 2,150MHz on the core, which would be impossible on the stock Titan RTX board and cooler.

Again, all of this was done with one GPU. Maybe one day we'll see the same card paired in SLI with another card with the same Titan GPU swap. If that happens, we could see some new records being broken. 18,000 times two equates to a TimeSpy Extreme score that outperforms even an LN2 overclocked RTX 5090.

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

Trinity Rodman capped off an excellent week in style, scoring her first goal for the U.S. women's national team in nine months during the team's 6-0 win over Paraguay on Saturday that was defined by their second half dominance.

A young and inexperienced version of the USWNT commanded the game from the start but the tempo decreased midway through the first half, making the game's opening goal hard to come by. It did eventually come in first half stoppage time courtesy of Reilyn Turner, who connected with her Portland Thorns teammate Olivia Moultrie and scored from an angle to notch her first international goal on her debut.

The goals, then, came flooding. The USWNT scored four times in a 10 minute span to start the second half, the highlight of which was Rodman's goal to make it 4-0 in the 56th minute. Ally Sentnor also impressed with a brace bookending that 10 minute spell, while substitute Emma Sears bagged the sixth and final goal of the game less than 10 minutes after coming on.

Rodman played her first game for the national team since April, returning to the USWNT after an injury-plagued 2025 season. She was able to go 63 minutes, though, a sign that her fitness is trending in the right direction as she and her teammates begin to shake off the preseason rust. The goal marks another round of headlines for Rodman, who announced a new deal with the Washington Spirit on Thursday that makes her the highest-paid player in the history of women's soccer.

The USWNT close out their January camp with a friendly on Tuesday against Chile at Santa Barbara's Harder Stadium.

Well, that wasn't so bad in the end for the USWNT, wasn't it? A slow first half gave way for an uber-productive second half, one in which the team followed through with Emma Hayes' vision of a team that takes advantage of the opportunities in front of them. Ally Sentnor bagged a brace, Trinity Rodman returned to the scoresheet and Olivia Moultrie excelled in midfield but a lot of players showcased their talents today, making it a strong start for all in 2026.

78' The USWNT are not finished taking cracks at goal, unsurprisingly, the latest coming from substitute Maddie Dahlien in her first cap. She finds herself near the endline and takes an angular shot at Paraguay's goal, something that Patricia Lopez should handle but fumbles. Paraguay survive this time but at this point, the rhythm of the game is set and it's all USWNT, all the time.

72' The USWNT are not done scoring yet! Croix Bethune nick the ball off an opponent with ease and quickly, the ball is at Emma Sears' feet. She goes straight for goal, making her way into the box before hitting a pacy shot that goalkeeper Patricia Lopez cannot keep out.

63' USWNT head coach Emma Hayes makes all five of her remaining substitutes to close out the game. [clears throat] Emily Sams, Hal Hershfelt, Maddie Dahlien, Sam Menti and Emma Sears come on, Kennedy Wesley, Tara Rudd, Izzy Rodriguez, Lo'eau LaBonta and Trinity Rodman come off. Rodman passes off the armband to 20-year-old Claire Hutton, making her another first-time USWNT captain today.

57' You know the USWNT have found their rhythm when they score another goal while your average live-blogger is busy filling in the details on the previous goal. Tara Rudd connects again with an attacking teammate, this time Ally Sentnor, who is essentially alone in the box and beats goalkeeper Patricia Lopez with ease. The floodgates are officially open.

56' This game has officially slipped out of Paraguay's grasp. The USWNT benefit yet again from club teammates connecting well, this time Tara Rudd's long ball towards Trinity Rodman. Today's USWNT captain made a run into the box and was never going to miss from close range, scoring her first goal for the national team since April of last year -- and capping off an excellent week for her in style.

53' In quick succession, the USWNT have three! Croix Behune is denied of her first international goal moments earlier with an impressive point-blank save from Patricia Lopez but she is responsible for creating the USWNT's next goal. She first sends the ball to Olivia Moultire and then makes a run to free herself up, creating the pressure that forced Fiorela Martinez to send the ball into the back of the net for an own goal. That escalated quickly.

47' What a difference the halftime break can make. The USWNT may have struggled for the first goal but they wasted no time finding a second, with Ally Sentnor finishing things off. Again, a club and country connection was responsible here -- the Kansas City Current's Izzy Rodriguez slips the ball through traffic to find Sentnor, who also scored from an angle to double the USWNT's lead.

Emma Hayes said to expect changes and on that front, she is a woman of her word -- Croix Bethune is on for Reilyn Turner, the goalscorer, at halftime. Paraguay have also made a change in goal to start the second half, bringing on Patricia Lopez in the place of Cristina Recalde.

A recent retirement ceremony celebration is a halftime speed painting! Christen Press being honored with on here today. 

It may have taken a while but the USWNT have a deserved lead heading into the halftime break, the stats very clearly laying out their dominance - they had nearly 70% of the ball, took nine shots while facing just one and posted 1.44 expected goals to Paraguay's 0.05. The preseason vibes are hard to miss, though, playing a big role in the performance so far. The U.S. have not exactly made the most of their chances in front of goal and the tempo slipped at times. Reilyn Turner, though, has so far made the most of her debut with the game's only goal so far, a nice follow-up to a strong rookie season with the Portland Thorns.

45'+3 The long wait for a goal is finally over, with Reilyn Turner bagging a goal in her debut - and near her hometown of Lakewood, California! Olivia Moultrie spots club and country teammate Turner making a run and sends the ball to her left, the ball zooming past a few Paraguay players before meeting Turner. She then finishes from an angle, ensuring the USWNT have a lead going into the half.

40' The USWNT have stpped things up after a mid-tempo patch in the middle of this half but like many of their opportunities in front of goal, they end up winning a corner that they cannot do much with. Trinity Rodman and Reilyn Turner have had some notable chances but again, nothing is really coming off for the hosts - they have six shots, one on target but just 0.54 expected goals so far.

30' ...And just as I say that, the USWNT look a little dangerous in front of goal. Izzy Rodriguez darts down the wing, a reflection of the fact that she and Gisele Thompson are making those aggressive forward runs against Paraguay, and tries to connect with Trinity Rodman. The ball is in front of her but the timing's off so she cannot get a great hit on it. Rodman's definitely someone you can count on in these moments but again, it could just be the preseason vibes of the game - and the fact that she has not played for the USWNT since last April.

30' Half hour gone by on the clock, and there's been some disjointed play as to be expected. Emma Hayes alluded to this during yesterday's media availability, mentioning that we might see some things look ""a bit clunky."" 

Giesele Thompson has been fairly active when on the ball from the first whistle, and Reilyn Turner is hungry for a goal with her nose on the ball with good opportunities. The chemistry between Kansas City Current's Lo'eau LaBonta and Claire Hutton is notable, but it's their first game together since the Current's elimination from the NWSL playoffs in November.

26' The USWNT's quick start has tapered off a little bit, allowing Paraguay to settle into the match a bit more. It is not so much that the U.S. are not finding their connections in midfield but they feel a step too slow in creating chances, to the point that they have taken just one shot since the eighth minute and none since the 16th. None of their four shots have been on target so far, nor have they been of particularly high quality - they have generated just 0.35 expected goals so far. Perhaps it's a natural product of the preseason rust, but it really has slowed the tempo of the game.

14' There may technically be a newness to the lineup but the USWNT are moving smoothly in midfield, quickly setting up the attackers to create some chaos in front of goal. Trinity Rodman is an easy target for her teammates, who continue to send the ball her way after carving their way around Paraguayan opponents. There are different players responsible for the chaos, though - Olivia Moultrie and Lo'eau LaBonta have tried to connect with Rodman and Ally Sentnor has caused real problems for Paraguay while playing in and around the No. 10 role.

Paraguay's high line, while an ambitious choice, is making it easy for the USWNT to take advantage of their attacking opportunities. It feels like sooner rather than later that the hosts will find a breakthrough.

6' It takes almost no time at all for the USWNT to edge towards Paraguay's goal, with Gisele Thompson making an important run on the flank and Kennedy Wesley taking a shot that Paraguay 'keeper Cristina Recalde making the save and forcing the ball out for a corner. It's the first of two early corners for the hosts, each of them directed towards Trinity Rodman before Paraguay eventually clear the ball out of danger.

The USWNT's first game of the year is officially underway in Carson, California.

Christen Press is on the pitch at Dignity Health Sports Park in a familiar sight for U.S. Soccer ceremonies - a framed jersey with her name and number of caps (155), a bouquet of flowers in hand, federation dignitaries and Press' family members on the pitch ... and the player's dog, Bob! It's nice to see Bob partake in an important day for his mom.

Hello from USWNT vs. Paraguay at Dignity Health Sports Park! Christen Press spent some time with media in the mixed zone and here's what she had to share about Trinity Rodman

""Trinity is having a moment. She's having a very good week, and I think we're all really proud of her, and in a lot of ways, she does represent sort of the next phase, the next generation, in a big way, like her personally,"" Christen Press on Rodman. ""So much of what we all did as leaders and players on this team was to try to create a reality like the one that she has today, where she gets to be her full self and her big personality and make the money that she deserves and earns.

I think the pressure of playing for this team is real, and it will never go away, and that's the privilege. And I think you know, what I was taught on this team was to harness that and to turn it into my motivation and my discipline and to enjoy it. Enjoy it while you get it, because the pressure will go away. You won't always be on the national team. It's a shooting star career. The tournaments happen in a flash. But while you have the honor of bearing the weight of so many people in this country's hopes and dreams and joy on their Sundays. It's a really special thing, and I know she'll do us all proud.""

Christen Press, a member of the USWNT's 2015 and 2019 World Cup-winning teams and a Los Angeles native, will be honored pre-match following her retirement at the end of the 2025 NWSL season. Press becomes the latest accomplished veteran in a long line of them to have a moment such as this one, something Emma Hayes likes to use as a meeting point between a history-making version of the team and the current group of rising talents -- and also a chance for her to respect the legacies those players left behind.

Trinity Rodman is fit to start and, as anticipated, she will wear the armband for the USWNT. She is joined in the lineup by the likes of Mandy McGlynn in goal and Washington Spirit teammate Tara Rudd (formerly McKeown) in defense, while Reilyn Turner will earn her first cap via a starting role. Per the broadcast, it will be a 3-4-3 in possession and a 4-2-3-1 out of possession. Here's a look at the USWNT's look for today.

USWNT starting XI: Mandy McGlynn, Gisele Thompson, Tara Rudd, Kennedy Wesley, Izzy Rodriguez, Lo'eau LaBonta, Claire Hutton, Trinity Rodman, Ally Sentnor, Olivia Moultrie, Reilyn Turner

Substitutes: Claudia Dickey, Ayo Oke, Emily Sams, Riley Jackson, Croix Bethune, Hal Hershfelt, Kate Wiesner, Sally Menti, Emma Sears, Maddie Dahlien, Yazmeen Ryan, Jameese Joseph

Today's fixture marks Paraguay's third match against the USWNT, losing the previous two by lopsided scorelines in 2021. The visitors will be hoping for a better outing this time around with a team headlined by midfielder Claudia Martinez, who is reportedly set to join Trinity Rodman at the Washington Spirit in time for the 2026 season. Here's a look at Paraguay's team.

Paraguay starting XI: Cristina Recalde, Fiorela Martinez, Tania Riso, Maria Vega, Daysy Sanchez, Cindy Ramos, Danna Barcete, Limpia Fretes, Claudia Martinez, Griselda Garay, Fatima Acosta

Substitutes: Patricia Lopez, Naomi de Leon, Maria Tamay, Erika Cartaman, Yanina Servin, Milagros Rolon, Belen Talavera, Nabila Perruchino, Agustina Varela

The USWNT's first camp of the year falls outside of a FIFA window and lands just before Gotham FC's participation in the first-ever FIFA Women's Champions Cup, leaving Emma Hayes with plenty of spots to fill on her roster in the absence of several regulars. It means, though, that Hayes can continue her period of experimentation for at least another month and extend her plans for the national team beyond the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil and the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.

Emma Hayes revealed in her pre-match press conference on Friday that, should she be fit enough to start, Trinity Rodman will wear the captain's armband against Paraguay. The days where Rodman was a rising talent may not feel all that long ago but she enters the USWNT's first camp of the year as the most experienced player on the roster, quickly becoming a veteran in the process. Rodman said on Friday that she plans to fill the leadership void during this month's friendlies, adding a professional maturity to her game.

Read more on Rodman's new leadership status here.

Goalkeepers (3): Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign FC), Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals), Jordan Silkowitz (Bay FC)

Defenders (8): Jordyn Bugg (Seattle Reign FC), Ayo Oke (Denver Summit FC) Izzy Rodriguez (Kansas City Current), Tara Rudd (Washington Spirit), Emily Sams (Orlando Pride), Gisele Thompson (Angel City FC), Kennedy Wesley (San Diego Wave FC), Kate Wiesner (Washington Spirit)

Midfielders (8): Croix Bethune (Washington Spirit), Hal Hershfelt (Washington Spirit), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current1), Riley Jackson (North Carolina Courage), Lo'eau LaBonta (Kansas City Current), Sally Menti (Seattle Reign FC), Sam Meza (Seattle Reign FC), Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns FC)

Forwards (7): Maddie Dahlien (Seattle Reign FC), Jameese Joseph (Chicago Stars FC), Trinity Rodman (Washington Spirit), Yazmeen Ryan (Houston Dash), Emma Sears (Racing Louisville FC), Ally Sentnor (Kansas City Current), Reilyn Turner (Portland Thorns FC)

The winter break is officially over for the U.S. women's national team, who kick off a very important year with a friendly against Paraguay in the Los Angeles suburbs. The countdown to November's World Cup qualification tournament is officially underway, this month's friendlies - including Tuesday's against Chile in Santa Barbara - will offer an important chance for players to impress head coach Emma Hayes as she inches closer to that looming deadline.

Stick around for pre-match coverage and updates once the USWNT's first game of 2026 begins.

CARSON, Calif. (Jan. 24, 2026) – A debut day for forward Reilyn Turner followed by a deluge of second-half goals, with five arriving in a 12-minute span, powered the U.S. Women's National Team to a 6-0 victory against Paraguay at Dignity Health Sports Park, the most visited venue in USWNT program history and home of the LA Galaxy in Major League Soccer. 

The win kicks off 2026 for the U.S. ahead of SheBelieves Cup in March, three matches against Japan in April and World Cup Qualifying later this year. And the group accomplished tonight's victory and shutout with the least capped Starting XI in the last 25 years.

Forward Trinity Rodman made her highly anticipated return to the U.S. Women's National Team fresh off re-signing with the NWSL's Washington Spirit in a groundbreaking deal. On Saturday, the forward earned her 48th cap and first since April 5, 2025, when she scored to help the USWNT defeat Brazil 2-0 in Inglewood, Calif. 

At 23 years old, Rodman is the most experienced player on this January roster, leading the group in caps and goals (12). Against Paraguay, the Laguna Niguel, Calif. native sported the captain's armband for the first time in her career and led a Starting XI that averaged just 9.6 caps entering Saturday's match.

Joining Rodman in the starting lineup was Turner, a fellow Orange County native. The duo played 10 years of youth club soccer together for the SoCal Blues. Saturday marked the international debut for the dynamic Portland Thorns FC attacker who hails from nearby Laguna Beach, Calif. Turner was one of three players to debut on Saturday, with midfielder Sally Menti and and forward Maddie Dahlien, who subbed on in the second half, became the 287th and 288th players to earn caps for the Women's National Team.

Two of the nine SoCal natives on the January roster, Rodman and Turner were active early for the U.S. attack and both saw chances in the first half. The team broke through when Turner scored her first international goal in her first cap and first start in first-half stoppage time. The forward slotted a left-footed roller from the left side of the box to give the USWNT a boost before the halftime break and become the 25th player in program history to score in her international debut.

The USWNT carried the momentum from Turner's stoppage-time goal into the second half and opened the floodgates. Ally Sentnor, who started the game in the midfield and move to center forward, opened her 2026 scoring account with the second goal of the afternoon, and the fifth goal of her career, when the Kansas City Current midfielder delivered after an excellent combination between Izzy Rodriguez and Olivia Moultrie, with Rodriguez providing the assist.

A Paraguay own goal made possible by a pass on the ground from the left side into the middle and from pressure by midfielder Croix Bethune -- who subbed on for Turner at halftime -- put the U.S. ahead 3-0 in the 53rd minute. Three minutes later, Rodman capped off her monumental week with a goal of her own, the 12th of her career and first since 2025, which resulted in a jubilant celebration from tonight's captain. 

In the 58th minute, Sentnor chased down a long through ball from Gisele Thompson, the Angel City defender and Studio City, Calif. native, who played tonight in front of her hometown crowd. Sentnor finished a right-footed strike into the lower left corner to add to the U.S. lead and record her second career brace.

The five goals, starting with Turner's at the end of the first half, were scored at a remarkable clip over a 12-minute span.

In the 72nd minute, forward Emma Sears added her name to the long list of goalscorers on the day. After receiving a pass from Bethune, Sears took a couple dribbles and slid her shot past Patricia López, the Paraguayan goalkeeper who subbed on for Cristina Recalde at halftime. Sears' finish rounded off a swarm of goals for the U.S. Women's National Team and tallied the team's fourth straight clean sheet, going back to 2025.

The Americans held 70 percent of the possession on the day, took 19 shots, eight on goal, and did not allow a shot on goal from Paraguay the entire match. U.S. goalkeeper Mandy McGlynn, earning her fifth cap, played a full 90 minutes and wasn't called into action until the 42nd minute when she calmly collected a cross into the box from Paraguay.

Prior to kickoff at Dignity Health Sports Park, U.S. Soccer honored former USWNT forward and Los Angeles native Christen Press in a pre-match celebration. The two-time World Cup winner announced her retirement from professional soccer last fall. Press concluded her international career with 155 caps and ranks No. 9 all-time in goals for the program with 64. 

Next, the U.S. Women's National Team heads 117 miles north – stadium to stadium – to face another South American opponent, taking on Chile at Harder Stadium on Santa Barbara, Calif., on Tuesday, Jan. 27 in the final tune-up before the SheBelieves Cup (Click here to view tickets | 7 p.m. PT / 10 p.m. ET on TBS and HBO Max in English, Universo and Peacock in Spanish, and on the radio in English on Westwood One and in Spanish on Futbol de Primera).

USA – REILYN TURNER (OLIVIA MOULTRIE), 45+3rd minute: The U.S. battled in the midfield to win a loose ball and advance the attack. Claire Hutton found Moultrie, and the young midfielder deftly played a through ball to Turner making a diagonal run on the left side of the pitch. Turner used her right foot to cut back and put the ball on her left. From about eight yards from goal at a difficult angle, the forward slid a low shot with her left foot that rolled inside the near post and into lower left corner of the goal. USA 1, PAR 0

USA – ALLY SENTNOR (IZZY RODRIGUEZ), 47th minute: After Olivia Moultrie and Rodriguez combined nicely on the left wing, Rodriguez slipped a pass into the path of Sentnor slashing inside the box. The midfielder lined up her first-time shot with her left foot from the left side of the 18-yard box. Her firm strike caught the tip of the goalkeeper's hands and sailed into the back of the net. USA 2, PAR 0

USA – OWN GOAL (53rd minute): Croix Bethune made a delicious turn with the ball at her feet to accelerate the U.S. attack out of the midfield. She passed ahead to Sentnor, who played a sharp pass first-time to Moultrie on the left. A Paraguayan defender redirected Moultrie's pass and the deflection carried into the back of the net for an own goal. USA 3, PAR 0

USA – TRINITY RODMAN (TARA RUDD), 56th minute: This goal came off a combination of two Washington Spirit players. With space on the backline inside the U.S. attacking half, Rudd dropped a ball over-the-top and into the box for Rodman. The forward took one touch to corral the ball, then used her second to set up a left-footed shot from just outside the edge of the six-yard box. She slammed home a low, left-footed strike into the right corner of the net to grab a goal in her first match as captain. USA 4, PAR 0

USA – ALLY SENTNOR (GISELE THOMPSON), 57th minute: Out of the back, Thompson thread a long vertical ball through the Paraguayan defense for Sentnor. The midfielder took one dribble inside the box and struck a low shot with her right foot that skipped into the left side netting to record her brace on the day, the second of her international career. USA 5, PAR 0

USA – EMMA SEARS (CROIX BETHUNE), 72nd: Bethune created a takeaway right outside the 18-yard box to lead to a quick counter for the U.S. Bethune poked the ball to her right to Sears. The forward picked up where she left off last season as the highest-scoring American in the NWSL. Sears took two dribbles – one short, one long – to fire a low strike with her right foot that rolled into the left, lower corner. USA 6, PAR 0

Reilyn Turner and Trinity Rodman started at the front, while Ally Sentnor, Olivia Moultrie, Lo'eau LaBonta, and Claire Hutton took the midfield. The defensive line was made up of Kennedy Wesley, Tara Rudd, Gisele Thompson, and Izzy Rodriguez. Mandy McGlynn earned her 5th cap as goalkeeper. 

This was the least-capped starting lineup, averaging 9.6 caps, for the USWNT in 25 years. Turner, Sally Menti, and Maddie Dahlien earned their first caps today.

The Americans created several chances in the first half, but nothing came to fruition until Turner, assisted by fellow Portland Thorns teammate Moultrie, slotted in her debut goal at an angle during stoppage time. Turner is the 25th player in USWNT history to score in her international debut. 

The first half ended with nine shots by the U.S., with only two on target.

Croix Bethune replaced Turner to start the second half. Paraguay also subbed out their goalkeeper at the half. Momentum picked up tremendously in the second half. Sentnor scored a goal in the opening two minutes, and then it was off to the races. Just a few minutes later, Bethune's pressure in the box forced an own goal for Paraguay.

Later on, Rodman received the ball (assisted by Rudd) in the box and slipped it past Paraguay's keeper into the right corner of the net. 

Trinity Rodman asked Emma Hayes at the half to give her more minutes bc she really wanted to hit the celly

Hayes: She asked me to mirror it, and I said, “I'm 49 yrs of age, there's no chance I'm doing that—my son's in the stands.”

The score increased to 5-0 after Thompson passed the ball up from the halfway line to Sentnor, who received it in the box after running past her defender and effortlessly kicking it past the goalie.

Hayes made the rest of her available substitutions at the 63rd minute: Hal Hershfelt (Rudd), Menti (LaBonta), Emily Sams (Rodman), Dahlien (Rodriguez), Emma Sears (Wesley).

The last goal of the day was provided by Sears in the 73rd minute. 

Not only did Rodman score in her return, she also captained the team. Her 48th cap is only her second appearance since winning Olympic gold in 2024, yet she is the highest-capped player on the camp's roster.

When asked by The Blazing Musket how her veteran presence has impacted the rest of the players, Hayes said she told Rodman at the beginning of camp that she would be captain.

Claire Hutton (who was handed the captain's armband after Rodman subbed out) and Emily Sams were also given leadership responsibilities. 

Hayes is aware that the lack of experience in the current group may not immediately translate to good chemistry on the field. 

“Sometimes I think it will look clunky,” she said before the game. “I think there might be moments that they're so keen to prove because there's limited opportunities.”

This window will be primarily used to assess the player's skills to then identify the core group that will be named to future rosters, namely for World Cup qualifying at the end of the year, as well as the SheBelieves Cup in March. 

Following the game, the coach said that while her team held 70% of the possession throughout the game, they fell short when it came to execution in the final third. The players took a total of 19 shots, eight being on goal. 

The day doubled as a celebration of Christen Press and her contribution to the game as fans received CP23 bobbleheads when entering the venue. The Los Angeles native was honored in a pre-game retirement ceremony, joined by her sister and father, as well as wife Tobin Heath (and pet dog Bob). Press announced her retirement late last year and ended her national team career with 155 caps and 64 goals. 

“A moment like this gives you sort of the opportunity to process and integrate the reality of, ‘I'm no longer a human doing. I'm a human being,” she said before the ceremony. 

Christen Press said she loves and is very proud of her bobblehead.

She gave several rounds of feedback including making her ponytail longer.

Though Press has enjoyed her time off from the sport, there are a multitude of details from being a professional soccer player that she mourns.

“I'm going to miss that I could do something so well that I felt like no one else could do,” she said. “It feels like a disservice to not do something you're really, really good at.”

The USWNT will face Chile on Tuesday, Jan. 27 in Santa Barbara, California.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Dahlien and Menti Make USWNT Debuts in 6-0 Win Over Paraguay","https://www.reignfc.com/news/92cj867dmnr1k8iz66xuztdif108s4","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 01:00:26 GMT","

After an exciting pre-game announcement that Seattle is set to host the United States Women's National Team in a fierce matchup against longtime rival Japan at Lumen Field on April 14, the U.S. Women's National Team downed Paraguay 6-0 in the first of two friendly matches to close out the squad's January camp. 

Seattle Reign FC, alongside the Washington Spirit, led all NWSL teams in call ups for the January window, with five apiece. The Reign saw goalkeeper Claudia Dickey, defender Jordyn Bugg and midfielder Sam Meza selected to join the Stars and Stripes once again, in addition to midfielder Sally Menti and Maddie Dahlien, who both received their first-ever senior national team inclusions. 

Against Paraguay, Dahlien, Dickey and Menti were available off the bench to start the match, eagerly awaiting the action to come in the second half. 

The United States got off to a hot start, immediately getting into the offensive third to challenge Paraguay in just the third all-time meeting between the two teams. Despite the U.S. outshooting Paraguay and enjoying the lion's share of possession in the first 45 minnutes, it took until the third minute of stoppage time for Reilyn Turner to break the deadlock between the two teams. Her first-ever goal for the nation sent the United States into the locker room up 1-0. 

After the halftime break, Head Coach Emma Hayes made one immediate adjustment, bringing Croix Bethune onto the field for Turner. It was clear from the first whistle of the half that United States was determined to get on the board again – and fast. 

It took just two minutes for Ally Sentnor to open the scoring of the half and from there, the United States did not slow down, adding four more goals before the end of the match. 

In the 63rd minute of the match, Reign FC's own Dahlien and Menti subbed onto the pitch, to make their first-ever appearances for the United States Women's National Team and bringing the number of debuts under Hayes to 30. 

The debutant duo dawned number 21 and 17 respectively as they immediately settled into the match. A little over ten minutes into their shift, Dahlien proved to be a problem for Paraguay, terrorizing the left side of the field with her pace, paired with her crafty footwork on the ball. 

From the outside of the field, the 21-year-old beat her defender and sliced a ball into the box, where her teammates were waiting to pounce, but much to the team's dismay, were instead flagged offside. Despite the play being stopped, the Edina, Minnesota native's skill was on full display, giving fans and foes alike something to keep an eye on. 

Seattle's duo connected just two minutes later, as Dahlien once again tore down the left side of the field and spun her defender to advance toward the touchline and cross the ball. Her near post service forced Paraguay's goalkeeper to take action. She bobbled the ball, allowing Menti to nearly tap it into the back of the net, but not quite. 

Menti had another near chance in the final ten minutes of the match as Sentnor served a ball from the right side of the box, scoping out her late run into the center of the box. Menti connected with the ball, sending it just wide to the left of goal. 

Seven minutes later, the referee blew the final whistle, closing out the United States Women's National Team's first win of 2026, as well as Dahlien and Menti's first caps with the squad. 

The USWNT plays one more match to conclude January camp, taking on Chile at Harder Stadium in Santa Barbara, California on Tuesday, January 27 at 7:00 p.m. PT. Follow along with the action on TBS and HBO Max in English, Universo and Peacock in Spanish, and on the radio in English on Westwood One and in Spanish on Futbol de Primera.

 This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here. 

Christen Press welcomed herself to the U.S. women's soccer team by scoring twice in her debut in the first game of 2013. The team said goodbye Saturday at Dignity Health Sports Park, honoring Press before its first game of 2026, a 6-0 win over Paraguay.

In between, Press played 154 more times for the U.S., winning two World Cups, an Olympic bronze medal and scoring 62 more goals, retiring as the ninth-leading scorer in  team history.

But  those are just numbers because as good as Press was, she wants to be remembered for the legacy she left behind, for the barriers she broke, for the inspiration she continues to provide for  players who  followed her to the national team.

 Soccer 

As much as U.S. women's national soccer team coach Emma Hayes would like to have her full roster at the ready, having several veteran players out presents an opportunity.

“Well, it's sort of the point, right?” she said ahead of Saturday's farewell ceremony before a crowd of 19,397. “I feel really lucky that I had the opportunity to play long enough to overlap with some of these young players and be able to see the growth of the game, how far it's come, and be able to see what the next generation of player feels like.

“It's different, and it's going to take different things for people to have success.”

Talk about following in Press' footsteps: The first score Saturday came from Reilyn Turner of the Portland Thorns, like Press a Southern California native who scored her first U.S.  goal on a left-footed shot in the first half of her international debut. The second goal, less than two minutes into the second half, came from Kansas City's Ally Sentnor.

And that opened the floodgates, with the U.S. getting an own goal from Paraguay's Fiorella Martínez followed by scores from Trinity Rodman — who was celebrating the three-year contract, reported to be worth a record $6 million, she signed Thursday with the Washington Spirit — a second goal from Sentnor and another from Emma Sears.

Press scored her final international goal in the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. Ten months later, playing with Angel City FC in the NWSL, she shredded the anterior cruciate ligament  in her right knee, an injury that required four surgeries and nearly 25 months to repair. She never played another game for the national team and made just three more starts for Angel City before announcing her retirement last October.

By then Press, 37, had made the transition from soccer star to businesswoman and media personality with Re-Inc, a gender-neutral community-driven fashion brand, and the Re-Cap Show,  an  award-winning soccer podcast, both of which she runs with wife and former teammate Tobin Heath.

That, Press  said, will continue to provide her with a link to the game.

“We're so integrated into the women's sports ecosystem, through podcasts, through merchandise and through the women's soccer community,” she said. “I have spent a lot of time looking at the business of women's sports and how we need to reimagine it.

“In a dream world, I'd be able to continue to influence the ecosystem as a businessperson.”

Press got her start in soccer in the Palos Verdes Peninsula, about a dozen miles from where her career officially ended Saturday in Carson. As a preschooler she played with older kids in co-ed league because one team was short a girl.

“I didn't touch the ball once,” she remembered years later. “I picked daisies and waved to my mom.”

She went on to win two CIF Southern Section titles at the Chadwick School and a Hermann Trophy at Stanford before starting a club career that took her to eight teams in three countries. With the national team she went to three Olympics, won World Cups and played a key role in the landmark lawsuit against U.S. Soccer that ended with the women earning equal pay with the men's team.

It's a résumé that already is challenging the next generation of national team players.

“I admired her for a long time,” said Seattle Reign winger Maddie Dahlien, 21, who made her national team debut Saturday. “She made a name for herself a little later. You never know when your opportunity will be. So make the most of it when it comes.”

U.S. coach Emma Hayes never had a chance to work directly with Press, though she wanted to bring her overseas to Chelsea FC when Hayes managed there and Press was looking to move to the Women's Super League.

“I've always admired her and thought what a fantastic football player she is. Very different to what was a more traditional American forward at the time,” Hayes said. “What she's achieved, as well-traveled as she is, what an honor to be coaching on the day she gets celebrated in her hometown.”

For Press, it was a celebration that marked the transition from one stage of  life to the next. And, she acknowledged, there are a few things she's going to miss.

“I am so sad that I don't play soccer anymore,” she said. “I miss training. I miss being on a team, being around young people. I miss being outside every day. I miss the grass. I miss the discipline and ritual that football brings to my life.”

“I like to talk about all the things that I miss, because I think ‘I'm retired. It's easy now.' No. I had the best job in the world. And it's an irreplaceable job.”

USWNT manager Emma Hayes talks about Trinity Rodman embracing the captaincy role and adds that Claire Hutton is a captain in the making. (1:08)

United States women's national team coach Emma Hayes heralded a ""fresh start"" for Trinity Rodman after the forward scored in just her second match since the 2024 Olympics in Saturday's 6-0 rout of Paraguay.

The goal for Rodman capped off a memorable week, coming days after she signed a new contract with the Washington Spirit that, according to her agent, makes her the highest-paid women's player in the world.

The match in Carson, California, was her first for the U.S. since a 2-0 friendly win against Brazil this past April, which was her only international appearance in 2025 because of back and knee injuries.

""I'm happy for her, I really am,"" Hayes said. ""It was a hard year, as we know. And she's ready to move forward, which I think today symbolizes that this is a fresh year. It's a fresh start for her.

""She's settled, she's happy. I think knowing what her future is, this is a big weight off of her shoulders.""

Rodman was dangerous on the right flank throughout the match, and her 56th-minute tally saw her collect a ball on the right wing from defender Tara Rudd, cut inside and sneak her shot just inside the near post. She followed up the goal with a dance that she tried, and failed, to get Hayes to mirror on the U.S. sideline.

""The whole game, was telling Tara, I was like, 'Please, play one over the top. Come on, we got this,'"" Rodman said in a postmatch interview on the TNT broadcast.

""And then she again just had so much time, and I finally just called for it, played a perfect little ball, cut it back, and then when it went in, I was like, 'Alright, it's my time to shine.'""

The U.S. dominated from start to finish, but the finishing touch proved elusive in the first half until Reilyn Turner -- who was one of three players making their USWNT debut -- converted in first-half stoppage time.

That prompted a deluge of goals in the second half, with Ally Sentnor scoring twice and Rodman, Emma Sears and a Fiorella Martínez own goal adding to the scoreline for the USWNT.

Hayes noted that the team is basically in preseason, which explains some of the rust the players showed, including Rodman.

But the match was also notable for the fact that Rodman was named captain. And Hayes said she felt Rodman did well in the role for the 63 minutes that she was on the field, as did Claire Hutton, who took over as captain after Rodman exited the match.

""People like responsibility,"" Hayes said. ""So to give them that was only going to add value to their performances because they care about the team, they care about the crest, and I think [Rodman] did a great job of ensuring we carry on our customs and our traditions and by scoring a goal and signing off like that is always great for the fans.

""She knows how important it is to produce for our fans.""

The U.S. will face Chile on Tuesday in Santa Barbara, California, and Hayes is keen to see the team improve on Saturday's performance.

""I think for the amount of possession we grew to have in the first half, the decision into the final third, and the execution in the final third was where we fell short,"" Hayes said.

""So I think focusing on that is important. I think we do work the ball into the right areas. I think just getting that last part right ... I also think that part does take the longest and with it being only a week in preseason, I mean six goals isn't too bad for their first game.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Lucas Vázquez (Curtis, 1991) has made a comeback through the front door. After months of ostracism following an untimely injury, the Spanish international returned to Kasper Hjulmand's starting XI, and he couldn't have done it in a more decisive way: netting the winning goal against Werder Bremen (1-0).





It had been a long time since the '21' felt the heat of a Bundesliga start. His last league start dated back to October 4, 2025, against Union Berlin. Since then, a void. However, after getting back into rhythm in the Champions League against Olympiacos, Hjulmand decided to bet on the veteran ex-Madridista in a 100% Spanish right flank alongside Aleix García and Alejandro Grimaldo.









A Goal for the Personal History Books

The defining moment arrived in the 37th minute. Lucas received the ball from Quansah hugging the touchline—his natural habitat. With the clinical vision of a man who has played 402 elite matches, he found Maza at the edge of the box, who returned a pinpoint wall-pass. In the one-on-one, Vázquez was clinical, beating Backhaus with a surgical cross-shot.

This goal is far from ordinary. It is his first in a Bayer Leverkusen shirt and shatters an astonishing statistic: to find a goal scored by Lucas away from the Santiago Bernabéu, you have to travel back in time to April 17, 2015, during his spell at Espanyol against Levante. Exactly 3,935 days have passed since then.





Leverkusen Sets Its Sights on Europe

With this victory, the 'Factory Squad' secures its place in sixth position with 32 points. Although Bayern's lead remains light-years away (18 points), the recovery of Lucas Vázquez provides Hjulmand with a high-caliber asset for the season's home stretch. The 'utility man' from Curtis is back, and Germany now knows exactly what he is capable of.

“You don't have the cards,” repeated Donald Trump during Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky's now infamous White House visit last year. And there, in one sentence, was the best window into why a once unthinkable World Cup boycott has suddenly become a talking point among European politicians and football administrators.

With Trump threatening to annex part of Denmark, what better card do they have? A World Cup without Denmark – who still face two potential play-off rounds to get there – is one thing but just imagine if the European part of the Nato alliance became sufficiently outraged by a turn of events? In a stroke, the winners of 12 of the 22 World Cups (Spain, France, Germany, Italy and England) would be sidelined; enough to destroy the tournament.

The biggest nation to have a senior football official speak up so far is four-time champions Germany, with DFB vice-president Oke Göttlich saying that the time “has definitely come” to consider a huge sporting sanction. “What were the justifications for the boycotts of the Olympic Games in the 1980s?” asked Göttlich. “By my reckoning the potential threat is greater now. We need to have this discussion. Qatar [the 2022 World Cup] was too political for everyone and now we're completely apolitical? That's something that really, really, really bothers me. As organisations and society, we're forgetting how to set taboos and boundaries, and how to defend values.”

Whether a united response could ever be mustered remains questionable but you can only imagine how much Trump, the man who so revelled in sharing the winners' stage at the Club World Cup before receiving his Fifa Peace Prize in December, would hate an attack on a five-week show that will culminate with him presenting sport's most famous trophy.

As ever with Trump, no one really knows what might come next and there are significant other issues, not least an immigration policy that is expected to exclude fans travelling to the US from four qualified countries in Haiti, Iran, Senegal and the Ivory Coast.

Add in the spectre of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents patrolling the streets – and two fatal shootings in Minneapolis this month – and you can be sure some fans will be reassessing whether the already huge outlay on ticket prices is worth it. Trump has even suggested that he may move matches from cities if their governors or mayors do not “behave”.

Anja Lilli Beikes, a board member of the Danish Football Fan Association, said that there had been concern among their members about security and dynamic ticket prices even before the escalated Greenland threats.

“The US is very unpopular in Denmark at the moment,” she said. “During the last year Danish travel companies experienced a huge fall in the sale of trips to the US. Lots of football fans are discussing whether Denmark should actually boycott the World Cup because Fifa is also enormously unpopular in Denmark.

“Honestly – and this is my personal opinion – I do not think that many Danish fans will come to the World Cup if we qualify. Some fans would maybe travel to the two matches in Mexico but I do not think we will see many Danish fans in the US. I, and some of my fellow fans, actually think it would probably be better not to qualify.”

Fifa has itself moved in recent days to dispel fears that last week's suspension of immigrant visas from 75 countries – including the World Cup's most successful country Brazil – would directly affect the tournament.

Fifa president Gianni Infantino, who was in Davos this week enthusiastically supporting Trump's Board of Peace that now includes the Manchester City chair Khaldoon Al Mubarak, said the US would “welcome the world next summer”.

The US State Department has also stressed that the visa suspension “does not apply to non-immigrant visas, such as those for tourists, athletes and their families, and media professionals”.

A Fifa “Prioritised Appointment Scheduling System” – or Fifa Pass – went live on Tuesday so that ticket holders can access priority visa appointments. It is also stressed that even the complete or partial travel bans on Iran, Haiti, Senegal and Ivory Coast will not affect players or support staff.

It has not gone unnoticed, however, that the Senegalese women's basketball team cancelled a training camp in the US last year after five players and six staff members had their visa applications rejected. Some members of the Ethiopian team for the world cross-country championships were also denied visas earlier this month, while the South Korean baseball player Lee Jung-hoo was briefly detained on Thursday.

It is understood that the Ethiopian athletes were denied entry for a variety of reasons, including missed deadlines and forms, but there is concern that suggestions about even stricter vetting, such as social media records and extensive past contact details, could become prohibitive to some fans.

The New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani, intends to lobby Trump over travel bans. “It's something that I hope will change,” Mamdani told the New York Times after hosting members of the Senegalese community in New York for the Africa Cup of Nations final last Sunday.

Ivory Coast coach Emerse Faé also believes the situation is potentially fluid. “Things will be sorted out by the time of the World Cup,” he said. “It would be a real shame – especially since the World Cup only comes around every four years – not to let our supporters come and experience this celebration.”

FairSquare, the human rights body that campaigned over workers' rights in Qatar, has co-ordinated a letter from 90 civil society groups in the US to Fifa.

It warned that the World Cup risked becoming a “public relations tool to whitewash the reputation of an increasingly authoritarian government”, highlighting what it called “repressive” executive orders and policy changes since Trump's return to power a year ago.

“It was a letter to Fifa basically saying, ‘Look you need to pay attention to this because millions of people are going to come into this country and be at risk',” said Nick McGeehan, a director at FairSquare. “You would understand if people had concerns about going into the States right now, given how out of control some of the US law enforcement agencies appear to be.

“If you're looking at levers to pull to dissuade Trump from these sort of wild expansionist notions he has, it makes a lot of sense that the World Cup would be one thing that people would look at. He's a TV guy and this is his chance to play a central role in the greatest show on earth.

“The broader point is, ‘Will Fifa do anything about either of these issues?' To which the answer is probably a resounding, ‘Absolutely not.'”

There is certainly no public sign of any concern from Fifa or the US administration.“The president has continued to focus on not just the 11 American cities hosting World Cup games, but all of our American cities to make sure he's doing everything possible to make it safe and secure,” said Andrew Guiliani, who is heading the White House's World Cup Task Force.

“He understands the size of the World Cup and how there's no event in the world like it. He's enforcing immigration policies from an illegal immigration standpoint. But if you come through the right process, he wants as many people to come here as possible.”

Infantino has previously said that “any team, including the supporters and officials of that team… need to have access to the country, otherwise there is no World Cup”. Visa and immigration policies, Fifa now stresses, are a matter for each host nation. It also emphasises the large communities of people from Haiti, Iran, Senegal and Ivory Coast who are legally residing in the US and expected to attend matches, as well as exemptions for dual citizens and those with a passport from a non-designated country.

Fifa points to its 500 million ticket requests as evidence that fans are not being put off. “In 100 years of World Cup history, Fifa has sold around 50 million tickets in total,” said Infantino. “We have the request for 1,000 years of World Cups at once. People have trust. They want to travel. They want to go.”

Of those 500 million requests, most have come from Germany, England, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Argentina and Colombia. The US is hosting 75 per cent of all the matches, but it is perhaps significant that three of the most requested fixtures are being staged in Mexico and Canada.

While Infantino has been criticised for his relationship with Trump – as well as the extraordinary carry-on at the World Cup draw, he has been a frequent visitor to the Oval Office – some Fifa observers simply argue that he is being smart.

“People say sport and politics don't mix – but they're living in cloud-cuckoo land,” said one prominent former football administrator who, while acknowledging that he has never seen anything like this “sucking up”, suggests that Infantino has simply calculated that a good personal relationship is vital to keeping the show on the road.

“I think maybe Gianni is fearful – he's seen this turbulence coming down the road since Trump was elected president,” says the the former Football Association executive.

The counter argument, which was being widely outlined this week following the Greenland row, was that Trump understands only strength and leverage. “We need to try and work out what makes this man tick,” said the Conservative MP Simon Hoare. “He is thin-skinned, he has an ego. Should the state visit go ahead this year? Should football teams play in American stadiums for the World Cup? These are things which would embarrass the president at home. We now need to fight fire with fire.”

Similar arguments were also made in France and Germany, although it should be stressed that no government has spoken so stridently. France sports minister Marina Ferrari said that there was “no intention of boycotting” the World Cup while the Foreign Secretary, Yvette Cooper, emphasised diplomacy, claiming that this approach had already secured positive outcomes on tariffs and Ukraine.

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch was even more emphatic. “Anyone who's trying to stop England and Scotland from going to the World Cup needs to sit down and have their heads examined,” she said. “The World Cup is a global event. It's not an American event.”

The most recent precedent of a British government pushing for a sporting boycott of this magnitude was the 1980 Moscow Olympics when Margaret Thatcher's pressure was ultimately resisted by the British Olympic Association.

Should international relations deteriorate to the extent that it ever became a serious proposition again, most still expect the same outcome. “My instinct is that they [the FAs of England and Scotland] would move heaven and earth to go,” said the former FA leader. “There's no purpose in a boycott unless it's an effective boycott. Good luck, for example, with going to Rome and saying to the Italians: ‘Support our boycott.' I think achieving a meaningful consensus would be extremely difficult.”

Liverpool have made contact with Xabi Alonso's representatives to gauge his interest in becoming the club's next manager, reports in Spain claim.

The Spaniard was in contention to succeed Jürgen Klopp when the German opted to step down at the conclusion of the 2023–24 season, but decided to remain in charge of Bayer Leverkusen, who he had just led to a first-ever Bundesliga title while going unbeaten.

Liverpool pivoted to poach Arne Slot from Feyenoord, and went on to lift the Premier League title in the Dutchman's first season in charge. Alonso, meanwhile, wasn't able to best Bayern Munich for a second straight year, but did enough to convince the hierarchy of Real Madrid that he should be the person to replace the long-serving Carlo Ancelotti.

Ultimately, Alonso's return to Spain proved to be an unmitigated disaster. Under pressure from the get-go, Real Madrid were humiliated by Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup, losing 4–0, and Alonso quickly saw his authority undermined by a dressing room of players who weren't afraid to show their frustrations towards his decisions. He was sacked in mid-January after losing to Barcelona in the final of the Spanish Super Cup.

Less than two weeks after his axing, Spanish publication AS report that Liverpool have been in contact with Alonso's camp, as they explore their own options after an indifferent second season under Slot.

Alonso has made no secret in the past that he'd be open to returning to Liverpool. He spent five years at the club as a player from 2004–09, winning the Champions League and Super Cup in 2005, and built a strong connection with supporters.

“Of course there is a bond with my former club, but for now this is my place,” Alonso said in December, when he was still employed as Real Madrid's manager. “In future, you never know what might happen.”

That proved to be true as little over a month later Alonso was given the boot by Real Madrid president Florentino Pérez. Club sources have maintained the separation was mutual, but that version of events has been wildly disputed in the press.

The report from AS indicates nothing has changed in regards to Alonso's recent comments. Liverpool's approach is said to have been met with a “positive response,” reiterating their belief that strong options are out there should Slot's position become untenable.

The big question is whether Liverpool are prepared to part ways with Slot. He delivered an unexpected Premier League title in his maiden campaign, when many felt that both he and the club would need to acclimatise to the departure of Klopp.

Consequently, Liverpool found themselves in a position they didn't expect to be in and bumped up their plans of a squad overhaul. They spent over £400 million ($538.9 million) on new players, breaking the British transfer record twice to sign Florian Wirtz and then Alexander Isak, and were the overwhelming favourites to retain their crown in the eyes of many pundits, supporters and neutral onlookers.

Instead, Liverpool have lost their way this season, failing to properly integrate their new signings—injuries have played a major part—and get them up to speed. They've also had to deal with the sudden, tragic death of forward Diogo Jota in July.

At the time of writing, Liverpool have lost 10 times across all competitions from 34 matches played, winning just half (17). They've already been beaten seven times in the Premier League—Saturday's 3–2 defeat to Bournemouth their most recent arrear—which is three more than they lost in the entirety of last season.

The pressure is building on Slot, with disjointed performances and an alarming amount of goals conceded the primary concern, and there's been suggestions he could be removed from his role. Spanish media suggest he'll be given until the season's end, by which time a decision will be made on whether to formally pursue Alonso—it's unlikely he'll take another job in the meantime and will instead enjoy some time off before getting back on the touchline.

Another year, another quadruple attempt. You can set your watch by them. Every January, some clever-clogs team will be chasing the quadruple before shamefully ending up with something embarrassing like only the Premier League and Champions League to show for it. Mortifying.

Of course, there's a good reason that the Full Quad in the world's only proper football, which is obviously English football, and the four proper trophies available – Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, Carabao Cup – has never been done. It is almost impossibly difficult. There is literally no shame in failing to complete it; that you can get past the halfway point of the season with something so impossible still theoretically possible is itself extraordinary.

And Arsenal are right now among the less convoluted quad-chasers. They are top of the Premier League and top of the Champions League. They are current favourites in each of the four competitions. It really might happen. Except: it won't. Because it never does.

But that thought set us upon another thought: what is the best quadruple that has actually happened? We have, through necessity, allowed all manner of bullsh*t pots into this, but we have limited ourselves to Europe's top five leagues for our own sanity.

Unfortunately, that does mean no place for Celtic, whose 1966/67 Quintuple contains all the proper ingredients (European Cup, Scottish League, Scottish Cup, Scottish League Cup) as well as a Glasgow Cup which, given the historical if not current nature of Scottish fitba, is at least as good as a League Cup probably. But if we included them, we'd have gone down a long, arduous yet inevitable road that leads directly to Linfield's 1961/62 Septuple and pure delirious madness. So we haven't. Soz.

 

A Quadruple containing neither European nor domestic league glory? F*** all the way off, you cheeky scamps. You're trying to pull a fast one here and we'll not have it. Quadruple? Notruple more like.

 

This was Pep Guardiola's Barcelona at the peak of their powers and an indisputably great side, no doubt about that. They don't need a Quadruple to prove it. Which is just as well, because this is still firmly in tinpot territory. We'll give you La Liga, obviously, especially after losing just once all season and still only edging out Real Madrid by three points in an epic tussle. But the rule that any cup containing the word ‘Super' is bobbins is immutable and in play twice here.

The UEFA and Spanish Super Cups are (or were at the time) both two-team low-wattage affairs (albeit the Spanish version was played over two legs) and not really major titles. The FIFA Club World Cup may have slightly more teams, but we all know that in its historical pre-Trump format it amounted in the end to the old Intercontinental clash between the European and South American champs. Barca started the season with six titles up for grabs, but missed out in the Copa del Rey to Sevilla in the last 16 and to Jose Mourinho's party-pooping Inter in the Champions League semi-finals.

 

It must be quite nice to be able to go “This is the worst Quadruple we've ever won”. The inherent implications can only augur well. This is the worst Quadruple Bayern Munich have ever won.

 

And this is the second worst. A far better one in 2012/13 opened the Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup doors, gifts that were duly accepted. In accordance with tradition, Guangzhou Evergrande were beaten en route to World Cup glory, while penalties were needed to exact a measure of revenge on Chelsea for the 2012 Champions League final in the UEFA Super Cup. But Bayern were thrashed in the Champions League semi-finals by Real Madrid and sloppily passed up the DFB-Supercup right at the start of the season with a defeat to old rivals Dortmund.

 

Don't hear as much about this as you do the 1999 Treble, do you? Even though four is definitely more than three. Can't think why this is less venerated. Not every day you beat Gamba Osaka and Quito to land the Club World Cup. Or beat Portsmouth on penalties to win the Community Shield. You can stick That Night in Barcelona up your arse, quite frankly.

 

Scores grudging bonus points for the fact they've done this particular quadruple four times since replacing Lyon as French football's dominant force. No arguing with the neatness of that. There's a very obvious reason it's not as good as 2024/25's effort, but three of the four here are at least actual competitions containing multiple matches and more than two entrants.

We also quite enjoy the fact that because PSG weren't even letting anyone else have a go in the League Cup – winning six of the final seven renewals – it was just abolished altogether. We assume that's why it was chucked in le bin anyway.

The Trophee des Champions sounds much better than ‘Community Shield' and less deceptively bombastic than ‘Super Cup' but amounts to the same thing. It's just a glorified friendly between league winners and cup winners, and PSG have won loads of the buggers. This is a Quadruple built around a Domestic Treble and therefore not too tinpot, but inevitably loses some points because farmers and no Europe.

 

A Proper Domestic Double is a high-quality cornerstone of any respectable Quadruple, and Barcelona tick that box in style here, putting a three-game April wobble behind them to win their last five league games by an absurd aggregate score of 24-0 to pip Real Madrid by a point. Sevilla were beaten in extra-time for Copa del Rey glory, but alas it then goes once more into the realm of the tinpot. Athletic Bilbao offered minimal Supercopa resistance, while Guangzhou Evergrande (it is always Guangzhou Evergrande) and River Plate (it is quite often River Plate) were sorted out with little fuss in the Club World Cup. The Champions League bid came a cropper against eventual finalists and domestic rivals Atletico Madrid in the last eight.

 

Yes, another Champions League for Real Madrid. Nice one, Loris Karius is crying. The rest of it: tish and fipsy. Alright, so the Supercopa was against Barcelona, but it was still a fancy two-legged friendly. Al-Jazira and Gremio were dispatched in the Club World Cup and Manchester United in the UEFA Super Cup. Real also finished second behind actual Tottenham in their Champions League group stage, and third in La Liga. Utter frauds.

 

This is one of our favourite Quadruples. Because it highlights the absolute folly of it all. The whole Quadruple obsession vaguely reminds us of the razor blade wars when Gillette and Wilkinson Sword would constantly set out to one up each other by just adding blade after unnecessary blade. The Mach 3 was definitely enough, guys.

And that brings us to Manchester City's 2018/19 season, in which their Champions League hopes collided with the unstoppable chaotic banter force of Spurs with inevitable consequences, but they did complete an unprecedented English Domestic Treble. An achievement Sir Alex Ferguson had declared impossible, rightly acknowledging the League Cup is far harder to win than the Champions League. But here's the thing: nobody cared.

And, sure, a lot of that was because it's City and people in general still don't care about City the way they do United or Liverpool or even Arsenal. They still didn't care all that much when they emulated United's Proper Treble in 2023. But it wasn't entirely that. Quadruple obsession had rendered Trebles meh. Ludicrous as that is.

Still, though. Whack in the good ol' Community Shield, and you have a Quadruple. And with all three proper pots pocketed in a league where that had never happened before or since it remains one of the better ones. And you can't really blame anyone for coming off second best to Spurs with Fernando Llorente in his pomp, can you?

 

Were it not for an extremely careless Copa del Rey quarter-final defeat over two legs to Celta Vigo, this would be challenging for top spot. The league title was snaffled after a typically forthright to and fro with Clasico rivals Barcelona, while a slightly scruffy Champions League group stage featuring three draws on their way to second place behind Dortmund was put right in a dominant march through the knockouts. Classic Real Madrid Champions Leaguing, really. They know their way around a UCL knockout tie better than most, a bother with which Man City are about to collide. Napoli and Bayern were beaten home and away in the last 16 and quarter-finals, while a 2-1 second-leg defeat to Atletico mattered not a jot with a 3-0 lead in the bag from the first. On to the final in Cardiff, and a 4-1 shellacking for Juventus. It is the history of the etc.

Super Cup and Club World Cup formalities were also completed along the way, although extra time was required against both Sevilla in the former and Kashima Antlers in the latter. The Antlers were only in the tournament at all as J-League champions because Japan were hosts, but defied the odds to make it all the way to extra-time in the final, beating Auckland City, Mamelodi Sundowns and most notably Copa Libertadores champions Atletico Nacional (thanks in part to the first penalty ever awarded by VAR) along the way.

 

We're going to go right ahead and say it: winning the Champions League is better than winning the French Coupe de la Ligue. Let it never be said we are afraid of molten takes here.

PSG seemed pretty happy, all in all, with a season that finally delivered that long-awaited first Big Cup success alongside a customary sprinkling of domestic baubles. But we're still pretty annoyed that the abolition of the French League Cup meant no Proper Quad was achieved. On the flipside we are, in truth, relieved at their failure to win the summer's Club World Cup because then we'd have had to decide which, if any, season it belonged to and we can't be remotely arsed with that noise.

But within the definite confines of the actual 24/25 season, the entire absence of the Coupe de la Ligue does leave this as a largely unimprovable effort with the domestic double at its core and the big European prize to go with the more tinpot Trophee des Champions.

Of course, this season could set new benchmarks despite Coupe de France embarrassment. Having already won all three of the Glorified Friendlies available to them post-quad – Trophee des Champions, UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Intercontinental Cup – and with a live interest retained in both Ligue 1 and Champions League there is a tinpot quintuple very much up for grabs.

 

There is no Carabao equivalent in Germany, so this does have to go down as a largely unimprovable effort for Bayern, for whom a Quadruple featuring no tinpottery whatsoever is thus impossible. Won all three major pots in some style, breaking all manner of records on their way to a ludicrous 25-point victory margin in the Bundesliga and winning their six DFB-Pokal games by a combined aggregate of 20-2. Arsenal gave them an almighty scare in the Champions League last 16, winning 2-0 in Munich after a 3-1 Bayern win at the Emirates appeared to have put the tie to bed three weeks earlier. Sauntered past supposed European superpowers Juventus and Barcelona by scoring 11 goals and conceding none before outlasting Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund at Wembley to take the Big Cup.

We don't want to get into the hypothetical, but it does seem pretty reasonable to assume this team that lost just once to a German side (2-1 to Bayer Leverkusen in October) all season long may well have won a German League Cup were there such a thing to be won.

World Cup

This is the 15th article in a series by The Athletic looking back at the winners of each men's World Cup.

Previously, we've looked at Uruguay in 1930, Italy in 1934 and again in 1938, Uruguay in 1950, West Germany in 1954, before a Brazilian double in 1958 and 1962, an England success in 1966, another Brazil win in 1970, a second West Germany triumph in 1974, Argentina's first win in 1978, Italy's third in 1982, Argentina's second in 1986, West Germany's third in 1990, and Brazil going clear with a fourth World Cup in 1994. Now, it's time for someone new to get involved.

A tournament that is fondly remembered, and a triumphant side that were celebrated as deserving winners. France were — in modern times — that rare thing, a victorious host nation. Divide the 22 World Cups in half, and while five of the first 11 were won by the host, this is the only one of the last 11 tournaments to have been won by the country staging the event.

As with many World Cups, there was a wider political angle. Amid a rise in support for far-right National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, who had repeatedly criticised the national side for having too many players born outside France, or from an immigrant background, France's eventual success was seen as a victory for the side's multiculturalism as much as its football approach.

As a general rule, French managers tend to take something of a back seat role. They're not overly concerned with footballing philosophy, they aren't constantly tinkering with their side, they aren't larger-than-life characters in press conferences.

Aime Jacquet had enjoyed great success with Bordeaux in the 1980s, and subsequently worked for the national side as technical director and then assistant manager, during which time France failed to qualify for World Cup 1994. He was then appointed as manager, but was constantly criticised in the French press, largely for being too conservative. But Jacquet knew what was needed to win a tournament: a good defensive record, a harmonious atmosphere, and lots of players chipping in with goals.

Even in victory, Jacquet was still rattled by the previous negativity towards him. “The team got better as the tournament progressed, and we showed we have some world-class players,” he said after the final. “The supporters also got more confidence in us as the games went by. But we have been unfairly criticised at times, and I'll never forgive those critics who were so severe on us after we failed to qualify for USA 94.”

He never coached another game after the World Cup final, reverting to his position as technical director.

For all the joyous scenes after the final, France was struggling to love its national team until midway through the tournament. Missing out on World Cup 1994 was still considered a national embarrassment. The side also struggled to reach Euro 96 — a Youri Djorkaeff free-kick in a qualifier against Poland probably kept Jacquet in his job — and while France reached the semi-finals of that tournament, they didn't score a single goal in four hours of knockout football. France wanted something more beautiful.

Outside France, there were questions about precisely how much this was a football-mad country. Ligue 1 attendances averaged only 16,000. Star players were leaving after the Bosman ruling, and French tax rates meant its clubs couldn't compete financially. The lack of competitive games in the build-up to the tournament meant there was little for fans to get excited about. Captain Didier Deschamps called for fewer shirts and ties in the stands, and more France shirts.

Nevertheless, France seemed to suddenly become obsessed midway through the tournament — the more France progressed, the more its citizens watched matches in big groups in public places, rather than at home. The scenes after the final were so memorable because they felt so unlikely going into the tournament. The Ligue 1 average attendance rose more than 20 per cent for the following season.

France ended the tournament with a 4-3-2-1 formation, which lacked both attacking width and speed.

Striker Stephane Guivarc'h was mocked for his inability to score a single goal at the competition. He was retrospectively praised for his ability to hold up the ball and run the channels, but he constantly slipped when through on goal, or haplessly scuffed the ball. “No team has ever won the World Cup with such ineffective forwards,” said the editorial in World Soccer magazine.

Behind, Zinedine Zidane and Djorkaeff provided some attacking spark — Djorkaeff from slightly higher up the pitch, offering more of a goal threat in open play. They had the security of three solid players behind them: the ultra-solid water carrier Deschamps, the cautious Emmanuel Petit, who offered left-footed balance, and then the workmanlike Christian Karembeu, who offered more energy to the right. The passing network for the final makes them look like 2-7-1, with the full-backs pushing on, the wider midfielders spreading, and the two No 10s coming short to get the ball.



Earlier in the competition they had offered more speed and urgency, particularly when using a young Thierry Henry from the wing, and David Trezeguet at times too. Meanwhile, Christoph Dugarry started up front and scored France's opening goal of the competition, although was ruled out for most of the tournament with a hamstring injury. As regularly happens, the eventual World Cup winners became more cautious as the tournament developed.

🏆 David Trezeguet was the youngest member of France's 1998 #WorldCup-winning squad, netted the golden goal that won them EURO 2000 and remains their 5th highest all-time scorer 🇫🇷

The defence was celebrated as the the most solid in the competition, although almost everyone ran into some problems along the way. In the 4-0 win over Saudi Arabia, goalkeeper Fabien Barthez got away with a two-footed lunge and left-back Bixente Lizarazu was also lucky not to be dismissed for a last-man foul.

In the semi-final, Lilian Thuram ended up five yards behind his fellow defenders to play Davor Suker onside for Croatia's opener. Later on, Laurent Blanc was controversially sent off after whacking Slaven Bilic in the chest, prompting Bilic going down holding his head. That meant Frank Leboeuf coming in for the final to play alongside Marcel Desailly — and then Desailly was sent off midway through the second half for a wild challenge on Cafu which resulted in a second booking.

This meant France ended the tournament with backup Leboeuf playing alongside Petit, who had dropped back from midfield into the position he used to play with Monaco. It was all a bit more ramshackle than often portrayed. But it's worth pointing out that France scored six goals in the knockout stage, and four — one from Blanc, two from Thuram, and another from Petit late in the final — came from those playing in defence.

Zidane had long been cast as France's superstar, and given he scored twice in the first half of the final to give France a 2-0 lead they never looked like relinquishing, he became the poster boy for this side — literally, as his face was projected onto the Arc de Triomphe while Parisians celebrated up and down the Champs Elysee.

But this wasn't Zidane at his best — his outstanding tournament was Euro 2000, and he performed better at World Cup 2006 too — and in the aftermath of the tournament most journalists' attempts to create a best XI didn't feature his name.

Here, he was sent off in the 4-0 group stage victory over Saudi Arabia for stamping on Fuad Amin, which meant he was suspended for two matches. Such was the clamour for Zidane to be the main man — the new Michel Platini — his absence almost overshadowed France's progress.

Upon his return, he was marked out of an uneventful goalless draw with Italy by his Juventus team-mate Gianluca Pessotto in the quarter-final, but was excellent against Croatia in the semi.

Thuram and Desailly were hailed as France's best players throughout the tournament, but after the final, Zidane was clearly the star.

The 2002 final would be about Ronaldo. The 2006 final would be about Zidane. This was about both.

The build-up to the game is perhaps more memorable than the game itself, with two separate Brazil team sheets appearing — the first with Ronaldo somehow not in the side and replaced by Edmundo, then a revised version with Ronaldo reinstated. It later emerged that Ronaldo had experienced a series of convulsions while having his afternoon nap, and had spent several hours in hospital. He arrived at the Stade de France separately from his team-mates.

He eventually played the full 90 minutes, but was clearly lacking his usual spark. Amid these pre-match worries, Brazil had barely warmed up before the game, and never really got going.

France dominated without playing spectacular football, and were 2-0 up at half-time thanks to Zidane's two headers, both after beating Leonardo to reach an inswinging corner. “Scoring two with my head is unbelievable,” he said afterwards. “I'm not very good with my head. But both times the ball came over perfectly for me, and I managed to connect perfectly.”

There was little reaction from Brazil, even after Desailly's red card on 68 minutes. 2-0 seemed a fair scoreline, but Petit added the icing on the cake after being slipped in by his Arsenal midfield colleague Patrick Vieira, to make it 3-0.

Probably the single most joyous moment was Thuram's second against Croatia in the semi-final. His error meant France fell behind for the only time in the competition, which prompted France's most intense spell of the World Cup, and he was the fitting man to turn things around. This was a right-back who had never previously scored for France — and never would do so again — but he momentarily transformed into a goalscoring machine, first grabbing the equaliser a minute after Suker's goal and then, even more improbably, curling home with his left foot from outside the box.

“It was what I call my Miles Davis moment,” he later told The Guardian. “Footballers can be like artists when the mind and body are working as one. It is what Miles Davis does when he plays free jazz — everything pulls together into one intense moment that is beautiful. He doesn't have to think about it; it's pure instinct… we do not know why it happened, but it worked.”

Brazil were the favourites going into the final, and showed more attacking flair than the hosts — as did the Netherlands, Croatia and Argentina, in all honesty.

During this period, winning the World Cup seemed to primarily be about collecting clean sheets. France had a strong defence, they protected them with solid holding midfielders, and they ultimately conceded only two goals in seven matches, a stark contrast from Brazil.

“We conceded 10 goals in our seven games,” acknowledged Brazil captain Dunga afterwards. “You cannot expect to win the World Cup like that.” Brazil would return four years later with a better defence — and a fit Ronaldo.

The DFB vice president has suggested a separate tournament for UEFA teams not competing in the upcoming World Cup.

St. Pauli president and vice president of the German Football Association (DFB) Oke Göttlich has recently tossed around the idea of boycotting the 2026 FIFA World Cup in Canada, the United States, and Mexico due to the ongoing situation between the US and Greenland.

In an interview with the Hamburger Post (via welt.de), Göttlich was asked if he was calling for a boycott, after having previously questioned in a social media post whether European national teams should participate in a tournament hosted by a country “that is indirectly and possibly soon directly attacking Europe.” To this, Göttlich aswered that it was time to “think about it and talk about it concretely.”

However, Göttlich stressed that he would not advise any player to make their opinion on the matter public, since “that is a decision each individual had to make for themselves.” Göttlich also stated that he was disappointed that UEFA football associations, including the DFB, had been “so quiet, almost speechless” about the matter, which was different before the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Göttlich also said he has thought about the possible consequences such as financial disadvantages for the associations and players. To that, he suggested a UEFA competition in the summer for teams not competing in the World Cup.

Finally, Göttlich stated that the situation could not be compared to Qatar and Saudi Arabia because, while these countries had disreputable human rights abuse records, they had “at least not issued any open threats or attacks against Europe.”

In a move that brings the spectacle of the 2026 FIFA World Cup directly to our backyard, the Curaçao National Team has officially selected Boca Raton as its home base for this summer's tournament.

The “Blue Wave” (La Familia Azul) will utilize Florida Atlantic University (FAU) as their primary training facility, with the team and staff taking up residence at the Boca Raton Marriott at Boca Center.

Curaçao's arrival in Boca Raton is the final chapter of a “Cinderella story” that captivated the footballing world this past November. By securing a gritty 0-0 draw against Jamaica in Kingston, Curaçao became the smallest nation by population (approx. 160,000) ever to qualify for a FIFA World Cup, shattering the record previously held by Iceland.

Now, as they prepare for their Group E clashes against Germany, Ecuador, and Côte d'Ivoire , they have chosen the palm-lined fields of FAU to fine-tune their tactics.

The decision to select Boca Raton over other qualified base camp sites like Atlanta or Dallas was driven by a combination of climate, world-class facilities, and local culture.

“Boca Raton provides the perfect environment for our players to focus,” said legendary Dutch manager Dick Advocaat, who leads the Curaçao squad. “The facilities at FAU are top-tier, and the climate closely mirrors what we expect during our opening matches. Plus, the Caribbean connection in South Florida makes our boys feel right at home.” For those who don't follow world football, Advocaat is one of the most decorated coaches in history winning multiple European titles with Zenit as well as multiple domestic trophies with Rangers and PSV. He has also managed several national teams successfully. 

The arrival of a World Cup team is expected to provide a significant economic boost to the city. Local businesses in Boca Center and along Glades Road are already preparing for an influx of international media and traveling fans from the Dutch Caribbean.

The Boca Raton Tribune has been a cornerstone of local journalism for over 18 years, delivering reliable news and engaging content to the Boca Raton community. Our commitment extends across print, online platforms, and video interviews, reflecting our dedication to comprehensive coverage. We actively support local events, an non profit organizations.

The U.S. is expecting at least 5 million international visitors, not to mention the millions of soccer fans at home, to be on the move during the six-week tournament

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

More than half a billion ticket requests have been made for World Cup 2026 games, which will be hosted by cities across the United States, Canada and Mexico, FIFA reported this month.

The U.S. is expecting more than 5 million international visitors, not to mention the tens of thousands of soccer fans here at home that will not only pack stadiums but also flood fan zones from coast to coast, including in New York , Los Angeles, Kansas City and Atlanta over the six-week tournament, which kicks off on June 11.

This once-in-a-generation opportunity also brings a nationwide, multifaceted rollout of security measures to prepare for potential threats ranging from drone incursions to cyberattacks. 

However some human rights advocates have expressed fears that the Trump administration will use law enforcement operations around the World Cup to target migrants as part of the White House's aggressive deportation policy. 

“Under the Trump administration's policies, immigration enforcement at major sporting events can tear families apart and could expose people fleeing persecution to life-threatening danger,” Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. 

And there is also trepidation from fans traveling from abroad after the Trump administration broadened its visa ban to 75 countries. 

Despite announcing the FIFA Priority Appointment Schedule System, or FIFA PASS, which will expedite visa processing for individuals cleared by the Department of State, FIFA fans from around the world are still questioning whether or not they'll be allowed to enter and travel within the U.S. without federal harassment, according to the BBC. 

The Department of Homeland Security announced earlier this month that it plans to invest $115 million in counter-drone technologies to protect World Cup games, and also events celebrating the country's 250th anniversary this year.

The funds will be managed by a new DHS office that will focus on buying and deploying drone and counter-drone tech.

“Drones represent the new frontier of American air superiority,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement.

FEMA, which is under the umbrella of DHS, said in December that it had allocated $350 million to the 11 states hosting World Cup matches. That money is earmarked for the purchase of counter-drone tech. 

While most drones are more disruptive than are they overtly dangerous — though there have been cases of falling devices causing serious injury to people on the ground — the war in Ukraine has proven that even relatively inexpensive, commercially available racing drones outfitted with explosives can be used as potent weapons. 

U.S. officials reportedly see the potential threat of a drone attack as more than a fringe possibility. 

Last week, leaders from the military, law enforcement, and local governments gathered to participate in ""tabletop exercises overwhelmingly focused"" on drone attacks at World Cup events, where large numbers of people will be gathered in places at predetermined times.

Politico reported about the war games that local and state law enforcement agencies in the U.S. have been “encouraged to purchase equipment that can jam inbound drones or redirect them to their origin,"" and to seek reimbursement for their purchases through a $500 million federal grant program. 

The World Cup is larger than it has ever been. In all, 48 teams are competing in more than a dozen cities across three North American countries. Like the rest of the world, the World Cup relies more on automated systems and digital technologies today than it ever has in the past. 

That means that cyberthreats are more of risk factor than ever before. 

""The more we build out these things and automate and scale larger — more days, more games, more teams — the more we have to find a way to do that efficiently, and they're not scaling out the human labor force to do it,"" Chris Grove, director of cybersecurity strategy for Nozomi Networks, a provider of cybersecurity for operational technology told Dark Reading, a cybersecurity news site.

""They're building with technologies and processes and things, automated ticketing access controls, and being able to do a lot more with less."" 

Digital threats aren't just a theorized vector for malicious behavior; there is precedent. Following the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, analysts found a router that had been compromised and could have been used to disrupt communications during the games, including all streaming services carrying the events. 

In 2024, the Olympic Games in Paris were subject to at least 140 cyberattacks, but thanks to French preparation, there were no outages to the games, according to Dark Reading.

Grove warned that this year, as a result of heightened political polarization in the U.S., there will likely be an increased likelihood of ""hacktivists"" targeting the World Cup to make statements. 

""I think there's more potential and concern for disruption around hacktivists this time around than four years ago,"" he says. ""Four years ago was just a different political and social landscape."" 

Donald Lane, a former Secret Service agent, told the U.S. Sun that while physically attacking an event has become more difficult thanks to increased surveillance and threat-detection technology, malicious actors have found plenty of vulnerabilities through the use of remote access. 

“Bad actors are realizing they can cause a lot of destruction by accessing these things remotely, which can be just as devastating as a physical attack,"" the told the outlet. 

Targeting systems that manage electricity, gas, and water are all possible options for potential bad actors. 

Little information has been released about the specific steps to ramp up cybersecurity ahead of the World Cup but a House Committee task force - focused on the World Cup and 250th anniversary celebrations — has indicated that it is among the chief areas of concern.

Last summer, Andrew Giuliani, who is leading the White House Task Force on the World Cup, announced that the federal government was pouring more than a billion dollars into security for the tournament, calling it ""one of the largest commitments of safety resources ever made for a single event."" 

 ""This includes $625 million through the FIFA World Cup Grant Program and is directed to support law enforcement, supporting everything from training and exercises to cybersecurity and emergency response,' he said. 

Securing the physical locations of games will fall largely to a combined force of federal, state and local law enforcement. 

Kansas City has already started its preparations, naming Kyle Postell, as the city's director of safety & security. Postell is a former Secret Service agent and will oversee security preparations alongside local law enforcement. 

World Cup hosting cities will likely see increased police presence, controlled traffic corridors, and the presence of state and federal law enforcement as has been seen before during major events like the Super Bowl. 

After a New Year's Day vehicle attack in New Orleans that killed 14 people in 2025, police used reinforced “drop and stop” metal barriers ahead of the Super Bowl in the city. 

The barriers used in New Orleans advertise the ability to stop a 2,430 pound (1102 kg) vehicle moving at 30 miles per hour (48 kph) without the need for an anchor. 

Cities across the U.S. have been investing in similar barriers since the New Year's Day attack. West Palm Beach spent $800,000 in 2025 to protect its pedestrian-heavy downtown events, according to WPTV. San Antonio did the same in 2025, but used two-ton stone barriers to block vehicle entry to its Market Square, News 4 San Antonio reports.

In addition to securing the actual venues, the U.S. is also preparing for non-American travelers who come from cultures where public transportation is more the norm. Giuliani said that the federal government is working with public and private partners to ensure foreign visitors have safe and reliable transportation to and from events.

""The Department of Transportation is very aware that Americans travel differently from Europeans and South Americans, and we are working shoulder-to-shoulder with FIFA, host cities, airlines, Amtrak, rideshare companies, and public transportation networks to keep fans moving safely and efficiently,"" Giuliani said in December. 

Michael Donnelly, Georgia's TSA federal security director, said officials at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in host city Atlanta are preparing for a massive influx of foreign and domestic travelers. 

""It's going to be an extremely, busy time when we have games,"" he told Fox 5 Atlanta. ""So we'll be preparing like like every game is a Super Bowl."" 

He said that the TSA would be utilizing unspecified ""new technologies"" to help with screening and expedite wait times as travelers arrive.

The Trump administration's aggressive anti-immigration policy - which has seen nearly 3 million people deported and thousands arrested by masked ICE agents and held in detention centers - appears to have left foreign visitors wondering what welcome awaits them in the U.S. 

In December, Giuliani was asked by reporters if Trump will rule out ICE raids at World Cup games. He said Trump would not. 

“The one thing, and I've known the president for 25 years, the president has not ruled out anything that will make American citizens safer,” he said. 

In January, Lebanese diplomat and FIFA fan Mohamad Safa, announced he'd canceled his World Cup tickets because of the Trump administration's draconian anti-immigration policies. 

“I cancelled my World Cup tickets. The ICE may decide that I am a gang member, and I'll be locked in prison for a year with no charges, no hearing, no trial, no right to consult a lawyer, no phone call,” he wrote in a post on X. “The US is not safe to visit.”

The Department of Homeland Security proposed a rule in January that would expand the personal and social media information travelers are required to provide DHS officials when traveling to the U.S. on the waived visa program. 

The waived visa program applies to citizens of many European countries and other American allies. The DHS proposal means those visitors may be sujected to expanded scrutiny.

If implemented, the new proposal would give Homeland Security the ability to screen travelers' social media posts for any sign of ""anti-American"" sentiment, even if they aren't seeking long-term stays in the U.S. 

Trump has said that he ""can't wait to welcome soccer fans from all over the globe” but has already banned visa applications for visitors from 21 nations including Iran, Brazil, Colombia, and Egypt — which all have teams in the World Cup or competing to qualify for the event. 

While exceptions have been made for World Cup teams, their immediate families, and coaching staff, the same cannot be said of their supporters.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned soccer fans that just because they bought a ticket to a game doesn't mean they're getting into the U.S. “A ticket is not a visa and it doesn't guarantee admission to the U.S.,"" he said. 

Trump's immigration crackdown is a concern for domestic fans as well. In July, an asylum seeker in the U.S. took his children to a Club World Cup soccer tournament final and was arrested by ICE, detained for three months, and was then deported to a country where he felt he could be killed, according to Human Rights Watch. 

In May, two months before the incident, HRW sent a letter to FIFA asking for “immediate action” to address potential risks to fans posed by U.S. immigration policies. 

FIFA responded on June 3 that it “expects … host countries take measures to ensure that any eligible persons who are involved in the Competition are able to enter the respective countries,” and “is actively working on this matter with relevant authorities.”

This summer's FIFA World Cup already looks set to be a controversial one, with the UK government now warning England fans about the potential perils of travelling.

The US, Mexico and Canada are joint hosts of football's biggest international competition this summer, with fans of the Three Lions hoping to finally see some success on the men's side after going so long without a trophy.

Considering the goings-on in the US right now, it was perhaps always going to be chaotic in the build-up to the event, and Donald Trump has made sure of that, thanks to his hefty travel ban list, which is likely to prevent fans of teams such as Haiti and Iran from even travelling.

Iranian officials boycotted the World Cup draw late last year but were perhaps relieved that they did so after a rather confused event that included performances from The Village People and Nicole Scherzinger, while England fans finally found out their group stage opponents.

Although England's fixtures against Croatia, Ghana and Panama take place in the US, knockout fixtures could see them travel to Mexico, and now the UK government has issued a warning about the precautions they will need to take there, even if the beer and match tickets are likely to be much cheaper.

The UK government's Foreign and Commonwealth Office has issued a raft of warnings, ranging from alcohol intake to drugs and corrupt police officers, as fans start to book their flights and hotels ahead of what promises to be a huge footballing summer.

They say: “Do not leave food and drinks unattended in bars and restaurants.

""Criminals have robbed or assaulted travellers after drugging them. Tainted alcohol has caused illness or blackouts. If you have any concerns, get advice from your tour operator or the local authorities.

“There have been deaths and cases of serious illness caused by alcoholic drinks containing methanol in Mexico.”

England fans certainly have a reputation for travelling abroad and running into trouble with local enforcement officers, but in Mexico, it's important they don't get arrested by someone who doesn't even have the authority to do so.

The FCDO add: “Be wary of criminals posing as police officers and trying to fine or arrest you for no reason. They have targeted travellers driving rental cars.

“Some genuine police officers have extorted money from tourists for alleged minor offences or traffic violations.”

You'll also want to keep a close eye on your belongings in Mexico, as 'pickpocketing and theft are common', especially on public transport.

Fans are urged to avoid wearing expensive-looking clothing, jewellery or watches and to limit the amount of cash or credit cards they carry.

You'll also have to be careful for the group games in the US, as one step out of line and Trump might just try to keep you there.

A dominant second half carried the USWNT past Paraguay, with Trinity Rodman and Ally Sentnor shining - even as first-half issues linger for Emma Hayes' side.

The U.S. Women's National Team have now scored 23 goals across three all-time meetings with Paraguay. While Saturday's 6-0 win at Dignity Health Sports Park did not reach the heights of the 9-0 and 8-0 victories from 2021, it followed a familiar script: patience early, then a decisive second-half surge. Five of the six goals came after halftime, with three arriving in a 15-minute span as the Americans pulled away.

USWNT head coach Emma Hayes again leaned into youth, naming a young starting lineup and handing the captain's armband to Trinity Rodman. At just 23 years old, Rodman was one of the more experienced players on the field, earning her 48th cap in her first national team appearance since 2025. She marked the occasion with a goal and a celebratory moment that reflected both confidence and comfort, dancing her way toward the sideline - and toward Hayes - after finding the net.

Rodman's record-breaking contract, reported to be over $2 million annually, stole headlines this week. Hayes believes having the title of the world's highest-paid player in women's soccer won't affect the forward, though. 

'I'm happy for her. I think it was a hard year, we all know [and] she's ready to move forward,"" Hayes told reporters following the win. ""I think today symbolizes that, like, as a fresh year, it's a fresh start for her. She's settled, she's happy. Knowing her future is [settled]...This is a big, big weight off her shoulders.""

Rodman shared it was important to be a standard bearer, not just for fellow players, but for kids who look up to her. 

""Yeah, I think it's just another thing to inspire the youth,"" Rodman explained to TNT after the game. ""Now, having the opportunity to change the game and not just in an on-field perspective...I think it's important to give opportunities to Americans [soccer players] in America - it's huge. And then having the World Cup [this year], the Olympics and the U.S. [women] for the next World Cup, it's the perfect time to keep this going on the incline and hopefully, it happens to more players as well."" 

While Rodman's return and recent record-setting contract drew much of the pregame attention, it was Ally Sentnor who ultimately tipped the balance. The midfielder scored twice and was involved throughout, doing the off-the-ball work and connective play that often goes unnoticed. On this night, Sentnor's impact showed up clearly on the scoresheet as well.

Despite the lopsided final score, the opening 45 minutes offered some early warning signs, as Paraguay's compact five-back setup limited space and slowed the U.S. attack before the match opened up after the break.

GOAL breaks down the winners and losers from Dignity Health Sports Park.

Turner became the 25th player in USWNT history to score in her first appearance for the senior team. If it wasn't for Turner's goal, the USWNT would have entered the half level with Paraguay. 

""I honestly can't put into words how I'm feeling right now,"" Turner told TNT after the game. 

Turner, a native of Southern California who hosted dozens at the game, has been an offensive threat for the Thorns over the past two seasons. On Saturday, she started in the No. 9 spot for the USWNT, and despite a slow first half for the squad, got herself in dangerous positions and proved to be a promising future player in that essential No. 9 role. Turner was the first player in 2026 to both earn her USWNT debut and start, simultaneously. She became the 286th woman to play for the USWNT and the 28th to debut under head coach Hayes.

""I'm so grateful to even get this opportunity to play...I think this team has done a really good job of getting to know each other and meshing well and communicating. I feel like you really saw that tonight...My family is here and I'm just beyond words. 

It was one of the slower first 45 minutes of play from the USWNT in a long time. Despite all of the pieces in place and a 4-2-3-1 formation, Hayes' side struggled to play quickly and switch the point of attack. Granted, Paraguay packed in numbers behind the ball and played with five in the back, but even so, there were spaces the USWNT weren't seeing or utilizing. Despite Claire Hutton, Olivia Moultrie, and Lo'eau LaBonta's grit in the midfield, there wasn't the same chemistry and flow USWNT fans are used to seeing when Rose Lavelle, Lindsey Heaps, and Sam Coffey are in the rotation. 

Although the first half was slow, they quickly adjusted after halftime and were moving the ball much faster, playing one-two-touch and utilizing the triangles throughout the midfield. Hayes acknowledged there was some rustiness from her NWSL exclusive squad, many of whom haven't played in weeks on the club level. She remained impressed by Hutton's overall leadership in the contest, especially what she showed after getting the armband from Rodman after she came out of the contest.

""For Claie, I think she's a future captain in the making, without question. So what a great learning moment for her,"" she said. 

Sentnor has proven to be a scoring threat for both the U.S. youth national team and senior team, and on Saturday night scored a brace to help the USWNT cruise past Paraguay 6-0. Sentnor earned her 14th cap on the night and seventh start with the senior team. To date, she has six international goals and three assists. When she was slid into the No. 9 spot after Turner came out, she was consistently in dangerous spots on the attack, and her off-the-ball movement helped her open up scoring opportunities for those around her, too.

All of the stars aligned for Rodman to score, celebrate, and call it a night. And that's exactly what happened. Despite a quiet first half, not seeing much of the ball, the second half was a complete shift, and the midfield was able to more quickly switch the point of attack and find Rodman, who was often wide open on the wing.

Rodman scored in the 55th minute, after fellow Washington Spirit teammate Tara Rudd found her out wide with an over-the-top ball.  Rodman trapped it, and took a few inside-outside touches before burying it to make it 3-0.

Paraguay came out with five in the back and held a high line to try and keep the space limited and chances few out of the USWNT, but were only able to wreak havoc in the first half. By the second half, the USWNT came out with more pace, bite, and organization, and were easily able to exploit the spaces out wide. 

Paraguay struggled to mark the outside backs making endless runs down the line, and services into the box saw the USWNT constantly outnumbering Paraguay. It was a tough night for a team that has historically struggled to be competitive with the Americans. ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Liam Rosenior explains why Cole Palmer missed Chelsea's trip to Crystal Palace & responds to transfer speculation around 'homesick' talisman","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/liam-rosenior-explains-cole-palmer-missed-chelsea-crystal-palace-responds-transfer-speculation/bltf9bea5d6bb5a2964","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 17:01:09 GMT","

Chelsea manager Liam Rosenior has explained why Cole Palmer missed Sunday's Premier League clash with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. The talisman was expected to feature but did not make the squad for the 3-1 victory. Rosenior also responded to recent transfer speculation amid claims Palmer is unsettled in London and is hankering after a return to Manchester.

Palmer has endured an injury-interrupted campaign for Chelsea that has limited him to just 10 Premier League starts to date. The England international sat out the midweek win over Pafos in the Champions League due to a ""tiny"" injury but had been expected to return against Crystal Palace. However, Palmer was once again missing from the squad as Chelsea beat the Eagles 3-1 to move above Liverpool and into fourth place in the Premier League.

Rosenior told Sky Sports why Palmer had missed the match, saying: ""Unfortunately for us, Cole's not quite right for this one. I've said before in press conferences we want to make sure that every player is 100 per cent. There's no use risking players in January for what we want to achieve. He's got a little niggle in his thigh, he's not quite 100 per cent, but he's got a chance for Wednesday, hopefully he's back for then.""

Chelsea coped well without Palmer in a comfortable win thanks to goals from Estevao Willian, Joao Pedro and Enzo Fernandez. Pedro was happy to take all three points, telling Sky Sports: ""We knew this would be a tough game, they have a strong team. We knew we need to win second balls and fight the whole game. We scored three goals, conceded, but get the three points. In the first half we could have played more with the ball, and did not control the game but at half-time the gaffer told us to keep going, play with intensity and when we scored the second we could breathe a bit.""

Rosenior was also quizzed on Palmer's future at Chelsea amid reports claiming he's 'homesick' for Manchester. Recent speculation has claimed that Palmer could be tempted back to former club Manchester City if Pep Guardiola moves on in the summer. Palmer left City for Chelsea in 2023 in search of more regular game time but is reportedly unsettled in the capital and missing his friends back in Manchester. Rosenior insists he has spoken with Palmer and that he is still happy to be a Chelsea player: ""I've had numerous conversations with Cole and he seems, and is, very, very happy to be here. He is a huge part of our long‑term plans, he's an outstanding player. Every player goes through difficult moments in their career with injuries, but that is no indication of his quality.""

Chelsea's win over Palace makes it four wins out of five for Rosenior since he took charge of the Blues following Enzo Maresca's departure, and the Chelsea boss was thrilled to see his team ease past the Eagles and above Liverpool in the table. He told BBC Match of the Day: ""Very pleased. This is always a very difficult place to come. Crystal Palace are a very good team. What the players have given is outstanding. It's frustrating to not have a clean sheet in the last few minutes - I wanted three in a row and we should've got one, we were 3-0 up against 10 men.""

""But there's so much good. I thought we defended from the front, we were organised and were very clinical. All credit to the lads. We can be better on the ball, especially in the first half but in terms of what I want to see from a team performance, it was a very good one.""

Rosenior will be hoping that Palmer is fit enough for their next game against Napoli in the Champions League on Wednesday. The Blues head to Italy to face Antonio Conte's side sitting in eighth place in the Champions League and aiming to secure automatic qualification to the knockout stages. Chelsea are one of eight teams sitting on 13 points going into the final round of league phase fixtures and know that a victory should be enough against the defending Serie A champions.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

A dominant second half carried the USWNT past Paraguay, with Trinity Rodman and Ally Sentnor shining - even as first-half issues linger for Emma Hayes' side.

Chelsea's young Brazilians were the stars of the show on Sunday as the Blues beat Crystal Palace 3-1 at Selhurst Park to move above Liverpool in the Premier League's top four race. Estevao Willian opened the scoring in style before Joao Pedro made it 2-0 just after half-time. An Enzo Fernandez penalty then put the game out of reach, while Palace finished with 10 men after Adam Wharton saw red in the second half.

Barcelona were far from convincing in their meeting with Real Oviedo at Camp Nou, as they toiled for long periods against rock-bottom opponents, but the Blaugrana returned to the La Liga summit courtesy of a 3-0 win. Dani Olmo, Raphinha and Lamine Yamal dug them out of a hole on home soil, with class eventually shining through as a collection of impressive finishes delivered three hard-fought points.

The U.S. Women's National Team started slow, but went on to defeat Paraguay 6-0 with goals from Ally Sentnor, Trinity Rodman, Reilyn Turner, Emma Sears, and an own goal situation. The USWNT have now scored 23 goals against Paraguay in the last three meetings.

Arsenal extended their lead at the top of the Premier League last weekend by picking up a point at Nottingham Forest while their only two title rivals, Manchester City and Aston Villa, both lost. However, the dour 0-0 draw at the City Ground, which was only enlivened by a late row over a disputed penalty shout, raised some serious questions over the visitors' attacking threat, given it was their second consecutive scoreless stalemate, after being held at home by Liverpool the week before. 

Liverpool's defensive frailties were their undoing once again after Arne Slot's side lost with the last kick of the match, beaten 3-2 in dramatic fashion by Bournemouth at a rain-soaked Vitality Stadium. The Red were behind midway through the first-half after captain Virgil van Dijk failed to deal with a long pass into the box and the hosts' lead was doubled moments later. The Reds battled back into the match, but were sunk in the last second as Amine Adli stabbed the ball home to send the Cherries fans delirious. 

Kylian Mbappe scored two and Real Madrid were solid defensively in a relatively uneventful 2-0 win over Villarreal. Los Blancos were far from brilliant, but they were effective, and grabbed two second-half goals to secure a victory that sent them top of La Liga for at least 24 hours, ahead of rivals Barcelona playing Oviedo on Sunday afternoon, with the chance to put themselves back at the summit.

Manchester City strolled to their first Premier League victory of 2026 as Omar Marmoush and Antoine Semenyo fired Pep Guardiola's side to a 2-0 win at home to Wolves. Erling Haaland was the most eye-catching absentee from the starting XI as Guardiola made six changes from the side who were battered 3-1 by Bodo/Glimt in the Champions League, while Marc Guehi made an impressive debut.

Wrexham scored two goals deep into time added on to beat Queens Park Rangers 3-2 in a chaotic finish to the clash at Loftus Road. The Hoops looked good for the three points until goals from Josh Windass and Oliver Rathbone sealed a stunning comeback win for Phil Parkinson's side who move up into sixth place in the Championship table and into the play-off spots. 

Christian Pulisic is “the best player at AC Milan right now” and the only American that would feature on a list of the “top 150 players in the world”, claims one of his former coaches. The United States international is considered to have benefited from playing “street soccer” in England as a youngster, with those early experiences putting him on a path to superstardom.

U.S. Men's National Team striker Patrick Agyemang scored another goal on Friday to continue his recent hot streak with Derby County. Agyemang, who joined Derby this past summer, helped earn his side a 1-1 draw with West Brom. The 25-year-old now has eight league goals in 24 matches this season.  The Rams now sit eighth on the table.

USMNT star Brenden Aaronson is considered to be enjoying the best spell of his career, as the American playmaker finally cracks the Premier League at Leeds. He is, however, approaching the final year of his contract at Elland Road and Brad Friedel has explained to GOAL why a World Cup summer will deliver some huge transfer decisions in West Yorkshire.

Khadija Shaw's late goal ensured Manchester City went nine points clear at the top of the Women's Super League with a battling 2-1 win at London City Lionesses. Kerolin gave the visitors an early lead but the hosts levelled after the hour mark in deserved fashion from Freya Godfrey's thunderbolt. But Shaw ensured the league leaders came away with all three points to inch them closer to their first WSL title since 2016.

Trinity Rodman became the highest-paid women's soccer player in the world by staying in the NWSL. GOAL breaks down what that decision means - and the challenges that came with it.

Arsenal were imperious at Chelsea in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off as second-half goals from Beth Mead and Mariona Caldentey saw the Gunners claim a 2-0 win at Stamford Bridge. They moved to within one point of their capital rivals in the Women's Super League table as Renee Slegers' side returned to north London with a huge three points in tow.

Chelsea were handed a major blow to their hopes of retaining the Women's Super League title as they were beaten 2-0 at Stamford Bridge by London rivals Arsenal on Saturday. The visiting Gunners struck twice in the second half through Beth Mead and Mariona Caldentey, with the Blues failing to come up with a response. They are now in danger of the current gap to leaders Manchester City increasing to nine points by the end of the weekend.

Three years on from his seismic arrival at Chelsea after one of the most dramatic transfer sagas in recent memory, Enzo Fernandez is facing an uncertain future at Stamford Bridge. Supposedly growing disillusioned with life under BlueCo, the midfielder has been linked with some of Europe's biggest clubs - and his current employers are said to be willing to do business.

Virgil van Dijk is eager to see “my vice-captain” Andy Robertson remain at Liverpool. Mounting speculation during the January transfer window suggests that the Scotland international left-back has emerged as a shock target for Tottenham. Van Dijk is hoping that a fellow two-time Premier League title winner will not be allowed to leave Anfield.

Chelsea manager Liam Rosenior has explained why Cole Palmer missed Sunday's Premier League clash with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. The talisman was expected to feature but did not make the squad for the 3-1 victory. Rosenior also responded to recent transfer speculation amid claims Palmer is unsettled in London and is hankering after a return to Manchester.

Manchester City may be in need of a new captain next season, with Bernardo Silva's contract running down towards free agency, and a prediction has been made regarding who will take the armband. Portuguese defender Ruben Dias and prolific Norwegian striker Erling Haaland are reported to be among those in contention to take over skipper duties at the Etihad Stadium.

Manchester United have reportedly held internal discussions regarding the possibility of bringing Mason Greenwood back to the club from French side Marseille. The forward was sold to the Ligue 1 side in 2024 but the Red Devils included a buy-back clause in the transfer. Greenwood has gone on to become a key player for Robert De Zerbi's side which has sparked speculation he could move on.

Former Argentina international Javier Zanetti considers fellow countryman Lionel Messi to be “the essence of football” as he is capable of doing “crazy things”. The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner has proved as much over the course of his career, with the South American GOAT still going strong at the age of 38 with MLS Cup winners Inter Miami.

There is always a scramble to secure Lionel Messi's shirt whenever he takes to the field for Inter Miami or Argentina, with the South American GOAT facing plenty of requests. Alan Cantero was the lucky recipient of an iconic No.10 jersey following Messi's first outing of 2026. The Alianza Lima striker broke down in tears after landing a prized momento at the end of a friendly fixture.

Inter Miami CF have signed goalkeepers Rocco Ríos Novo and Luis Barraza on permanent deals, terminating the contract of veteran Oscar Ustari in the process. Ríos Novo spent last season with the club and started in the MLS Cup final. Separately, defender Tomas Aviles will join CF Montreal on loan for more playing time. 

The New York Red Bulls are nearing an agreement to sign U.S. international goalkeeper Ethan Horvath from Cardiff City, as the club continues a major roster overhaul ahead of the new MLS season. The move would address a key vacancy in goal following Carlos Coronel's departure and add experience to a squad entering a new era under head coach Michael Bradley.

Liverpool head coach Arne Slot has suggested it would be unwise to sanction the sale of Andy Robertson before the transfer deadline as he still 'needs' the left-back. Robertson is in talks with Tottenham over a move but the Reds are facing a mounting injury crisis and Slot is determined not to lose any further players.

Chelsea are among a number of Premier League clubs closely monitoring Paris Saint-Germain's teenage winger Ibrahim Mbaye, following his eye-catching performances at the recent Africa Cup of Nations. The 18-year-old has emerged as one of Europe's most exciting prospects, but PSG are determined to retain their rising star and are reportedly working on a new contract.

Wrexham owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac have been told to ""go for it"" in the January transfer window as they bid to secure a Premier League promotion. The Red Dragons were the Championship's biggest spenders over the summer and they are now within touching distance of the playoffs. As a result, ex-defender Curtis Davies thinks they should ""double down"" and invest again this month.

Manchester United have conceded that midfield target Elliot Anderson favours a summer switch to rivals Manchester City. The Nottingham Forest star has caught the attention of the Premier League pair having shone for the Tricky Trees this season. Forest are adamant that Anderson won't leave the City Ground in January and are expected to demand £100 million ($136m) to cash in on their prized asset later this year.

Swiss star Alisha Lehmann suffered defeat on her Leicester City debut on Sunday as the Foxes were beaten 2-1 by West Ham in the Women's Super League. The result leaves Leicester down in ninth place in the table and just two points ahead of bottom side Liverpool after 13 games. Leicester now face a tricky run of fixtures as they battle to avoid relegation.

Chelsea head coach Sonia Bompastor has conceded her side are unlikely to win the Women's Super League this season after defeat to Arsenal left them six points behind leaders Manchester City having played a game more. The Blues were beaten for the second time in their last three home games.

Trinity Rodman returns to club and country roster, Gisele Thompson has a chance to solidify herself as an outside back, goalkeeper pool gets clearer, and five keys for the USWNT as they take on Paraguay to open up play in the new year.

U.S. international Trinity Rodman has agreed to a three-year deal to remain with the Washington Spirit, ending months of uncertainty surrounding her future. The agreement follows the NWSL's introduction of the High Impact Player rule, though it remains unclear whether Rodman will be formally classified under the designation once it takes effect in July.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Could Mason Greenwood return to Man Utd? ‘Discussions' transfer claim as Red Devils hold buy-back option on Marseille forward","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/could-mason-greenwood-return-man-utd-discussions-transfer-claim-buy-back-option-marseille-forward/blt39351bb017b1a335","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 14:55:50 GMT","

Manchester United have reportedly held internal discussions regarding the possibility of bringing Mason Greenwood back to the club from French side Marseille. The forward was sold to the Ligue 1 side in 2024 but the Red Devils included a buy-back clause in the transfer. Greenwood has gone on to become a key player for Robert De Zerbi's side which has sparked speculation he could move on.

Greenwood scored 21 Ligue 1 goals in his first season at Marseille to finish top of the standings alongside Paris Saint-Germain star Ousmane Dembele. The 24-year-old has continued in the same vein in the current campaign. He has 12 goals from 18 outings in the French top flight and tops Ligue 1's goalscoring charts ahead of Strasbourg's Joaquin Panichelli. Greenwood also bagged a hat-trick earlier this month in Marseille's 9-0 win over Bayern in the Coupe de France round of 16 and has been tipped to be a future Ballon d'Or winner by De Zerbi. He said: ""I see him every day, he has a huge potential. I don't see any other players in Europe at the same level. He has the potential to win the Ballon d'Or. It will be up to him to decide whether he wants to do everything he can to fight for it or not. At the level of the qualities that nature has given him, that his parents have given him, I think he is worthy of the Ballon d'Or. I would like him to be more consistent. I know he needs to press with more intensity, he needs to manage the ball better when the team is in trouble, not lose the ball easily but keep it to allow the team to move up because he has the ability to do it.""

Greenwood came through Manchester United's academy and into the first team but was suspended in January 2022 after being arrested on charges suspicion of attempted rape, assault and coercive behaviour. The charges were subsequently discontinued after key witnesses withdrew their involvement and new material came to light but Greenwood went on to leave Old Trafford in July 2024. According to Football Insider, Manchester United have spoken about activating the buy-back clause in Greenwood's contract which would allow the Red Devils to bring the forward back for less than his market value. There's no word yet on whether Manchester United have a made a decision on Greenwood, but the club are not expected to strengthen in the January window and would rather wait until the summer to conduct any transfers. The departure of Ruben Amorim, and arrival of Michael Carrick as caretaker boss, has affected the club's transfer plans as well as the return from AFCON of Amad Diallo, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui.

Marseille president Pablo Longoria has revealed that the club can increase their ownership of Greenwood's economic rights if they qualify for the Champions League again. Manchester United also hold a sell-on percentage which will be reduced to 35% should Marseille secure their place in Europe's premier club competition again  Longoria told a news conference at the end of 2025: “Regarding the contractual situation, OM holds 60% of the player's economic rights and 100% of his sporting rights, with the possibility of increasing this to 65%. In that case, we can add 5% for qualification to the Champions League. Longoria also showered the forwad with praise: ""We are very pleased with Mason's progress. We know his talent, but the work that Roberto De Zerbi is doing with him is extraordinary.“ Marseille currently sit in third place in the Ligue 1 table, five points behind Lens in second.

Chelsea boss Sonia Bompastor admits WSL title race is 'probably' over after limp loss to Arsenal at Stamford Bridge","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/man-city-chelsea-boss-sonia-bompastor-wsl-title-race-probably-over-loss-arsenal/blt675eec4e414c068c","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 09:58:09 GMT","

Chelsea head coach Sonia Bompastor has conceded her side are unlikely to win the Women's Super League this season after defeat to Arsenal left them six points behind leaders Manchester City having played a game more. The Blues were beaten for the second time in their last three home games.

Chelsea welcomed Arsenal to Stamford Bridge on Saturday lunchtime looking to close the gap on City to three points prior to the leaders' trip to London City Lionesses on Sunday. However, the reigning champions were beaten 2-0, with Beth Mead and Mariona Caldentey grabbing the goals just after half-time. The result means Chelsea are unlikely to win a seventh-straight WSL title.

Speaking to the press post-match, Bompastor admitted: ""Today we understand the situation. We know the title race is probably gone, but our mentality is to fight until the very end.

""We will never give up. Now we have to focus on getting points and staying in that second position and doing the best we can. There is a big gap and if City win tomorrow then the gap is nine points. They are in control and if they perform at their best it will be a difficult gap to close.

""My job is to make sure I lift everyone up and we take the learnings and we go into the next game ready to perform. We will have one or two days really low but we will have a good conversation, as usual, and from that everyone will be lifted.""

In an interview with Chelsea's club channels, Bompastor added: ""My mentality is to keep working hard to give everything we can because the gap is big, but nothing is impossible. So we need to try to control what we can and focus on ourselves, to make sure we put as much pressure as we can on Man City. We need to now protect our second place.

""That's where we are, and it will be tough until the end. We have nine games left. But that's the job we need to do. I know my players, and I know the DNA we have at this club. This result hurts everyone, but the best way to bounce back is to have a good reaction. I think mentally we are strong enough to stay confident. We know the qualities we have in the squad, and that's what we need to focus on, making sure we take the good learnings from this game and look to the future with confidence.""

Chelsea and Arsenal both played in the semi-finals of the Women's League Cup on Wednesday, with the Blues beating City away from home while the Gunners lost to Manchester United at Meadow Park. Lucy Bronze said to Chelsea's club channels that Saturday's hosts were still feeling a little 'tired' from their midweek excursions.

""At the end, we created enough chances to at least get one goal back, and that might have swung it a little bit,"" Bronze said. ""I think in the first half we started really well, but it was a bit of a basketball game, up and down the pitch.

""They were just clinical on those chances they had. The second one was a bit of a killer because it was two in quick succession, and then at the end, you saw us pushing. If we had got a goal, we probably could have nicked a point.

""Coming off the back of the Man City game, there were probably a few tired legs out there, and Arsenal just attacked the game a little bit fresher. It probably took us a bit too long to get into our rhythm, but by the end, we were winning every single duel.""

Sunderland star Granit Xhaka allegedly told a West Ham fan he would ""see them outside"" following his side's 3-1 Premier League loss at London Stadium. The Swiss international missed the defeat through injury on Saturday, and during his time in the stands, it seems he was on the receiving end of some stick. Now, one supporter has opened up on their supposed interaction.

Just under a week after their dramatic late win at Tottenham, West Ham breathed new life into their bid to stave off relegation to the Championship with a convincing victory against Sunderland. They are now just two points behind 17th-placed Nottingham Forest after looking dead and buried just a week ago. Following the victory, West Ham boss Nuno Espirito Santo was full of praise for his players, who raced into a 3-0 lead, before conceding late on.

He told BBC Match of the Day: ""We played good, I'm always positive that things can improve, but clearly the connections, combinations, knowledge of each other as players are starting to happen. Things we are doing on the training ground are starting to be reflected on the pitch, and for me that is a joy. The mental side [is important]. We have to keep the momentum, we came from a good win. It was important to start the game this way with the same energy. The boys did it, we had a very good first half. We improved a lot in terms of managing the game, the tempo in the second half, knowing that Sunderland would react. We defended well, managed the time well, the possession, try to keep some threat in our attack. Overall, it was a good performance. The fans are giving back what we are asking, they support, sing, and today I think they are happy.""

In the second half, when West Ham were cruising to victory, it appears Xhaka clapped back at some taunts from home supporters. While Sunderland boss Regis Le Bris said he didn't know what happened, although he did admit it was a ""shame"" that things played out the way they did, one Hammers fan has opened up on their side of the story.

An unnamed West Ham supporter told The Sun: ""Another guy came [towards the dugout] to calm it down. Then Xhaka started picking on him – he wasn't doing anything, he's just saying ‘stop, stop' to Xhaka. And then Xhaka started calling him out saying, ‘I'll see you outside, I'll see you outside.' Then as he was heading down the tunnel after the game finished he was still going to the guy, ‘I'll see you outside'. It was all Xhaka, complete head loss. The geezer's on 100 grand a week getting rattled by absolute nobodies, just giving it the big ‘un. It was all on him.""

West Ham were worthy winners at home but Nuno did admit that Xhaka's absence, which was down to an ankle injury, helped the east London outfit. 

He added: ""Xhaka is an important player for Sunderland, his absence favoured us. But that doesn't take away from the quality of their squad, that's why they are where they are and they play good football. We controlled well, Tomas [Soucek] and Mateus [Fernandes] did very hard work.""

Le Bris made no excuses for his side's loss, saying that West Ham were deserved winners. He also provided an update on Xhaka's injury.

He said: ""They were better than us, they showed good quality, they started better, more aggressiveness and more composure with the ball. We were the opposite. The balance went in their favour at the beginning and they scored, it was well deserved. Our reaction in the second half was a bit better, we tried to change the dynamic of the game. We scored once, we have the opportunity to score the second but they were simply better than us. We have to accept it.

""It's [an] ankle injury, he [Xhaka] has a period of rest and see how long he will be.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Alcaraz passes Paul test to book Australian Open QF spot, faces De Minaur next","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/alcaraz-paul-australian-open-2026-r4","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 09:11:54 GMT","

 Carlos Alcaraz faced the sternest test of his 2026 Australian Open so far on Sunday afternoon, but the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings overcame the challenge of Tommy Paul to maintain his commanding start to the hard-court major in Melbourne. 

 Alcaraz overcame 19th seed Paul 7-6(6), 6-4, 7-5 with a fourth-round performance packed with explosive shotmaking to improve to 12-0 in sets played so far this fortnight. Paul, owner of two Lexus ATP Head2Head victories against the Spaniard, quickly showcased the threat he posed by opening a 4-2 lead early inside Rod Laver Arena. Yet Alcaraz soon recovered and produced some scintillating tennis to reach his third consecutive Australian Open quarter-final.

 “I think he started pretty strong. In the first game, serving, I thought I played a good game, but he came with really strong shots, really flat, and for me it was a bit difficult,” said Alcaraz in his on-court interview. “But I stayed there all the time and I knew I was going to have my chances, and I tried to take them. I think I did that. 

 “Overall, I think it was a really high level of tennis from both sides, but I'm just really happy that I got it in straight sets.” 

 The 22-year-old top seed fired 35 winners, according to Infosys Stats, en route to sealing a last-eight meeting with home favourite Alex de Minaur at Melbourne Park. With his two-hour, 44-minute victory, Alcaraz also stayed on track to become the youngest man to complete the Career Grand Slam (winning the singles title at all four majors). The current holder of that record is his countryman Rafael Nadal.

 In a tight first set, Alcaraz had to fight back from the early break deficit as 2023 semi-finalist Paul went toe to toe with the powerful Spaniard from the baseline. In the subsequent tie-break, Paul fired a backhand down the line to fend off a set point at 5/6 that proved to be one of the highlights of the match, but the American quickly undermined that effort by gifting Alcaraz the set with a double fault at 6/7. 
 With the momentum firmly in his favour, Alcaraz rode a purple patch to clinch a break of serve in the third game of the second set. The 24-time tour-level titlist produced a series of winners off his forehand in particular that had the Rod Laver Arena crowd gasping at the combination of spin and sheer velocity. 
 Paul, who won five of his first seven matches this season after not competing for the final three months of the 2025 season due to injury, continued to battle in trademark fashion in pursuit of his fifth Grand Slam quarter-final. However, although the 28-year-old did not lack moments of quality of his own, he was unable to sustain any real pressure on Alcaraz once the first set was gone. 
 After saving three break points to hold serve for 2-1 in the third game of the third set, Paul was unable to repeat the escape in the 11th game. Alcaraz crucially claimed his third break of the match before serving out to improve to 6-2 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Paul. 
De Minaur booked his spot in the quarter-finals for the second time with a comfortable 6-4, 6-1, 6-1 win against 10th seed Alexander Bublik, who had no answers for the Australian on Rod Laver Arena.
“I knew what I was in for today,” De Minaur said. “Bublik is a hell of a player. He has so much firepower and I lost to him the past couple of times. I made sure I was ready to go from the first point to the last and I was locked in. It was all about neutralising his big groundstrokes and doing my best to get him on the move and it all kind of worked perfectly.”

The sixth seed soaked up everything Bublik threw at him, tracking down drop shots and demonstrating fast reactions to repel the 28-year-old's big-man tennis. With his win, De Minaur defeated a Top 10 player at a major for just the third time, while he also equalled his best result at a Slam.
The 26-year-old holds a 0-5 record in major quarter-finals but will hope to change that record when he meets Alcaraz. He has dropped just one set this week in Melbourne.
“I think the last two matches I have played I have hit the ball extremely well and am extremely pleased with my level,"" De Minaur said. ""I think I am doing everything I want on the court and I am excited for the next one, that is going to be a big one. I am going to have to come out here guns blazing and I am excited for a battle.”

Jakub Mensik has withdrawn from the Australian Open due to an abdominal muscle injury, giving Novak Djokovic a walkover into the quarter-finals.

“After doing everything we could to keep going, I have to withdraw from the Australian Open due to an abdominal muscle injury that has progressed over the last matches,” Mensik said. “Even though I'm disappointed, making the fourth round here for the first time is something I will carry with me for a long time. 

“I felt so much energy from the fans and the atmosphere in Melbourne was truly special.”





After battling past former Top-10 star Pablo Carreno Busta in five sets in the first round, Mensik beat Rafael Jodar and Ethan Quinn in straight sets. But he will not take the court for what would have been a rematch of the 2025 Miami final, won by Mensik.

Djokovic will take on fifth seed Lorenzo Musetti or ninth seed Taylor Fritz in the quarter-finals. The 10-time Australian Open champion is pursuing his 25th major trophy.

When Daniil Medvedev stepped onto court on Sunday to face Learner Tien in the fourth round of the Australian Open, he was perfect on the season, holding an 8–0 record according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

A little more than 90 minutes later, however, the first blemish on his 2026 scorecard had been firmly marked. The former three-time finalist in Melbourne had few answers for Tien, who delivered a commanding 6-4, 6-0, 6-3 victory. Still, when reflecting on the defeat, the 29-year-old Medvedev was keen to keep perspective.

“I think I should focus more in general. If we take the past eight tournaments, starting from US Open, I played great,” Medvedev said. “I beat a lot of players. I played great against some top players. In general, I was going far in the results. Even here, I won two very tough matches against opponents who played well, [Quentin] Halys and Fabian [Marozsan].

“So I should try not to focus on this exact match, which was not good, because he outplayed me, so that's not a good feeling. But I should focus more on the general picture and just continue working the way I did for the last tournaments. If I manage to play good, beat all the players I have beaten in all these tournaments, I can get to where I want. Of course, it's unfortunate to finish a Grand Slam like this when I was feeling well and confident, but it is what it is.”

After a somewhat testing 18 months, Medvedev has looked closer to his best since the start of the Asian swing in September. The former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, now coached by Thomas Johansson and Rohan Goetzke, has won recent titles in Almaty and Brisbane and earned Top 10 victories against Alexander Zverev and Alex de Minaur.
However, he has now lost three of his four Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings against the 20-year-old Tien, who also defeated Medvedev in Melbourne last year. Despite his frustrations with Sunday's match, Medvedev was full of praise for the reigning Next Gen ATP Finals champion.
“He played great, super-aggressive. Even when I was making good shots, he was making a better shot back,” Medvedev said. “I didn't find many solutions today on the court, which is rare, and I didn't feel that many times in my life like this.
“But, again, these things can happen. He had an unbelievable match where everything went in. It did happen to me as well a couple of times, and you even kind of feel sorry for your opponent, because, okay, I can go for tweener now and probably with closed eyes and make it. It happens. I should have done maybe something a little bit better to try to disturb this rhythm of his.”
Medvedev is next scheduled to play at the ATP 500 event in Rotterdam, where he won the title in 2023.

After racing out early and navigating a second-set surge from Victoria Mboko, Aryna Sabalenka leaned on her tiebreak poise to move into the Australian Open quarterfinals, where another teenage test awaits.

World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka started fast and steadied late in a 6-1, 7-6(1) win over No. 17 seed Victoria Mboko on Sunday in Melbourne, booking her place in the Australian Open quarterfinals for the fourth straight year.

Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Aware of the challenge posed by the 2025 WTA Newcomer of the Year -- playing a World No. 1 and stepping onto Rod Laver Arena for the first time -- Sabalenka came out in punishing form. She raced through the opening set and surged ahead 4-1 in the second, taking full control in just over 45 minutes.

But as in her previous two matches, the top seed's level dipped with a commanding lead. Mboko capitalized, breaking Sabalenka twice in the second set -- including at 5-4, after Sabalenka failed to convert three match points -- and later pulling the set back to deuce at 6-5, two points from forcing a decider.

That was as far as the comeback went. Sabalenka reset in the tiebreak, the scenario she has made her own over the past 18 months, improving to 20-0 in Grand Slam tiebreak sets as she closed out the win in 1 hour and 26 minutes.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Sabalenka said beforehand that she hadn't yet had the chance to practice with Mboko or watch her play up close -- perhaps symbolic of the 19-year-old's rapid rise on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz over the past 12 months -- but Mboko's competitive spirit and tenacity still left her impressed.

“What an incredible player for such a young age,"" Sabalenka said in her on-court interview. ""It's incredible to see these kids coming up on tour. I can't believe I say that, I feel like I'm a kid still but whatever! Incredible player. She pushed me really hard today.

""I'm super happy with the win, once again in straight sets. She played incredible tennis. She pushed me so much. Happy to be through.""

Sabalenka later said that the midday Melbourne sun made serving difficult as the match progressed, and pointed toward that as one of the factors that helped Mboko climb back into the second set. But in the end, four winners in the first six points of the tiebreak helped push her through.

""She's incredible, that's for sure, but the tricky thing about playing the first match -- don't get me wrong I like to play the first match -- but the tricky part, at some point the sun goes right into your serve [hit] point. It's kind of like tricky. It's become not easy. You can break the serve,"" she said.

""That's what actually happened. Two breaks that she got, it was on the side when I was facing the sun. Yeah, I didn't deal that good with the serve. She done incredible job serving on that side. That's the tricky part.

""I knew she's going to be fighting. I knew she's going to be trying. She kind of like has nothing to lose. She showed incredible tennis in those moments when she broke my serve.

Elina Svitolina bested Mirra Andreeva on Sunday night at Rod Laver Arena, defeating the No. 8 seed in straight sets to set up a meeting with another young star in Coco Gauff. It will mark Svitolina's 14th Grand Slam quarterfinal appearance.

Only three players have reached more Grand Slam quarterfinals than Elina Svitolina since her Slam debut in 2012:

That's the entire list. Svitolina sits next, and on Sunday night she added to her total, advancing to her 14th career major quarterfinal -- and fourth at the Australian Open -- with a 6-2, 6-4 win over World No. 8 Mirra Andreeva in 1 hour and 23 minutes on Rod Laver Arena.

“It's unbelievable,” Svitolina said in her on-court interview. “I'm very, very pleased with the performance tonight, and I had to really put up a fight and fight until the very last point. It was an extremely nerve-wracking match, and I was very happy the way I held myself.”

The victory improves her record to 7-14 against Top 10 opponents at Grand Slams and 2-3 at the Australian Open. She'll get another chance to improve those numbers in the quarterfinals, where World No. 3 Coco Gauff awaits in what will be their fourth meeting at the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz level.

""I don't want to think too much about it,"" Svitolina said of her next match. ""It's, like, another opportunity for me to go far in the tournament.

""I want to focus on my recovery. I want to focus on my game plan that I have to execute well. I think right now this is the priorities for me.""

And before she could look ahead, she had to get through Andreeva, who arrived in Melbourne fresh off a title run in Adelaide and appeared poised for another deep push.

Svitolina shut that door quickly, leaning on her experience to take control of the match's biggest moments and keep the 18-year-old from ever settling in.

“I was expecting a tough battle and lots of long rallies,” Svitolina said. “I was trying to just move my feet extremely well today, be really focused and find the small holes in her game and try to use them.”

With that in mind, here are three key points that swung the match in Svitolina's favor:

1-0, First set: It goes against conventional wisdom to say the first game shaped the match, but it would be hard to overstate how critical it was. Svitolina was taken to school on the first three points, as Andreeva took the ball early off the 31-year-old's racket on her first serve of the match and deposited a forehand winner back down the line en route to a 0-40 lead.

But Svitolina responded with poise. She saved the first break point with a forehand winner of her own and rattled off five straight points to hold for 1-0. It proved to be a preview of the streaky match to come.

2-1, Second set: After Svitolina closed the first set by winning the final three games, she opened the second set with a double fault and was broken at love. Andreeva was surging, having won the first 10 points of the set and 11 of the first 12.

The last of those came on a wicked slice drop shot that gave her double break point and a chance to go up 3-0. Instead, Svitolina steadied herself again, saving the first break point with an ace and winning four straight points to hold for 2-1, avoiding a potentially devastating double-break deficit.

6-4, Second set: That hold proved pivotal, as Svitolina broke back in the very next game, and after four straight holds, found herself leading 5-4.

What followed was the point of the match: a 22-shot rally in which Svitolina spent much of the exchange scrambling but managed to push one last ball over the net. The net cord nearly helped Andreeva, but her slice return dipped just low, moving Svitolina within two points of victory.

Andreeva saved one match point -- created by her own double fault -- but another unforced error, one of 33 on the night, handed Svitolina a second chance. The Ukrainian capitalized, burying one final forehand winner to end it.

Her attention now shifts to Gauff, whom she trails 1-2 in their head-to-head. Her lone win, however, came five years ago in Melbourne.

Two-time Grand Slam champion Coco Gauff fought past Karolina Muchova in three sets to reach the Australian Open quarterfinals, improving to 5-0 against the Czech. The American's latest win marks her third straight quarterfinal appearance in Melbourne, where she will face Elina Svitolina.

Two-time Grand Slam champion Coco Gauff battled past Czechia's Karolina Muchova in three sets to advance to the Australian Open quarterfinals Sunday.

Gauff, who won the 2023 US Open and the 2025 French Open, dominated the opening set, racing to a 5-0 lead before closing it out 6-1. In the second set, after the players exchanged early breaks, Muchova broke again in the fourth game and held on to take the set 6-3. It marked the first set the Czech had taken from Gauff, ranked No. 3 on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, in their five career meetings.

At 1-all in the deciding set, Gauff won 12 of the next 13 points to build a 4-1 lead. Despite stiff resistance from Muchova, the third-seeded American held firm to seal the 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 victory in just under two hours.

""I feel like with each match you start to relax a little bit more,"" Gauff said to press. ""But also, as you keep going, usually the ranking of the opponent gets higher, so the matches should be a bit tougher, which they have been.""

Here's a look at some of the interesting numbers from Gauff's win:

3: Gauff will make her third consecutive quarterfinal appearance at the Australian Open. She reached the semifinals in Melbourne in 2024, losing to Aryna Sabalenka, and the quarterfinals in 2025, falling to Paula Badosa. She is also the youngest American woman to reach three or more consecutive singles quarterfinals at the Australian Open since Mary Joe Fernandez from 1990-93.

5: The victory improved Gauff's head-to-head record against Muchova to 5-0. The American had not dropped a set against her Czech rival in any of their four previous meetings. Interesting to note that Gauff has gone on to win the title at each of the previous events in which she faced Muchova -- Cincinnati and the U.S. Open in 2023, Beijing in 2024 and with Team USA at the United Cup in 2025.

6: This marks the sixth consecutive year Gauff has reached a Grand Slam quarterfinal. She is the youngest woman to reach the quarterfinals at a major for six or more straight years since Martina Hingis (1996-2002) and Venus Williams (1997-2002).

10: Gauff is through to the quarterfinal round at a Grand Slam for the 10th time in her career. In addition to her three quarterfinal appearances at Melbourne Park, she has reached the last eight five times at the French Open and twice at the U.S. Open.

41: Gauff has won her last 41 Grand Slam matches when taking the opening set. The last time she lost a major match after winning the first set was at Wimbledon in 2022 against fellow American Amanda Anisimova.

50: Gauff converted 50% of her break-point opportunities on Sunday, breaking Muchova four times on eight chances. Muchova converted 40% of her break points, going 2 for 5.

Gauff will face Elina Svitolina in the quarterfinals, and hold a 2-1 advantage over Svitolina, winning the most recent two clashes.

""I feel like the more experience I get at this level -- maybe not the easier it gets, but the more used you get to dealing with those difficult situations,"" Gauff said. ""Obviously losing the second set today, I'm glad I was able to reset and kind of go on to play some good tennis after that.""

Iva Jovic hasn't waited long to reach her first Grand Slam quarterfinal, but that didn't keep her from rushing past Yulia Putintseva in 53 minutes Sunday to book her spot in the final eight at the Australian Open. She dropped just one game.

Iva Jovic has arrived.

Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Playing in just her sixth Grand Slam, and her first as a seeded player, the 18-year-old American powered into her first major quarterfinal with a 6-0, 6-1 win over Yulia Putintseva in 53 minutes.

The victory puts her in rare company: Jovic is now the youngest American to reach the Australian Open women's singles quarterfinals since Venus Williams in 1998. Like Williams, she has reached this stage without dropping a set.

“I feel great,” Jovic said after the match. “I'm really glad to get through. Obviously, the score line is favorable, but it doesn't matter how you get it done. I just wanted to get it done, and it felt like if I let her come back a little bit, it would become a dog fight. So I just tried to keep it as far away as possible, and I'm just so happy to be in the quarterfinals.”

There, she'll face World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka for the first time at the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz level, a challenge she's choosing to embrace.

“I'm just going to try to keep taking care of my side of the net,” Jovic said. “Obviously she's number one for a reason and has had so much success at this tournament, but that's what I want.

“I said it last year. I hope to be able to play her this year, because you definitely want to play the best and see how it goes. So I'm just really excited.”

That confidence was on full display against Putintseva.

Jovic showed only a hint of nerves in the opening game, falling behind a couple of break points. She responded with four straight points to hold for 1-0 and was off to the races.

It's difficult to single out one part of her game, given how complete the performance was, but her ability to find winners, especially on return, stood out. Up triple break point in the fourth game, she followed a Putintseva save with a timely backhand winner to break for 4-0.

She added another backhand winner to hold to love in the next game, then secured a third break to wrap up the opening set in just 25 minutes.

Every reason to smile 👏#AO26 pic.twitter.com/Eh9CetTpqH

The second set followed a similar script. Jovic kept producing winners, her serve remained rock solid -- landing 71% of first serves and winning 67% of those points, along with 73% of second-serve points -- and Putintseva's frustration grew, punctuated by a subtle racket toss.

Perhaps coincidentally, Putintseva broke Jovic for the first time after that to finally get on the board at 4-1 in the second set, but the momentum shift was brief. Jovic broke right back and served out the match, which stands as the quickest of the Australian Open so far.

With the win, Jovic has now reached the “Final 8,” as she wrote on the camera lens after the match. She has reached this stage in all three tournaments to open her 2026 season, becoming the youngest player to do so since Maria Sharapova in 2005.

Published Jan 25, 2026

MELBOURNE, Australia—Preparing to play an opponent who's beaten him twice before, Carlos Alcaraz was ready to “suffer” to win his fourth round at the 2026 Australian Open.“I have to accept the tough moments that is gonna be in the match,” he said on Friday. “You know, from that, just move on, and I'm trying to feel comfortable, you know, in those rallies, in those tough moments.”Ultimately it was Paul who suffered through three sets; though he broke Alcaraz in the opening game, the top-seeded Spaniard eventually “suffocated” the in-form American to advance, 7-6 (6), 6-4, 7-5.“He makes you feel like you have no time,” the No. 19 seed explained. “He rushes you.“I hit my forehand terribly today, and he saw that early. He was trying to get in that forehand-to-forehand rally, and he did it much better than I did. That's what it felt like. It felt like he got all the patterns he wanted, and I was having a tough time getting into the patterns that I wanted.”

Paul enjoyed early success against Alcaraz, beating him in back-to-back years in 2022 and 2023. But the world No. 1 has pulled away in their head-to-head, winning their last five matches despite Paul keeping each match close.“You know you're going to have fun, at least,” sighed Paul, who shut down his season after the US Open last summer. “When we have points like that and the crowd loves it, we love it. You know that you're going to have fun points. You know that you're going to, like, have points you both play great tennis.“I wish we had more of them today, honestly. Obviously for me that means that I'm coming up with shots and being a shot-maker. Obviously we've all seen that he does that. I wish there were more. That is the fun part about playing Carlos, though.”Alcaraz largely sacrificed fun in favor of efficiency, the reigning Roland Garros and US Open champion pleased to have made it past Paul with minimal scar tissue heading into the quarterfinals.

At the time, there was no formal extreme heat protocol at AO. Courier declined the tournament's offer to close the roof, and both players endured brutal conditions as temperatures exceeded 100°F.“Edberg and I played a four-set match, it was not even three hours on the clock, and both of us were cramping while we were waiting for the trophy presentation,” Courier added. “Our bodies were just in shock. That's what happens: your body goes into shock.“I applaud the tournament, given how much more physical the game is now compared to how it was back then.”According to the Australian Open Extreme Heat Protocol, “In the event of extreme heat, the Referee has the right to suspend play or order a cooling break” based on the Australian Open Heat Stress Scale (AO-HSS), which ranges from 1 to 5.The scale reached Level 5 on Saturday, triggering the suspension of all matches and practices on outside courts and prompting roof closures on Rod Laver Arena, Margaret Court Arena and John Cain Arena. The protocol specifies that matches continue until an even number of games in a set before the roof is closed—meaning the timing, however inconvenient, was done completely by the book.

I smiled a little bit when the heat rule went into effect... it was kind of funny timing. Spizzirri after Sinner defeat

Spizzirri himself acknowledged as much.“You know, I smiled a little bit when the heat rule went into effect, just because it was kind of funny timing as I went up 3-1,” he told reporters in Melbourne. “But at the same time, the game at 2-1 in the third set was when the heat (index) hit 5.0, which means that the heat rule is in effect. So whenever that game was over—whether I broke or whether he held—we were going to close the roof.“It was just funny that right when I broke and he was wobbling.

The No. 16 seed sends Djokovic into the quarterfinals after withdrawing from their scheduled fourth round on Monday.ByDavid KanePublished Jan 25, 2026 copy_link

Published Jan 25, 2026

MELBOURNE, Australia—Jakub Mensik joins Naomi Osaka on a growing list of players suffering abdominal injuries at the 2026 Australian Open, the No. 16 seed withdrawing from his scheduled fourth-round clash with Novak Djokovic Sunday night.“This is a tough one to write,” Mensik wrote in a statement posted to social media. “After long discussions with my team and doctors we decided not to step on court tomorrow.“Even though I'm disappointed, making the fourth round here for the first time is something I will carry with me for a long time. I felt so much energy from the fans and the atmosphere in Melbourne was truly special. Thank you to my team for being with me every step, and to everyone sending messages and cheering—it means more than you know. Now it's time to recover properly.”

Why does F1 have regulations?

First look at Ferrari's 2026 car

With pre-season testing fast approaching, Lawrence Barretto outlines how the Barcelona Shakedown will unfold.

With the winter break firmly in the rearview mirrors and several of the teams having already completed a first run of their car during a filming day or released imagery of their new livery and machines, attention is now turning to the next step – the Barcelona Shakedown.

Right, then. Talk to me. What's the Barcelona Shakedown?

It's an opportunity for teams to run their car without limitations like a maximum of 200km of running on promotional tyres that is permitted during filming days, so they can start checking parts on the new machines work as expected.

OK, you've got me hooked. Tell me more...

Well, firstly – this is a first chance to stress-test their race machines in real life rather than in the world of simulation. If they have already done a shakedown, that would have focused on system checks and to make sure a car that has been bolted together for the first time does what they thought it would do.

If they didn't, the early running in Barcelona will be focused on that. Barcelona then offers teams a chance to put some mileage on the cars, on the parts and on the power units – and see how those elements react in reality.

OK, that makes sense. So, when does it start?

I'm glad you asked. It'll kick off on January 26 and run until January 30. That makes it a five-day event but teams will only be permitted to run on three days. They can choose when they run.

Why is that the case?

This gives teams flexibility to run when it's convenient for them. Some might choose to run one day, then use the next day to work on the car or wait for new parts and then run on day three. Others might want to wait and run on day two or even the final three days to give them extra days to work on their project.

It also gives teams the chance to react to bad weather. If the forecast is rainy or snowy on one particular day, they are perhaps better off waiting for a clearer day to maximise the mileage they can gather.

Can we watch it?

Unfortunately not. This is a closed event and very much what it says on the tin – it's a shakedown.

The main focus of this event is for teams to get mileage on the cars and start to learn about how it works, how the various parts react and where they need to improve. It won't be about chasing performance – that'll come in Bahrain, providing they are all in good shape.

However, I've got good news. There will be a daily highlights video, short interviews from the key protagonists – drivers and team principals – and clips on social media plus teams will be posting their own stuff and we'll have supporting coverage across Formula1.com, too.

Lovely. So when does Official Pre-Season Testing begin?

That'll be next month and, once again, Bahrain plays host. Last year, F1 had just one pre-season test at the desert track. This year, there are two – given the scale of the changes to the regulations. Both tests are three days apiece.

Test one starts on February 11. There's a four-day gap before test two starts on February 18. This is when things start to ramp up.

Beyond the teams using the running to learn about the cars, there'll be plenty for the drivers to swot up on, too, with a greater set of tools – like boost, overtake and recharge – to attack and defend on Grand Prix weekends. That makes this running even more important than usual.

It's likely that the car some teams bring to the first test in Bahrain will look different to the one seen in Barcelona – with some also likely to bring new bits to the second Bahrain test.

It's also very possible some teams will bring an update package for the first race in Australia, which takes place March 6-8 while others will bring the car they plan to race in Australia to Barcelona and spend the nine days of running really getting to know their car while giving them scope to check out everyone else's innovations in case they missed something.

That means getting a sense of the pecking order will be trickier than ever.

Can we watch the tests in Bahrain?

You can! The last hour of each day of running in the first Bahrain test is set to be streamed live. There will also be an assortment of content to keep you in the loop across Formula 1's channels – F1.com, F1's social media and F1 TV.

Then for test two – when things get serious and we start to see a pecking order start to form as teams chase performance – you'll be able to watch every minute of every single day on a full live broadcast. There will be a suite of analysis content, too.

Oh, I like the sound of that. And then what happens?

It'll be a final push to get the cars ready for their debut race weekend in Australia – the first of 24 Grands Prix weekends that will culminate in a finale in Abu Dhabi.

Why does F1 have regulations?

First look at Ferrari's 2026 car

From new engines to revised aerodynamics and everything in between, there have been plenty of F1 regulation changes over the years…

F1 will enter a new era in 2026 as overhauled cars and power units take to the track. But what about the other major regulation changes the sport has witnessed in years gone by – and who benefitted from them? F1.com provides an overview…

Although there had already been several rule changes since the inception of the F1 World Championship in 1950, the 1961 season was revolutionary for the sport, with normally aspirated engine capacity cut from a maximum of 2.5 litres to 1.5l, and a minimum car weight of 450kg introduced.

“Ferrari were the best prepared for the new regulations, given the British teams that had dominated previously felt, wrongly, that their influence would lead to the rule changes being dropped,” wrote Edd Straw in a previous F1.com feature, pointing to Cooper's rear-engined revolution in 1959 and 1960.

Ferrari's new engine – based on the 1.5-litre V6 Formula 2 unit used in 1960 but with a raft of modifications – and their sleek 256 ‘Sharknose' chassis dominated the season, winning five out of seven World Championship races, while Phil Hill claimed the title after team mate Wolfgang von Trips died in a crash at Monza.

In 1977, ‘ground effect' well and truly arrived in F1 with the revolutionary Lotus 78 – Colin Chapman's creation mastering the fine art of using the underside of the car to generate negative pressure and suck it towards the track.

However, with rival teams applying their own solutions over the coming seasons, and cornering speeds getting faster and faster, ground effect cars were outlawed from the 1983 campaign in favour of flat-bottom floor regulations.

Given that the final call came in November 1982, any ground-effect cars in the works had to be scrapped, with Brabham's BT52 – powered by a turbocharged BMW engine – being designed, manufactured and prepared in just six weeks.

The car won on its debut at the Brazilian Grand Prix in the hands of home hero Nelson Piquet, who ultimately pipped Alain Prost to the Drivers' Championship by two points with the help of a ‘B-spec' mid-season upgrade and some specially formulated fuel.

While Piquet and Prost led the charge for Brabham and Renault respectively, Ferrari also navigated the rule changes well to retain the Teams' Championship title – French duo Rene Arnoux and Patrick Tambay consistently scoring podiums and points.

Renault began an F1 trend when they introduced the sport's first turbocharged car in 1977. While the RS01 was extremely unreliable, it eventually showed enough promise to prompt many of their rivals to adopt the technology.

Turbo cars were part of F1 for more than a decade, but growing safety concerns over just how much power they produced, as well as the costs involved, led F1's governing body, the FIA, to introduce limitations before banning them altogether.

Not that it stopped McLaren and engine partners Honda, who followed up an almost perfect 1988 season (across which they won all bar one race) with another commanding display in 1989 – defending both their Teams' and Drivers' Championship titles.

F1 was an electronic driver aids playground in the early 1990s, with Williams' FW15C the ultimate example by seamlessly combining active suspension, traction control, anti-lock braking and much more to dominate the 1993 season.

All of the above devices were banned for the 1994 campaign, though, while in-race refuelling was permitted for the first time since 1983, forcing teams to go back to their drawing boards and try to find lap time elsewhere.

Benetton and Michael Schumacher emerged as title challengers under the new rules, while triple World Champion and new Williams signing Ayrton Senna failed to finish the first three races before his fatal accident at the San Marino Grand Prix.

Another round of safety-based car changes were enforced in response to Senna's death, after which Schumacher – driving a Benetton that rivals had accused of rule-bending, and overcoming disqualifications and race bans – beat Williams' Damon Hill to the title via a controversial clash at the season finale.

The 1998 season signalled the start of a ‘narrow track' era in F1, with car widths reduced from two metres to 1.8m, while grooved tyres were also introduced (three on the front, four on the rear) to get spiralling speeds under control.

Williams became a leading force as the 1990s developed, winning the 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996 and 1997 Teams' Championships, as well as several Drivers' crowns, but they lost star designer Adrian Newey to McLaren the year before the 1998 reset came into play.

Newey's design office came up with a brilliant solution to the changes – the Mercedes-powered MP4-13 securing 12 pole positions, nine victories, 20 podiums and, most importantly, McLaren's first Drivers' and Teams' championships in seven years.

For some in the F1 paddock, there was a clear link to be made.

“All you can do is look at teams' performances and try and find the common denominator, and you'd have to say that without him Williams aren't doing so well, and with him McLaren are doing better than they were last year,” said Newey's former Williams colleague, Hill, early in the campaign.

Just over a decade later, F1 was on the brink of another reset – one that would flip the formbook on its head and produce the underdog story of all underdog stories.

With an array of winglets making their way onto cars across the noughties, it was decided that almost all aerodynamic devices – apart from the obvious front and rear wings (albeit to significantly different dimensions) – would be banned for 2009.

Meanwhile, driver-adjustable front wings were permitted, slick tyres were re-introduced, and teams also had the option to run an all-new KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery System) that turned energy generated under braking into a limited boost of horsepower.

Step forward Brawn GP, who emerged following Honda's dramatic exit from F1, struck a deal to put a Mercedes engine in the back of their design – which had been developed with huge investment from the Japanese manufacturer – and initially blew away the competition.

Aided by a novel ‘double diffuser' creation, Ross Brawn's eponymous team sensationally secured both of that year's world titles, racking up the wins early on – while the likes of McLaren and Ferrari struggled – and defending their position when rivals made gains.

One of the biggest engine overhauls in the sport's history took place in 2014 when teams swapped their 2.4-litre naturally aspirated V8s for the ground-breaking 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrid power units still used today.

Central to these new units were the MGU-K (Motor Generator Unit Kinetic) for the recovery of kinetic energy under braking, and the MGU-H (Motor Generator Unit Heat) for the recovery of heat energy from exhaust gases, along with a host of other changes.

Mercedes, having made plenty of progress since returning to F1 as a factory outfit in 2010, and having ploughed resources into the 2014 project, enjoyed a flying start to the new era – winning 16 out of 19 races and both world titles, with Lewis Hamilton crowned the Drivers' Champion.

It not only ended a spell of Red Bull dominance from 2010 to 2013, when every title went the way of the team and Sebastian Vettel, but marked the beginning of a Mercedes winning run that would go down as the longest in F1 history.

In 2017, the aforementioned 1998 reduction in car widths from two metres to 1.8m was effectively reversed, with chassis lengths, front and rear tyre widths, front wing widths and the minimum overall weight also increasing.

Producing more downforce and grip, the new breed of cars broke no fewer than 11 lap records (in Azerbaijan, Monaco, Austria, Great Britain, Belgium, Singapore, Malaysia, Russia, USA, Mexico and Brazil) over the course of the year.

Mercedes remained the team to beat despite how much had changed, with Hamilton winning another Drivers' title and the Silver Arrows retaining their Teams' crown, though Ferrari – and particularly Vettel – put up a much bigger fight.

As touched on earlier, ground effect was banned in 1983, but F1 chiefs decided to bring it back for 2022 in a set of sweeping changes predominantly aimed at reducing ‘dirty air' – making it easier for cars to follow each other and, in turn, for drivers to pull off overtakes.

The underbody therefore produced the majority of aerodynamic grip, front and rear wing specifications were changed significantly, bigger wheel rims were introduced alongside low-profile Pirelli tyres, bargeboards were scrapped and plenty more.

Prior to this change, Mercedes had dominated the turbo-hybrid years, winning all eight Teams' Championships from 2014, and all bar one Drivers' title in the same period – Red Bull's Max Verstappen ending that run in 2021 by edging out Hamilton.

For 2022, however, Honda-powered Red Bull kicked on, with Newey – one of few current designers who'd experienced those original ground effect days – overseeing a dominant 2022 challenger, before going even better in 2023 when the team amazingly took 21 out of 22 race wins.

For the 2026 season, it's all change once again. In a nutshell, cars will be shorter, narrower, lighter and nimbler, while ground effect tunnels are being replaced by much flatter floors, meaning less downforce and higher ride heights – in theory allowing for greater set-up variety.

A host of new driver tools are also available, including ‘Active Aero' (the ability to adjust front and rear wing elements at different points of the track), ‘Overtake Mode' (which essentially replaces the Drag Reduction System), a new maximum power ‘Boost' button, and a ‘Recharge' setting.

On the power unit side, while teams are still running 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrids, power balance has shifted – the Internal Combustion Engine output being cut and the electric motor being tripled, creating roughly a 50-50 split between petrol and electric.

That leads to more road-relevant designs, with the complex and expensive MGU-H heat recovery system no longer a feature, while F1's new engines will also run Advanced Sustainable Fuels, which were trialled in F2 and F3 in 2025.

Only time will tell who nails the latest F1 revolution…

After finishing the tallest urban free solo ever — streamed globally by Netflix as 'Skyscraper Live' — the renowned climber reflects on risk, joy and the existential message of his feat.


							By 

	Patrick Brzeski


Asia Bureau Chief


	Alex Honnold isn't sure what meaning viewers will ultimately take from his ropeless, death-defying ascent of Taipei 101 — but he has a few hopes.


	“Honestly, I don't really know,” Honnold told Netflix commentator Elle Duncan when she asked him — less than an hour after he had safely returned to the ground — what he thought the takeaway of his feat might be “for all of the people who watched across the world.”




	After briefly pausing to collect his thoughts, Honnold said he had learned from the response to his harrowing, Oscar-winning documentary Free Solo that “people kind of take the message that they need from it.”

	“People often find the inspiration that they need to pursue their own challenges, their own goals,” he explained. “Or, you know, it's often the kick they need to do whatever it is that they want to do in their life.”

	Honnold said he didn't expect Netflix viewers would suddenly feel inspired to take up the uniquely dangerous sport of free soloing after witnessing his example.


	“But maybe they'll watch something like this, and it'll be a reminder that their time is finite, and they should use it in the best way they can,” he added. “If anything, I hope that's what people take from it — that if you work really hard, you can do hard things, and maybe they should try.”

	











	Honnold's wife — and the mother of his two children — Sanni McCandless, was by his side at the press conference, just as she had been earlier on Sunday atop an upper balcony of Taipei 101 to embrace him after he descended from the spire. She said the aspect of her husband that viewers often miss is the underlying motivation behind the relentless work and personal risk he devotes to his craft.


	“What people don't understand until they get to watch him is how much fun he's having, and just how joyful he is when he's doing it,” she said. “It's almost like a childlike joy — like, I'm up here and I'm playing. I think that was the really cool part of today — that we all got to watch him have a lot of fun.”


	The joy was indeed surprisingly evident throughout Honnold's anxiety-inducing climb, which unfolded over just more than an hour and a half on Sunday morning local time, as he methodically worked his way up the 1,667-foot tower — completing what is now believed to be the world's tallest urban free solo ascent to date. Thousands of spectators gathered outside a large exclusion zone around the base of the building, while hundreds more watched from inside Taipei 101, waving from office windows and observation decks as Honnold passed, occasionally stopping to chalk his hands or flash a quick wave back.


	The route itself was divided into three distinct sections: a lower, slabby opening stretch of several hundred feet that served as Honnold's “warmup,” a long middle section of repeating “bamboo box” platforms that demanded sustained focus and pacing, and a final, highly exposed upper section featuring ringed overhangs and, at the very top, a narrow spire capped by a small spherical platform barely large enough for one person to stand on. Although it was a gloriously clear and sunny day in Taipei, conditions grew slightly more challenging as Honnold climbed higher, with winds whipping around the building's corners and upper reaches. Late in the climb, he also noted on mic, with a laugh, that he was feeling “kind of tired,” before calmly continuing upward.

	











	At the summit, Honnold pulled himself onto the spire's tiny platform, waved to the crowd below and briefly raised his arms in triumph before letting out a triumphant “siiiick,” while taking in the view and snapping a quick selfie.


	The climb was broadcast globally as Skyscraper Live, Netflix's latest foray into live programming, part of a growing slate of sports and event-based experiments. Lead-hosted by Duncan, the telecast combined live drone and helicopter footage, a cable-mounted camera system and on-building cameramen with pre-taped segments explaining the technical demands of the climb. A 10-second broadcast delay was built in as a safety precaution, and viewers were repeatedly warned not to attempt anything similar.


Skyscraper Live marked Honnold's first time free soloing in front of a large crowd — let alone a global TV viewership — since many of the rock faces he has completed are situated in remote wilderness locations. He said the reaction from the crowd — audible even as he climbed hundreds of feet above the street — surprised him. “It kind of gave it a different energy, which kind of bolstered me,” he said. “It felt more like a celebration than I expected.” Smiling, he added: “That was cool.”

The ceremony honors film and TV adaptations of written material, with both the authors of the source material and the screenwriters sharing the prize.


							By 

	Scott Feinberg


Executive Editor of Awards


	The writers of the feature film One Battle After Another and the TV series Death by Lightning, as well as the authors of the written works from which they were adapted, were recognized with the top prizes at the 38th USC Scripter Awards, a black-tie affair held in the Town & Gown ballroom on the campus of USC, on Saturday night.


One Battle After Another was adapted by Paul Thomas Anderson from the 1990 novel Vineland by Thomas Pynchon. Death by Lightning, a limited series that was adapted from the 2011 nonfiction book Destiny of the Republic: A Tale of Madness, Medicine, and the Murder of a President by Candice Millard, was written by Mike Makowsky.

	Anderson previously was Scripter-nominated for 2007's There Will Be Blood and 2014's Inherent Vice, the latter of which also was adapted from a Pynchon novel. Makowsky previously was nominated for the film adaptation Scripter Award for 2020's Bad Education.


	The Scripter winners, like the nominees from which they were chosen, were determined by a jury chaired by USC professor and Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences vp Howard Rodman. Other jurors included critics/journalists Justin Chang and Leonard Maltin (as well as, full disclosure, yours truly); authors Janet Fitch and Jonathan Lethem; screenwriters Eric Roth and Tyger Williams; producers Gail Mutrux and Jennifer Todd; and Elizabeth Daley, dean of the USC School of Cinematic Arts.


	In addition to One Battle After Another, this year's other film adaptation nominees — selected from a field of 43 options — were:


Frankenstein, Hamnet, One Battle After Another and Train Dreams are also nominated for the best adapted screenplay Oscar; Bugonia claimed the fifth slot. The Scripter and the best adapted screenplay Oscar have gone to the same project on 17 occasions: Schindler's List, Sense and Sensibility, L.A. Confidential, A Beautiful Mind, No Country for Old Men, Slumdog Millionaire, The Social Network, The Descendants, Argo, 12 Years a Slave, The Imitation Game, The Big Short, Moonlight, Call Me by Your Name, Women Talking, American Fiction and, last year, Conclave.


Hamnet nominee Zhao was previously nominated for — and won — the best film adaptation Scripter Award for 2020's Nomadland. Train Dreams nominees Bentley and Kwedar were nominated for it at the most recept Scripter Awards, for Sing Sing. And Frankenstein nominee del Toro was previously nominated for it for 2022's Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio, which was the first-ever animated nominee.

	











	And in addition to Death by Lightning, this year's other TV adaptation nominees — selected from a field of 64 options — were:


Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light nominee Straughan was a winner of the most recent film adaptation Scripter Award, for Conclave, and was also nominated for it for 2011's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy; he would have become the first person to win Scripter awards for both a film adaptation and a TV adaptation. Slow Horses — and specifically, its writer Smith — has received Scripter nominations in each of the past three years, winning in the first two of those. (No other TV program has won more than once.) And Dept. Q nominee Frank won this award for 2000's The Queen's Gambit, and was also nominated for the film adaptation Scripter Award for 1995's Get Shorty and 2017's Logan.

Michelle Mao, Haley Lu Richardson and Jin Ha play three people whose lives intersect over the course of a single night in Hong Kong.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	The South Korean-born video essayist turned filmmaker who goes by the mononym Kogonada emerged in 2017 as an assured new voice with the exquisite contemplation of physical and emotional architecture, Columbus. He confirmed that promise four years later with After Yang, a soulful reflection on identity and connectedness, not to mention a refreshingly open-minded view of the potential for A.I. to enrich rather than intrude on our lives. Kogonada continued sharpening his craft directing episodes of Pachinko and The Acolyte, before stumbling last year with A Big Bold Beautiful Journey, a high-concept romantic odyssey too precious and contrived to strike authentic chords.

	As a first step into larger-scale, star-driven (Colin Farrell and Margot Robbie) studio filmmaking, the movie's critical and commercial failure must have stung. It's understandable that Kogonada might crave a radical creative reset by going back to basics with an intimate, shoestring-budget film made on the fly without binding structures or complicated logistics. Such throat-clearing purification makes sense. But the resulting project, Zi, sad to say, is too wispy to be compelling as a narrative or even enveloping as a vibe.







	
	
		
					Zi		
	


The Bottom Line

	
	An adventurous experiment that doesn't pay off.
	



Venue: Sundance Film Festival (NEXT)Cast: Michelle Mao, Haley Lu Richardson, Jin HaDirector-screenwriter: Kogonada

								1 hour 39 minutes			






	The film came together when Kogonada invited six of his closest friends — actors Michelle Mao, Haley Lu Richardson and Jin Ha, regular cinematographer Benjamin Loeb and producers Chung An and Christopher Radcliff — to fly to Hong Kong on their own dime. With only a slender outline for a movie, they started shooting almost immediately, developing the idea as they went along. They came away three weeks later with Zi.

	











	Mao plays the accomplished young violinist of the title, who has undergone tests at the Center for Neurology and must wait for what she's certain will be distressing results the following morning. She ambles around the densely built-up city in what seems an alienated state, visiting her parents' graves and getting emotional as she berates herself for not doing more to look after them.


	As she sits weeping on concrete steps, convinced she's losing her mind, Zi is approached by Elle (Richardson), a concerned American transplant from Missouri. What's disturbing though is that Zi has already seen Elle in the visions of her future that haunt her; the most frequently recurring of them is an image of her being embraced by an older woman whose face is obscured. With each vision, Zi feels herself slipping farther away.


	The affable Elle insists on walking her home all the way across town, and as Zi slowly opens up about herself, the American says she knows someone who might be able to help her. They go to find Min (Ha), who has been living abroad, and despite bad memories of Hong Kong followed Elle back there even though she broke his heart when she called off their engagement. It's also revealed that Min works at the Center for Neurology and has been observing Zi from a distance, anticipating her troubled state.


	They spend the night drifting through the city — watching fireworks over the bay, singing Alanis Morissette at an outdoor karaoke bar, the two women exchanging necklaces, Min scaring off Elle again by coming on too strong. There's a soothing rhythm to their wanderings, with Loeb frequently shooting Zi from behind, in the unfussy, handheld style of the Dardenne brothers. But the movie also becomes draggy and repetitive, unformed in its intentions and as inarticulate as Zi about her untethered feelings.

	











	Poetry in cinema is a tricky thing; it must happen organically, not be studied or molded, no matter how loosely. Kogonada's film suffers by comparison with another recent drama partially built around walking-and-talking sequences, in which a city teeming with life becomes an outsize presence: Bing Liu's Preparation for the Next Life, which also featured Mao.


	The customary warmth and gentleness of Kogonada's approach and the corresponding delicacy of the three actors makes you keep wishing Zi would build more substance, more lingering poignancy instead of wafting along on its cloud of melancholy with characters that lack dimension. But it only acquires life intermittently, and sometimes in the wrong ways, like the cloying earnestness of Min singing a plaintive “Leaving on a Jet Plane” to Elle.


	With Columbus, Kogonada showed a lovely facility for exploring the ways in which people's inner lives and connections can be shaped by the private and public spaces they inhabit. He seems to be moving back in that direction here, but the effect is unpersuasive, at times almost inert. Here's hoping the director can manage to keep hold of his creative freedom while finding his way back to more emotionally robust storytelling.

The man allegedly stated how proud he was to be “white” after which he confronted Maxwell Alejandro Frost and told him “Trump was going to deport me before he punched me in the face,” confirms the politician.


							By 

	Chris Gardner



	A man was arrested inside Park City's High West Saloon after he allegedly assaulted Florida Congressman Maxwell Alejandro Frost and a female guest during a CAA party amid the Sundance Film Festival.


	Park City Police community outreach lieutenant Danielle Snelson confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter that officers responded to High West Saloon after midnight, responding to a report of an assault. After an investigation, they arrested Christian Young and determined that he “unlawfully entered a private party after previously being turned away for not having an invitation. Once inside the saloon, Young assaulted Florida Congressman Maxwell Frost and a female who was attending the private event.”

	Young was arrested and booked into Summit County Jail on charges of aggravated battery and two counts of simple assault with “each charge subject to a sentencing enhancement,” per Park City PD.

	The police confirmation affirms what THR had learned about the incident. Young had presumably crashed the party — he was not on the RSVP list nor was he known to be a guest of a confirmed attendee —  by sneaking in through an alternate entrance, per a source. At the time, CAA was in the midst of hosting its annual festival party at the popular Park City hotspot to kick off Sundance's first weekend and celebrate independent film and the agency's talent.

	











	Around midnight, Young went into the restroom where he allegedly began causing a disturbance in a racially-charged scene that shocked other men using the facilities when Young allegedly stated how proud he was to be “white.” The tense moment continued as Young then exited the restroom and allegedly punched a person of color, later revealed to be Frost. Security is said to have intervened quickly to detain the man until Park City Police arrived.


	Hours after The Hollywood Reporter broke the story, Frost took to X to state that he was the man who was assaulted. “Last night, I was assaulted by a man at Sundance Festival who told me that Trump was going to deport me before he punched me in the face. He was heard screaming racist remarks as he drunkenly ran off. The individual was arrested and I am okay,” posted Frost, who represents central Florida and Orlando in District 10. “Thank you to the venue security and Park City PD for assistance on this incident.”


	The identity of the female guest is not known at this time. Frost, who identifies as Afro-Latino, is an activist and justice-minded organizer who ran on a campaign to remain “laser-focused on working to deliver change and results on issues of housing affordability, healthcare, abortion rights, LGBTQ+ rights, voting rights, transportation, justice reform, climate change and more.”

	Reached Saturday morning, Park City Police confirmed to THR that a man was arrested at High West Saloon following an incident. They would not comment on any charges he is facing or his identity. A representative from the Summit County Sheriff's Office also declined to comment on the charges but confirmed that a man is still behind bars as of Saturday afternoon.

	











	The festival released a statement following the incident, writing, ”We strongly condemn last night's assault and abhor any form of violence, harassment, and hate speech. While the incident occurred at a non-Festival-affiliated event, such behavior is intolerable and against our values of upholding a welcoming and inspiring environment for all our attendees. ”


	The statement continued: “The safety and security of our festival goers remains our chief concern, and our thoughts are with Congressman Frost and his continued well-being. We encourage anyone with additional information on this matter to contact the Park City Police Department.”


	Park City Police have a strong presence around the city, especially on Main Street and nearby locations, including High West, which is located on a prominent corner of Park Avenue. The establishment has many floors, private rooms and close corridors, and it is understood that the alleged assault was an isolated and discreet incident that did not disrupt the festivities. Because CAA bought out the restaurant, it's likely that many guests had no knowledge that police were on the scene. The agency's events are long known to be tightly controlled with strict invite lists.


THR also reached out to High West for comment but an employee declined to offer details and said it is policy to not comment on private events. Once the news began to circulate online, Frost weighed in again Saturday evening, responding to THR's X post, “I am okay. Thank you for all the well wishes. We are in scary times. Please stay safe and do not let these people silence you. Onwards.”

	Late Saturday, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries responded to Frost's X post to state, “I am horrified by the attack on Congressman Maxwell Frost. Grateful that he is okay, but appalled that this terrifying assault took place. The perpetrator must be aggressively prosecuted. Hate and political violence has no place in our country, and the entire House Democratic Caucus family stands with Maxwell.” According to the U.S. government, assault of a congress person can be a federal offense.

The veteran star, who has received four Oscar noms in his career, praises his wife while recognizing the toll: “She's been going nuts because the whole award season is so insane, especially for a woman.”


							By 

	Chris Gardner



	It's a good week for the Ed Harris and Amy Madigan household.


	The veteran actor touched down this weekend in Park City, Utah, where he was honored for his decades of work as a screenwriting labs adviser at Friday's Celebrating Sundance Institute: A Tribute to Founder Robert Redford fundraiser at the Grand Hyatt Deer Valley. Harris and director labs adviser Gyula Gazdag received inaugural Robert Redford Luminary Awards, presented to them by Amy Redford and Michelle Satter, respectively.




	While walking the red carpet ahead of the event, Harris spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about how he feels about awards at this moment in time, and he promptly turned his attention toward his wife of 40 years, Amy Madigan. “My wife was just nominated for an Oscar,” he said. “So, in terms of awards at the moment, I think they're cool.”

Weapons fans think it's pretty cool that the woman who slipped into the shoes of Aunt Gladys in Zach Cregger's Warner Bros. film got singled out for her work in a horror film, a genre that typically has a tough time with recognition when it comes to the Academy Awards.


	At the time nominations were announced on Thursday, Harris was in Texas where he's filming a spinoff of the Yellowstone universe from Taylor Sheridan, a series titled Rio Paloma. “I didn't want to call because I knew she had gotten up at, like, 5:30 a.m., and then she probably tried to go back to sleep,” Harris explained. “I didn't talk to her until about 10 or 10:30 a.m.”


	It's understandable that Harris didn't want to bother his wife, considering how heavy a lift the whole season is for her. “She's been going nuts because the whole award season is so insane, especially for a woman, from what you're wearing to makeup, blah, blah, blah. But she's digging in on it. She's handling it pretty well, I got to say.”

	











	Harris knows the awards season swirl well after having been nominated for four Oscars, including nods in 2003 for The Hours; 2001 for Pollock; 1999 for The Truman Show; and 1996 for Apollo 13. “It's been a while,” he said, “but I kind of know what she's going through and I've just been trying to be supportive.”


	In what way? “Cook a lot,” he said with a smile. “So she doesn't have to.” The notice marks Madigan's second Oscar nomination, and it arrived nearly 40 years after her first for 1985's Twice in a Lifetime.


	Harris added that it's “been pretty remarkable” to see the response to Madigan's portrayal of Gladys, which has become something of a pop culture phenomenon. From the moment Gladys walked into the principal's office, Harris said he perked up. “Who is this?” he asked. There have been countless memes, Halloween costumes and loving tributes from horror and film fans alike. “It's such an iconic creature that she established,” he said, adding that he got a kick out of drag queen mimics. “I think it's pretty cool.” 


	Back to Redford. Harris said it was an honor to be receiving an award with the Sundance founder's name on it. “He was always very generous and I really loved him,” he noted. “Just his integrity and his honesty. He really, genuinely gave a shit about what he was doing. I mean, it was his generosity. It was very, very special.”

	











	During his acceptance speech at the fundraiser, Harris got choked up about having a front row seat while seeing so many artists find their voice over dozens of summers at the Sundance Institute labs. “It's just hard to describe for anybody who hasn't been a part of it. You really can't describe it because it's a unified positive. It almost sounds like a cult or something, but it's not. It's just about the work. And it's about helping these young filmmakers realize their scripts and understand their material deeper. Everybody's working for the same purpose. It's about artistic freedom, it's about love, it's about giving.”

""We might have a whole new record of f***ing songs that we just finished the other day,"" Grohl told the crowd during their Tasmanian show over the weekend.

Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl has hinted at a return to Australia — and confirmed a new album is finished — during the band's one-off Tasmanian show over the weekend.

	The U.S. rock veterans played a sold-out marathon set at UTAS Stadium in Launceston on Saturday (Jan. 24), marking their first Tasmanian performance in more than a decade and their debut concert in the state's second-largest city. The show, which ran close to three hours, was the band's only Australian date on the current visit.

	Late in the set, Grohl addressed the crowd with a major update on the band's next chapter, confirming that Foo Fighters have recently completed work on a new record.


	“We might have a whole new record of f***ing songs that we just finished the other day,” Grohl told the audience, delivering the first public confirmation that a follow-up to 2023's But Here We Are is complete.


	Grohl also hinted strongly that fans won't have to wait long to see the band back on Australian soil.


	“This won't be the last time you see us,” he said. “We'll be back here sooner than you think… and it's before my next birthday.”


	Grohl's birthday falls on Jan. 14, suggesting Foo Fighters could return to Australia before the end of 2026, though no official tour dates have yet been announced.

	











	The Tasmania performance carried additional emotional weight, marking one of the band's most high-profile Australian appearances since the passing of longtime drummer Taylor Hawkins in 2022. But Here We Are — Foo Fighters' 11th studio album — debuted at No. 1 in Australia and became one of the group's most critically acclaimed releases to date.


	Other notable moments from the Launceston show included an appearance by Brent Webb, the Australian miner who made international headlines in 2006 after requesting an iPod loaded with Foo Fighters songs while trapped underground.


	When the show was first announced, Grohl described the decision to play a single regional Australian date as part of the band's ongoing love affair with the country.


	“We have a very special relationship with Tasmania — as we do with all of Australia,” Grohl said at the time. “To come down and have a special night is amazing… even though we're literally flying down for 48 hours.”


	With a new album now finished and Grohl openly teasing a return, Foo Fighters' next Australian chapter appears firmly on the horizon.

	The British singer-songwriter finished ahead of Keli Holiday's “Dancing2” at No. 2 and Tame Impala's “Dracula” at No. 3, capping a tightly contested countdown that featured a strong mix of Australian and international artists. Dean also placed two additional tracks in the top 20, with “So Easy (To Fall In Love)” landing at No. 11 and her collaboration with Sam Fender, “Rein Me In,” finishing at No. 14.

			By Matthew Carey, Anthony D'Alessandro 


Meghan Markle and Prince Harry pulled into 13-degree weather at Park City, UT for the Sundance Sunday AM premiere of the documentary they EP'ed, Cookie Queens. This comes after the pic's world premiere last night in Salt Lake City, UT. 


	The Alysa Nahmias directed documentary follows four ambitious Girl Scouts with big personalities and ambitions, who are competing in a cookie sales industry worth $800 million. WME Independent and Submarine are co-repping sales on the movie. 


	Talking to Deadline at the Eccles Theatre, the Suits actress and Duchess of Sussex shared the lessons she learned as a Girl Scout, which she keeps with her today: “It really embeds such great values from the get-go. I was a Girl Scout, my mom was a troupe leader, and I think the value of friendship, of being dedicated to a goal as you can see that in Cookie Queens, it's so reflective of how these girls stick with something that's important to them and don't give up. And self belief is an integral value that comes with being a Girl Scout.”

	In the documentary, little Olive sells 12,000 boxes (spoiler alert), a record which Markle said she never ever hit.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“I don't remember,” beamed the Duchess of Sussex about her Girl Scout cookie sales records, “but it certainly wasn't 12,000! But I think I did really well.” 


	“We didn't have the same perks and leverage of using social media and VENMO, and QR codes that the girls use these days. It was really about a charm and a smile and who doesn't love a Girl Scout cookie? It's a pretty easy sell.”


	Markle's favorite cookie?


	“I think universally, Thin Mints is most people's favorite.” 


	Prince Harry's? “The shortbread cookies and he loves the Samoas.” 


	Is Princess Lilibet of Sussex bound to join the Girl Scouts? 


	“I think we'll continue to explore whatever feels right,” said Markle, “Alysa (the director) is a mom of a daughter, and I think for both of us working on this project it's been incredibly special as parents, as mothers to be able to see something our girls will be able to enjoy and watch as well.”

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


	The fatal shooting of an American by federal agents in Minneapolis today was left out of SNL‘s cold open tonight as the Lorne Michaels-run show went all Trump all the time again, with some old pals showing up.


	“You know this is such a special night, everyone wants to go home with a Trump, except Melania,” proclaimed Saturday Night Live's James Austin Johnson as the puffed-up POTUS himself in “The 1st Annual Trumps” awards skit.


	Screening her Brett Ratner-directed self-titled documentary tonight at the White House, the often absent First Lady was nowhere to be found in this evening's cold open. No Melania was all the more noticeable  by the fact that almost every SNL cast member was given a chance to play one of the many administration sycophants or allies — plus there was a cameo by Loki the God of Mischief as Trump's agent (sorry Ari Emanuel).

	











	However, the real star attraction was Mike Myers back as Elon Musk — even if it was for a TV nanosecond.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The too brief highlight of the skit's litany of Trump sins and insecurities (that Nobel Prize), the SNL legend and proud Canadian was there as the often annoying and very twitchy X owner to “accept the Lifetime Achievement Award for comedy, even though he might not always intend it,” according to Johnson's Trump's intro of “My close ex-friend Elon Musk.”


	“I'm so emotionless to be here, and if anyone knows humor, it's me,” Myers' Musk uttered before turning things over to “Carrie Underwood and the construction worker from the Village People” for “a mournful rendition of America's Funniest Home Videos theme.”


	Truth be told, on another tragic and a mournful day in America, the cold open was off tonight, even with Myers in attendance.


	Hosted by One Battle After Another star and newly minted Oscar nominee Teyana Taylor, tonight's SNL comes after yet another killing of an American citizen Saturday by Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis.


	Captured in numerous videos, the shooting death of Alex Pretti, a ICU nurse, has once again found the Trump administration asserting the deceased was a “domestic terrorist.” In cruel sentiments similar to that from the January 7 death of Renee Nicole Good, various MAGA officials claimed Pretti was threatening agents with a gun; the claim doesn't standing up next to the clear visuals of a man who was stepping in to stop the feds from assaulting a woman. While Pretti was carrying a registered weapon, the 37-year-old was moving to take out a phone when he was attacked and then shot.

	











	Even after a week of Trump's ludicrous Board of Peace, Greenland deal (or not), Davos grandstanding or the upcoming bloated-budget Melania documentary, it would not have been out of character for the NBC late-nighter to take a more solemn approach to its old open. Additional source material could have come from Netflix's delayed Skyscraper Live tower climbing spectacle out of Taiwan or the UFC's debut on the Trump buddies the Ellisons owned-Paramount+ live from Sin City — but topical wasn't where SNL really wanted to go today


	The 11th show of Saturday Night Live's 51st season, tonight is the first time Taylor has fronted the show, but likely not to be the last in a career that is taking off like a rocket to the moon. Joining the Golden Globe winner and Academy Award hopeful as musical guest is hot ticket indie band Geese. While this is the band's first SNL musical performance, Geese actually made an appearance of sorts last year when singer Cameron Winter was played by the show's Johnson (that guy again).


SNL is back next week for its 1000th show with Alexander Skarsgård hosting and Cardi B as musical guest.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	There's been a sting of standing ovations, which don't happen often at Sundance, the fourth of which from our count was tonight's world premiere of Olivia Wilde's sexual comedy The Invite at the Eccles Theatre. And at a time when comedies are rare on the big screen, here's one that triggered back-to-back shared laughter from the crowd.


	Pic follows two couples who live in the same apartment complex; Edward Norton and Penelope Cruz's progressive, sexually open couple, and Seth Rogen and Wilde's married in misery twosome. The two couples get together for wine, cheese and dessert — with a lot of laughs and something that speaks to middle age.

	“There's a seven hour movie you would have liked,” said Wilde who workshopped the screenplay with scribes Rashida Jones and Wil McCormack. The pic is an English language remake of the Cesc Gay Spanish film The People Upstairs. 


			Watch on Deadline		







	“We just dug into it with generosity and poured a spirit into with personal ideas,” said Wilde,”The cast brought this creative energy every day.” 


	Wilde told the crowed Eccles that the movie, which essentially takes place in one apartment, was shot in order, which was “such a luxury; we just kept generating ideas as we went.”


	Similar to how Charli XCX is doing double duty at Sundance (she had Gregg Araki's I Want Your Sex and The Moment last night at the Eccles), so is Wilde who after starring I Want Your Sex is a double threat here as a star and director on The Invite.

Senior Film Reporter


UPDATED, 5:22 p.m.: Maxwell Alejandro Frost, a U.S. Representative for Florida's 10th congressional district, has identified himself as the man assaulted during a racially charged incident at CAA‘s annual Sundance party on Friday.


	“Last night, I was assaulted by a man at Sundance Festival who told me that Trump was going to deport me before he punched me in the face. He was heard screaming racist remarks as he drunkenly ran off,” Frost wrote on X. “The individual was arrested and I am okay. Thank you to the venue security and Park City PD for assistance on this incident.”

PREVIOUSLY, 5:08 p.m.: A man was arrested at a CAA Sundance party on Friday after a racially charged incident in a restroom at at High West Saloon in Park City, UT, sources have confirmed to Deadline.


	What exactly prompted the incident isn't yet clear, and neither party involved has been identified as of Saturday. A caucasian man, the person arrested was said to have shocked those in his vicinity with remarks about his pride in being white. Subsequently, he was said to have punched a person of color in the face. 


	In the aftermath of the punch, security was quick to detain the assailant — a party crasher — who was taken into police custody. Whether the man remains in jail is not yet clear. Representatives for the Summit County Utah Sheriff's Department didn't immediately respond to request for comment on the incident.

	











	An annual presence at premier festivals worldwide, including Sundance, CAA is in town both to celebrate the premieres of clients and as part of an effort to help filmmakers lock down distribution. 


	Taking place in person in Park City and Salt Lake City from January 22–February 1, with an online component, this year's festival will be the last in Sundance's longtime hub of Park City, with a move to Boulder, CO set for next year.

Everyone needs to move with caution and have security or friends with them mow in public at all times..no joke..it's how it is at the moment

That's very strange for the location and venue.

They are everywhere..it's not stra ge it's Utah!

Nowhere is safe anymore  under this regime.

Expect a presidential pardon for the assailant.

Typical MAGA. Lame.

					By Glenn Garner 

Associate Editor


	For her Sundance directorial debut, Olivia Wilde has delivered a witty, emotional punch to Park City with the world premiere of The Invite.


	Also starring in the English-language remake of Spanish filmmaker Cesc Gay's The People Upstairs (2020), Wilde and Seth Rogen play a San Francisco couple who have a witty banter playing on the best of both actors' comedic chops, while immediately establishing their bickering old married couple dynamic as stay-at-home mom Angela and music teacher Joe.


	Following a rough day at work, Joe comes home to find Angie preparing for a fancy dinner with the couple upstairs, which she swears she told him about. While Angie is enamored with the effortlessly chic sex therapist Pina (Penélope Cruz) and jealous of her ability to achieve orgasms so frequently, Joe is annoyed by retired firefighter Hawk's (Edward Norton) overly friendly nature and the couple's “floor-shaking, animal fucking.”

	As the evening progresses, the four learn more about each other, changing their entire perspective on sex and relationships.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Wilde and Rogen nail the comedic timing and lived-in tension of their miserable married couple who still holds somewhat of a flame that just needs a little fuel and a lot of communication. Their chemistry for banter sometimes feels like a tennis match of passive aggression, which director Wilde uses to escalate the tension at the most pleasantly unexpected times.


	Meanwhile, Norton and Cruz offer the perfect antidote to the anxious energy with their disarming sexual humor. “We love a contentious environment,” Hawk assures them early on, as the uninhibited pair pushes their new friends out of their comfort zone. 

	











	Overall, the film explores dynamics of sex and relationships with raw and endearing honesty, as a once-head-over-heels couple blows up their marriage in the course of one dinner, and maybe attempts to repair it again. 


	Adam Newport-Berra's beautiful cinematography makes use of the most everyday of spaces with an intimate eye that feels as if looking at an old cherished photo of these characters, wondering what they're thinking.


	Coming off the polarizing reception to her last directorial outing Don't Worry Darling, Wilde's newest work more than makes up for any gripes with the sci-fi period piece, exploring the same themes of relationships and needing to feel valued, but with a presumably more manageable budget.


	Dedicated to Diane Keaton, The Invite would likely make the late star proud, echoing the neurotic nature of love and relationships, which the beloved writer, director and actress captured so timelessly in films like Annie Hall and Something's Gotta Give.


	Producers are David Permut, Ben Browning and Megan Ellison, with executive producers Saul Germaine, Patrick Chu, Shayne Fiske Goldner, Glen Basner, Andy Kim, Alex G. Scott and Alex Astrachan.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Lisa Rinna's daughter Amelia Gray Hamlin breaks down all the cosmetic surgery procedures she's had","https://pagesix.com/2026/01/24/celebrity-news/lisa-rinnas-daughter-amelia-gray-hamlin-breaks-down-all-the-cosmetic-surgery-procedures-shes-had/","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 01:58:00 GMT","

Lisa Rinna's model daughter, Amelia Gray Hamlin, pulled back the curtain on which cosmetic procedures she's had — and hasn't had done — in a candid new interview. 

“I've always had these lips,” Hamlin, 24, told Variety in an interview published Saturday, denying she's had fillers. 

“I'm doing this thing right now called SkinVive, which is a moisturizer injection, not a filler.”

Per the outlet, “The Beauty” actress has been “open” about having had rhinoplasty. The Victoria's Secret model has also previously spoken out about having a breast reduction in order to prevent a dangerous infection called sepsis due to a nipple ring. 

Advertisement

“I was 16 and had mastitis, whatever the heck that is,” she said on on the “Skinny Confidential: Him & Her” podcast in 2020. “It was the worst thing I've ever been through.” 

She subsequently had a breast augmentation, but admitted to regretting it. 

“I was dating somebody who was older than me when I was younger, and I sort of allowed his beauty perception to affect my choices, and I decided to get another breast augmentation because I wasn't necessarily happy with the scarring that I was left with from the reduction,” she told Variety. 

“I woke up in a state that I didn't agree to. We can just say that.”

She ultimately suffered complications. “That also turned into a medical emergency surgery, because my breasts literally could not handle what were put in me,” she told the trade publication. 

“It got to the point where I couldn't even pump soap because the implants were pushing on the nerves,” she added. “I ended up having to get a 14-hour reconstruction surgery.”

Gray has been open about body image issues before, divulging in 2020 that an eating disorder pushed her to the brink. 

“I woke up one morning at my best friend's house. My parents, my sister, they're all outside, like waiting to pick me up,” she recalled of her famous family's intervention during an episode of the “Skinny Confidential” podcast at the time.

“They're like, ‘Get in the car. We're going to UCLA [to get treatment].'”

A staff member there informed her that the situation was grim. “He looked at me and he was like, ‘At this rate, in about four months, you're going to be 45 pounds and you're going to be dead.'”

The news forced her to  “snap out of it” and decide to recover.

“I'm not going to be this type of person,” she explained. “I'm not going to ruin my life because of whatever issues I'm having.” 

“You don't need to be skinny to live your best life. It's either be skinny and die or happy and be who you are.”

Hamlin has since become extraordinarily comfortable with her flawless figure — she was seen rocking low-rise, see-through pants in Los Angeles and Thursday, and in October, she modeled a crystal-covered sheer dress at a Swarovski event.

In the comments section of the post, several stars paid tribute to Vo.

“I'm so sorry he was such an amazing human. Filled with such light and love xo,” Spelling, 52, wrote.

“Oh no!!! The iconic Perez pink and all my wold colors – as well as my lush blondes – were thanks to Kim. A master of his craft and art! Such a loss! 😢😢😢,” Perez Hilton added.

“I will never forget his kindness and how special I felt when I walked in those salon doors. May he fly high with the angels. I feel so lucky to have known him and am sending prayers for healing to all the hearts who loved him,” Emmy-nominated producer ​​Ashley Hammen commented.

Vo was the go-to colorist for many A-listers, including Gwyneth Paltrow, Britney Spears, Pamela Anderson, Goldie Hawn, Kate Hudson and Uma Thurman.

The movie will debut in 20 markets at the same time before theatrically opening in 30 territories around the world, we previously reported. 

We hear that guests entered to a military band playing a tune from the film's score, called “Melania's Waltz,” as well as other iconic movie music.

There were limited edition popcorn buckets, and a black-and-white theme at the event that was put together by Melania herself, a spy told us.

Guests also received a limited edition version of the First Lady's book, “Melania,” plus a framed, collectable screening ticket, and even cookies for the road.

Also expected at the 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue cocktail reception and screening, we hear, were Mike Tyson, branding exec Peter Arnell, Journey rocker Jonathan Cain, auto heiress Azzi Agnelli and Frankie Lagrange, Tony Robbins, TikToker Link Lauren, fashion designer Adam Lippes, Herve Pierre, Tam Kannalikham and New York Stock Exchange president Lynn Martin.

Amber Heard made a rare comment about the impact she felt after losing her ex-husband Johnny Depp's 2022 defamation trial.

During the Sundance Film Festival 2026 Saturday, the “Aquaman” actress made a guest appearance in “Silenced,” a documentary about accused men weaponizing defamation lawsuits to silence women speaking out about abuse.

“This is not about me. I have lost my ability to speak,” she said during a confessional chat with director Selina Miles, per Variety.

“I am not here to tell my story. I don't want to tell my story,” Heard, 39, added.

“In fact, I don't want to use my voice anymore. That's the problem.”

Page Six reached out to Heard's rep for comment but did not immediately hear back.

In February 2019, Depp, 62, sued Heard for $50 million for defaming him in a 2018 Washington Post op-ed about abuse.

Three years later, the mom of three lost the defamation trial and was ordered to pay her ex $10 million in compensatory damages and $350,000 in punitive damages. She was awarded $2 million in compensatory damages for her counterclaim.

In December 2022, the “Justice League” star settled the case with Depp, agreeing to pay him $1 million. 

Three months after losing the trial, Heard and her eldest daughter, Oonagh Paige, 4, relocated to Spain.

Last June, the “Edward Scissorhands” star claimed he was a “crash test dummy” for the #MeToo movement during his infamous trial.

“I'll tell you what hurts. There are people, and I'm thinking of three, who did me dirty,” he told the Times of London about his unnamed pals.

“Those people were at my kids' parties. Throwing them in the air. And, look, I understand people who could not stand up [for me], because the most frightening thing to them was making the right choice,” Depp added.

The “Pirates of the Caribbean” actor said his lengthy trial with the “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” actress was before the #MeToo movement, which amplified the voices of survivors of sexual harassment and assault.

“I was like a crash test dummy for MeToo … and I sponged it, took it all in,” he told the outlet.

“And so I wanted from the hundreds of people I've met in that industry to see who was playing it safe. ‘Better go woke!'”

A Hong Kong violinist who's losing her grip on reality, young Zi (Michelle Mao) is haunted by visions of her future self. The doctors at the local neurology center suspect that she might be suffering from the early symptoms of a brain tumor, but Zi — a being of pure cinema, cobbled together from the half-formed memories of films like “La Jetée” and “Cléo from 5 to 7” — will have to wait a long and lonely 24 hours for the test results to come back. 

Well, maybe not so lonely. Crying on one of the innumerable concrete steps that climb Lantau Island, Zi is consoled by a sweet American expat with a strangely familiar face (and an aggressively unnatural blonde wig). Her name is L, she's a disillusioned former dancer played by the luminous Haley Lu Richardson, and she can't help but reciprocate the inexplicable closeness that Zi feels towards her. Over the course of a single night together, these two lost souls will help to relocate each other in time — to resynchronize with the world around them, reconnect with the infinite potential of the present, and return themselves to the creative purpose that once anchored them to it.

Even if seen without a shred of context, it would be obvious to anyone that “Zi” was made by someone who is — or hopefully was — desperate to spark a realignment of his own. To steal himself away from regret and anxiety and tether his perspective back to the now. Shot without a script or a budget in the immediate aftermath of Kogonada's ill-received “A Big Bold Beautiful Journey” (the “After Yang” auteur's studio debut, by all indications a soul-crushing experience for an artist whose two previous features retained the delicate grace of the video essays that he used to make), this searching and unformed wisp of an experiment hardly represents the first time that an ascendent director has scaled down after a misstep, but “Zi” takes the notion of “one for me” to much greater and more galvanizing extremes than usual. 

 










This isn't just a filmmaker trying to get back on track, it's a filmmaker desperately, nakedly searching for a way to fall back in love with filmmaking itself. A way to prove that it might still love him back. (Kogonada described the project to IndieWire as “A retreat, as well as a pursuit.”)

While the prospect of watching Kogonada do that will naturally be of greater interest to those who have watched him get to this point, this movie's palpably improvised nature — its stolen shots and recursive shape lend the impression of someone trying to cut their ultra-evocative vacation footage into a coherent narrative — would force anyone to wonder about the meta-textual aspects of its creation. “You feel like your sole purpose in life is something, and it doesn't choose you back,” L sputters out at one point. “What do you do with that? I had to get away from it all. That's why I came here. Wandering.”

Since arriving in Hong Kong, she's made a habit of collecting sounds in much the same way as Kogonada has come there on the hunt for images. They both find a dissonance around Victoria Harbor that reflects their internal feelings of otherness and self-alienation. It's China, but not. It's a single city, but one split across two main areas by a stretch of the sea that some people never cross. It's among the world's most densely populated metropolises, but the vertical terrain seems fundamentally inhospitable to human civilization, and nature continues to assert itself between every skyscraper, shopping mansion, and crack in the sidewalk. Zi is the only native character in the film, but the history and design of Hong Kong reflects her disassociation as well — like her, the former British colony's experience of the present is delayed. 

 










That's the closest thing to a diagnosis we get for what ails her, though it's clear that Kogonada is leaning more towards soft science-fiction than the stuff of hard medicine. “Temoral relativism” is how L's ex-fiancé Min (Jin Ha) describes it, though he's slow to reveal how much he knows about Zi's condition. Everything she perceives is already in the past. I suppose that's true for all of us to some degree, if you factor in the nanoseconds that elapse between stimuli and our ability to perceive it, but the situation is more pronounced for Zi (who Mao plays with the effervescent helplessness of a paper airplane). Of course, that doesn't explain why she believes she's bearing witness to visions of her future self, but that confusion only exacerbates her feelings of distance from the present. 

Even in its more platonic dimensions, the threadbare story that gradually allows Zi to close that gap is awash with the romance of loss, reconciliation, and belonging. Kogonada is falling back in love with the movies right before our eyes, and yet,  in characteristic fashion, that process isn't garish or forced. His is a vision that is revealed through careful subtraction — by clearing away all of the dust and smudges that came to obscure it. 

While Kogonada indulges in a few legible winks to his cinematic forebears (the most obvious of those being a step-printed homage to Wong Kar Wai, and my most far-fetched being a disoriented nod to José Luis Guerín's “In the City of Sylvia”), he and cinematographer Benjamin Loeb almost completely eschew the neon exoticism that foreigners tend to look for in Hong Kong, with the vast majority of the film being captured in unfussy handheld shots that accentuate its here-and-now anxiety and delegate the emotional heavy lifting to an impeccably curated soundtrack of Ryuichi Sakamoto remixes and originals. 

 










By the end, “Zi” engenders a certain emotional attachment toward and between its characters, all of it building to a gently unexpected gutpunch of a final minute. But even that last-minute reveal — not a plot twist so much as a sudden change in perspective — is rooted more in the movie's form than its plot, as Kogonada's characters remain largely symbolic of their function in the writer-director's journey back to himself. 

It's a testament to Mao, Ha, and especially Richardson — who continues to be so good at grounding Kogonada's most abstract ideas in a tender human place — that “Zi” retains even a soft dramatic pull as it searches for the present, though its recursive nature certainly wasn't conceived with a casual audience in mind. If you're hooked, which I wasn't, or haunted by it, which I was, that will likely have less to do with an acute emotional connection to these characters than with the overflowing rewards of watching someone rediscover the sound of their own voice, and hear a way forward into the future in its echoes. 

“Zi” premiered at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

The most immediate thought is the most salient: how are we getting this close? The imagery of Jack Weisman and Gabriela Osio Vanden's documentary “Nuisance Bear” is startling, if only because the bear of its title (and many more of his brethren) are rendered so immediately visible, so present, so vivid that anyone with even the loosest grasp on human and animal interactions will have to wonder, at first, how? And then, at what cost?

That's the central conflict of both the film itself and its making: how were the filmmakers able to get so close to various polar bears that we're able to identify their individual teeth, and at what cost? As plain-faced as those queries are, as baked-in as they are from the film's very first shots, they are not answered within the film's slim 89-minute running time.

Instead, other — just as vital — questions are raised in place of real answers, all of these queries interlocked, none resolved, and many building to a kind of slow-speed panic. The basis of Weisman and Osio Vanden's film (itself expanded from their short film of the same name) is compelling, loosely chronicling a Canadian community known as the “Polar Bear Capital of the World” and some of the ursines that make their way there throughout the year.

But while the film includes many sequences following humans as they attempt to chase off the hundreds of bears who arrive each year (from bear traps to bear jail, whizzing fireworks and nightly patrols), waiting for the Hudson Bay to freeze over so they can venture forth on to the sea ice (well, for as long as that lasts), the film is less preoccupied with those machinations and more with what they mean in a larger context. That interest is compelling, but the actual execution is lacking. Documentaries should inherently spark questions and debate, but “Nuisance Bear” too often throws out a buzzword or heady topic and abandons it.

Mostly, the film is about changing ways of life — those ways foisted and forced upon unsuspecting and innocent communities of both bears and people — and the butterfly effect that naturally (or, in some cases, unnaturally) follows. Which is why it's unfortunate that the film, so able to get us so very close to nature (and, it should be noted, the film is visually stunning because of that), keeps some of its human subjects at a remove. 

Narrated by Mike Tunalaaq Gibbons, a native of the Inuit community of Arviat, a small town where many of the bears converge, “Nuisance Bear” clearly has deep access and strong ties to the community, but they feel at a distance. Tunalaaq Gibbons' interviews that give some shape to the film eventually give way to something of a twist, an emotional gut-punch that feels out of place within the rest of the doc. And while we go into the homes of some of the other inhabitants of Arviat, we rarely even learn their names.

 










Still, they are all part of one larger circle of life, and the ways in which they are pushed together under challenging circumstances (really, can you imagine what it would be like for a single polar bear, let alone many, to stroll through the center of your town?) make for captivating watching. We just wish that circle was tightened up a bit more, focused more on the forced intimacy and its obvious and immediate concerns, pulled into a sharper focus. The imagery is startling. The story needs to hit even harder.

“Nuisance Bear” premiered at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

It opens with a classic epigraph from Oscar Wilde: “One should always be in love. That is the reason one should never marry.” Cut to: a clearly miserable Seth Rogen, presumably very married indeed. Olivia Wilde's “The Invite” may start simply enough — marriage is bad, just look at this broken man — but it almost instantly shifts into a different register that makes its comedic aspirations clear. It's so silly and so simple: music teacher Rogen's Joe just can't get his goddamn folding bike out of a door, making a spectacle that his students can only stare at, one of them muttering a “what the fuck” for all of us. 

 










But don't let that simplicity fool you, because what Wilde is saying here (with a superb script by Rashida Jones and Will McCormack, who know a thing about relationships gone bad) is something much bigger and bolder. She knows exactly what she's doing, how to calibrate between big laughs and broken hearts, how to use her cast to great effect, and how to surprise her audience at nearly every turn. This is less than two minutes into the movie, wonderfully setting the stage for the crackling, crazy entertaining dinner party from hell to come.

While Joe might be dragging his ass through his downbeat life (folding bike very much in tow), his wife Angela (Wilde) is going through her own motions, which happen to be amped up by her naturally anxious personality. Angela is preparing the pair's stunning San Francisco apartment (an inspired setting, rife with both sprawling rooms and a slightly off-kilter floor plan that keeps us just confused enough) for something rare: company! The long-time couple don't have many friends and they don't have many people over, so tonight's dinner with their upstairs neighbors has provided Angela with something very big to fixate on.

How much does she need something to fixate on? She bought a new rug and at least six kinds of cheese for the occasion. She is making a fucking soufflé! Joe can't even be bothered to pick up wine on the way home. Joe is barely in the door before the inevitably-compared-to “Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” antics start unfolding. Made even more nerve-shredding by Devonté Hynes' score, a tense offering that plays out (and loud!) during Joe and Angela's seemingly constant bickering. But Wilde keeps things pitched just so, allowing the pair's worst moments to still feel funny and relatable.

But Angela's anxiety also makes her unpredictable (and unpredictable in an entirely different way than Wilde's other great Sundance 2026 performance), and Wilde soon taps into a natural agility that only ups the comedic ante in what feels like her best performance yet. (There is a bit of physical comedy, early in the film, that involves Angela reacting to a ruined dinner with a comedic timing that instantly catapults Wilde to a new level, it's a five-second moment that is aces enough to inform the rest of the film to come). Wilde's expressive face and big eyes tap into a Lucille Ball elasticity; the film would be funny enough if it was only its director turning in such a hilarious performance, but she's hardly alone in this endeavour.

 










With just four stars in the film, everyone has to count, and Wilde hasn't skimped on her co-stars. Rogen's Joe gets to play straight man, often serving as our eyes into an increasingly fraught affair. Wilde and Rogen are good enough together, and then, oh! Our guests of honor have arrived, Hawk (Edward Norton) and his girlfriend Pina (Penelope Cruz), the much-feared, long-desired neighbors from upstairs, mostly known to Angela and Joe through the very loud noises of their nightly love-making sessions. 

If Joe and Angela's simmering resentment and hard-won affection are one side of the coin, Hawk and Pina's weirdo sexuality and wacky intrigue are the other. These two are into each other, and somehow, they're also into the Joe and Angela show. (Of note, both are very good here, but Norton is taking such obvious delight in the whole thing, he just manages to edge out Cruz, who still gets her time to shine later in the film.)

Why have Hawk and Pina come to this ill-fated dinner? Why does Angela want them there so badly? Why can't Joe even pretend to be a decent host? Eh, well, you can probably guess, just based on what we know of the two couples — miserable marrieds, sexually adventures strangers, etc. — but Jones and McCormack's script has lots of fun getting there, with Wilde's zippy direction and core foursome working their way through a comedy of manners that eventually feels like a comedy of errors. 

 










Smart craftsmanship elsewhere helps everything glide along, including costuming choices from Arianne Phillips that cleverly set up the couples in opposition to each other and cinematography from Adam Newport-Berra that crafts interesting dynamics in artfully made frames. All of it feels impeccably chosen without being showy or affected. 

As Wilde splits her couples and brings them back again, we are able to see different sides of each character and the roles they play within their relationships. Angela's nerves make way for a giddy chemistry with Hawk (the two of them bond over, of all things, their shared love of rugs, one of many running jokes that keep up the clip). Joe's mystified anger is softened by Pina's easy grace (and, yes, yes, Rogen and Cruz do smoke a joint together at one point). 

Wilde's previous film, “Don't Worry, Darling,” was somewhat similarly driven by questions about the price of relationships, the cost of the lies we tell, the impossibility of really knowing someone, but Wilde answers those same questions here with far more insight and entertaining humor (it cannot be overstated how fun it is to watch this one in a packed theater). The film's third act stumbles a bit, trading in its high humor for darker emotions that Wilde cannot quite as deftly navigate (and with, unless I am very mistaken, a tiny, left-turn mystery about the true nature of Hawk and Pina).

 










Still, the rest of this meal (light on the soufflé, heavy on the jambon) is such a treat, a truly adult comedy with plenty to say and even more laughs to share. Accept this invite, and fast.

A tender New Jersey romance between second-generation immigrants, Stephanie Ahn's “Bedford Park” comes instantly alive. Sparked by the literal collision of two Korean American families, this dreamy feature debut opens on a short-tempered meet-cute that promises a precise and deeply personal love story unfolding in real time. When physical therapist Audrey (Moon Choi) arrives at her childhood home to care for her mother following a car accident, she develops an intense, slow-burn attraction to Eli (Son Sukku), a local security guard and the stand-offish “other” driver.

 










Ahn introduces the couple's unlikely chemistry through strained carpool rides that gradually give way to intimate, disarming nights. Audrey and Eli's at-first brief interactions are framed by poetic moments of privacy that play like naturalistic portraits: shared silences, cautious humor, looks that linger too long. Early on, there is a sense that “Bedford Park” is culturally revelatory. It's a flashpoint depiction of American life filtered through a specificity that feels rare, romantic, and essential right now.

Less invested in sustaining a love story than it is mapping that romance onto a recognizable community, Ahn's film trades some of its emotional momentum for an accumulation of rich detail. After its bright beginning, this 2026 Sundance premiere overcomplicates itself to a degree, layering in extraneous characters and tonal detours that feel authentic but steadily chip away at Audrey and Eli's connection — both with each other and the audience. Ahn's script grows ever-more ambitious as it goes on, and that sprawl seems intentional. But in overextending her characters' arcs and hearts, this otherwise exceptional filmmaker struggles to hold onto the core intimacy that initially makes her film feel assured.

Anchored firmly in the Garden State despite its misleading, Bronx-based title, “Bedford Park” captures distinctly East Coast textures — ironed-on familial obligation, brusk cultural shorthand, simmering lower-class resentment — to create a lived-in world that ultimately feels deeper in its symbolic meaning than the two leads' human emotion. From transplanted Korean-American customs, to a convincingly rendered high school wrestling scene, the soulful specificity is immersive rather than ornamental. And yet, as a revolving door of background figures spins through the frame, Ahn clouds her, Audrey, and Eli's voices, losing sight of a story that could've been smaller, sharper, and more affecting. 

 










That misstep is especially frustrating because the central romance, flawed and fiery as it may be, is Ahn's greatest strength. The pair's early antagonism is punctuated by petty, almost sibling-like sniping, and their shared world soon emerges as a place of brutal honesty and old ghosts. The remnants of a fruit basket Audrey once hurled at Eli's closed door clarifies a kind of bruised vulnerability between the stars. Moments of levity, including a surprisingly charming “Rocky” soundtrack sing-a-long, sketch a universe forming between people whose experience of U.S. life has long been dictated by stoicism and isolation.

As their relationship deepens, “Bedford Park” reveals a connection shaped less by idyllic fantasy than by the relief of survival. Sharing a bed, Audrey and Eli talk about lost potential and childhood abuse with an understated frankness that makes their mutual trust feel all the more earned. Here, love is not a cure-all but a process of rupture and repair centering the damage both people already carry, and Choi and Sukku are exquisitely matched on that front. Audrey presents like a self-protecting spider — intimidating yet delicate, crawling the fraught emotional web that circumstance has built around her with sly, hand-wringing diligence. Her performance balances restraint with sudden flashes of overwhelming emotion and even fury, effectively embodying a woman whose subtle self-abuse has calcified into habit. 

 










Sukku, by contrast, brings a regionally-appropriate directness to Eli that's warm, welcome, and comfortably melancholy. His presence feels as protective and dangerous as a bear hug near Audrey, and when he opens up to her, the vulnerability she discovers is infectious. Eli prompts his love itnerest to extend kindness toward herself she has long withheld. But a spider and a bear, as Ahn seems to know, are poorly suited to lasting harmony, and tension bubbles beneath the surface of nearly every scene. 

As Audrey's guard lowers, “Bedford Park” broadens its scope and further confuses her interior life as the primary protagonist. Cycles of destructive behavior (including repeated miscarriages tied to a condition she knows makes pregnancy unsafe and unlikely) gradually recede as Eli's equally troubling past comes into focus. His ex-wife, estranged daughter, and an unnecessary criminal subplot involving his adopted brother introduce stakes that feel less illuminating and more melodramatic. While Audrey's elderly parents are smartly drawn (particularly her father, still mourning a professional life in Korea he lost decades ago), Ahn's flawed effort asks viewers to manage too many threads at once.  

That said, the emotional congestion could be deliberate. In the second half, Ahn introduces more supporting characters than she can care for, gesturing at a worldview in which the future — especially for immigrant families — feels crowded, precarious, and perpetually on the verge of collapse. In that reading, “Bedford Park” becomes brilliantly tragic: a romance smothered not by a lack of attraction but by the weight of real life tearing it down. As a debut feature, whether it's confused or clever, the film announces Ahn as a true artist of intimacy and image. Framing her leads' rain-soaked first kiss in a shot so unexpected it makes parked cars look magical, the director speaks the language of cinema with ease. 

 










Still, running more than two hours, “Bedford Park” hangs on too long. Trimming even twenty minutes would sharpen its emotional throughline and leave a more enduring impression. But Ahn is especially attuned to this particular moment, and transportive indie romances arrive at Sundance every year. Speaking for itself with ferocious humanity, Ahn's work makes a strong case for indulging her instincts, even when they don't work out. Better still, it offers companionship in uncertainty, evoking the gentle squeeze of another's hand the moment you realize how perilous it was for either of you to get this far.

“Bedford Park” premiered at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival.

In the first scene of Macon Blair's “The Shitheads,” a God-loving striver named Davis (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) gets fired from his job at a presbyterian church for taking the congregation's youth group to a screening of Lars von Trier's “Antichrist.” He had been under the impression that it was an educational film about the life of Jesus. Why, his boss wonders, didn't he leave after Willem Dafoe's “dong” got smashed with a giant block of wood? (Or, you know, a long time before that?). Just how often are there mid-day rep screenings of “Antichrist” in suburban Atlanta, anyway? And in what universe would the mega-millionaire parents of a malevolent teen like Sheridan Foxworth Kimberly (a hyper-punchable Mason Thames, excellent as a pointier young Jessie Eisenberg in pure evil mode) hire a fuck-up like Davis to drive their kid to the rehab center on the other side of the state?

These are just a few of the many different questions that go unanswered over the course of a wild — and wildly uneven — comedy that attempts to split the difference between “Road Trip” and “The Last Detail” without capitulating to the fact that each of those masterpieces belongs to a wholly separate reality. To be clear, I would never begrudge Blair for wanting to set a movie called “The Shitheads” in the non-existent overlap of the Venn diagram between them; the “I Don't Feel at Home in this World Anymore” director has previously displayed a rare knack for using outsized situations to highlight the raw indignities of modern American life, and I have to respect the less successful attempt to do so again here.

Blair has never flinched away from the subhuman treatment of America's working class (see: “Toxic Avenger, The”), and “The Shitheads” is at its best whenever it hones in on honest people who are just trying to do the best they can in the face of a country that couldn't possibly care any less. Or, for that matter, honest people who are just loudly watching drunk people fight each other on YouTube during the middle of their shift at a debt collection agency. Mark (Dave Franco, once again proving his genius for playing unbothered scumbag) was about to get laid off anyway as part of his company's pivot to not paying people, but that little incident helps to expedite the process. It also frees Mark to help Davis chauffeur Sheridan to rehab, as the two strangers — like all great teams — are recommended to each other by their mutual drug dealer (Blair). 

And so the world's least qualified transportation team rolls up to Sheridan's parents' mansion in Mark's beat-up red sedan, completely unprepared for the ride of their lives. Davis is a sweet-natured idiot who wants to do good with his life. Mark, basically a more aggro and demented version of the character Franco's brother played in “Pineapple Express,” is a less sweet-natured idiot who wants to do the glorified gas station drugs he's packed into his pockets for the drive. Sheridan, meanwhile, is the antichrist who Lars von Trier foretold, and — as becomes violently clear after he bites and robs the Eastern European stripper (a flinty Kiernan Shipka as Irina) he convinces Mark to call to their motel room — neither of his temporary legal minders are at all prepared for the full extent of his spoiled brat sociopathy. 

 










From that point on, “The Shitheads” becomes a meandering and recursive journey to wherever (how far away is this rehab center anyway?) as Sheridan's antics effectively convince all of the workaday people in his path to fight each other for table scraps while he laughs at them from the backseat of Mark's car. There's a handful of malicious druggings, a half-naked fight against a gaggle of Sheridan's dad's business associates (who are attending a convention at a rundown motel?), and later an encounter with some wannabe kidnappers whose members include Peter Dinklage in zombie makeup and a spectacularly committed Nicholas Braun as a lycan-obsessed Soundcloud rapper who calls himself “Pricka Bush Da Werewoof.” 

A smattering of individual moments achieve the kind of madcap insanity that a movie like this needs for momentum, but “The Shitheads” is plagued by stop-and-start plotting that does more to stifle its energy than build to it, and its complete disinterest in meaningfully developing the relationship between Mark and Davis makes it hard to feel like this road trip is going anywhere — not that we ever really know where it's supposed to be going in the first place. It's a credit to Blair's script that Sheridan doesn't seem to learn anything from this misadventure, which would have been fatal to a film that's only held together by its enduring fascination with how some people choose to retain their decency in a world that rewards the opposite, but he never seems to be much of a real person either, and the shred of humanity the movie wants you to see in him sucks the life out of things just when the story's chaos is peaking. 

 










That speaks to the biggest problem with “The Shitheads,” which is that its gap between credibility and comic license is way too wide for Blair to bridge. Despite featuring one of the greatest eruptions of explosive diarrhea in the proud history of motion pictures (it's so good), “The Shitheads” isn't funny enough to earn its heightened cruelties, and — that incredible jet stream of liquid poop notwithstanding, along with a small handful of other memorable highlights — its cruelties aren't heightened enough to justify how little sense they make. In that sense at least, Blair's latest movie doesn't feel at home in this world anymore. 

“The Shitheads” premiered at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

In 1995, Joni Mitchell sat down for an interview with one of her biggest fans: Maynard James Keenan, the lead singer of Tool. Keenan asked her about guitar tunings, songwriting, Hejira's “Black Crow,” the colors of chords. Joni, always the raconteur, offered long and thoughtful answers. The only artist Keenan mentioned more than Joni Mitchell in interviews around this time is the New York noise band Swans. Ænima, Tool's third album, actually kind of sounds like a cross between Swans and Joni Mitchell.

“You can have pure major experiences,” Joni said, “but since we've been standing under the shadow of the bomb, it seems to me we're all emotionally complex. That to me is why these modern chords are the chords of our spirits.”

That is the world of Joni.

“I think we're evolving at a rate that we need to move on to the more complicated structures anyway,” Maynard replied. “Simplistic stuff is a good starting point, but you need to hear those things. You really do. They're like software upgrades for the psyche.”

This is the world of Tool.

Tool is what the comedian Norm Macdonald would describe as a perfect joke, where the setup and the punchline are identical. Tool? Tool. In 1996, they were a band for the times, set against the backdrop of an ascendant Christian right, a new age boom, a cultural vacuum where grunge used to be, and a post-metal Los Angeles reckoning with a newly shorn Metallica who just came all over their new album cover. Enter the more prurient, more indulgent, 77-minute Ænima. Its title is a portmanteau between the Jungian term for the feminine part of the male psyche and an anal cleanse. Its lead single was the biggest radio hit about hole since Frankie Goes to Hollywood's “Relax.” After living with this album for 30 years, turning it inside and out, memorizing its drum fills and marveling at its sacred geometry, I have one remaining question about Ænima. Are you serious?

A few months before he met with Joni, Keenan attended a week-long seminar, in California's San Fernando Valley, rooted in the teachings of new age guru Drunvalo Melchizedek, who, in 1972, claimed his former self was inhabited by a higher-dimensional being who had been moving through the emptiness of space in the 13th-dimensional realm for 10 billion Earth years before he came upon the star Sirius in the Orion system and was transformed into an alien lifeform and granted a spaceship by the Sirians with which he journeyed to Earth with 350 crewmembers and then—skipping ahead a bit—spirit-walked into the body of a man who would now be known as Drunvalo Melchizedek. He, meaning the interdimensional being known as Drunvalo Melchizedek, said he was sent here to raise as many spirits as possible through to the next level of consciousness. (N.b. Drunvalo Melchizedek says there are 100,000 levels of consciousness preceding the All Is One realm, so.)

I bought the Ænima CD—the one with the clear lenticular case that could wiggle the cybernetic album art designed by artist Cam de Leon—when I was 12 years old at a long-forgotten record store in Whitewater, Wisconsin, where I grew up. I was, at that time, on whatever level of consciousness is associated with being in middle school and sitting at the lunch table that hosted Magic: The Gathering games—“level one,” I guess. This was a few years before I stumbled upon a website called the Erowid Vault, a beautiful relic of the early internet where amateur and professional psychonauts could blog about their experiences on drugs. There I'd learn that if you ground up enough morning glory seeds from the gardening store, you could, in so many words, trip balls, and that if you drank enough Robitussin, you could join a small group of people who claimed they all saw the same exact interdimensional being from the same exact star system. For those in small towns with a dial-up modem and without access to eccentric new age gurus, poisonous flower seeds and Robotripping were alternate means of enlightenment. Total mentions in the Erowid Vault blog archives: Drunvalo Melchizedek (1); Magic: The Gathering (9); Tool (80+).

Of course, Drunvalo Melchizedek was only one of countless spiritual practitioners working in Los Angeles. By the 1990s, the city hosted a cottage industry of psychics, astrologists, oracles, new age publishing houses, numerologists, crystal dealers, and tarot throwers. (Keenan claims an Angeleno psychometry practitioner foresaw the arrival of Justin Chancellor, Tool's new bassist for Ænima). The glut of woo in Los Angeles had established itself slowly over the years, under the influence of charismatic leaders and con artists alike, descended from the strains of 19th-century metaphysical groups such as the New Thought movement and the Theosophical Society.

When the film industry arrived in Hollywood in the 1920s, it had an alchemical reaction to the new age community. With the allure of fame, people from all over America followed the trail west to California to stake their claim—again. Los Angeles, after all, was modeled after Arcadia and marketed as a new Eden, a kind of coastal suburban utopia that was newly minting global superstars. It was a magical place, as inexplicable as an aura. As Spencer Orey observed in his dissertation, The Dream Refinery: Psychics, Spirituality and Hollywood in Los Angeles, Hollywood became a kind of global media nexus through which new age thinking flowed, buoyed by celebrities and their celebrity seers. What better way to expand the mind, manifest success, and explain away the constant rejection of the entertainment industry than to seek out divine intervention from a crystal ball, Enochian magic, or a 13th-dimensional being?

Keenan was wary about the move to Los Angeles, but in 1990, after a few false starts in Boston and Grand Rapids—most notably with the art-house new wave act C.A.D.—he packed up a U-Haul and drove across the country, where he settled into a tiny apartment just off the Sunset Strip with his pet zebra finch, Harpo. He fell in with a group of musicians that included Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello and the absurdist rock troupe Green Jellö. A year later, he formed Tool with drummer Danny Carey, guitarist Adam Jones, and bassist Paul D'Amour, got signed to Zoo Entertainment, and began working with the raw, unformed ideas that would form their debut EP, Opiate.

A year after that, they put out a great debut LP called Undertow that eventually went gold and got heavy rotation on radio and MTV, thanks in large part to Jones' unsettling stop-motion animation videos for the hit singles “Sober” and “Prison Sex.” (Butt-Head's reaction to the “Sober” video remains to this day critically salient: “Cool.”) They got even bigger on the 1993 Lollapalooza tour when they were upgraded from the side stage to the mainstage—where Keenan would sometimes join grunge juggernauts Alice in Chains to sing backup on “Rooster.” Tool were hard to classify. They were slowly building a following among the riff-rock crowd who had one foot in Soundgarden's melodic grunge-metal world and another near Helmet, with a third foot in astral projections.

When it came time for Keenan to start planning the follow-up record, he looked to his bookshelf. There were his familiar books by Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell, John Crowley's heady sci-fi series The Solitudes (then known as Ægypt), and a small stack of private-press books someone had dropped off, written by Drunvalo Melchizedek. Drunvalo Melchizedek was a minor figure in the Los Angeles new age community, perhaps because some of his more outré ideas would make even the most dilated third eye begin to squint: a universal system of measurement inscribed on the Giza Pyramids and Stonehenge by extraterrestrials, a foretelling of a global shift in the tectonic plates that would swallow California whole, a new breed of humans possessed with not just the usual 46 chromosomes but an additional two more. All this was set to usher in a new age of cosmic consciousness. At the weeklong seminar in the Valley, Keenan took copious notes.

If you accept Ænima as a kind of new age California metal album, you can meet it at its own level. Call it pseudo-intellectual, or fake deep, or prog-rock, but those are half measures that don't take into account the terroir out of which Tool grew. It is a record that emotionally and aggressively tries to gain access to a deeper consciousness through a cocktail of mysticism, mushrooms, mosh pits, and masturbation. The new age metal mindset, Ænima posits, is not just yours to inhabit, but yours to witness—like an impossible polyrhythm or an alien spaceship. To ascend, you must first be in awe, and then you will be subsumed, and only then will you understand that all this is one big joke, one big ride, and the alien is smoking a joint, and he takes a puff and says, “Take me to your dealer.” That's the world of Tool.

As I sit here and tilt my Ænima CD case so that I can use the lenticular cover to animate a naked milk-colored person suckin' their own dick, I wonder if rock music that tries to be smart is actually dumber than rock music that knows it's dumb, and should not be critiqued as a failed attempt at entering into the realm of smart music. Is half-way smart all-the-way dumb? It's just a theory.

But the one unassailable truth about Tool and Ænima, around which the laws of rock are governed: “Forty Six & 2” rules. Always has, always will. It is compositionally perfect, muscular and musical, thoughtful and instinctive, start to finish. Jones' greyish chords snake in and out of Chancellor's amazingly simple bassline. It is the first riff you learn to play when you first tune your guitar or bass down to drop-D. Carey's drumming is busy, naturally, but he's so effortlessly groovy. It remains, to me, the peak of Carey's writing in Tool's entire catalog. I have watched so many YouTube drum covers of this song that I've developed a sixth sense for whether the drummer will nail Carey's solo based on how well they do the opening drum fill.

And so the song is about, what, 13th-dimensional aliens? Chromosome upgrades? Jungian shadow theory? Ego death? What Keenan brought home from the weeklong Drunvalo Melchizedek seminar was not a membership card to a galactic cult, but an idea toward transcendental songwriting. To Keenan, the era of grunge songwriting defined by self-chosen pain had run its course. A new era of heavy music was dawning, one of alienation, transgression, and childhood trauma. There's something in complicating a harmonic voicing, troubling a time signature, a brief detour into esoteric metaphysics that could, as he told Joni, become “software upgrades for the psyche.” Maybe there's a way to evolve your inner consciousness through engaging with your shadow self and purging it through verses and choruses. Unless you've taken a heroic dose of DXM, “Forty-Six & 2” may not cause you to join Sirians on the higher plane. But, in 1996, it certainly evolved mainstream rock music.

“The reason the world's so fucked,” said Bill Hicks, the acerbic underground comic, in one of his final specials recorded in 1992, “is we're undergoing evolution, and the reason our institutions, our traditional religions are all crumbling is because they're no longer relevant…. So it's time for us to create a new philosophy and perhaps even a new religion.” The often brilliant, sometimes homophobic, usually sophomoric Hicks spent his two-decade career working in relative obscurity in America, speaking truth to power through the realizations most people have at the peak of a psychedelic trip and bookending them with bitter sarcasm and paroxysms of anger. Henry Rollins, one of the first acts to bring Tool on tour in 1992, called Hicks “hilarious, brilliant, brave, and right about everything.”

Hicks' bit about evolution continues: He wonders why America's drug czar under President H. W. Bush isn't someone who's in recovery who can understand that addicts need compassion and not punishment. Sick people don't get healed in prison. “And if we evolve the idea, you see, the planet might become more compassionate and something like heaven might dawn.” The audience applauds, and Hicks quickly cuts them off: “I want everyone here to take the five dried grams I taped under all your chairs right now. Let's go, man. The fucking UFOs are waiting in the fifth dimension, let's go!”

The way Hicks conveyed his evolutionary manifesto—angrily, innocently, sarcastically, drugily—is the perfect analog for Ænima. Keenan had absorbed bootleg cassette tapes of Hicks' shows in the tour van. He named Hicks as an influence in the liner notes for Opiate and sent him a copy of the album. They eventually developed a friendship, and Hicks even introduced Tool at one of their Lollapalooza stops (he did a bit on stage about losing a contact lens in the mosh pit). They exchanged letters, then began talking on the phone. They were going to plan a tour together until Hicks died of pancreatic cancer, in 1993, when he was only 32.

Inside the Ænima booklet, there's a painting of Hicks and Keenan together; Hicks is dressed like a doctor who appears to have just pried open Keenan's skull, revealing his third eye. You can hear Hicks on the album—sampled in the final song—but you can feel his presence deeper, more prominently elsewhere. On the title track, Keenan imagines, like Steely Dan and Warren Zevon did before him, California tumbling into the sea. But the invocation of “Arizona Bay” is borrowed directly from a Hicks bit, and the broad, vituperative rant about the various Central Casting characters you'll find in Los Angeles could have been pulled from a never-surfaced bootleg Hicks tape Keenan and Rollins laughed at on the tour bus. Again, the song's composition is incredible—Carey switches between several different feels within one time signature to give the illusion that the song is slowing up and speeding down. When a Tool song is molded around a particularly brilliant Carey drum part, it simply cannot fail.

The same can also be said for “Jimmy,” the first song Keenan wrote about his mother, Judith. When Jim Keenan was 11, he watched his mother be carried out of their rural Ohio home on a stretcher. She suffered an aneurysm and was partially paralyzed until her death in 2003. Keenan's reverie back to this childhood trauma is full of backmasked and digitally manipulated vocals with Carey delicately, musically grounding the song around its shifting sands of time. It's the most personal the album ever gets, putting the spotlight directly on Keenan's voice, which, on Ænima, still stands as one of the best melodic metal performances ever given. When he appeared on Deftones' record four years later, he passed the torch to another shapeshifting California band and vocalist who would discover even more unsung melodies in metal and evolve the genre.

Amid the unremarkable main-menu pain lyrics, there's this funny and prescient line from Keenan: “All you know about me is what I've sold you, dumb fuck,” he sings on “Hooker With a Penis,” a seething l'esprit de l'escalier rant about a kid who told him he thought Tool was selling out. Keenan, in a very Adbusters way, agrees with him: “I sold my soul to make a record, dipshit, and then you bought one.” It was a clever way to get ahead of the curve in a time when “selling out” could mark you as a pariah in alternative rock. “All you know about me is what I've sold you” is one of the more honest things Keenan or any singer has written.

When Tool are in their flow state, they are a marvel to listen to. Enough can't be said about Carey, the spine and heartbeat of the band, as well as a true believer in Enochian magic, a language said to have been given by angels to John Dee, a 16th-century magus who left written accounts of experiments with extradimensional beings. Keenan's emotional dynamism and vocal vulnerability helped enlistan entirely new demographic to heavy music. While former bassist Paul D'Amour helped write five songs, Chancellor brought a nimbleness to the band; just listen to his fretwork on the title track. Jones became almost an entirely different guitarist between Undertow and Ænima, finding more space in drones and psychedelic leads, giving songs a crucial lift and drift. His shining moment is on “Stinkfist” when he plays a two- or three-note solo that starts to tilt the whole song just slightly off its axis.

The band did concede to MTV's standards when programmers asked that “Stinkfist” be titled “Track 1” when they played its video. Provocative? Transgressive? Juvenile? A nod to no wave pioneer Lydia Lunch? This is the world of Tool: The sacred and stupidly profane. Some of it hasn't aged well, though you could say music listeners have, over three decades, evolved so as not to be shocked by invocations of sexual fetishes. But in 1996, to hear “Stinkfist” on the radio invoked the same kind of tittering and fascination with my cohorts at the Magic: The Gathering lunch table as the rumor that Marilyn Manson removed his own rib so he could better suck his own dick. Is all this within me, too? Do I possess this kind of prurience? Is this my shadow? I wondered. “Relax, turn around, and take my hand,” Keenan croons. A few years later, I traded all my Magic cards for a 4xCD Led Zeppelin best-of box set. I didn't know at the time that Tool had recorded a pretty good cover of “No Quarter” during their Ænima sessions and released it on the Salival box set in 2000.

What doesn't work, and what has never worked, is “Third Eye”—which is a shame because it is the grand finale, a mission statement, and it takes up 13 rather difficult minutes on a record that, even with a few dull moments, is an otherwise spectacular, unstoppable listen. “Third Eye” is what happens when Tool shoots from the hip, and the riffs tumble forward without shape and contour. The silly rhythmic muting of the vocals, the aimless noodling, the mindless pentatonic riffing, the stupid phaser effect—all cast into sharp relief their understanding of psychedelic music. On an album whose liner notes are nothing but an inscrutable rant about the subtler properties of ketamine, you wish the band had a better way to land the spaceship—and it took them until 2019, with Fear Innoculum's closing opus “7empist,” to really figure out how properly do it.

I'm toying with the lenticular Ænima CD case again, looking at the third image in the booklet, a monster's eye rolling around like you're face-to-face with some kind of Xenomorph, or maybe a Sirian from the Orion system. For an album that is about the balance of high and low, go-dumb riffs and complex time signatures, the world within and the world without, childhood trauma and a recipe for cookies recited intimidatingly in German, is it any wonder that when I peer into this lenticular case, I see why I love this record and why I think it kind of sucks? After all these years, I don't think Ænima is serious, but it is in perfect harmony with itself. It is the setup and the punchline. It is the perfect joke.

Geese were the musical guests on Saturday Night Live last night (January 24), making their debut on the show alongside host and One Battle After Another star Teyana Taylor. For the occasion, the band played two songs from their latest album Getting Killed, “Au Pays du Cocaine” and “Trinidad.” Watch both performances below.

Although the episode marked Geese's first SNL appearance, frontman Cameron Winter has technically been on the show before. On SNL's final episode of 2025, hosted by Ariana Grande, cast member James Austin Johnson portrayed Winter in a “Random Duet Christmas Spectacular” sketch. The bit also featured impressions of Yoko Ono, Björk, Kate Bush, Post Malone, and more.

Getting Killed, Geese's fourth studio album, arrived in September 2025. After generating serious buzz on a fall North American tour, they made a number of notable TV and radio appearances. They played “Taxes” on Jimmy Kimmel Live!; recorded a live set for Nigel Godrich's series From the Basement; and covered New Radicals' “You Get What You Give” on BBC Radio 1. In a recent Xbox ad, Winter also seemingly covered Bruce Springsteen's ""Dancing In The Dark,"" although he still hasn't confirmed the voice was his. The band is now gearing up for a run of festival sets—they'll play Coachella, Primavera Sound, Bonnaroo, Governors Ball Music Festival, and more in the coming months.

The musical guests on Saturday Night Live's 51st season so far have included A$AP Rocky, Doja Cat, Sabrina Carpenter, Brandi Carlile, Olivia Dean, Dijon, Lily Allen, and Cher. Bad Bunny also hosted an episode. Cardi B is the musical guest this week, and Alexander Skarsgård is set to host.

	Florida congressman Maxwell Frost was assaulted late Friday night in a racially motivated attack at a Sundance Film Festival party.


	Park City Police arrested a man named Christian Young on charges of aggravated battery and two counts of simple assault, allegedly that Young “unlawfully entered a private party after previously being turned away for not having an invitation. Once inside the saloon, Young assaulted Florida Congressman Maxwell Frost and a female who was attending the private event,” a community outreach lieutenant told The Hollywood Reporter.


	“Last night, I was assaulted by a man at Sundance Festival who told me that Trump was going to deport me before he punched me in the face. He was heard screaming racist remarks as he drunkenly ran off. The individual was arrested and I am okay,” Frost wrote of the incident on social media. “Thank you to the venue security and Park City PD for assistance on this incident.”

	According to the Hollywood Reporter, Young presumably crashed the party hosted by talent agency CAA through a side door — Young was not on the guest list — of the High West Saloon. Around midnight, Young allegedly went to the bathroom and allegedly told other patrons how proud he was to be “white.” He then exited the bathroom and encountered Frost, a Democratic representative who identifies as Afro-Latino.

	











	According to the police report, Young called Frost a racial slur and told the congressman “we are going to deport you and your kind.” Young then punched Frost in the face before security quickly stepped in.

	











	“I am okay. Thank you for all the well wishes. We are in scary times,” Frost added. “Please stay safe and do not let these people silence you. Onwards.”

	Film festival organizers added in a statement, “We strongly condemn last night's assault and abhor any form of violence, harassment, and hate speech. While the incident occurred at a non-Festival-affiliated event, such behavior is intolerable and against our values of upholding a welcoming and inspiring environment for all our attendees. The safety and security of our festival goers remains our chief concern, and our thoughts are with Congressman Frost and his continued well-being.”


	Axios reports that Young was later additionally charged with aggravated burglary, assaulting an elected official and simple assault, and that a judge ordered him held without bail as there is “convincing evidence” he is a flight risk and “would constitute a substantial danger” to the community.

Saturday Night Live‘s Donald Trump announced he has unfortunately only just begun wrecking the country. 


	One year into his second term, Trump (James Austin Johnson) decided that amid all the controversies, it was appropriate to indulge his vanity and host an awards show about himself: the First Annual Trumps.


	“After that lady whose name I already forget gave me her Nobel Prize, I thought, ‘I need more awards!'” Trump began, referencing Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Machado gifting the president her peace prize medal.


	“And after what all my little freaks and psychos in ICE have been doing, I need more distractions!” he added anxiously, after a federal immigration agent shot and killed another civilian in Minneapolis early Saturday. “Look, everything's gold and shiny!”


	After receiving an award for winning the hastily created FIFA Peace Prize, Trump gave the crowd of sycophants a message they're sure to love.

	











	“And if I could be serious for a moment: there's just so much horrible stuff going on in our country and the world right now, but I promise you I'm just getting started,” he said. “Thank you! Eric, go to bed.”


	Trump then introduced the next award category: best kiss. The nominees were Vice President JD Vance (Jeremy Culhane), Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem (Ashley Padilla) and FBI Director Kash Patel, with the recipient of the kiss in each case being “Trump's ass.” Trump himself also received a nod, but for “Putin's ass.”

	











	Noem announced she was “honored—and in no way dead inside”—to win the award, which she dedicated to Trump. He immediately accepted it and channelled Kanye West before giving her the boot.

	Trump then brought out the recipient of the lifetime achievement award for comedy—”even though he might not always intend it”—Elon Musk (Mike Myers).


	Noting that “it wasn't all laughs this year,” Musk, with the help Trump inauguration performer Carrie Underwood (Veronika Slowikowska) and a member of the Village People (Tommy Brennan), mourned what the Trump administration destroyed, to the tune of the America's Funniest Home Videos theme. On the list were the White House's East Wing, NATO, D.E.I., civil rights, checks and balances, and Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Saturday Night Live‘s Weekend Update mocked Donald Trump‘s obsession with Greenland by comparing his demand to acquire it to a creepy guy on a dating app. 


	Trump, who at times threatened a military invasion and tariffs on European countries until he got what he wanted, ultimately backed down this week, announcing a framework for a lesser deal.


	“President Trump has spent so much time stalking Greenland like an absolute psycho, he's basically become a guy on a dating app,” co-anchor Colin Jost joked. “He's like, ‘Hey Greenland, you look so good.' And Greenland's like, ‘Haha thanks.' And Trump's like, ‘Seriously, I need you. I'd literally give 700 billion dollars to be with you.'”


	Colin added that after Greenland replied, “not trying be mean, but I'm not interested,” Trump grew irate: “I'll kill you, you ugly b—h.”

Michael Che also made fun of Trump for caving on his tariff-related demands.


	Trump backed down, Che joked, “after consulting his most trusted advisor: the stocks app.”

	











	Also in the segment, Che addressed the latest fatal shooting in Minneapolis by a federal immigration agent.

	“I get that ICE agents are people, allegedly, and they have a job to do,” Che said, “but at some point while you're pepper-spraying old ladies or shooting at a nurse, you ever stop and ask yourself, ‘Are we dicks?'”


	Che also called out Vice President JD Vance for saying that anti-ICE protesters should just write op-eds or debate on social media rather than take to the streets—”You know, just like these young scholars did on Jan. 6,” he joked.

The Signal Mountain Police Department is urging everyone to stay inside and stay off the roads as crews work to clear off the ice.

Several trees are down, including one near the famed Flying Saucer ""Spaceship"" house.

Sergeant Detective David Holloway says it makes it easier on everyone cleaning up the mountain for people to stay home and not risk traveling.

""It just causes first responders more stress and and our resources have to be pulled in different directions,"" he told us. ""So we're just hoping everybody will heed the call. You know, make a pot of chili, turn on the TV, watch football and and let this weather pass us by.""

The storm, which is ever-evolving, has produced snow, freezing rain, and ice everywhere, especially in the higher altitudes like the mountain.

America's most sensitive nuclear sites have been secretly invaded by thousands of unidentified flying objects, a stunning new report has revealed.

Crowdsourced platform Enigma revealed to the Daily Mail that there have been more than 2,800 'unidentified aerial sightings' over 90 US nuclear plants or nuclear weapons facilities over the last eight decades.

The new report detailed sightings of objects often described as glowing orbs, disks, spheres, cylinders, or triangles hovering or flying in precise patterns within 25 miles of these nuclear sites.

One of the most recent reports from April 2025 captured video of a glowing orange ball changing shape while flying over Bear, Delaware, which is located near the Salem Nuclear Power Plant and Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Station in New Jersey.

'It just kept getting bigger, disappearing, bigger, disappearing. I thought it was just a star at first, or just a plane from a distance. Then I realized it got a lot, lot closer and kept getting closer and bigger. Then it started flashing,' the witness described.

'It wasn't a drone. It wasn't mechanical. It would actually morph into different shapes.'

One witness in California from April 2023 said: 'After hovering, it arched sideways and disappeared in the blink of an eye. I felt it was observing Diablo Canyon Nuclear plant.'

More than 70 of these reports specifically referenced UFOs with metallic or reflective surfaces flying over bases in broad daylight during the early dawn hours.

Enigma added that nuclear sites and missile bases in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Florida saw the biggest clusters of sightings.

Moreover, these incidents exploded during the mysterious drone surge over the East Coast between November 2024 and February 2025. 

Enigma said: 'Many of these sightings described structured, light-emitting objects that pulsed or changed color before disappearing - characteristics that closely resemble those attributed to the unidentified drones reported across the region at the time.'

One witness near the Salem nuclear power plant claimed that several small objects hovering over the facility seemed to combine into one large UFO in February 2024.

'I was coming up to the Salem hospital and saw these four lights in a square hovering over the building, it looked like, but the closer I got, they seemed to disappear,' the witness revealed.

'So I started recording, and you see all these little lights going into the big bright one and not coming back out.'

Although the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office is charged with investigating reports of UFOs, the military has maintained that there has never been any physical evidence that proves extraterrestrials or UFOs exist. 

The new report also detailed how many of the thousands of objects easily violated restricted airspace, raising concerns about how safe America's national security sites really are.

What do you think these UFO incursions say about the safety of our nuclear sites and national security?

'If these objects belong to foreign intelligence or advanced programs, they expose vulnerabilities in national defense,' Enigma researchers wrote in a statement.

'If they are something unknown to science, they may represent new physics or technology. Either possibility demands improved detection, data sharing, and protective measures.'

Enigma, which allows people to report sightings and share pictures or videos of UFOs on an app, noted that these incidents include the strange craft seen over Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana in 1967, just as several Minuteman missiles shut down.

The sightings of strange craft and unidentifiable objects over nuclear plants weren't limited to just the US.

Researchers detailed how witnesses claimed they saw UFOs over two major nuclear disasters - the 1986 reactor meltdown in Chernobyl, Ukraine and the 2011 accident in Fukushima, Japan.

In Chernobyl, a bright cylindrical object was reportedly seen hovering near the burning remnants of the nuclear plant's Reactor 4. There has never been any confirmation that the radiation dipped after the sighting, as some have claimed.

During the Japanese meltdown, similar glowing objects were allegedly flying over the damaged reactor; however, these sightings were later suggested to be foreign drones conducting surveillance of the accident.

In the US, the sightings go all the way back to the dawn of the US nuclear program in the late 1940s, with Enigma detailing how 'bright green fireballs' were reported near Kirtland and Sandia Air Force Bases in New Mexico.

Overall, Enigma Labs has collected over 1,800 reports of UFOs flying and hovering near 53 nuclear power plants in the US.

Another 1,000 reports specifically mentioned incidents that allegedly took place over 37 US military bases linked to nuclear weapons research or missile launch sites.

Half of these sightings claimed that the objects were able to hover or seemed to float through the air, and one-third mentioned suddenly disappearing or vanishing into thin air.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

If you saw something in the sky that you genuinely could not explain—something now officially categorized as an unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAP—would you tell your therapist or psychiatrist?

For many people, the honest answer is no. Not because they doubt their own perception, but because they worry about what might happen next. They fear being seen as unstable, having the experience reframed as a symptom, or having it documented in a way that could affect future care, employment, or credibility.

Concerns like these are not hypothetical. Peer-reviewed research has repeatedly found that individuals who report UAP sightings do not exhibit broad psychological impairment or psychopathology [7,8,9]. Yet the academic and clinical literature has historically interpreted such reports through frameworks emphasizing fantasy, cognitive error, or psychological instability, often without direct clinical assessment [7]. The implication has been a preconceived idea that what these people report seeing is explained by their individual characteristics as opposed to the event itself [9]. More recent patient-reported evidence documents people describing dismissal, disbelief, or self-censorship in therapy due to fear of being labeled mentally ill after talking about what they observed [6].

All of this raises an uncomfortable ethical question: What does it say about the state of mental health care if honesty itself feels risky?

For decades, UAP observations were treated as inherently suspect. In recent years, however, the U.S. government has publicly acknowledged that unidentified anomalous phenomena are real, observed events—even though many remain unexplained [3,4]. These acknowledgments come from defense, intelligence, and scientific bodies analyzing radar, infrared, and visual data, not from speculative or anecdotal sources.

This shift matters clinically. Once a phenomenon is officially recognized as real, it can no longer be dismissed as inherently implausible. Under these conditions, reflexively interpreting reports of UAP sightings as evidence of cognitive error or pathology no longer aligns with current ethical standards.

Neither psychology nor psychiatry permits clinicians to infer mental illness simply because an experience is unusual.

The American Psychological Association requires psychologists to respect individuals' dignity and avoid unfair discrimination, including bias based on reported experiences when there is no evidence of impairment [1]. Similarly, the American Psychiatric Association prohibits discriminatory treatment based on beliefs or experiences and cautions against using diagnosis as a form of social or institutional control [2].

Put simply, ethical care requires humility. Unusual or unresolved experiences must be approached with neutrality and evaluated based on how a person is functioning—not on whether the experience itself fits familiar explanatory frameworks. When uncertainty is present, diagnostic restraint is required for ethical practice.

Observing a UAP can itself be distressing. Many individuals report acute stress reactions, anxiety related to uncertainty, sleep disruption, and existential or meaning-related distress following such experiences—particularly when what they observed challenges assumptions about safety, control, or reality [6]. These reactions reflect a human response to uncertainty and disruption, not evidence of underlying psychiatric disorder.

However, distress can be exacerbated when people who witness UAPs try to talk about what they've seen. In clinical settings, individuals describe a second layer of stress driven by fears of disbelief, loss of credibility, or having the experience interpreted as pathology rather than processed as an event [6]. Because clinicians function as gatekeepers to diagnosis, records, and institutional authority, their responses carry disproportionate psychological weight. When reports of unusual experiences are met with skepticism, minimization, or subtle pathologizing, the therapeutic environment itself can become a source of harm.

This pattern aligns with broader institutional findings. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's UAP Independent Study Team identified fear of ridicule, reputational harm, and professional consequences as significant barriers to reporting, noting that stigma suppresses reporting and shapes emotional responses to UAP observations [3]. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has similarly acknowledged persistent underreporting driven by concerns about career and personal impact [4].

In clinical contexts, a clinician's response can therefore determine whether distress is reduced—or inadvertently transformed into secondary trauma.

While considerably more research is needed on how to appropriately respond to people who report UAP sightings, ethical, evidence-based care in this context is not radical or complex:

This approach does not require endorsing any explanation for UAPs. It requires professional humility and adherence to established ethical standards for non-discrimination, competence, and harm reduction [1,2,6].

As government disclosure of UAP information continues to evolve, the mental health field cannot afford to lag behind. Ethical practice requires not only keeping pace with emerging realities but helping to shape how they are met in clinical settings. Mental health professionals are uniquely positioned to lead—to model how uncertainty can be held with care, how unfamiliar experiences can be approached without judgment, and how trust can be preserved even when answers are incomplete.

Mental health professionals are not being asked to answer unanswerable questions or even change their own beliefs. They are being asked to ensure that ethical standards keep pace with disclosure and to lead the way in creating clinical spaces where talking honestly about what one observed does not come at a psychological cost.

What someone believes they saw may remain unresolved.

Whether they feel safe talking about it should not be.

Meera Bhansali has steadily carved a unique space in Indian English poetry, blending myth, psychological inquiry, and the allure of darkness. Her latest collection, ‘Nocturnal Frights', is being hailed as India's first sustained paranormal poetry work, inviting readers into a realm where fear is both intimate and contemplative.  

The collection was not conceived as a “first” in the genre. Bhansali explains that it “began as a natural progression” of her previous work. “Almost eighty percent was already written when the realisation struck that this could become something no one had attempted before. That is when it consciously turned into intention.”  

Her fascination with dark poetry and the Gothic stems from a deep interest in flawed humanity. “I am drawn to the grey character—the misunderstood figure who is pushed into becoming the villain. Much like ‘Paradise Lost', it is the flaw in humanity that fascinates me, not pure evil,” she notes.  

In crafting the entities that populate ‘Nocturnal Frights', Bhansali deliberately chose figures familiar across cultures and myths. “Most of them appear under different names. That familiarity creates an immediate connection while still allowing room for interpretation,” she says. The book is structured around thirteen such entities, a number she describes as “instinctive and symbolic; it has long been associated with the supernatural, the forbidden, and the unseen. It felt like the right vessel for a book that lives in the shadows.” Unlike many poetry collections that feel disjointed, Bhansali aimed for narrative continuity. “I wanted these poems to feel connected—to belong to something larger than themselves. Bindingeach set to a single entity allowed the poems to stand alone while still carrying a shared presence forward.” Some poems even adopt the cadence of short fiction. “Today's readers have limited attention spans, yet they still want depth. Narrative poetry allows them to experience a full world in a compact form,” she observes.  

Rhythm and rhyme are prominent in her work, though not as a calculated technique. “Certain rhythms simply stay with you. When they linger in memory, they naturally find their way into poetry,” Bhansali explains. As for the fear that permeates the collection, it is both psychological and supernatural, feeding into each other “like a vicious circle—one often giving birth to the other.”  

Writing such intense material requires emotional grounding. Bhansali consciously steps back when overwhelmed. “Music, nature walks, and meditation help me ground myself and return with clarity,” she says. She also addresses a common misconception about the Gothic in India: that it is a Western concept. “Indian and Asian cultures have carried Gothic elements long before the word ‘Gothic' was even coined.”  

Looking ahead, Bhansali is already venturing further into the macabre. She is working on a series of horror stories and hints at a possible return to horror poetry, though she prefers to keep future projects under wraps for now.  

With ‘Nocturnal Frights', Meera Bhansali not only explores the liminal spaces of fear but also reclaims a Gothic and paranormal sensibility rooted in Indian cultural memory—proving that the shadows havealways belonged here.

Ryan Hartford/INSTARimages.com

Whether he's fighting all the demons that hell has to offer in Supernatural or racing against time to stop domestic threats in Countdown, Jensen Ackles has long been a hero in the eyes of his fans. Still, despite being cast as an actual superhero (depending on who you ask) in Eric Kripke's The Boys, the actor has more boxes he'd like to tick off on his superhero checklist. During a recent appearance at a Supernatural panel in Las Vegas, Ackles put himself out there as a would-be willing member of the Justice League should James Gunn be on the lookout for his Bruce Wayne, aka Batman, in the future. When Ackles was posed with the question of what his dream role would be, a participant from the crowd shouted, “Batman,” giving Ackles the perfect opportunity to give his two cents.

“Roger. Somebody up here yelled Batman. I think that is certainly a dream,” Ackles said to the room filled with Supernatural fans. “I've got a few go-tos,” he revealed, “Batman, Wyatt Earp, Robin Hood, that kind of stuff.” All three action-centered roles are ones we'd love to see Ackles take over, but Batman is certainly at the top. After all, he's already got the voice down. Although he's never appeared as the live-action version of the Caped Crusader, Ackles has previously voiced the character in a multitude of animated projects in the DC Animated Movie Universe, with the most recent performance being 2024's Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths.

Should he enter Gunn's DCU, Ackles would be far from the first Supernatural alumni to step into the comic book world. His co-star, Misha Collins, who was also on stage at the Las Vegas Supernatural panel, previously appeared in The CW series, Gotham Knights, as Harvey Dent, aka Two-Face, a casting that he referred to as a “dream role.” Joking about his potential future with the ever-growing DCU, Collins said, “It's funny you mentioning Batman because playing Two-Face was a dream role. Sebastian Stan just got cast as Two-Face in the next Batman movie, which I did not feel jealous about. If he were to meet with an accident and they needed to find — I'd certainly free up my schedule to make myself available.”

With Superman flying into cinemas last summer and Supergirl just around the corner, Gunn and Peter Safran's takeover of DC Studios has been flourishing. The Guardians of the Galaxy director has been keeping his cards close to his chest when it comes to casting, but we know a handful of projects are in the works, including Clayface, Man of Tomorrow, and The Brave and the Bold. As of right now, Gunn hasn't announced moves for a new Batman movie, but Matt Reeves is pushing forward with The Batman Part II, which will see Robert Pattinson reprise his role as the titular vigilante, with Sebastian Stan and Scarlett Johansson also boarding the vehicle.

Stay tuned to Collider for more information about the future of Gunn's DCU.

At first glance, Princess Diana, Madonna, and Khloé Kardashian seem to share very little. They come from different eras, industries, and worlds of fame. Yet there's a quieter, more personal thread linking them, and it has nothing to do with fashion, headlines, or chart-topping success.

Each has openly turned to spiritual guidance.

From astrology and tarot to psychic readings, these women have explored intuitive practices as tools for clarity, comfort, and self-reflection during some of the most scrutinized moments of their lives. Their openness has helped bring alternative spirituality out of the shadows and into the mainstream.

Princess Diana was known to consult astrologers and psychics throughout her life, including Penny Thornton and Debbie Frank. Friends and biographers have described her spiritual curiosity as deeply personal. It's a way to seek reassurance and emotional grounding while navigating extraordinary public pressure.

Madonna, 67, has long woven spirituality into her identity, embracing Kabbalah in the mid-1990s and frequently crediting her spiritual studies with helping her stay centered through fame, reinvention, and controversy.

Kardashian, 41, has spoken openly about seeking psychic insight, including appearing on Hollywood Medium with Tyler Henry. Her willingness to share that experience publicly reflects a generational shift toward normalizing spiritual curiosity.

According to Trusted Psychics, celebrity openness plays a meaningful role in shaping how the public views spiritual practices. When high-profile figures speak candidly about tarot, astrology, or intuitive readings, it reframes them not as fringe beliefs, but as reflective tools.

""People often assume celebrities turn to psychics because they want predictions,"" says Joanne Jones, Astrology and Psychic Expert for the brand. ""In reality, it's often about finding perspective and reconnecting with intuition when life feels overwhelming.""

For women living under constant scrutiny, spiritual guidance can offer privacy, clarity, and a sense of control without dogma or expectation. It's less about knowing the future and more about understanding themselves.

Different generations. Different paths. One shared instinct: when the noise gets loud, look inward.

When conspiracy theorists use “they,” that “they” that's controlling your life is usually a faceless group of powerful people making decisions behind closed doors. So, in that regard, it's easy to see why the annual gathering of billionaires at Davos has become a focal point in communities where people do their own research.

The people who believe Davos attendees are out to get them have always existed, but, as with other niche interests, social media amplified those conspiracy theories, and they now reach a wider audience. Some that have gained traction in recent years include:

The threat of dis/misinformation: While some conspiracy theories can be harmless—no, the NYC bagel place isn't messing up your order because they know you're from Boston—they can also have a way of sowing distrust in a society…which runs exactly contrary to the conference's goals of international cooperation. At Davos in 2023, New York Times chairman and publisher AG Sulzberger said about the danger of disinformation: “Once you see trust decline, what you then see is a society start to fracture, and so you see people fracture along tribal lines and, you know, that immediately undermines pluralism.”—DL

Former British No 1 Laura Robson has dismissed conspiracy theories that have been floated by some cynics following Jannik Sinner's fortune escape in his match against Eliot Spizzirri.

Sinner was gripped by full-body cramps as the extreme heat in Melbourne took its toll on him and it seemed as if he would not be able to get through the match.

Just as Sinner was struck down, the heat rule came into effect as tournament chiefs stopped the match and closed the roof, which gave the defending champion time to recover and get back on court to record a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4.

Inevitably, social media platforms were full of comments from fans of Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic suggesting the rules were bent to ensure Sinner would remain in the event.

Yet that theory carries very little weight, as the heat rule kicked in across all courts at the Australian Open and Sinner's match was, in fact, the last to be halted due to the extreme temperatures.

Former world No 2 predicts dominance of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner will end in 2026

Jannik Sinner makes ‘got lucky' confession after surviving major Australian Open heat scare

Robson was quick to rule out any desire by Australian Open chiefs to manipulate the rules and allow Sinner to have some recovery time.

“There is no way he could have finished this match,” said Robson on TNT Sports.

“He was talking to Darren Cahill and saying I don't know if I can do this. Darren was saying just walk through the third set and get off the court because they knew there was a very good chance that the heat rule was coming in.

“He certainly got lucky. People will be convinced that there were other factors in play and that the tournament did it on purpose, but genuinely it was boiling at that point of the day and it was pure kismet that the match stopped when it did.

“We sat off for seven or eight minutes and the ten-minute heat rule that came in at the end of the third [set]. Things just fell his way.”

Robson's fellow TNT Sports analyst Tim Henman described the break for Sinner as a ‘massive slice of luck', as he suggested the defending champions as very nearly counted out.

“If that went for another seven or eight minutes and the heat rules doesn't come in, he can stand out on the court, but he loses the third set for sure.

“Once he had time to go off court, the temperature drops in Rod Laver Arena, his core body temperature drops as well and he started to feel a little bit better. He was able to loosen up and find a way through.”

Sinner will be grateful that he has two days to recover before his next match, but he will be keen to avoid playing in the daytime slots again as that may well be the biggest threat to his title hopes.

US President Donald Trump's top negotiator Steve Witkoff has praised the first Russia-US-Ukraine meeting in Abu Dhabi, saying the sides have agreed to resume negotiations next week.

The two-day meeting in the Emirati capital, which concluded on Saturday, marked the first time negotiators from Russia, Ukraine, and the US sat together since the conflict between Moscow and Kiev erupted in February 2022. However, the parties have remained largely tight-lipped about the outcome of the discussions.

In a post on X on Saturday, Witkoff, who led the American delegation alongside Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, said the talks were “very constructive” and that plans were made to continue discussions next week in Abu Dhabi. He added that Trump was committed to negotiating a peace deal.

The talks in Abu Dhabi took place shortly after Witkoff and Kushner met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin, while Trump spoke with Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

All three parties have acknowledged that territorial disputes remain the main obstacle to a peace settlement. Moscow maintains that a sustainable deal is only possible if Ukraine withdraws its troops from the regions of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporozhye, which voted to join Russia in 2022, and formally recognizes its neighbor's new borders, including Crimea. Zelensky has ruled out any territorial concessions.

Putin's top aide Yury Ushakov, who attended the Abu Dhabi talks, told reporters before the meeting that Russia had the battlefield initiative and would achieve its objectives militarily unless a diplomatic solution is found.

Flood of boasts, broadsides and conspiracy theories leaves envoys sifting for the signal within the Trumpian noise

How does one keep tabs on, and then interpret, a president who in a single year sent out more than 6,000 social media posts, conducted more than 433 open press events and held free-associating press conferences lasting close to two hours? The White House Stenographer's Office calculates it has transcribed 2.4 million of Trump's words, four times the length of Tolstoy's epic War and Peace.

Tracking Trump is not just a problem for exhausted reporters – but also exhausted diplomats, who are tasked with searching for the signal in the ceaseless Trumpian noise.

Western diplomats have upgraded their media monitoring operations to take account of Trump's habit of dropping an explosive policy announcement or launching an unexpected incendiary broadside against an ally at almost any point in the 24/7 news cycle.

Foreign ministries now also have to look out for the private texts of their boss reappearing on Truth Social.

Trump holds press conferences almost every day, and in his first year posted on Truth Social 6,606 times. Research shows that Thursday midnight, Tuesday 11am, Saturday 5pm and Monday 11pm are the witching hours at which he most frequently issues posts, often leaving western diplomats in a different time zone at a disadvantage.

One diplomat said the most frequent refrain most mornings is: “What has he said this time?”

On the night of 1 December he posted 156 times, and – as on many nights – he mixed market-moving announcements with personal boasts and conspiracy theories, including the possibility that Joe Biden was executed in 2020 and replaced by robots and clones.

For European diplomats, the late-night posts are often the worst since they may be landing on their phones as they make their way into work.

The UK Foreign Office discovered at 6.15am last Tuesday that someone, possibly Nigel Farage, appeared to have got hold of Trump through an intermediary to convince him to denounce the UK Diego Garcia deal, something Downing Street thought had long been put to bed.

A diplomat based in the UK said it is also now becoming a specific skill to be able to translate and sift Trump's often rambling remarks for any hidden policy gems of genuine consequence.

He explains: “You can have the speech live on your dinner table at home, and he starts speaking about his childhood of playing at a park next to a mental hospital and his mother telling him he could have been a professional baseball player. You start to switch off – you don't want to live inside this man's head – and then you realise you missed something.”

Many of these rambling press conferences are pure self-aggrandising junk, but there is always the possibility that he will drop a bombshell that he is, say, planning to send an armada to Iran, or slap 100 % tariffs on Canada.

Another diplomat pointed to the opening section of his anniversary press conference last week celebrating his first year in power, in which he spoke for 80 minutes about why America was “the hottest country in the world” before taking questions.

Soon after saying Somalia does not even resemble a country and the Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar is a crook and he personally cannot stand her, he started showing reporters photographs of alleged criminals picked up by ICE in Minnesota, each with the headline “the worst of the worst”.

Then he set off on a monologue that contemplated the photographs before riffing on “a beautiful place in Switzerland where I am sure I am very happily awaited for”, pivoting to Venezuela and opposition leader María Corina Machado's gift of her Nobel prize and landing on American oil companies' satisfaction at his approach. “You are not getting bored with this right?” he asked. “I hope not.”

Even in this ramble – revealing his deep fear of being boring – there are some clues that he still wants to work with the existing Venezuelan government, but that Machado is not out of the picture, because her Nobel gesture touched him. Flattery still works, the diplomats register. 
 So taxing are these marathons that one diplomat admits that one of the remaining values of X is that you can check whether journalists have spotted something they had missed.

Dame Karen Pierce, Britain's ambassador to Washington who famously got on well with the Trump crowd, was recently quizzed by another diplomat on the secret of her success.

She explained that she decided to try to go on Fox News as much as possible, knowing that Trump watches it. Some embassies now have a diplomat detailed to cover how Fox is reporting geopolitics, since they believe this is probably the single most important source of Trump's information.

The diplomat said: “We believe he does not read, but if there is a Maga commentator on Fox, that will be where he is getting his information.”

Some western diplomats even believe the whole week-long row over Trump threatening to impose tariffs on eight European states was purely due to the president being convinced that Europe had sent a reconnaissance mission to start building Greenland's defences in the face of a US invasion.

“If he sees pictures on TV of a C-130 on a runway in Greenland and there is a Maga commentator spouting nonsense, you are in trouble,” one said.

But just as he is highly vulnerable to misinformation, so is he a mine of disinformation. While fact-checking was a growth industry in Trump's first term, now it is accepted that Trump has his own facts. But diplomats cannot dismiss them because they are part of an arsenal to threaten rivals.

In a long passage of his speech in Davos, for instance, he claimed the Chinese were selling windmills (as he calls turbines) to Europe, but leave them out of their own energy mix.

“They sell them to the stupid people that buy them, but don't use them themselves,” he said, to a packed audience of business executives that knew he was spouting nonsense. China's wind and solar generation in 2024 equalled 40% of total electricity generation in April 2025, according to the thinktank Ember.

He says this because he has demanded the EU buy $250bn (£180bn) of US oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and nuclear technologies every year until 2028.

All of that makes the diplomat's job very much harder. Fortunately for them, the further Trump strays from reality, the more valuable the diplomat, versed in the art of interpretation, may prove to be.

Prime Minister Mark Carney meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, China, on Jan. 16. Mr. Carney says Canada is not pursuing a formal trade deal with China despite claims from U.S. President Donald Trump.Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press

Prime Minister Mark Carney says Canada has no intention of pursuing a free-trade deal with China and a recently signed deal amounted to a rectification of existing issues. 

Mr. Carney, on his way into a Liberal caucus meeting on Parliament Hill Sunday, was responding to U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose a 100-per-cent tariff on Canada if it makes a trade deal with China. 

Mark Carney's survival plan: Canada and other ‘middle powers' must co-operate in order to thrive

Opinion: Facing 100%-tariff threat, Canada must swallow its pride and compromise

Mr. Carney told reporters that under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free-trade deal, also known as CUSMA, there are commitments not to pursue free-trade agreements with non-market economies without prior notification. 

“We have no intention of doing that with China or any other non-market economy,” Mr. Carney said. 

He described the deal with China as going “back to the future” with respect to electric vehicles and other food products. 

“It's entirely consistent with CUSMA, with our obligations, which we very much respect under CUSMA, and will continue to work that way.”

Canada and China struck a strategic partnership earlier this month to boost ties and allow Chinese investors to play a larger role in Canada's economy. 

During a four-day visit to Beijing, Mr. Carney praised China as a more predictable trading partner than the United States and broke with Washington over tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles.

The Prime Minister agreed to allow nearly 50,000 Chinese-made electric vehicles into Canada at a low tariff instead of a 100-per-cent tariff Ottawa imposed on these imports in 2024, along with the former Biden administration. In return, Beijing scaled back retaliatory tariffs on canola seed, Canada's No. 1 export to China.

When Mr. Trump was initially asked for his response to the Canada-China agreement, he appeared to give his blessing.

“That's okay. That's what he should be doing. I mean, it's a good thing for him to sign a trade deal. If you can get a deal with China, you should do that,” Mr. Trump told reporters.

But on Saturday, his tone shifted. In a post on Truth Social, the U.S. President argued a trade agreement between Canada and China would result in Canadian territory being a transit point for shipping Chinese goods into the United States.

“If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a ‘Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,” Mr. Trump said, in belittling language that cast the Prime Minister as state governor instead of the leader of a sovereign country.

“If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,” the President wrote.

On Sunday, he posted again about Canada, saying this country “is systematically destroying itself. The China deal is a disaster for them. Will go down as one of the worst deals, of any kind, in history.”

He also said that China “is successfully and completely taking over the once Great Country of Canada,” adding, “I only hope they leave Ice Hockey alone!”

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that new tariffs would be dependent on a new free trade deal between China and Canada that goes further than the recently signed pact. 

He told the American news program This Week with George Stephanopoulos it is also dependent on whether the U.S. sees Canada allowing China to dump goods, and linked the issue to the coming renegotiations of the USMCA. 

“We can't let Canada become an opening that the Chinese pour their cheap goods into the U.S. We have a USMCA agreement, which is going to be renegotiated this summer, and I'm not sure what Prime Minister Carney is doing here, other than trying to virtue-signal to his globalist friends at Davos,” Mr. Bessent said.

“I don't think he's doing the best job for the Canadian people.”

The new tariff threat is the latest attack by Mr. Trump on Mr. Carney since the Prime Minister delivered a provocative speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that amounted to a veiled attack on the damage the U.S. President has done to the international rules-based order.

Mr. Bessent accused Mr. Carney of doing an about-face. 

“The Canadians, a few months ago, joined the U.S. in putting high steel tariffs on China because the Chinese are dumping. The Europeans also have done the same thing. And it looks like that Prime Minister Carney may have done some kind of about-face,” Mr. Bessent said. 

Kody Blois, who is Mr. Carney's parliamentary secretary, said Sunday what Canada is doing with China is no different than the trade and economic deal Mr. Trump signed with China at the fall APEC summit. 

The U.S. was finding a way to create market access for their farmers, producers and the American tech sector, Mr. Blois told reporters Sunday morning. 

“They found a pathway, not on a comprehensive trade deal, but just on certain arrangements to reduce tariffs. We're following the same path. We're following the Canadian interest, and we think it's the right pathway,” he said. 

Mr. Carney was meeting with Liberal caucus Sunday to prepare for the start of a new parliamentary sitting on Monday. He said his government's priorities include affordability measures for Canadians, and promised those very soon. 

He was asked by reporters, however, whether he's putting his commitment to affordability at risk by antagonizing Mr. Trump. 

“No,” he said in French.

“The impact of American tariffs will be on American affordability, not Canadian affordability.”

Prime Minister Mark Carney gave a speech at the World Economic Forum that blamed U.S. President Donald Trump, without naming him, for what Carney described as a rupture in global relations.

A new poll finds more than 60% of Germans see the US president as a major threat. It comes as the president's actions and rhetoric have alienated US allies. Follow DW here for the latest.

Here are some of the biggest news headlines from Germany from the weekend of January 24 and 25:

At least 64 police officers had been injured during a football match in the eastern city of Magdeburg.

Violence broke out during the half-time break of a Saturday night match of a second-division game between Magdeburg and Dynamo Dresden, said the Interior Ministry of the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt.

Authorities say Magdeburg fans targeted police with pyrotechnics, barricades, rocks, bricks and even a manhole cover.

Some of the injured officers had to be taken to nearby hospitals for treatment.

""I strongly condemn yesterday's riots by alleged [Magdeburg] football fans and the violent attacks on our police colleagues. Hitting police officers with manhole covers and paving stones is nothing less than brutal violence,"" Saxony-Anhalt Interior Minister Tamara Zieschang said.

""I wish our injured colleagues a speedy recovery. I would like to thank all the police officers who were on duty yesterday to secure a football match and prevent clashes between home and away fans.

The ministry said several hundred officers were on site to safeguard the match.

Police say both fan blocs set off pyrotechnics. The authorities also claim Magdeburg fans had tried to attack Dresden supporters and committed other crimes in the city.

A new YouGov opinion poll conducted in the southwestern German state of Baden-Württemberg found that half of voters there want political parties to ignore the so-called ""firewall"" against working with extremist organizations and begin cooperating with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. 

The poll, commissioned by Germany's DPA news agency, comes ahead of elections in five of the nation's 16 states.

Germany's intelligence services have labeled AfD a ""confirmed right-wing extremist organization."" The far-right, anti-immigrant and anti-government AfD started as a fringe party and later secured strongholds mostly in the east of the country. Currently, however, support for it is surging across the country.

Voters in industrious and wealthy Baden-Württemberg — home to Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Bosch and a host of other tech and pharmaceutical companies — will head to the polls on March 8.

The AfD is currently the second most popular political party in the country and is polling third in Baden-Württemberg with 20% support.

Though Germany's major parties have previously upheld the pledge to refuse cooperation with anti-government outfits, the AfD's rising popularity has caused some to reconsider that stance.

Among those voters polled between January 14 and 22, 24% said parties should deal with the AfD on a case-by-case basis, with a further 26% viewing the AfD as a viable political operation that they would have no problem seeing in a government coalition.

Only 42% of respondents completely ruled out cooperation with the AfD, with another 8% having no opinion on the matter. 

Chancellor Friedrich Merz's conservative CDU currently leads polling in Baden-Württemberg, followed by the Greens.

Germany telecommunications companies have updated connectivity to the EU-wide emergency call system for vehicles known as eCall.

The companies switched coverage to 4G, updating from a four-decades-old 2G network. Not only will the update allow far more information to be transmitted, it will also do so much more quickly. 

The new Next Generation Emergency Call (NG eCall) system will be supported on the networks of Deutsche Telekom, O2 Telefonica and Vodafone, which operators say are also ready for 5G.

The automated emergency call system eCall has been mandatory in all new vehicles on EU roads since March 31, 2018. The aim of eCall is to greatly reduce the time between an accident and the arrival of emergency services. 

The system is automatically triggered when sensors detect airbag or seatbelt tensioner activation, but ignores minor impacts. 

Though the system is automated, it can also be activated manually in emergencies.

The EU, which says the system has the potential to slash response times by half, estimates the bloc could see 2,500 fewer annual traffic fatalities by the time most cars on the road are outfitted with it.

Deutsche Bank says it will continue to shutter branch offices around the country while at the same time pushing customers to switch to online apps.

The bank says the shift to more reliance on artificial intelligence or AI will free employees to deal with personal consultations with customers.

Speaking with German press agency DPA, executive board member Claudio de Sanctis said, ""After cutbacks in recent years, another 100 or so locations will be shed under our existing program.""

Deutsche Bank and its subsidiary Postbank currently serve some 19 million customers. The two operated roughly 750 branch offices in 2025.

Explaining the expansion of the bank's plan to lean into AI, board member de Sanctis said: ""Our staff currently spend far too much of their time on administrative tasks. They should have more time for consultations.""

De Sanctis said the bank will roll out an AI digital assistant app this year to facilitate its action plan, noting that this will free up bank employees to provide expertise to customers when it comes home purchases and major investments — ""You want to know that an important part of your life of this kind is not taking place in a cloud that you cannot reach.""

De Sanctis admitted that the shift to AI will lead to job losses but claimed the impact will be minimal as those leaving are doing so due to retirement or because their jobs are being phased out anyhow.

A new nationwide poll of Germans shows that a large majority views US President Donald Trump as a threat to their country.   

Some 1,000 respondents were queried for the poll, though 15% did not respond.

In the final tally, 24% of respondents said they continue to view Trump as an ally, whereas 61% defined Trump as a ""threat to the country.""  

The poll, commissioned by the tabloid newspaper Bild and carried out by the INSA Institute, was conducted this Friday and Saturday, in the wake of Trump's aggressive push for US ownership of Greenland while speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

Trump had threatened a 25% punitive tariff on nations — like Germany — unwilling to go along with his scheme to take semiautonomous Greenland from NATO-ally Denmark.

With that in mind, 52% of respondents called on German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and his administration to take a harder line when dealing with the nation's longtime ally, while 31% argued for continued cooperation.

Beyond the Trump administration's bullying of allies in international forums such as NATO, it has also increasingly turned up domestic pressure, too. 

The administration, including the president, vice president, secretary of state and others, such as part-time allies like Elon Musk, have aggressively injected themselves into German politics, offering wild assessments of the state of free speech and immigration in the country and giving full-throated support to far-right parties across Europe, especially Germany's Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. 

Welcome to DW's coverage of events in Germany on Sunday, January 25. 

Today we are taking a look at a poll showing how Germans really feel about US President Donald Trump, among other topics. 

Stay tuned for more!  

We'll return Sunday morning with the latest headlines from Germany. Stay tuned!

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius on Saturday joined other NATO partners in pushing back against US President Donald Trump's renewed insults over the sacrifice made by US allies who came to America's aid to fight in Afghanistan after September 11, 2001.

Trump has repeatedly slighted NATO contributions as well as suggesting they could not be counted upon. Pistorius pushed back hard in an interview published in the tabloid Bild on Saturday.

""Our Bundeswehr was ready when our US allies asked for support after the Islamist terrorist attack in 2001,"" he said. 

Germany and other US NATO allies rushed to the US' side when Washington — for the first and only time in NATO's history — invoked Article 5 of the military alliance's treaty, meaning that all must come to the aid of an ally who has been attacked.

Pistorius pointed out that German soldiers had ""fulfilled their mission under the greatest danger to life and limb and under extreme conditions,"" during a 19-year mission.

He also underscored the sacrifice made by Germany. 

""Fifty-nine soldiers and three police officers lost their lives in combat, attacks or accidents. Numerous wounded soldiers still suffer from injuries sustained during this time. We will honor the dedication and courage of our soldiers in Afghanistan. No matter who questions that. They will never be forgotten.""

Leaders throughout the alliance have recoiled at Trump's comments, with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer calling them, ""frankly appalling.""

Agents from Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office arrested a 36-year-old Lebanese man on Friday with authorities accusing him of having procured live ammunition presumably intended for use in attacks on Israeli or Jewish institutions in Germany and Europe.

Germany's Federal Public Prosecutor's Office made the announcement on Saturday.
Authorities suspect the man of being a member of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which was behind the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Hamas is designated as a terrorist group in Germany as well as several other countries.

German authorities say he was arrested at Berlin's BER Airport on Friday evening upon arrival from the Lebanese capital Beirut.

Investigators say the man is believed to have purchased around 300 rounds of live ammunition for the group.

The 36-year-old is scheduled to appear before the investigating judge at the Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe on Saturday.

Friday's arrest is the latest in a string across Europe, after three Hamas members were apprehended during a weapons exchange in the German capital in October, as well as suspects being detained upon entry to the Czech Republic and the UK.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul on Saturday criticized the European Union Parliament's decision to seek legal review of the EU-Mercosur free-trade agreement as a ""very serious political mistake.""

Wadephul told German public broadcaster Deutschlandfunk Radio that the Wednesday vote — the narrow passage of which was made possible by support from Germany's Green and AfD parties — was ""a major setback.""

Wadephul said the referral could cause ""a significant delay that will harm political trust,"" as other countries with pending trade deals — like India — watch to see if the EU is even capable of passing and implementing such treaties.

The EU-Mercosur trade deal with Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay had been in the works for a quarter century before it was approved by the EU on January 9, signed by all parties on January 17, and then halted for review by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on January 21. 

Supporters of the deal say it is necessary for EU security in the face of aggressive and punitive US tariff policy.

European farmers, however, have been among the loudest opponents of the deal, which would involve reducing trade and tariff barriers on goods and services and create one of the largest free-trade zones in the world, covering some 700 million people.

In remarks published in Germany's Tagesspiegel newspaper on Saturday, Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel said the central bank is the target of relentless cyberattacks. 

""We see 5,000 attacks per minute on our IT systems alone,"" Nagel said, adding that in light of the fact that this comes out to more than two-and-a-half-billion attacks annually, the institution is in a ""never ending race.""

Nagel says the bank has implemented numerous security measures — including stringent employee background checks, secure IT systems, and business continuity management plans — to protect the institution from cyber criminals.

Nagel's remarks came at the same time Federal Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt vowed that Germany would become much more aggressive in fighting cyber crime.

""We will strike back, including abroad,"" Dobrindt told Germany's Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. ""We will disrupt attackers and destroy their infrastructure.""  

Dobrindt said the threshold for action would be set low and that counterstrikes would be carried out jointly by the intelligence services and the Federal Criminal Police Office.

The Interior Ministry intends to set up a new hybrid-threat defense center to improve coordination. Germany's domestic intelligence service is preparing the unit, which is due to start work later this year.

Dobrindt said Germany's institutions, infrastructure and companies are under constant threat of cyber attack, adding, ""We cannot accept that.""

German police shot and killed 17 individuals in 2025 according to statistics published by the Institute for Civil Rights & Public Safety at Humboldt University in Berlin.

The figure was lower than 2024, when a record 25 police killings were logged, yet well above decades-long averages.

The high number, published on the institute's online magazine Civil Rights & Police, has amplified calls for police to be equipped with Tasers in order to provide a non-lethal option for them in threatening situations.

Although special forces units in all 16 German states carry Tasers, not all local and state police do. Several states are looking to pass laws to change that.

GdP Police Union Chairman Jochen Kopelke used the southwestern state of Baden-Württemberg as a case example in arguing for the implementation of Tasers. The state registered seven police-related fatal shootings in 2025, predominantly by state and local police with no access to Tasers.  

""Where no or only limited 'non-lethal' means of intervention can be used, firearms are the only proportionate means,"" said Kopelke. ""Where Tasers are more readily available to the police, the use of service weapons is reduced.""

This past October, lawmakers in Germany's Bundestag passed a legislative amendment to expand the list of equipment provided to federal police officers beyond their standard issue of truncheons and service pistols to include ""distance electric pulse devices"" that can deliver electric shocks from a short distanceand usually incapacitate a person.

Guten Tag from the Bonn newsroom, where the sun is shining and the air is crisp. After a whirlwind week of international news, we will start the day here by looking at a shifting cybersecurity posture, police violence statistics, and the tabling of the Mercosur free-trade agreement.

Cybersecurity is a topic being widely discussed here this weekend, with the president of the central bank as well as the federal interior minister addressing the relentlessness of attacks on institutions and a government pivot to more aggressive responses to such crime.

A high number of fatalities as the result of police firearm use in 2025 has amplified calls to give cops access to non-lethal means of intervention and self-defense. Police say Baden-Württemberg, where special forces carry Tasers and state police don't, serves as a case study for the difference they can make.

And as the world digests the ongoing shake-up of global alliances, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has unleashed criticism of the EU Parliament's vote to seek a legal review of the massive EU-Mercosur trade agreement that looked likely to become a reality after 25 years of negotiations. Wadephul called the move a ""very serious political mistake.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","How Gregory Bovino became the face of Trump's immigration crackdown","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/25/politics/gregory-bovino-minneapolis-immigration-crackdown","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 12:00:46 GMT","


            A year ago, few Americans knew Gregory Bovino's name. Now he's the face of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.
    


            And everything from the Border Patrol commander-at-large's tactics in the field to his wardrobe choices have become lightning rods in a storm with no end in sight.
    


            On the streets of multiple American cities, Bovino – sporting a buzzcut and the Border Patrol's olive green uniform – has been spotted leading patrols, hurling tear gas canisters and verbally sparring with critics. He often stands out among groups of federal officers as one of the few people not wearing a mask.
    


            On social media, he's known for sharing photos and cinematic videos that tout Border Patrol agents' determination to carry out their mission.
    


            And now, his presence at the podium and on screens around the world is becoming more common as he delivers briefings from Minneapolis.
    


            That's where Bovino stood hours after a Border Patrol officer shot and killed a man in that city Saturday, telling reporters that officers had followed their training when faced with an armed suspect who “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.”
    


            Critics quickly slammed Bovino's statement and others from Homeland Security officials, arguing that videos of the shooting show no evidence the man was trying to harm anyone.
    


            But Bovino doubled down on his defense of officers Sunday.
    


            “The fact that they're highly trained prevented any specific shootings of law enforcement, so good job for our law enforcement in taking him down before he was able to do that,” Bovino told CNN's “State of the Union.”



            Pressed to provide evidence, Bovino said more details would emerge as authorities investigate and argued that the man was trying to impede officers.
    


            “It's too bad the consequences had to be paid because he injected himself into that crime scene. I can't say that enough. He made the decision to go there,” Bovino said.
    


            The Border Patrol official's account drew sharp criticism Sunday morning from Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy.
    


Videos appear to show federal officer took gun away from Alex Pretti just before fatal shooting, CNN analysis finds



            “Everybody saw that video, and yet there he was telling you and telling the American public that this young man was brandishing a weapon, that he was impeding officers, that he was there to attend a riot, that he was engaged in assault, when everyone can see that that's not true,” Murphy told CNN. “It should freak the American public out that the Trump administration lies this easily, will lie to your face when you can see the evidence for yourself.”
    


            Bovino is no stranger to criticisms of his approach. For months in interviews, court testimony and social media posts, he's repeatedly defended federal officers' actions and vowed not to back down.
    


            In multiple social media posts and interviews, Bovino has repeatedly used a phrase to describe his officers' tactics.
    


            “He calls them ‘turn and burn,'” CNN contributor Lulu Garcia-Navarro says. “They're very rapid. They're very aggressive. Break windows, go in, grab people. And the reason he says that he does these tactics is to not put …agents at risk, not to allow protests to develop.”
    


            Supporters of the administration's aggressive mass deportation push see Bovino as a hero. But the forceful, unapologetic approach that's fueled his recent rise to prominence has also drawn fierce criticism from local leaders and protesters in cities his team is targeting.
    


            Officials in several cities have described Bovino as leading a law enforcement agency which deploys tactics that are frighteningly authoritarian and used by the president as a cudgel against Democrat-led communities and the people — citizens and noncitizens alike — who live in them.
    


            “They want mayhem on the ground,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker told CNN in October, accusing Bovino and other federal officials of deliberately inflaming tensions. “They want to create the war zone, so that they can send in even more troops.”
    


Heavy-handed tactics, including immigration sweeps in parking lots and smashing car windows, have fueled alarm, including among some in the Trump administration, while also garnering praise from senior Homeland Security officials.
    


            Asked about the aggressive approach that has spurred growing criticism and protests, Bovino has defended his officers.
    


            “You know, folks are free to criticize. They're free to armchair quarterback. When they don't walk a mile in the shoes of law enforcement, then they might want to think a second before full-blown criticism. I've heard a lot of that,” he told CNN in October. “Our officers act legally, ethically and morally in all law enforcement actions.”
    


            On Sunday, Murphy said on CNN's “State of the Union” that the latest shooting in Minneapolis should spur lawmakers to press for reforms within the Department of Homeland Security before approving its budget.
    


            “People being killed simply for exercising their First Amendment rights is going to be a regular feature in this country. That is dystopian. We shouldn't allow for it, and that should unite Republicans and Democrats in Congress, because it's increasingly uniting Republicans and Democrats all around the country who are turning against this just unbelievably lawless way that Bovino and his team are operating in our cities,” he said.
    


The Trump administration is turbocharging its immigration offensive on three controversial fronts. See how



            Bovino's presence in different cities across the country in recent months has become an unofficial barometer of how intense immigration enforcement is expected to get.
    


            These days, Bovino is a frequent sight on the streets of Minneapolis – bringing what he calls the “Mean Green Team” thousands of miles from the sector along the US-Mexico border where he was stationed before.
    


            “The #MeanGreen is patrolling Minneapolis through the cold, through the snow, and through it all arresting illegal aliens until the mission is accomplished,” Bovino posted Friday on X. “We're here and we're making the city safe.”
    


            Originally from North Carolina, Bovino joined the Border Patrol in 1996. His 30-year career has taken him from Washington to New Orleans as well as foreign postings in Honduras and Africa. In 2020 he was named Chief Patrol Agent of the El Centro Sector of Southern California.
    


            In 2023, Bovino was briefly relieved of command from his position in what House Republicans described as a retaliatory measure after he testified critically about conditions along the border under President Joe Biden's administration. The Associated Press reported other factors were also at play – including his social-media presence and an online profile picture of him posing with an assault rifle.
    


            He began drawing public attention last summer, when he helped orchestrate the arrests of more than 5,000 immigrants in a Los Angeles operation. Since then, Bovino – who's in his mid-fifties – has led sweeps in Chicago, Charlotte, New Orleans and, now, Minneapolis.
    


            Bovino's conduct during the Chicago operation drew stern rebukes from a federal judge, who ruled that his descriptions of events weren't supported by video evidence.
    


            In one video, cited in a federal court case alleging excessive force against protesters in Chicago, the judge ruled that Bovino “obviously tackles” a protester on camera. But in his deposition, Bovino denied he tackled the man. “I'm imploring (him)…to comply with leaving the area to comply with instructions,” Bovino said, adding, “the use of force was against me.”
    


            Lately, another aspect of Bovino's image is also drawing attention: the long green trench coach he sometimes wears.
    


            “Greg Bovino dressed up as if he literally went on eBay and purchased SS garb. Greg Bovino, secret police, private army, masked men, people disappearing quite literally, no due process,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said recently, drawing a comparison to Nazi uniforms.
    


            Bovino says he's had the jacket for more than 25 years, and got it from the Border Patrol.
    


            “I bought that as a young agent, approximately 1999,” he told News Nation, noting that he was also photographed wearing it for a ceremony during the Biden administration.
    


            That interview, Bovino wrote on social media, “cleared up any misconceptions and highlighted the double standard phenomenon.”
    


            Whatever happens next, there's little doubt we'll be seeing more of Bovino – and his coat – on America's streets.
    


            Slickly produced videos and other social media posts from Bovino's accounts have also drawn criticism. He says the posts are aimed at increasing transparency.
    


            “This is not agenda-driven. Our social media is designed to give the public … a real-time snapshot of what is really happening,” Bovino told CNN in October.
    


            Among his recent posts, Bovino shared a video clip of his response during a press briefing to a reporter who asked when the surge of federal law enforcement into Minneapolis will end.
    


            “Is there a certain number of people you want to apprehend before you decide to ease the surge?” the reporter asked.
    


            “There is a number,” Bovino said, “and it's called all of them.”

Fox News' Steve Harrigan reports on the growing number of protesters marching through Minneapolis after the fatal CBP-involved shooting on ‘The Big Weekend Show.'

Former Minnesota Vikings captain and University of Minnesota football player Jack Brewer spoke out against the anti-ICE agitators in his state.

Unrest erupted in and around Minneapolis on Saturday after a Border Patrol agent fatally shot one of the agitators.  Brewer called out the state's liberal leadership for inciting the unrest, arguing the Democrats are opposed to ICE because the agency is ""deporting their voters.""

""We're deporting their voters. That's part of what's happening and it's blowing up their whole plan,"" Brewer told Fox News Digital. 

""You can't allow people to come into your country who don't carry the same morals and values that you do. That's what's happening. Minneapolis is protecting these thugs. It's unbelievable. These people are demonic. I've done work in third-world countries for 25 years. The values are not the same... You cannot let people come into the United States who come from cultures like that, because they bring their culture with them. That's what's happening.""

Brewer also took aim at the city's liberal population, calling for behavioral assessments and national guard intervention.

""There is something wrong in Minneapolis. We need a city-wide behavioral health assessment. People have completely lost reality,"" Brewer said. ""I hope President Trump sends in the National Guard. We need curfews. We need real consequences for attacking law enforcement. These men and women should be able to do their jobs and go home to their families safely.""

In 2018, Brewer was presented the key to the city of Minneapolis by Mayor Jacob Frey. But today, Brewer condemns Frey for taking far-left stances.

DHS SAYS ICE AGENTS RAMMED BY VEHICLES AMID MINNEAPOLIS ENFORCEMENT SURGE: 'AGGRESSIVELY ASSAULTED'

""I wish I could lock the doors on that city and not let him back in if I had the power. What he has done is absolutely ridiculous,"" Brewer said.  ""He tap-dances for Somalis. He does anything to go against the culture of America and Christianity for them.""

Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident and ICU nurse, was shot during an immigration enforcement operation early Saturday targeting Jose Huerta-Chuma, an illegal immigrant with a criminal history including domestic assault for intentional conflict bodily harm, disorderly conduct and driving without a valid license.

Department of Homeland Security officials said Pretti approached Border Patrol agents while armed with a 9 mm pistol and ""violently resisted"" when they attempted to disarm him. Medics immediately delivered aid, but Pretti was pronounced dead at the site of the shooting.

After the shooting, approximately 200 agitators arrived and began to ""obstruct and assault law enforcement,"" leading to crowd control measures, according to DHS.

The Minneapolis Police Department asked for the public to remain calm after Saturday's shooting.

""We are aware of reports of another shooting involving federal law enforcement in the area of 26th Street W and Nicollet Ave. We are working to confirm additional details. We ask the public to remain calm and avoid the immediate area. Please follow the city's social media channels for updates,"" the Minneapolis Police Department said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said at a news conference that an ""unlawful assembly"" was taking place in the area of the shooting and urged the public to avoid it.

""Our demand today is for those federal agencies that are operating in our city to do so with the same discipline, humanity and integrity that effective law enforcement in this country demands. We urge everyone to remain peaceful,"" O'Hara said.

O'Hara said there had been an emergency recall of all sworn personnel back to duty to handle the situation.

While MPD is leading the charge, it is receiving help from the Minnesota State Patrol and Hennepin and Ramsey County sheriffs, O'Hara said. 

Suburban towns have aided MPD in handling the influx of 911 calls. He added that the fire department was working with police to ""ensure that two small fires that were started in the area are safely extinguished.""

North Carolina House Speaker Destin Hall reacts to the deaths of a college soccer star and his girlfriend and outlines what he says went wrong.

Lawmakers are voicing outrage as family and friends mourn a college soccer player and his girlfriend who were killed in a DUI crash allegedly caused by an illegal immigrant.

The case is reigniting debate over immigration enforcement and whether failures in the system contributed to the deaths of Fletcher Harris, 20, and Skylar Provenza, 19.

Prosecutors say Juan Alvarado Aguilar, 37, was driving under the influence when his vehicle slammed into the couple's car on Friday, Jan. 16, killing them both and devastating their families and community. As mourners gather to say goodbye to Provenza and Harris, whose funeral was held Thursday, lawmakers are pointing to Aguilar's immigration status and alleged criminal history as evidence of broader public safety failures they say demand immediate action.

North Carolina Republican Rep. Mark Harris said the case highlights what he described as the deadly consequences of sanctuary policies and failures to enforce immigration laws. Harris argued the couple's deaths were preventable and blamed state and local leadership for allowing the suspect to remain in the country and on the road.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT RAN FROM DEADLY WRONG-WAY DUI CRASH THAT KILLED MOTORCYCLIST, RECORDS SHOW

""Fletcher Harris and Skylar Provenza—two bright young lives full of promise—were brutally taken in a head-on crash allegedly caused by an illegal alien with a prior DUI who never should have been on our roads,"" Harris said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""This is the deadly cost of North Carolina's sanctuary policies and radical Democrat refusal to enforce the law.""

Harris also questioned the lack of public response, suggesting the reaction would be far different in other cases.

""Where's the outrage? Where are the protests? If this were any other tragedy, the streets would be filled—but when criminal aliens kill Americans, the silence from the Left is deafening.""

Authorities say the deadly crash occurred just after 11 p.m. on Jan. 16 in Rowan County, North Carolina, when a Chevrolet Silverado driven by Aguilar crossed the center line and slammed head-on into the car carrying Harris and Provenza. They were both pronounced dead at the scene.

Investigators said officers noted a strong odor of alcohol and that Aguilar appeared unsteady on his feet when he was arrested.

Court records reviewed by Fox News Digital show Aguilar had a prior driving-while-impaired charge from 2020 that was dismissed by a district attorney, a procedural move that has drawn renewed scrutiny following the deadly crash. Prosecutors also told the court that Aguilar had two prior failures to appear, and an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainer has been placed on him.

Aguilar now faces two counts of felony death by vehicle, driving while impaired and other charges, and is being held on a bond of more than $5 million.

North Carolina House Speaker Destin Hall said the deaths hit close to home and blamed what he described as failures in federal immigration enforcement. 

""I think it's a failure of policy, and it's a failure under the Biden administration, where essentially he allowed open borders,"" Hall said. He argued that Democrats have taken the position that ""no one should be deported, even those who are committing serious crimes,"" adding that the suspect had previously been charged with DWI before the fatal crash.

Hall pushed back against claims that North Carolina is a sanctuary state, pointing to legislative action taken in recent years to require cooperation with federal immigration authorities. He said that prior to 2018, all sheriffs in the state worked with ICE, but that changed after several Democratic sheriffs stopped honoring ICE detainers.

Republican lawmakers responded by passing legislation mandating cooperation with ICE, bills that were initially vetoed by then-Gov. Roy Cooper before lawmakers overrode the vetoes.

""So in this state right now, when somebody is charged with a crime, and they're here illegally and ICE wants to take custody of that person, the local county sheriff has to do that,"" Hall said.

Hall argued that enforcement later broke down at the federal level, despite state laws remaining in place, saying ICE under the Biden administration often failed to take custody of illegal immigrants charged with crimes.

He said stronger coordination between state and federal authorities is critical to preventing similar tragedies, crediting renewed enforcement efforts under the Trump administration and emphasizing the need for continued cooperation.

Reflecting on the victims, Hall said lawmakers are focused on preventing future losses.

""Know that we're fighting very hard to make sure this never happens to anyone again,"" he said.

Harris was a standout student-athlete at Catawba College, where he played soccer and made the dean's list. Provenza had just graduated in Esthetics from Dermacademy and was set to start her career at Datre Hair Co., according to her obituary.

In a Facebook post, Provenza's mother urged the public to reject hatred and honor the couple's lives with love.

""Remember them. Remember love. Remember justice, and the Lord's plan will prevail,"" she wrote. ""Hate will never bring them back. While my heart is broken, I pray for this world that we live in. Evil never wins, but love always will.""

It wasn't surprising to learn that there was more to the story of the 5-year-old detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Minneapolis last week than met the eye. The heartrending picture of the frightened boy in his winter hat being led into a dark vehicle by a masked officer sparked a visceral response. But as it happened, the boy was alone in a vehicle because his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, fled on foot upon seeing the officers. And when the officer attempted to return the boy to his home, his mother and whomever else was inside refused to open the door. Only then was he led by the hand to the vehicle.

Predictably, the evocative image went viral on social media, along with false context spread by liberal journalists that the child was being used as “bait” for the parents. No evidence has surfaced to contradict DHS‘s version of events, not that it matters to President Donald Trump‘s opponents in the press. The young boy's terrified face made for a perfect propaganda tool, and they wielded it with glee behind crocodile tears.

The incident was a flashing red warning for an agency that is losing the war for hearts and minds. Images matter, in this media environment more than ever. Yet so far in Trump's second term, ICE's attempts to clean up the mess from Joe Biden's calamitous open-border policy have been marred by sloppy optics and amateurish messaging. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem‘s brash, cowgirl attire and hard-line rhetoric frequently scares off normal voters who might otherwise be sympathetic to the cause of cleaning up the streets. And ICE's communications staff habitually shares weird and dark memes on social media, the kind that lend credence to Democrats' characterizations of the agency.

Saturday's shooting of left-wing agitator Alex Pretti in Minneapolis and Noem's response epitomized the agency's recent problems. Multiple videos show that Pretti appears to have been another progressive agitator with a cell phone camera. A scuffle occurred between a different officer and protester pairing, and Pretti lunged forward in the action. Four officers proceeded to detain him face down on the ground as Pretti resisted. At one point, an officer appears to disarm Pretti of the pistol he'd been legally carrying. Moments later, for reasons that remain unclear, a Border Patrol agent drew his gun at Pretti as the other officers held him down, and fired multiple times, sending his body instantly limp.

As with the shooting of activist Renee Good two weeks earlier, the chaotic scene will take some time to parse out. Did the one officer who shouted “gun” trigger the shot, even though Pretti had already been disarmed?

But having viewed multiple videos of the Pretti shooting multiple times, it's difficult, if not impossible, to justify the shooting morally. Legally, perhaps, but only because the legal standard for a law enforcement officer is so low and highly subjective — for a shooting to be lawful, an officer needs only to have a reasonable perception of an imminent threat of deadly force. Pretti was being held down by four muscular men and had been disarmed. The court of law may acquit the officer, but the court of public opinion will almost certainly convict him along with the broader effort to carry out sweeping and often reckless deportation operations.

True to form, Noem sealed the agency's PR catastrophe at a press conference hours later by labeling Pretti a “domestic terrorist.”

“Fearing for his life and the lives of those around him, the agent fired defensive shots,” Noem told reporters. “This looks like a situation where an individual arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement.” 

Not to be outdone, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller took a similarly extreme position in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, posting on X, “A would-be assassin tried to murder federal law enforcement and the official Democrat account sides with the terrorists.”

Of course, more information will surface in the coming hours and days that will shed light on why the agent opened fire. But no one who has seen the videos believes that Pretti was a “would-be assassin” who intended to “inflict maximum damage.” Certainly not while he was being held down on the concrete by four much larger ICE agents.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","European leaders insist ‘shifting international order' is inevitable while holding out hope instability will pass","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/world/4430267/european-leaders-shifting-international-order-inevitable/","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 12:00:00 GMT","

European leaders are beginning to believe their continent is the last advocate for a world that isn't governed with a sense of might-makes-right.

Between the Russian invasion of Ukraine, U.S. demands for sovereignty over Greenland, and other geopolitical upheavals to global norms, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is lamenting it all as a “shift in the international order” that is both “seismic” and “permanent.” 

“In essence, the post-war international order … was based on the major powers' respect, at least formally, for the rules of international law,” Nicolas Tenzer, a professor at the Paris School of International Affairs and senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, told the Washington Examiner. “Even if it covered up some rotten fruit, the idea that democracy had to be defended and spread throughout the world was a project shared by the allies on both sides of the Atlantic.”

Now, the Old Continent seems to be in agreement that its diplomatic posture will need to change drastically — learning to assert itself with confidence and solidarity in the face of a “world defined by raw power.”

“Adapting to the shifting world order should in no way mean forgoing our principles,” one European official told the Washington Examiner. “It means defending our sovereignty, our independence, and our values with greater assertiveness, strength, and determination than ever.”

This new attitude was on full display at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week — a summit that, for many attending leaders, felt more like a funeral for how geopolitics used to be.

Heading into the conference, President Donald Trump had intensified his demands that Denmark give up its sovereignty over Greenland — ostensibly for the purpose of upgrading security infrastructure on the island.

For many, this demand, following a year that brought weaponized tariffs, mercurial attitudes toward defending Ukraine, and the abduction of a sitting world leader, proved to be the breaking point.

“Until now, we tried to appease the new president in the White House,” Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever told the crowd in Davos. “We were very lenient, also with the tariffs, we were lenient, hoping to get his support for the Ukraine war. “We were in a very bad position at the moment; we were dependent on the United States, so we chose to be lenient, but now so many red lines are being crossed that you have the choice between your self-respect.”

The Belgian leader characterized Europe as a continent forced to reject transitioning from the status of “happy vassal” to “miserable slave.”

“Every day we're reminded that we live in an era of great-power rivalry,” Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada told the audience. “That the rules-based order is fading. That the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must.”

Canada, the northern neighbor of the U.S., has suffered perhaps the most explicit threats of annexation from the White House. Trump has repeatedly alluded to making the country America's “51st state,” spurring Canada to consciously align itself with its European allies.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned that the “new world of great powers” is “not a cozy place,” but that Europeans “do not have to accept this new reality as fate.”

“We are not at the mercy of this new world order,” Merz said. “We do have a choice. We can shape the future. To succeed, we must face harsh realities and chart our course with clear-eyed realism.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the leader of a war-torn nation desperately seeking refuge within the ranks of the European Union, offered a rebuke of the continent's ineffectual posture.

“Instead of becoming a truly global power, Europe remains a beautiful but fragmented kaleidoscope of small and middle powers,” Zelensky, who is generally prone to flattery and thankfulness, said Thursday. “Instead of taking the lead in defending freedom worldwide — especially when America's focus shifts elsewhere — Europe looks lost, trying to convince the U.S. president to change. But he will not change.”

Meanwhile, Trump has continued to expand his transnational ambitions unhindered, hosting a slew of world leaders for a signing ceremony that cemented his “Board of Peace,” which will oversee the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip. Trump will hold autocratic executive authority on the board, which has been embraced by a slew of Eastern European and Middle Eastern states but largely ignored by Western Europeans.

In these unilateral actions by the U.S., Europe sees concerning parallels to the actions of its preeminent rivals.

“Who are the powers targeted by Ursula von der Leyen and other European leaders? Let's be clear: it is primarily Russia and China, not the United States,” Tenzer told the Washington Examiner. “The fear is therefore less that the United States will attack us — that would be stupid — than the fact that there is an ideological alignment between these three powers and an indifference, perhaps hostility, on the part of the United States towards the European model of democracy.”

But for all the talk of shattered friendships and inescapable upheavals, Europe seems at least to be leaving the door open for the U.S. to correct course.

Not long after Trump spoke at the Davos summit — a bellicose speech that included explicit jabs at many of the world leaders in attendance, including Carney and French President Emmanuel Macron — an unexpected breakthrough was announced.

American, Danish, Greenlandic, and NATO officials agreed to begin negotiations on the future of Greenland that would be mutually satisfactory for all parties. Trump is seeking assurances that U.S. military actions on the island are legally unrestricted and will never expire. Europe just wants to keep Greenland under Danish control.

Virtually zero concrete details about these negotiations have been announced, but all sides are celebrating their mere existence as a victory.

“We will have everything we want. We're getting everything we want at no cost,” Trump told Fox Business on Thursday. “I'm not going to have to pay anything. We're going to have total access to Greenland. We'll have all the military access that we want.”

Meanwhile, Macron touched down in Brussels and told the press that the negotiations show that “Europe can make itself be respected.”

“When we use the tools that we have at our disposal, we get respect, and that's what happened this week,” the French president said.

Macron was arriving in Belgium for an emergency summit planned before the Davos breakthrough, a meeting intended to discuss coercive mechanisms that would punish the U.S. for its Greenland ambitions.

With negotiations underway, focus shifted to normalizing trans-Atlantic trade, a priority disrupted by the dispute.

Regardless of the outcome in Greenland negotiations and the finalization of the trade deal, European leaders have made clear that they remain skeptical of Trump's insistence that “the United States cares greatly about the people of Europe — we really do.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Yes, It's Fascism","https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/america-fascism-trump-maga-ice/685751/","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 14:39:07 GMT","

Until recently, I thought it a term best avoided. But now, the resemblances are too many and too strong to deny.

Until recently, I resisted using the F-word to describe President Trump. For one thing, there were too many elements of classical fascism that didn't seem to fit. For another, the term has been overused to the point of meaninglessness, especially by left-leaning types who call you a fascist if you oppose abortion or affirmative action. For yet another, the term is hazily defined, even by its adherents. From the beginning, fascism has been an incoherent doctrine, and even today scholars can't agree on its definition. Italy's original version differed from Germany's, which differed from Spain's, which differed from Japan's.

I accepted President Biden's characterization of the MAGA movement as “semi-fascist” because some parallels were glaringly apparent. Trump was definitely an authoritarian, and unquestionably a patrimonialist. Beyond that, though, the best description seemed to be a psychological one propounded by John Bolton, Trump's first-term national security adviser: “He listens to Putin, he listens to Xi, he listens to how they talk about governing unburdened by uncooperative legislatures, unconcerned with what the judiciary may do, and he thinks to himself, Why can't I do that? This doesn't amount to being a fascist, in my view, [or] having a theory of how you want to govern. It's just Why can't I have the same fun they have?”

Writing a year ago, I argued that Trump's governing regime is a version of patrimonialism, in which the state is treated as the personal property and family business of the leader. That is still true. But, as I also noted then, patrimonialism is a style of governing, not a formal ideology or system. It can be layered atop all kinds of organizational structures, including not just national governments but also urban political machines such as Tammany Hall, criminal gangs such as the Mafia, and even religious cults. Because its only firm principle is personal loyalty to the boss, it has no specific agenda. Fascism, in contrast, is ideological, aggressive, and, at least in its early stages, revolutionary. It seeks to dominate politics, to crush resistance, and to rewrite the social contract.

Over Trump's past year, what originally looked like an effort to make the government his personal plaything has drifted distinctly toward doctrinal and operational fascism. Trump's appetite for lebensraum, his claim of unlimited power, his support for the global far right, his politicization of the justice system, his deployment of performative brutality, his ostentatious violation of rights, his creation of a national paramilitary police—all of those developments bespeak something more purposeful and sinister than run-of-the-mill greed or gangsterism.

When the facts change, I change my mind. Recent events have brought Trump's governing style into sharper focus. Fascist best describes it, and reluctance to use the term has now become perverse. That is not because of any one or two things he and his administration have done but because of the totality. Fascism is not a territory with clearly marked boundaries but a constellation of characteristics. When you view the stars together, the constellation plainly appears.

Demolition of norms. From the beginning of his first presidential run in 2015, Trump deliberately crashed through every boundary of civility; he mocked Senator John McCain's war heroism, mocked fellow candidate Carly Fiorina's face, seemingly mocked the Fox News host Megan Kelly's menstruation, slurred immigrants, and much more. Today he still does it, recently making an obscene gesture to a factory worker and calling a journalist “piggy.” This is a feature of the fascist governing style, not a bug. Fascists know that what the American Founders called the “republican virtues” impede their political agenda, and so they gleefully trash liberal pieties such as reason and reasonableness, civility and civic spirit, toleration and forbearance. By mocking decency and saying the unsayable, they open the way for what William Galston has called the “dark passions” of fear, resentment, and especially domination—the kind of politics that shifts the public discourse to ground on which liberals cannot compete.

Glorification of violence. Every state uses violence to enforce its laws, but liberal states use it reluctantly, whereas fascism embraces and flaunts it. Trump thus praises a violent mob; endorses torture; muses fondly about punching, body-slamming, and shooting protesters and journalists; and reportedly suggests shooting protesters and migrants. His recruitment ads for ICE glamorize military-style raids of homes and neighborhoods; his propaganda takes childish delight in the killing of civilians; and we have all seen videos of agents dragging people out of cars and homes—partly because the government films them. Like the demolition of civic decency, the valorization of violence is not incidental to fascism; it is part and parcel.

Might is right. Also characteristic of fascism is what George Orwell called “bully-worship”: the principle that, as Thucydides famously put it, “the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.” This view came across in Trump's notorious Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump showed open contempt for what he regarded as Ukraine's weakness; it came across explicitly, and chillingly, when Stephen Miller, the president's most powerful aide, told CNN's Jack Tapper: “We live in a world, in the real world, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world that have existed since the beginning of time.” Those words, though alien to the traditions of American and Christian morality, could have come from the lips of any fascist dictator.

Politicized law enforcement. Liberals follow the law whether they like it or not; fascists, only when they like it. Nazism featured a “dual state,” where, at any moment, the protections of ordinary law could cease to apply. Trump makes no secret of despising due process of law; he has demanded countless times that his opponents be jailed (“Lock her up!” chants, with his endorsement, were a prominent feature of his 2016 campaign), and he has suggested the Constitution's “termination” and said “I don't know” when asked if he is required to uphold it. His single most dangerous second-term innovation is the repurposing of federal law enforcement to persecute his enemies (and shield his friends). No prior president has produced anything like Trump's direct and public order for the Justice Department to investigate two former officials, or like his blatantly retaliatory prosecutions of James Comey and Letitia James. “At least 470 people, organizations and institutions have been targeted for retribution since Trump took office—an average of more than one a day,” Reuters reported in November (and today one can add others to the list, beginning with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell). Had Trump done nothing else, his demolition of independent and apolitical law enforcement would still have moved the U.S. government closer than ever before to a fascistic model.

Dehumanization. Fascism draws its legitimacy from its claims of defending the people from enemies who are animals, criminals, brutes. Trump characterizes (for instance) political opponents as “vermin” and immigrants as “garbage” who are “poisoning the blood of our country” (language straight out of the Third Reich). Vice President Vance, as a senator, endorsed a book called Unhumans (a title that refers to the left). And who can forget his false claim that Haitians abduct and eat pet cats and dogs?

Police-state tactics. Trump has turned ICE into a sprawling paramilitary that roves the country at will, searches and detains noncitizens and citizens without warrants, uses force ostentatiously, operates behind masks, receives skimpy training, lies about its activities, and has been told that it enjoys “absolute immunity.” He more than doubled the agency's size in 2025, and its budget is now larger than those of all other federal law-enforcement agencies combined, and larger than the entire military budgets of all but 15 countries. “This is going to affect every community, every city,” the Cato Institute scholar David Bier recently observed. “Really almost everyone in our country is going to come in contact with this, one way or the other.” In Minneapolis and elsewhere, the agency has behaved provocatively, sometimes brutally, and arguably illegally—behaviors that Trump and his staff have encouraged, shielded, and sent camera crews to publicize, perhaps in the hope of eliciting violent resistance that would justify further crackdowns, a standard fascist stratagem. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's recent appearance with a sign reading One of ours, all of yours seemed to nod toward another fascist standby, collective punishment—as did the administration's decision to flood Minneapolis with thousands of officers after residents there began protesting federal tactics, a prioritization that was explicitly retributive.

Undermining elections. Trump's recent musing that there should be no 2026 election may or may not have been jocular (as the White House has maintained), but he and his MAGA supporters believe they never lose an election, period. They went to great lengths to overturn the 2020 election, as the prosecutor Jack Smith's indictment of Trump and subsequent report detail ad nauseam. Rigging, stealing, or outright canceling elections is, of course, job one for fascists. Although Trump is term-limited, we must not expect that he and his MAGA loyalists will voluntarily turn over the White House to a Democrat in 2029, regardless of what the voters say—and the second insurrection will be far better organized than the first.

What's private is public. Classical fascism rejects the fundamental liberal distinction between the government and the private sector, per Mussolini's dictum: “No individuals or groups outside the State.” Among Trump's most audacious (if only intermittently successful) initiatives are his efforts to commandeer private entities, including law firms, universities, and corporations. One of his first acts as president last year was to brazenly defy a newly enacted law by taking the ownership of TikTok into his own hands. Bolton understood this mentality when he said, “He can't tell the difference between his own personal interest and the national interest, if he even understands what the national interest is.”

Attacks on news media. Shortly after taking office in 2017, Trump denounced the news media as “the enemy of the American people,” a phrase familiar from dictatorships abroad. His hostility never relented, but in his second term, it has reached new heights. Trump has threatened broadcast licenses, abused his regulatory authority, manipulated ownership deals, filed exorbitant lawsuits, played favorites with journalistic access, searched a reporter's home, and vilified news outlets and journalists. Although Trump cannot dominate news media in the United States in the way that Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has done in Hungary, he is running the Orbán playbook. No other president, not even Richard Nixon (no friend of the media), has used such blatantly illiberal tactics against the press.

Territorial and military aggression. One reason I held out against identifying Trumpism with fascism in his first term was Trump's apparent lack of interest in aggression against other states; if anything, he had seemed shy about using force abroad. Well, that was then. In his second term, he has used military force promiscuously. Of course, many presidents have deployed force, but Trump's explicitly predatory use of it to grab Venezuela's oil and his gangster-style threat to take Greenland from Denmark “the easy way” or “the hard way” were 1930s-style authoritarian moves. The same goes for his contempt for international law, binding alliances, and transnational organizations such as the European Union—all of which impede the state's unconstrained exercise of its will, a central fascist tenet. (Mussolini: “Equally foreign to the spirit of Fascism … are all internationalistic or League superstructures which, as history shows, crumble to the ground whenever the heart of nations is deeply stirred by sentimental, idealistic or practical considerations.”)

Sally Jenkins: What Leni Riefenstahl's work reveals about fascism

Transnational reach. Like authoritarians generally, fascists love company; the world is safer for them if there are more of them. In his second term, Trump has broken with long-standing U.S. policy by dialing back support for human rights while praising and supporting authoritarian populists and illiberal nationalists in Serbia, Poland, Hungary, Germany, Turkey, El Salvador, and Slovakia, among other places—and by being weirdly deferential to the strongman Russian President Vladimir Putin. Even more striking is his de facto alignment against America's liberal allies and their parties in Europe, which he holds in contempt.

Blood-and-soil nationalism. A fascist trademark is its insistence that the country is not just a collection of individuals but a people, a Volk: a mystically defined and ethnically pure group bound together by shared blood, culture, and destiny. In keeping with that idea, Trump has repudiated birthright citizenship, and Vance has called to “redefine the meaning of American citizenship in the 21st century” so that priority goes to Americans with longer historical ties: “the people whose ancestors fought in the Civil War,” as he put it, or people whom others on the MAGA right call “heritage Americans.” In other words, some Americans are more volkish than others.

White and Christian nationalism. While Vance, Trump, and MAGA do not propound an explicit ideology of racial hierarchy, they make no secret of pining for a whiter, more Christian America. Trump has found many ways to communicate this: for example, by making clear his disdain for “shithole” countries and his preference for white Christian immigrants; by pointedly accepting white South Africans as political refugees (while closing the door to most other asylum seekers); by renaming military bases to share the names of Confederate generals (after Congress ordered their names removed); by saying that civil-rights laws led to whites' being “very badly treated.” In his National Security Strategy, he castigates Europe for allowing immigration to undermine “civilizational self-confidence” and proclaims, “We want Europe to remain European,” a rallying cry of white Christian nationalists across the continent. Taking his cue, the Department of Homeland Security has propagated unashamedly white-nationalist themes, and national parks and museums have scrubbed their exhibits of references to slavery.

Mobs and street thugs. The use of militias and mobs to harass, rough up, and otherwise intimidate opponents is a standard fascist stratagem (the textbook example being Hitler's Kristallnacht pogrom in 1938). As few will need reminding, the Trump-MAGA parallel is the mob and militia violence against the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. Trump knowingly laid groundwork for this operation, calling on militia forces to “stand back and stand by” in September 2020 and later dog-whistling “Be there, will be wild!” to his supporters. His pardon of all of the Capitol attackers—more than 1,500, including the most violent—only proved what we knew, which is that they had his blessing. While Trump has found state violence adequate to his purposes so far in his second term, street violence is self-evidently in his repertoire.

Leader aggrandizement. Since 2016, when he declared that “I alone can fix it” and bragged that his supporters would remain loyal if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue, Trump has cultivated a personality cult. Although some of his efforts at self-aggrandizement can seem comical (the gilding of the Oval Office, the renaming of the Kennedy Center, the proposed triumphal arch), he understands the centrality of leader worship in a fascist-style regime. In sharp contradistinction to the American presidential tradition since George Washington, he makes no pretense of serving the people or the Constitution. His mindset, his symbolism, and his rhetoric all underscore the point he made to The New York Times this month: his own mind and morality are the only limits on his global power. This is Fascism 101.

Alternative facts. As Orwell, Hannah Arendt, and practically every other scholar of authoritarianism have emphasized, creating a reality-distortion field is the first thing a fascistic government will do, the better to drive its own twisted narrative, confuse the citizenry, demoralize political opponents, and justify every manner of corruption and abuse. While other presidents (including some good ones) have lied, none have come close to Trump's deployment of Russian-style mass disinformation, as I detail in my book The Constitution of Knowledge. From the start of his first term, Trump has made “alternative facts” a hallmark of his governing style, issuing lies, exaggerations, and half-truths at a rate of 20 a day. Predictably, his second term has brought more of the same. Following his lead, a MAGA-fied postmodern right gleefully trashes objectivity as elitism and truth as a mask for power.

Maria Ressa: Fight fascism before it's too late

Politics as war. A distinctive mark of fascism is its conception of politics, best captured by Carl Schmitt, an early-20th-century German political theorist whose doctrines legitimized Nazism. Schmitt rejected the Madisonian view of politics as a social negotiation in which different factions, interests, and ideology come to agreement, the core idea of our Constitution. Rather, he saw politics as a state of war between enemies, neither of which can understand the other and both of which feel existentially threatened—and only one of which can win. The aim of Schmittian politics is not to share the country but to dominate or destroy the other side. This conception has been evident in MAGA politics since Michael Anton (now a Trump-administration official) published his famous article arguing that the 2016 election was a life-and-death battle to save the country from the left (a “Flight 93” election: “charge the cockpit or you die”). In the speech given by Stephen Miller at Charlie Kirk's memorial service, MAGA's embrace of Schmittian totalism found its apotheosis: “We are the storm. And our enemies cannot comprehend our strength, our determination, our resolve, our passion … You are nothing. You are wickedness.”

Governing as revolution. Although born in revolution, the American liberal tradition, especially its conservative branch, prizes continuity, stability, and incremental change guided by reason. Fascism, by contrast, “is not reactionary but revolutionary,” as Mussolini insisted. It seeks to uproot and replace the old order and embraces bold, exhilarating action unshackled to rational deliberation. MAGA embraces its own revolutionary ethos, what Russell Vought, the administration's Office of Management and Budget director and probably its most formidable intellect, has called “radical constitutionalism,” a doctrine that would vitiate many checks on presidential power. In pursuit of this vision, Vought told Tucker Carlson in a November 2024 interview, “The president has to move executively as fast and as aggressively as possible, with a radical constitutional perspective, to be able to dismantle that [federal] bureaucracy and their power centers” because “the bureaucracies hate the American people.” He predicted, “If you have a radical constitutionalism, it's going to be destabilizing … But it's also exhilarating.” He said he would put federal agencies “in trauma,” an idea echoed by Christopher Rufo, an architect of Trump's attack on universities, which Rufo described as a “counterrevolution blueprint” to put universities “in an existential terror.” As Trump shuttered a congressionally mandated agency, renamed an international body of water, arrested an op-ed writer, deported immigrants to a foreign gulag, terrorized American cities, threatened an ally, and more, he showed how it looks when a radicalized state abandons rational deliberation and goes to war against itself.

One can object that there are elements of classical European fascism that are not found in Trumpism (mass rallies and public rituals, for example)—or that there are additional elements of Trumpism that belong on the list (MAGA's hypermasculinity, misogyny, and co-option of Christianity all resemble fascist patterns). The exercise of comparing fascism's various forms is not precise. If historians object that Trump is not a copy of Mussolini or Hitler or Franco, the reply is yes—but so what? Trump is building something new on old principles. He is showing us in real time what 21st-century American fascism looks like.

If, however, Trump is a fascist president, that does not mean that America is a fascist country. The courts, the states, and the media remain independent of him, and his efforts to browbeat them will likely fail. He may lose his grip on Congress in November. He has not succeeded in molding public opinion, except against himself. He has outrun the mandate of his voters, his coalition is fracturing, and he has neglected tools that allow presidents to make enduring change. He and his party may defy the Constitution, but they cannot rewrite it, thank goodness.

So the United States, once the world's exemplary liberal democracy, is now a hybrid state combining a fascist leader and a liberal Constitution; but no, it has not fallen to fascism. And it will not.

In which case, is there any point in calling Trump a fascist, even if true? Doesn't that alienate his voters? Wouldn't it be better just to describe his actions without labeling him controversially?

Until recently, I thought so. No longer. The resemblances are too many and too strong to deny. Americans who support liberal democracy need to recognize what we're dealing with in order to cope with it, and to recognize something, one must name it. Trump has revealed himself, and we must name what we see.

The growl of a V8 engine — a deep, throaty roar that swells when a driver stomps the gas pedal — had for years been fading from auto assembly floors.

No longer.

The American automotive landscape is changing after a period that saw tighter emissions rules push automakers toward more efficient, quieter powertrains and prompted shifts away from big V8 engines.

But many of those regulations, including the federal EV incentives, have fallen away, leading automakers that once promised to discontinue the gas-hungry engines to reinvest in V8 offerings — especially in full-size trucks and performance cars.

The shift isn't a wholesale retreat from electrification, but it is a clear signal that legacy engines still matter, especially when profits are on the line.

Many auto enthusiasts are applauding the V8 revival.

""What makes V8s superior is the instant response when you hit the gas pedal,"" Justin Goldsberry, an enthusiast and author of the Automobile Innovations newsletter, told Business Insider. ""Everything is immediate and highly responsive.""

Over the past year, nearly every major American automaker has announced new investments or product updates tied to V8 engines. The industry's biggest bets centered on trucks and high-performance vehicles.

Big, powerful cars and trucks have long been Detroit's best profit-makers. Many are now seeing a resurgence thanks to the renewed investments.

Ram Trucks brought back its Hemi V8 engine in August after pulling it from parts of its lineup just last year. This month, it relaunched the TRX, a V8-powered sport-oriented pickup the company markets as an automotive ""apex predator.""

Last May, General Motors stopped producing electric-vehicle batteries at its Western New York propulsion plant and restarted V8 engine production for trucks instead — a shift that required an $888 million investment.

Ford is also leaning into performance. The company told Business Insider it plans to add a new, faster trim to its V8-powered Mustang Dark Horse lineup, called the SC.

""You're starting to see some more performance V8s come back,"" Kevin Roberts, the director of market intelligence at CarGurus, told Business Insider. ""Consumers wanted these cars. It was just a challenging economic choice because of the regulations that previously existed. But there are different rules now.""

Data suggests demand for big, gas-powered vehicles — particularly trucks — remains strong. According to Cox Automotive, US consumers spent about $15 billion on full-size pickup trucks in December alone.

To Roberts, that appetite reflects a long-running truth about the American auto market: even as efficiency improves and electrification expands, the industry continues to rely on high-margin vehicles with internal-combustion engines to bankroll its transition.

V8s are essential to American car-making culture.

First developed for US consumers in the early 1900s by Cadillac, V8s became synonymous with postwar expansion, cheap gasoline, and a domestic auto industry built around size and power. Ford helped popularize the engine in the 1930s, offering dramatic horsepower gains over smaller powertrains.

That popularity launched generations of American nostalgia.

""What customers actually want is more horsepower and more torque,"" said Dave Mann, a classic Ford Bronco owner and the president of motor oil company Performance Oil Technology. ""That's where the money is, and that's the bread and butter for American automakers.""

But the sales dominance didn't last forever.

As fuel prices surged and emissions rules tightened in the 1970s and 1980s, consumer preferences shifted. Smaller, more efficient vehicles — many built by Japanese automakers like Toyota and Honda — surged in popularity. By the early 2000s, V8 engines, which had once powered more than half of all American vehicle sales, accounted for less than 20%.

But the engine never disappeared. They just powered the auto industry's full-size and heavy duty trucks and hyper-powered racers.

Big trucks — including the best-selling Ford F-150 and second-best-selling Chevy Silverado — still remain wildly popular.

And while the V8 is getting newfound attention from automakers, it's not the only shift happening in the industry.

A new wave of sub-$50,000 EVs are on the horizon, which will test Americans' appetite for EVs now that the $7,500 EV incentive is no more. 

Meanwhile, gas-saving mild-hybrids are gaining popularity. The system pairs an electric motor with a standard gas-burning engine to reduce the amount of fuel needed on a trip.

That set-up is gaining more popularity, too. According to CarGurus data shared with Business Insider, hybrid sales jumped more than 41% in December compared to the same month the year before. Gas-only car sales rose a modest 1.4%.

""We've seen a large increase in hybrids,"" he said. ""The US is starting to shake some of its gas-guzzler mindset.""

More than 850,000 customers in the U.S. as far west as New Mexico were without electricity ‍and over 10,000 flights were canceled on ‍Sunday during a monster winter storm ‍that paralyzed eastern and southern states with heavy snow and ice.

As snow, freezing rain and dangerously frigid temperatures swept into the eastern two-thirds of the nation on Sunday, the number of power outages continued to rise. As of 10:47 a.m. EST (1547 GMT) on Sunday, more than 850,000 U.S. ‌customers ‌were without electricity, according to PowerOutage.us, with at least 290,000 in Tennessee and ​over 100,000 each in Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana. Other states affected included Kentucky, Georgia, Virginia and Alabama.

More than 10,200 U.S. flights scheduled for Sunday were canceled, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Over 4,000 flights were canceled on Saturday.

Washington, D.C.'s Ronald Reagan National Airport said airlines had canceled all flights at the airport on Sunday.

Delta Air ⁠Lines on Sunday said that it intended to operate on a reduced schedule ""subject to real-time frozen precipitation and afternoon storm conditions.""

The airline had adjusted its schedule on Saturday, with additional cancellations in the morning for Atlanta and along the East Coast, including in Boston and New York City, and said it would move experts from cold-weather hubs to support de-icing and baggage teams at several southern airports.

The National Weather Service's latest forecast for Sunday through Monday morning calls for heavy snow from the Ohio Valley to the Northeast, including up to 18 inches in New England. Much of the Southeast and parts of the Mid-Atlantic are expected to get rain and freezing rain.

Forecasters predicted ""bitterly cold temperatures and dangerously cold wind chills"" from the southern plains to the Northeast in the wake of the storm, bringing ""prolonged hazardous travel and infrastructure impacts.""

Calling the storms ""historic,"" President Donald Trump on Saturday approved federal emergency disaster declarations in South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Indiana, and West Virginia.

""We will continue to monitor, and stay in touch with all States in the path of this storm. Stay Safe, and Stay ‍Warm,"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.

Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have declared weather emergencies, the Department ‌of Homeland Security said. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, at a news conference on Saturday, warned Americans to take precautions.

""It's ⁠going to be very, very cold,"" Noem said. ""So we'd encourage everybody to stock up on fuel, stock up on food, and we will get through this together.""

The Department of Energy on Saturday issued an ‍emergency order authorizing the Electric Reliability Council of Texas to deploy backup generation resources at data centers and other major facilities, aiming to limit blackouts in the state.

On Sunday, the DOE issued an emergency order to authorize grid operator PJM Interconnection to run ""specified resources"" in the mid-Atlantic region, regardless of limits due to state laws or environmental permits. U.S. electric grid operators on Saturday stepped up precautions to avoid rotating blackouts.

Dominion Energy, whose Virginia operations include the largest collection of data centers in the world, said if its ice forecast held, ⁠the winter event could be among the largest ‌to affect the company.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","From Bill Gates to Emmanuel Macron: How the world's most powerful people communicate and exert influence","https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/25/how-worlds-most-powerful-people-communicate-influence.html","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 11:20:50 GMT","



Every January, the world's most powerful people gather on the snowy peaks of Davos to talk about the most pressing global issues, and it's a masterclass in the art of communication and influence. 

The World Economic Forum's flagship conference took place between 19-23 January, and leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump, billionaire Bill Gates and Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang delivered speeches and spoke on panels. 

This year's theme was ""A Spirit of Dialogue,"" as geopolitical uncertainty and international trade tensions dominated conversations. 

Among the most important topics was Trump's insistence on taking ownership of the Arctic territory of Greenland, as well as the impact of artificial intelligence on the labor market. 

The responses of national leaders and CEOs were broadcast live, then distilled into 10-second soundbites and TikTok fan edits, consumed globally, and inviting instant critique.

René Carayol, a leadership coach to Fortune 500 and FTSE 100 executives and world leaders, broke down what the most effective communicators did at this year's World Economic Forum, in a conversation with CNBC. 

Carayol, who has worked with Nelson Mandela, former Russian president Mikhail Gorbachev, former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and many more, was frank about the key ingredients to powerful public speaking and communication. 

""The two big things that we always coach: it's the performance, not the content. Second thing, it's not what you say, it's the way that you say it. That's the most powerful thing. Stop trying to remember the words, learn the performance,"" Carayol said. 

French President Emmanuel Macron and Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney were ""two masterclasses"" in public speaking, leadership, and influence, according to Carayol. 

Macron gave a special address in Davos on Tuesday, and in a hard-hitting speech, he hit back at ""bullies"" after Trump renewed threats of tariffs against Europe, as well as 200% levies on French wine, which have since been dropped. 

The French leader warned of a world ""without rules"" as international law is being disregarded and called for global cooperation to address instability. This was all delivered with blue aviator-style sunglasses due to an eye infection, which Carayol said, lent a ""Tom Cruise"" feel to Macron's presentation. 

""He was like a Marvel superhero. He was stood up, forthright, as tall as he could be, and spoke out,"" Carayol said. 

His stance was ""upright, looking up, looking powerful,"" which exuded an aura of being ""unafraid, unapologetic, and gave all of Europe backbone."" 

Carney delivered a similar message to Macron's in his own speech at the WEF on Tuesday, where he said the world's ""middle powers"" must unite against coercion from the world's largest.

""Great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons. Tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited,"" Carney said.

Carayol said Carney's speech was ""brilliant"" and described him as calm, authoritative, measured, and studied. 

Carney's facial expression did much of the talking as he remained ""extremely serious and grave"" throughout his speech and didn't break a smile once. He also used intonation to create gravitas. 

""He was serious ... he wanted the world to know that they are not backing down against Trump without ever mentioning him,"" Carayol said. ""Macron was the one you'd go away with and remember, Carney was the one you'd respect."" 

While Trump is generally a great speaker, Carayol said he gave a rambling speech on Wednesday. 

""Trump was all over the show, off script, rambling, no real point, because he was doing his 'TACO.' Trump always chickens out when someone stands up to him,"" he said. ""He was a shriveled mess.""

However, Carayol noted that Trump is usually  ""brilliant"" and ""when he's on top form ... you won't agree with what he says, but the way he says it."" 

Carayol recalled the lead up to the U.S. Presidential elections in 2024: ""He's at his best when he's in a competitive environment. So when he was running for president, he slaughtered all the opposition.""

Business leaders may communicate differently from heads of state because CEOs must be more conscious of how their words affect their companies' stock prices, while world leaders can utilize stronger rhetoric, according to Andrew Brodsky, a management professor at the University of Texas and the author of ""PING: The Secrets of Successful Communication.""

""World leaders often have other communication tools at their disposal because they don't have to worry about a stock price,"" Brodsky told CNBC. ""Notably, world leaders use strategies like leveraging negative emotions, such as anger, and highlighting potential existential threats to their country's future to motivate their population.""

On the opposite end, if tech CEOs show a lot of ""negative emotion or dwell on the risks"" of technology like AI, then their company's stock price would likely be affected, or staff would lose trust in the company and leave. 

Instead, Brodsky highlighted that one of the best communication styles in leadership is using ""imagery, metaphors, and stories"" to share a vision with audiences. 

For example, when Satya Nadella discussed AI advancements at the WEF this week, he compared it to how transformational PCs were when they were first introduced and even noted that the impacts of AI are ""10x, 100x"" times that. 

""Rather than emphasize the technical elements, Nadella communicated his vision for the future of AI through using simple metaphors in a way anyone could understand,"" Brodsky said. 

Additionally, Jensen Huang was asked about whether AI would increase or decrease the number of jobs, and instead of using statistics, he told a story about how AI actually increased the number of jobs in the radiology industry. 

""Rather than relying on high-level cross-industry statistics, Huang was able to use a story about radiologists to show the positive impact of AI. By using a story, he was able to make what he was saying feel much more tangible and meaningful to the audience in a way that statistics by themselves simply can't,"" Brodsky said. 

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates also stood out during a panel, as he mostly maintained eye contact with the audience while being asked questions by interviewers and other panelists. 

""This seemingly small choice made it feel like Gates was speaking directly to the audience and bringing them into the conversation,"" Brodsky added.

Oops, something went wrong

Robert Kiyosaki, the author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad” and investment guru, is not bothered by the price volatility of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH). He maintains his stance of purchasing both cryptocurrencies irrespective of their price movements.

Kiyosaki recently displayed interest in Ethereum, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency. He holds the conviction that Bitcoin is set to reach a valuation of $1 million within the next few years or decade.

In a post on X, Kiyosaki revealed that he does not fret over the price trends of Bitcoin or Ethereum. He clarified that his investment strategy is influenced by the escalating national debt of the US and the diminishing purchasing power of the US dollar.

Q: Do I care when the price of gold silver or Bitcoin go up or down?A: No. I do not care.Q: Why Not?A: Because I know the national debt of the US keeps going up and the purchasing power of the US dollar keeps going down.Q: Why worry about the price of gold, silver,…

Kiyosaki also voiced his distrust in major financial institutions like the Federal Reserve and the US Treasury. He argued that these institutions are run by individuals who lack profound knowledge of the economy and money management.

Despite the instability of cryptocurrency prices, Kiyosaki persists in investing in physical gold, silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. He often underscores the historical significance of gold and silver as a medium of exchange and views Bitcoin as “digital gold”.

Why It Matters: Kiyosaki's indifference to the price volatility of Bitcoin and Ethereum underscores his belief in the long-term value of these cryptocurrencies.

His investment strategy, driven by concerns over the US national debt and the declining purchasing power of the dollar, reflects a broader trend among investors who are turning to cryptocurrencies as a hedge against inflation and economic instability.

His lack of faith in key financial institutions, coupled with his continued investment in cryptocurrencies, gold, and silver, suggests a shift in investment strategies towards assets that are not tied to traditional financial systems. This could potentially influence other investors to diversify their portfolios in a similar manner.

The move adds to Bhutan's growing list of blockchain projects. This time, the country will help run and secure a public blockchain rather than just build apps on top of one.

The Sei validator will be launched through a partnership between the Sei Development Foundation and Druk Holding and Investments, Bhutan's state-owned investment arm.

LATEST: 🇧🇹 Bhutan's sovereign wealth fund will deploy and operate a Sei validator through a partnership with the Sei Development Foundation, with the validator expected to go live this quarter. pic.twitter.com/MEkUWBFc85

— CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) January 21, 2026



Why Bhutan Is Running a Validator?

A validator is one of the core parts of a proof-of-stake blockchain. Validators check transactions, help keep the network secure, and take part in key network decisions.

By running a Sei validator, Bhutan becomes an active network participant. It is not outsourcing this role to private firms outside the country.



Officials at Druk Holding and Investments said the validator fits into Bhutan's wider digital goals. The country wants to explore how blockchain can support finance, data systems, and national innovation.

For readers new to crypto, this is similar to helping operate the internet itself, not just using websites built on it.

The Sei Development Foundation said the validator is only the starting point. Future work with Bhutan could focus on tokenization, digital payments, and new forms of digital identification.

These areas are gaining attention worldwide as governments look for faster and more transparent systems.

Sei said the partnership also expands its global validator network, which helps make the blockchain more decentralized and resilient.

Bhutan has been building crypto infrastructure for years, mostly out of the spotlight.

The country already uses blockchain for public services. Citizens can access government platforms through a self-managed digital identity system built on Ethereum.

Bhutan is also one of the largest holders of Bitcoin. Estimates suggest it holds over 11,000 BTC, worth more than $1 billion. Most of the Bitcoin came from state-backed mining operations powered by renewable energy.

Some of these holdings are expected to support long-term development projects, including the planned Gelephu Mindfulness City.

Bhutan is not alone. Large companies and institutions are also choosing to run blockchain validators.

Telecom firms, cloud providers, and financial groups are increasingly involved in network operations across different blockchains.

Bhutan's move shows how blockchain adoption is shifting. Governments are no longer just testing the technology. Some are now helping run it.

That change could shape how public blockchains grow in the years ahead.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","Fed rate decision: Why Jerome Powell's press conference is the real wildcard for markets","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/01/25/here-s-what-fed-s-highly-anticipated-rate-decision-this-week-means-for-bitcoin-and-the-dollar","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 17:25:22 GMT","

The Federal Reserve is set to announce its rate decision, and almost no one expects it to cut rates.

However, traders will be paying very close attention to Chairman Jerome Powell's post-meeting press conference, which could hold the real intrigue. 

His take on what to expect in the coming months and on recent hot topics, including President Donald Trump's affordability policy push and threats to the Fed's independence, could move both traditional and crypto markets.

Let's dig into what is priced in and how Powell's comments could move markets.

After delivering three back-to-back quarter-point cuts, the central bank is expected to stand pat on Wednesday. As of Friday, CME's FedWatch futures priced in a 96% chance of the Fed holding steady at 3.5%-3.75%.

This is consistent with the message Powell delivered in December, saying the bank's voting committee will hold off on additional cuts into 2026. Further, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who has a vote on the Federal Open Market Committee this year, recently told The New York Times that he believes it is ""way too soon"" to cut rates again.

So, unless the Fed springs an unexpected rate cut, which could tank the dollar while boosting bitcoin and stocks, the decision itself is shaping up to be a non-event.

However, the primary question for traders will be whether the impending pause in rate cuts signals a hawkish or dovish stance.

A hawkish pause scenario involves Powell flagging lingering inflation risks, denting rate-cut bets and pressuring risk assets lower. A dovish scenario would mean Wednesday's pause is temporary and rate cuts would resume in the coming months, potentially lifting bitcoin.

Morgan Stanley expects the Fed to send a dovish signal by retaining the policy statement wording ""considering the range and timing for further adjustments to the target range,"" signaling that easing remains on the table. The statement is expected to acknowledge the economy's robustness while preserving options for future rate cuts.

Watch for dissenters to the Fed's rate pause, as they could amplify a dovish tilt. Trump's appointee, Stephen Miran, is expected to dissent in favour of a bold 50-basis-point cut. If the number of dissenters grows, it would bolster the case for future easing, lifting stocks and bitcoin.

As of now, most observers, except JPMorgan, are expecting the Fed to cut rates once or twice over the rest of the year. JPMorgan sees no rate move this year, followed by a hike next year. 

Powell will likely face questions about the rationale for holding rates steady, as well as the potential impact of Trump's affordability measures and related issues on key macroeconomic variables.

According to ING, Powell's explanation of the status quo rate decision may lift the U.S. dollar, potentially weakening greenback-dominated assets like bitcoin.

""Given the recent performance of both U.S. asset markets and activity, he will struggle to argue that financial conditions are restrictive and need to be loosened. This could pour cold water on the notion of a second Fed rate cut and this would lift the dollar against the low yielders like the yen and the euro,"" ING analysts said.

""Instead, the next macro leg lower in the dollar will likely have to emerge from poor data rather than Fed-speak,"" they added.

Powell's potential nod to Trump's housing affordability efforts as being inherently inflationary in the near term might amplify market volatility.

Trump recently said he has instructed his representatives to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, claiming it will drive down rates and monthly payments. He also issued an executive order requiring large institutional investors to refrain from buying single-family homes that families could otherwise purchase.

Observers say these measures could front-load demand, boosting housing inflation.

""The purchase [of] USD200bn of mortgage-backed-securities risk pulling forward demand, inflating prices and skewing benefits toward incumbents. On the other hand, the impact of banning large institutional investors from buying single-family homes is likely to be limited, given small institutional ownership relative to the overall stock,"" Allianz Investment Management said in a note.

Note that Trump's tariffs are already baked in with a delayed inflationary impact expected this year, as higher import costs filter through to the final consumer.

Lastly, Powell might face questions about the DOJ investigation targeting him personally, which he calls political vengeance for not slashing rates fast enough to suit Trump, and about recent bond market volatility stemming from Japan's fiscal issues. He might dodge the probe while downplaying bond market fears.

America has never seen a moment in modern history like the federal occupation of Minneapolis. Thousands of masked federal officers with uncertain authority are rampaging through the region, assaulting protesters and innocent people, abusing constitutional safeguards, staking out daycares and schools, snatching people off the streets in unmarked vans based on the color of their skin or their accent, and recklessly, relentlessly provoking violent confrontations with civilians—all against the loud, repeated expressed wishes of local and state officials.

Saturday morning, federal agents—apparently from the Border Patrol—shot and killed a 37-year-old nurse, Alex Pretti, amid a chaotic scuffle in front of a well-known Minneapolis donut store after agents began hassling and shoving him in the street. It was the second time this month that federal agents had resorted to deadly force within mere seconds after initiating an encounter with a Minneapolis civilian who never posed a threat to agents.

All of this unnecessary violence raises the question: Why can't elected officials do more to stop ICE? Apart from the courts, doesn't Minnesota's government have cards it can play in the battle against the Trump-led occupation, like calling out the National Guard for a showdown with federal agents?

The answer, in its shortest form, is mostly no, due to the basic foundations of American federalism. Over and over, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota governor Tim Walz have asked President Donald Trump to call back his operation. On Saturday, they again told the public that they had pleaded with the federal government to reconsider and withdraw the upwards of 3,000 immigration officers, who together nearly outnumber the region's 10 largest state and local police departments combined.

But Walz and Frey haven't taken overt actions to use state and local governments to actively resist because a key part of federalism in the United States is that a state can't really resist federal authority or kick out federal law enforcement officials. That principle primarily exists because the federal government is meant to be the “protector” of last resort if local and state officials fail to uphold the rights of ordinary citizens. What's remarkable, and worrisome, is that Trump today is using that arrangement to punish political opponents based on his own whims, as un-American an action as any president has ever undertaken and one that threatens the very union of the United States.

Tension in Minnesota between the national and state and local elected officials is already sky high—and there's rising animus between the federal forces and local law enforcement as well.

Minneapolis police were quick to condemn the shootings of both Pretti and Renee Nicole Good, who was shot and killed by an ICE agent on January 7. They have also been vocal in recent days about how their own officers have been harassed and even assaulted by immigration agents while off-duty. (“Every one of [the off-duty officers stopped by immigration agents] is a person of color,” one police chief complained.) DHS agents tried to bar local police from the shooting scene on Saturday, forcing them to return with a court order, and this time FBI agents again apparently resisted allowing access. “We're in uncharted territory here,” the head of the state's investigation bureau said.

A governor also has the state's National Guard at their disposal, which could hypothetically be deployed to counter ICE's actions. Yesterday, Minnesota governor Tim Walz  announced that he activated them following the shooting, amid a tense series of hours that saw the NBA postpone its evening game in Minneapolis for safety reasons. In a statement whose banality and simplicity underplayed just how stunning it was, the governor's office said the guard was needed because “local law enforcement resources are stretched thin because of the disruption to public safety caused by thousands of federal immigration agents in our neighborhoods.” So far it seems like Walz's intent is to use the National Guard and local and state policy as more of a buffer between federal forces and Minnesota residents, rather than as a supplement to the street resistance efforts.

For now, state and local officials—like those who also suffered from heavy-handed immigration deployments last year, like Los Angeles, Chicago, and elsewhere—are primarily focused on using federal courts for relief. Overnight, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order to ensure that federal officials didn't destroy or alter evidence related to Saturday's shooting. More broadly, Minnesota has a pending lawsuit aimed at blocking the immigration deployments altogether.

This restraint is almost certainly intended to prevent even further escalation, driven by President Trump's apparent eagerness to declare Minnesota in a state of “insurrection” that would allow him to activate and deploy federal troops against its residents. Trump has already launched unprecedented criminal investigations against Walz and Frey, and others, in an apparent bid to create pretexts that could aid the use of the Insurrection Act.

The situation is so unprecedented—and the Trump administration's political incentives so skewed by social media and the president's own manias—that it's impossible to understand or predict how the coming days and weeks might unfold. It's especially unclear how state or local elected leaders might make the situation better for their constituents and neighbors—and, because of the Trump administration's lawlessness, there are many paths where the situation worsens.

President Trump and his Department of Homeland Security in many ways appear to be attempting to provoke an actual showdown between federal forces and local or state authorities. DHS and White House officials have repeatedly labeled protesters exercising their First Amendment rights in Minnesota “domestic terrorists” and were quick to smear the victim of Saturday's shooting; they shut down an investigation of the ICE officer who killed Renee Nicole Good earlier this month and ordered a federal investigation of Good and her spouse instead, leading to the resignation of the FBI agent assigned to the case; at least six federal prosecutors also resigned, refusing to participate in the attempt to scapegoat a victim.

In a deeply troubling development, ICE agents have started declaring that people who so much as record them are being entered into a national database as “domestic terrorists.” “Have fun with that,” an ICE officer in Maine was captured joking to a civilian filming him. (That the assault on Minneapolis has little to do with violent crime or immigration issues was underscored Saturday when attorney general Pam Bondi sent state officials a letter saying they'd withdraw the federal forces if Minnesota complied with a Trump request to turn over its voter rolls.)

While Walz and Frey's seeming passivity in the face of an all-out federal attack on their constituents is provoking anger among activists, it may be a case where caution and restraint is the better part of valor. Citizens are already generating massive resistance to the federal presence in Minnesota, and any additional “official” resistance by local or state officials may tip the scales for Trump and bring federal troops into the picture, an escalation that would be surely worse for residents, the state, and the nation at large. Trump has already put some 1,500 federal troops in Alaska on standby to deploy to Minnesota and all indications are that he's eager for an excuse to do so.

Any such declaration of “insurrection” or deployment of federal troops to further subdue local and state authorities would bring the country the closest it's been to civil war since, well, the actual Civil War.

Under normal circumstances, the use of federal military forces in domestic situations is highly proscribed and limited by two sets of law, the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878—which prohibits the use of the military in civilian law enforcement—and the Insurrection Act, a series of statutes that date to 1792 and outline when a president can call out troops to suppress rebellions and domestic violence.

Considering how critical a principle it guards, the Insurrection Act is badly antiquated, as recent reform efforts have shown. As national security legal scholar Scott Anderson wrote in 2024, “Few principles of American government are more foundational than the idea that the US military should not be used against Americans, except in the most dire of circumstances. But even fewer foundational principles are so loosely grounded in the law … The fact that past presidents have done so relatively rarely is more a product of longstanding political norms than hard legal limits.”

While state National Guard units and federal troops are routinely used to help respond to natural disasters at the request of and in coordination with local and state officials, since Reconstruction presidents have only reluctantly ever sent in federal agents or troops against the wishes of state governments. Even then, it's in highly limited circumstances, such as defending civil rights and freedoms in moments when state officials refused to do so. (National Guard units usually report to state governors, although they can be federalized by presidential order to report to the commander-in-chief instead—meaning that Trump could always circumvent Walz activating them by putting them under direct Pentagon control anyway.)

In fact, while National Guard troops were used repeatedly in the 20th century by governors and presidents to break labor strikes—often brutally—it wasn't until the Civil Rights movement and the 1960s that federal troops began to play a more routine role in responding to civil disturbances.

In 1957, when Arkansas governor Orval Faubus used the state's National Guard to block the integration of Little Rock Central High School, President Dwight Eisenhower responded by federalizing all 10,000 Arkansas National Guardsmen and deploying troops from the 101st Airborne Division to force the school's integration and protect the nine Black students attempting to enroll there. The mission was a key learning opportunity for the military, and when the Army manual on “Civil Disturbances” was republished in 1958, it had doubled in size and now contained a new section on riot control.

In every year of his short presidency, President John F. Kennedy deployed federal marshals or troops against the wishes of state officials as the civil rights movement gained momentum. In 1961, some 400 federal marshals were sent to Alabama to protect the Freedom Riders, and when James Meredith attempted to enroll as the first Black student at the University of Mississippi in 1962, Kennedy sent federal marshals who then faced incredibly violent white protesters.

With the marshals under attack, Kennedy deployed first the Mississippi National Guard and then thousands of federal troops as well. (That military operation, codenamed RAPID ROAD, was actually the first and only time during the Cold War that the military activated and used plans it had developed to quell civil disturbances in the wake of a nuclear attack.)

Then, in 1963, Kennedy again relied on the National Guard to help with the integration of the University of Alabama, and his successor, Lyndon Johnson, used marshals and the National Guard to protect civil rights marchers in Selma after Alabama state troopers infamously attacked them at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in an incident that came to be known as “Bloody Sunday.”

Presidents began using military troops, including the National Guard, more routinely in America's cities in the 1960s. During summer riots following police brutality in Detroit in 1967, President Johnson ordered elements of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions into the city and Michigan governor George Romney called up the Michigan National Guard; more than 40 people were killed, more than half by Detroit police. National Guard troops killed 11, including a four-year-old girl, Tanya Blanding, who died when a Michigan guardsman opened fire with a tank-mounted .50-caliber machine gun on her apartment after wrongly believing a sniper was inside.

While troops were used again amid the 1968 riots that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., the downside and risk of such deployments was vividly captured two years later at Kent State University when National Guard troops opened fire on students protesting the Vietnam War, killing four and wounding nine.

Over the years since there has been incredibly limited domestic use of federal troops—the Los Angeles riots of 1992 being one exception—and presidents and attorneys general until the Trump administration usually go out of their way to coordinate surges of federal law enforcement to cities or states.

Even during the peak of the marshals and troop deployments to the South amid the civil rights movement, presidents only acted after state officials either refused to quell violence targeting Americans practicing their constitutional rights or, in the case of the Alabama state troopers, were the cause of the violence against peaceful citizens themselves. Often, a president acted only after there was defiance on the ground of a lawful court order—ensuring that there was a second branch of government acting as a check-and-balance and trigger for such federal action.

While Trump has said that the immigration enforcement effort in Minneapolis—as with previous efforts in Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Chicago, Charlotte, Portland and, most recently, Maine—is meant to enforce “law and order,” there's no apparent rhyme, reason, or necessity to deployments beyond political terror.

Trump today is attempting something unprecedented that stands in contravention of all historical tradition in the United States: the brutal application of federal forces against a state and region with no apparent reason beyond it being led by members of the political opposition.

“Few principles of American government are more foundational than the idea that the US military should not be used against Americans, except in the most dire of circumstances.”

In deploying immigration officers and border security agents from DHS, rather than deputy US marshals from the Department of Justice—as presidents in the past have done—Trump is also changing the nature and tenor of his federal force. Marshals, whose work and training involves constitutional rights and protections, have always been used to protect civil rights and valid court orders and come with strong federal policing powers and authorities. The agents from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are different. They are not trained to normal federal law enforcement standards of dealing with the public and are meant to operate with severely limited authority to enforce immigration matters, not general federal laws. CBP agents in particular are less a regular law enforcement agency, grounded in due process, and more a paramilitary force meant to operate on the border regions. They were never intended to have regular contact with US citizens and civilians.

Trump has also attempted to use troops in similar crackdowns over the last year and been stymied by federal courts, who, among other instances, preliminarily blocked his federalization of the California National Guard.

Invoking the Insurrection Act might give Trump cover to circumvent such restrictions.

Today, the Insurrection Act has three potential triggers: one in cooperation with state officials and two against the wishes of state officials. Trump, DHS, and the Justice Department appear to be attempting to artificially manufacture some combination of actions that would allow them to declare Minnesota as representing “unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion” or beset by “insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy” that “so hinders the execution of the laws” that federal military reinforcements are necessary.

If Walz, Frey, and other state officials seem reluctant to do anything other than use words to oppose Trump, it's surely because they're wary of what unrest and conflict would come from giving Trump any excuse to declare an “insurrection”—and the precedent any court battle over the vague words of the Insurrection Act might end up creating.

As one reform effort recently concluded, “Under the Insurrection Act, a president's authority to deploy US troops turns on terms—including unlawful ‘combinations,' ‘obstructions,' and ‘assemblages'—that lack settled contemporary meaning.”

In the meantime, even as ICE and CBP's trail of violence continues, the residents of Minneapolis might find that they're on their own to face the full weight of Trump's masked secret police. But the spreading and growing resistance to the Trump administration shows that the protesters of Minnesota are hardly alone nationally. Their courage in the face of the federal assault is contagious. Hours after the shooting Saturday in Minneapolis, at a vigil and protest rally in Boston, a crowd assembled in chilly temperatures ahead of a historic weekend storm and chanted, “We're not cold, we're not afraid, Minny taught us to be brave!”

8/10

If you're comparing the photos of the Audeo Infinio Ultra Sphere—Phonak's most powerful hearing aid to date—to the product's name, you're not crazy: It's not the slightest bit round. Rather, it's a traditional, teardrop-shaped, behind-the-ear hearing aid that takes its name from Phonak's new Spheric Speech Clarity 2.0 system, designed to enhance the understandability of conversations in noisy conditions, no matter what direction the voices are coming from.

Yes, Phonak Audeo Infinio Ultra Sphere is indeed a mouthful. For this review, I'll call it the Ultra Sphere. The other new hearing aid system in the Infinio Ultra line, called the R, is available as a less advanced, cheaper model.

The big sell with the Sphere is that it includes not one processing chip but two. The new DeepSonic DNN (deep neural network) chip is responsible for multidirectional speech processing in noise. That's included on top of Phonak's older Era chip, which launched in 2024 and handles core audio processing and wireless functions. Are two chips better than one for hearing clearly? I wore the Ultra Sphere hearing aids for a week to find out.

The Ultra Sphere hearing aids are visibly larger than most modern behind-the-ear (BTE) aids, clearly due to the extra silicon inside. At 3.39 grams each, that's a significant size increase over devices like the 2.58-gram Jabra Enhance Select 700 or the 2.68-gram Horizon Go 7IX. But while they're more readily visible to outside observers, that differential doesn't noticeably impact comfort, even with long-term wear. (More on this later.)

Both hearing aids have a two-way rocker button used for power, volume, and media control. Tap control is also an option for certain Bluetooth functions, but this is disabled in the MyPhonak app by default. The units carry an IP68 weatherproof rating and are available in seven colors. (I tested them in black.) You'll also be fitted with your preferred eartip style (open, closed, or Phonak's new wax-resistant EasyGuard domes) during your professional evaluation.

These prescription hearing aids worked quite well across the board in my testing. Tuned professionally by a Phonak representative, their claims of hearing better in noisy conditions were accurate, mildly—though not transformatively—dulling background sound in most cases. It's nearly impossible to quantify exactly how much better the Ultra Sphere aids worked compared to other models on this front. Oddly, they worked better in noise than they did in relative silence. In a quiet room, the hearing aids would occasionally hiss gently for a few seconds, then stop, only to hiss again a few minutes later. This light hiss effect was sustained throughout my experience, but I could only detect it when there wasn't any other noise in the room.

Rating: 8/10

The aids offered an appropriate and gentle level of support—never overwhelming me with sound when I didn't need it and overall improving my ability to understand speech both in person and while watching TV. High-pitched and sharp sounds like keyboard taps and mouse clicks registered a bit too loudly for complete comfort, but this could likely be improved with a return visit to the audiologist.

Bluetooth streaming quality is very good for BTE hearing aids. These aids can't effectively cancel heavy ambient noise during media streaming (particularly with open eartips), but on the whole, they were good enough for casual music and phone call usage. However, I encountered a few brief connectivity drop-outs during listening sessions.

I was stunned by how comfortable these hearing aids are, even for long periods of wear stretching into multiple hours. I expected the extra weight—and the perennial headache of dealing with BTE hearing aids while wearing glasses—would wear me down in short order, but that wasn't the case.

Phonak specifies a huge battery range of up to 56 hours, depending on usage patterns. In my testing, I achieved 27 hours on a charge with a mix of streaming and hearing aid usage. The rechargeable ChargerGo case isn't unique to the Ultra Sphere, but Phonak generally says the case provides enough power for three top-ups of the hearing aids.

Phonak offers several add-ons that work with the Infinio Ultra line, including its TV Connector (about $320), which plugs into your television and pipes sound straight to your hearing aids, similar to how Auracast works, bypassing the need for ambient sound amplification.

Rating: 8/10

Perhaps more interesting is the Roger On 3 (colloquially known merely as “Roger”). This device, which sells for a hefty $1,800 to $2,000, is a portable microphone that can also be used to pipe remote sounds into the Phonak hearing aids. It's both a unidirectional and omnidirectional microphone, depending on how you set it. In unidirectional mode, you can point the microphone at an audio source—a television speaker or a person talking across the room—and the microphone will home in on that source, amplifying it exclusively.

In omnidirectional mode, it can be laid flat on a table to amplify everyone within a few yards, helpful for picking up all the voices in a crowded meeting. The mic can also be clipped to a lapel or worn like a pendant to amplify the wearer's voice (and only the wearer), picking up audio from a person standing up to 80 feet away. It's insanely powerful, though I noticed it also had a tendency to pick up every sound in between me and my desired source: running water, rustling clothes, people chewing, and so on. Bottom line: If you pick up a Roger, plan to spend a lot of time fine-tuning and mastering it.

Two thousand dollars is a lot to pay for a fancy microphone; same with the Phonak Infinio Ultra Sphere hearing aids, which sell for an estimated $4,000—only from a licensed audiologist. (Prices can vary widely and are dependent on the provider.) That's in line with earlier top-tier Phonak hearing aids and similar aids from competitors. My classic advice on this front still stands: Most people with moderate hearing loss will do perfectly well with one of our over-the-counter hearing aid picks, and save a lot of cash to boot. Those with more profound hearing loss and/or the need for significant tuning may want to consider a more sophisticated hearing support device like the Ultra Sphere.

8/10

Having tinkered with 3D printers for over a decade now, I've always described them as more of a shop tool than a home gadget. Like a drill press or a table saw, they'll prove a lot more useful after a few months of trial and error, trying extra attachments, and tossing away little piles of half-spaghettified plastic.

No longer! The Bambu P1S combo happily fired off a near-perfect Benchy—the ubiquitous tugboat used to test basically every 3D printer's chops—in less than 20 minutes. Within just a few days of getting it online, I was confidently starting jobs from my computer on the other side of the house with complete faith they'd be done later that day.

My complaints about the P1S are minor, and won't be any trouble at all if you already have experience with 3D printers. As long as you don't mind handling a little bit of plastic waste, you'll be able to easily print many items.

Every time I upgrade my home 3D printer, I'm blown away by how much faster I can make things. My last printer, the Creality Ender 3 Max Neo, was able to break 150mm per second in ideal conditions. The P1S smashes past 200mm/s without breaking a sweat. It was so fast I had to reinforce the sturdy end table I usually use for printers to stop it from shaking, which was causing some light stringing on sharp corners.

3D printed models are always going to have imperfections, but the P1S performs a little ritual that directly addresses some of the most common causes of total print failure: Before every print, and whenever it changes filament, the nozzle moves to a trash chute at the back of the print area and poops out a little coil of extra material. As it moves off the chute, it wiggles across a bar, cleaning the nozzle and triggering a trap door that drops the extra waste. As a result, I haven't had to clean my nozzle tip since I set up the machine, and the first layer of every print comes out clean and smooth.

This simple solution does wonders for both maintenance and print completion rate, but it isn't exactly elegant. There's nowhere for the waste to go, so it just falls out the back and plops onto whatever surface is behind the printer. Sometimes the filament is still warm when the nozzle flips the switch and it doesn't fall, so you may need to manually reach in and unblock the pile after a big, multi-colored print.

It's such a known issue that a lot of users print an aptly named “poop chute,” which collects and redirects the waste to the side where it's easier to empty. I went with the simpler solution of putting an empty filament box behind the printer to catch it.

Before printing, the Bambu also sweeps and levels the bed in a grid, and warns you if it hits any obstructions like leftover supports or an errant bed scraper. I've checked out several printers with an auto-level before, but they were slower, and usually required a second check by hand before actually hitting go. I haven't had to adjust anything on the P1S in the month or so I've been using it, with the printer handling the initial setup, regular re-leveling, and nozzle cleaning.

The Bambu P1S is sold on its own, but I think the bundle that includes the multi-filament handling AMS is well worth the extra cost. When I unpacked the AMS, I had dreams of vibrant, multi-color prints, and while that's certainly possible, it isn't the component's best feature. Changing colors or materials mid-print forces the nozzle to dump a little coil of extra material, and you have to print a tower off to the side to minimize Z-axis variation.

The result is quite a bit of wasted plastic, extra time spent printing, and effort optimizing models and slicing for layers and colors. I also noticed there was a lot of extra length in the purge coils when switching colors, and slowly reduced that amount in Bambu Studio, but your mileage may vary. To get ahead of any questions: Yes, it did feel weird to inspect my 3D printer's poop to improve its diet.

Rather than print complex multi-color parts in one shot, I found the AMS more useful for reducing the amount of time I spent dealing with the printer to swap filaments. While it walks you through the process, switching a single filament is a fairly hands-on process. You have to wait for the nozzle to heat up, pull the old filament out, push the new one in until it drips out again, then get the roll situated on the spool holder, and make sure it purges anything leftover. With the AMS, I just load the colors I want for a multi-piece project onto the rollers, choose them in the slicer, and it handles everything from heating to purging.

Where I used to have to batch parts by color, or just print in whatever color was already loaded, now I print projects in an order that makes sense for time or assembly order, switching between filaments and colors without a care. The totally contained system even has slots for desiccant to keep your filament perfectly dry and ready to go.

If you opt to use Bambu filament spools, the AMS can read the chips inside and report the material and color info back to the slicer. You can still use other filament brands, but I did find that sometimes the AMS would get confused when synchronizing the filament colors and types back to the slicer, and I had to manually reset these settings each time I loaded up the app.

I figured out that the slicer and the AMS have different numbering systems, so if you see just a number, that's the software side, and if it has an “A” before the number, it's referring to the physical position in the AMS. When you've sliced the plate and go to start the print, Studio will let you verify that the two match up.

Even with some very mild fiddling required (hopefully now aided for some by these discoveries), the P1S has changed the way I approach 3D printing. Rather than wrestling with my printer to get a decent result, or dealing with filament swaps and double-checking measurements, I'm spending more time working on the stuff I'm actually printing.

I'm more motivated to start on complex projects knowing I don't have to worry about perfectly optimized beds or keeping stacks of filaments sealed in plastic bags. The minor software oddities and occasional plastic cleanup are easy to overlook when the rest of the process is so easy and straightforward. If you're after a simple 3D printer and have some projects in mind, the Bambu P1S Combo is a great place to start.

Not for me at least usually (exception might be something like an rpg game expanding the world), apps nagging to get updated is annoying in fact.

reply

There is no nagging. Apps auto-update on iOS, and have for years. I had 15 apps update in the last week. There was no nagging or notifications. It just happens.My only gripe is that they seem to want to update right after I take it off the charger in the morning, instead of at night. But I only actually notice this once or twice per year, if I go to use an app that's in the process of installing within the first few minutes of waking up.

Hmm... the sandboxing is a security feature, it's not there to prevent tracking (not sure what ""fingerprinting"" includes here). The sandboxing of Android is actually pretty good (a lot better than, say, desktop OSes).There is pretty much nothing you can do against an app requesting e.g. your location data and sending it to their servers. Fundamentally, the whole goal of apps is that they can technically do that. Then you have to choose apps you trust, and it's easier to trust open source apps.What GrapheneOS brings in terms of sandboxing is that the Play Services run sandboxed like normal apps. Whereas on Android, the Play Services run with system permissions.

AFAIK Graphene is oriented towards strong device security with privacy as more of a side effect.

reply

Which I believe is GrapheneOS' argument when people praise microG: microG being open source does not fundamentally add privacy: apps using microG will phone to Google's servers (that's the whole point of microG). What microG solves is that it removes the Play Services that are root on your device, and it turns out that sandboxed Play Services do that as well.> The idea for more privacy is you run open source apps instead that just don't collect data.Yep exactly, I just wanted to add about the sandboxed Play Services, because it was not obvious to me at first :)

I agree that this is the perception but anyone working in the mobile space on both platforms for the past ~2 years will know Google is a lot more hard nosed in reviewing apps for privacy concerns than Apple these days (I say this negatively, there is a middle ground and Apple is much closer to it - Google is just friction seemingly in an attempt to lose their bad reputation).

In contrast, on iOS I get prompted to allow or deny access to my information when the app tries calling Apple's API to fetch that information.For example, if an app wants access to my contacts to find other people using the app. On iOS I can simply say “no” when it prompts me to allow it to read my contacts. I lose out on that feature to find other people using the app, which I don't care about, but I can still use the rest of the app. On Android it seemed like by installing the app, I had already agreed to give up my contacts… it was all or nothing. If I don't like one privacy compromising feature, I couldn't use the app at all.Android may have improved this in the last few years, but I found it to be a dealbreaker for the entire platform.

Since some updates ago, my keyboard is still broken if I type too fast, and autocorrect been essentially broken for the same amount of time. Must be happening for ~years now, still waiting for a new update to finally fix it.At least on Android you can change the keyboard to something else if you'd like, instead of being stuck with what your OS developer forces on you. Wish I had that option now.

How's that different than Google Messages being exclusive to Android?

reply

People on Android I've run into seem to have a half dozen apps and use anything but the built in messaging.A few months ago while on a trip I ran into an older couple that wanted some picture I took in a place they weren't physically up to going. They were not tech savvy at all. Had they been on iOS, they would have just been using Messages and it would have been easy. They had Android, and the guy opened about 5 or 6 different messaging apps, not really knowing what any of them were, it seemed like a real mess. I sent them using Messages over RCS, assuming they'd go to Google Messages, or whatever the default equivalent standard app is for Google (they seem to have changed it a dozen times). It could be that the pictures were taking a while to send, my phone showed they sent, but he had no idea where to look or where they might have went, despite having so many messaging apps. I hope he is able to find them or they came through with a notification once he had a better single.Having one good app that everyone uses is better than the default app being sub-par, or so constantly in flux that the users and smattered about to dozens of different apps that can't talk to each other.

Consider the fact that Chromium has to specifically blacklist Yubikey and other known WebAuthn vendor IDs, otherwise any website could talk to your Yubikey pretending to be a browser and bypass your 2FA on third party domains.I'm conflicted on WebUSB because it's convenient but on the balance I think it's too dangerous to expose to the general public.

The apps that are more specialized to reach OS tend to prioritize iOS because if you look at app revenue, iOS users wildly outspend Android users. At least this was true when i was doing mobile shit a couple years agoThat doesn't mean the android app sucks, but it's usually given lower priority. New features and updates will usually hit iOS version sooner and things like that

Whenever there is an app with full feature parity (WhatsApp) you assume at best it can be equal, based on nothing. You have specific apps that work for you, and that's great, but my practical experience is much different: whenever I haven't had a choice in an app (think banking apps, carrier apps, local library apps, the Covid apps) the experience has been much better on Apple. Whenever there is a choice in apps, they're often cross-written in something that allows easy porting, and very similar, or the native Apple solution is much smoother. It's rare that an app just feels better on Android, and usually limited to cases where a specific app is only available on Android or, you know, Google.

iOS isn't particularly open source friendly, but mostly people don't do it because of personal incentives, not because it can't be done.It's subjective, and I get that, but what you miss is that features are subjective too. Missing parity apps are only relevant when you care about that feature; at no point in my life have I ever thought my life would be better or more convenient if I could only torrent on my phone.But having an app that is responsive and works well has made my life better. Standing outside a bar in the rain trying to get a stupid Covid app to work, not work well, just work, on Android has made my life worse.(Ironically, I've kind of noticed this is part of the Unix ethos writ small: do one thing and do it well. It's not exact, and iOS for sure has tons of crud everything apps. And they sure don't work together! I just think it's amusing.)

App addressable user base is another problem for Google, one that they have mentioned in developer conferences. It's a big part of why they've been trying to ship a tablet and unify android and Chromebook. If Google isn't careful they could find themselves in a downward spiral situation, stuck between apple on one side, and android forks on the other.And the last answer is, as always, money- browser is deemphasized on iOS, and so it's weaker feature set matters less- iOS is generally easier to develop for because of less device differentiation- on average iOS has significantly wealthier users who tend to be higher return or paying customers (seriously, look it up). This in turn leads companies to invest more heavily in iOS.- easier integration due to a narrow system services ecosystem (no Google vs Samsung slapfights)- unified platform advantage (apps written for iOS easily port to the watch and tablet, unlocking larger markets, and justifying greater spend in developing apps)- apples review process is significantly stricter (for better or for worse)Yes, Apple doesn't have something like fdroid, and that's really disappointing and honestly a legitimate dealbreaker for a lot of people

It's been a while since I was last using Android, but first-party Apple apps no longer meet my standards for ""polished"".e.g. type this sequence into the calculator:  [2] [-] [4] [=] [x²] [=]

Deleting a selection of items from browsing history is limited to about 5 items per second, as it deletes one then rebuilds the entire list before deleting the next.If I'm listening to a podcast on headpones and an alarm goes off, it doesn't play the alarm through my headphones, it plays on device speakers only.Podcast app's ""Up Next"" is a magical mystery list that can't be disabled or guided.The ""Do Not Disturb"" mode can be activated unexpectedly, leading to missed calls, and cannot be deleted.Localisation is inconsistent at every level, including system share sheet and behaviour of decimal separators.I could go on, but you get the point.

The real problem is that Android vendors mess up with the OS in weird ways by adding custom ultra battery savers, removing APIs etc. which is much less predictable than dealing with a few Apple devices, that are more homogenous.Then many vendors ship their own apps which are buggy and you need to know that vendor's Z Calendar app has a weird bug to account for.

Android has a reputation for being unsafe precisely because of sideloading (as well as low Google Play fees, looser app review, accessibility services and remote access).This policy is bad for us HNers, but objectively good for the 95+% of people who will never sideload a legitimate Android app, but are extremely likely to get caught by scammers.The heavy US skew of HN really distorts the arguments here, as Android-based scams aren't as common in AMerica due to the prevalence of iOS in that region.

Google could let users add their own signing keys (like browsers allow), and it might be they will let students or power users do this, or they could do what F-Droid does in packaging FOSS apps without developers having to provide extra PII information.

If there's a reputation, that means it's reasonably widespread.  5% doesn't seem like much.Does this mean there are so many advanced users sideloading apps to compromise them?Except users aren't so advanced that they are getting scammed because of side loading?Or might it be the cascading delays in security updates that don't seem to reach devices between Google, manufacturers, and telcos?  This is a much more massive (the 95%) of security hole and backdoors for scams to enter.These arguments don't really seem to fit together or make sense.Happy to get some links to read more about all of the statements.

The reason they probably have them preinstalled over there is because they don't care about licensing so they can freely preload whatever they want.

In Chrome on Android (and yeah, on desktop too) you just go into ""Settings"" and change your default search engine.

This is just straight up false.  Qualcomm's current top of the line processors are about 3 years behind what you can get in Apple's cheapest product (that being the 16e), and the budget phones (and by ""budget"" I mean ""the 600 dollar ones"") are another 3 years behind that.iPhones don't generally become too slow to realistically use until their support lifetime expires.  Androids are like that out of the box unless you spend over a thousand dollars, and those only last for about half the time (a combination of inferior hardware and inferior software).  It doesn't matter if you have a 120Hz screen if the UI only updates at 20.This is why the only killer feature for Android (outside the cameras) is adblocking- which, of course, is what Google wants to prevent.  They don't want you to run real Firefox (with the only effective adblock remaining), and they want you to pay for YouTube Premium rather than using NewPipe (or some other ReVanced successor) so you can't get out of paying 10 bucks to listen to a video with the screen off.

It doesn't matter if you have a 120Hz screen if the UI only updates at 20.This is why the only killer feature for Android (outside the cameras) is adblocking- which, of course, is what Google wants to prevent.  They don't want you to run real Firefox (with the only effective adblock remaining), and they want you to pay for YouTube Premium rather than using NewPipe (or some other ReVanced successor) so you can't get out of paying 10 bucks to listen to a video with the screen off.

Google pays content creators so little they have all started including ads in their videos. Si technically as long as you are counted they get paid. Meanwhile, Google is more and more aggressive with their own ads interrupting videos and pushing you to subscribe to their expensive offer.Some people, like me, have just stopped watching YouTube. Other are turning to blocking ads.It's the usual tug of war between revenues and UX but I don't think consumers have to feel bad about not playing by Google's rules.

In Apple's case this has been the only Apple business to grow at all in several of the recent years. In fact there's quite a few Apple businesses that look like they are ""revenue neutral"", most famously iPads. Google is better, but not by much. Cloud is growing fast (""but why?"" is a question that's unanswered. I mean, ""because of AI"", of course, but ... seriously?)So not only are they enshittified, and you see them getting worse and worse over time, but the financial statements show: if you're expecting this to get any better either in the Apple or Google case, you're insane. Because clearly ads for scams are worth it for advertisers, and most other types of ads are not worth it. The situation evolves more and more towards the cable channel situation of 20 years back.You could also reverse the view. The simple question: ""are people willing to compromise on hardware quality to get less ads?"" has a very clear NO answer. ""Are governments/institutions that are totally dependent on these systems willing to pay to either improve phones or make an alternative available?"", again has boatloads of evidence that the answer is NO, in all caps.[1] Search for ""credit card"" or ""lose weight"" and judge for yourself. Top results are promoting Apple or Google themselves, everything else are ads, and very bad deals that trivially will neither accomplish the promised financial independence nor weight loss. Or should I put it like this: the credit card deals advertised are so bad they might achieve weight loss. By the way ads designed to mislead, which the top ads for either search obviously are, are what both Google and Apple promised time and again never to do.

Also USB-C ain't some differentiating feature of android, rather rest of the world and electronics. Fully apple's fault here, it could have been their standard as the one, but greed is greed.Screens were always better on Samsungs flagships (apple buys screens there too) - mildly higher resolution, refresh rate and contrasts but these are rather unimportant. As an non-apple tech user, apple phone hardware has very few things that interest me or put them above the others.Its better integration with software that did put them above, since it was optimized for a very narrow band of hardware so could get far even with subpar hardware (till M chips came but these days they are almost on par with Snapdragons). But that software has a list of issues much bigger than hardware above so no, thank you.

This comment is insane in several different ways.There's nothing preventing Google's phones from being distributed in China. They already are distributed in China.Those phones won't come with the vendor OS installed; they'll come with an OS that works without a hitch in China.One of the modifications to the local OS will be to make sideloading trivial, since that's how you're expected to install apps.If you did start selling phones with a stock Android OS in China, those phones wouldn't work because their connections to Google services would all be blocked. The reason for that block has nothing to do with sideloading or even with phones. It's going to stay in place.

It's obvious you've never used Android if you think these are core features LMAO.  No one cares that much about connector type, more the fact it's using an industry standard versus proprietary.  No one cares about RCS, everyone uses WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Messenger, Line, etc...Core features are stuff like being able to search for a business through the phone app, Maps telling you where you parked your car, unprompted, compatibility with the casting protocol, the ability to make ANY app the default for a particular task, the ability to sideload, the fact you can switch phone brands and get whatever hardware you want but your core OS with all your accounts stays the same.  Basically the ability to do what you want win your OS and no one restricting your phone's features.As for Google's strategy, it's the same as Valve's.  Having a platform they can't be locked out of since both MS and Apple have shown they'll abuse their market power.

Well no, Chinese phones are above Apple material-wise (better battery, better cameras, better cooling) and on par SoC-wise since last year. That's what makes Google's strategy so baffling.> Apple has better app selection (for most people).It's entirely the same. I have gone back and forth regularly for the past 10 years. Android is completely on par app-wise. Apple has the iMessage lock-in in the US obviously but not in the rest of the world. Apple might have a slight advantage on the pro segment with the iPad but I don't think it has a huge impact on phones.The really baffling thing to me is that while they lock down Android, they pay to put Gemini on iOS. Google has a real competitive advantage with IA and they just gave it to Apple.It's clear to me that they are two companies fighting each other inside Google: the ex-Motorola who wants to be Apple and the service side who wants to be Microsoft.I personally fear that they are making the bed of the regulators who will probably come for Play Protect at some point to open the door for alternative OS providers at least in Europe. But maybe they think it's coming anyway and are strengthening their position and trying to milk what they can in the meantime.

From batteries to cameras and screens, apple is way behind on hardware tech. Yeah they are better than Samsung - but Samsung has also massively fallen behind what's the state of the art.>>is another customer Google has to pay exorbitant fees to a competitor to access.Last time I checked, it's apple paying Google, billions of dollars a year?

You checked wrong. Google pays Apple on the order of $20 billion to be the default search on iOS - this is so significant it accounts for ~5% of Apple's annual revenue

If any of these manufacturers decide to include an EMR pen in the body of the phone, like Samsung's S-Pen, they'll have me as a customer. The S-Pen so completely changes the experience that I am unwilling to go back.

This is true, but their phones don't ship with Google services out of box (at least the last time I checked). So in reality, ""Google's Android"" is really mostly Samsungs and Pixels.

No it's not. The term originated far before this debacle, and carries a meaningful distinction than just ""installing"". Specifically it means installing from a non-first party source. You might not agree the restriction should exist, or that even the concept of first party source at all, but for communication purposes it's worth having a simple word to describe that concept, rather than something like ""installing from a non-first party app store"".

And neutrality here isn't about mirroring current usage frequency (which is unique to Android and recent relative to the history of computing), it's about continuity with prior computing norms. Even when one distribution path dominated in practice, it didn't get to redefine the base verb.

reply

What ""first-party"" source? Apple invented out of thin air the notion of a ""first-party"" software source or that computer users can only install software approved by a central authority.

reply

It's amazing how many confidently wrong people are springing up out of the wordwork to present revisionist history about the meaning of ""install"" like it's ancient wisdom. Pre-mobile computing treated ""install"" as neutral and primary and had no built in relation to centralized distribution. Sideloading as a term of art originally, in practice came into usage for transferring media to devices, and some cloud file hosts briefly used it to mean load a file to an online drive without downloading it to computer. It's usage was varied, irregular, and not at any threshold of popular acceptance for one meaning or another.Windows, Dos, Linux, and online self-hosted services had no notion of ""sideloading"", or at least no usage of that vocabulary and did not use this notion of ""install"" that is now being retrospectively declared a longstanding historical norm. Even now, that's not a term used in Windows or Linux. Even Apple, who very much in practice utilize this controlled distribution model but even they don't use this sideloading/installing verbal distinction. In Apple's lexicon installing is neutral with respect to where an app comes from.So it's staggering to see a specific term of art that deviates from historical precedent that only is used in an Android context and only relatively recently in the history of computing be referred to as if its observing a longstanding precedent across all of computing. It's nothing of the sort.

Because when you install software that isn't from the app store, it's unvetted and untrusted.There is a whole different structure of trust when you download and install an app from your provider's app store.No, it's not perfect. No, it won't prevent malware or scams. But there is trust, and there is a vetting process, and there are automatic updates and in-app purchases and the other perks that you get with an integrated app store.Sideloading, or ""simply installing"" from an APK, is a different procedure that involves mostly disabling the trust and certification features that your app store was providing. I have never needed to do this for any app on any Android device, and I've owned them since KitKat.In fact, I will probably enable S-mode on my next Windows machine, because it's that easy to just avoid 3rd party apps and crapware.So I don't know why people want to muddy the waters.

The idea that a precondition for something to count is installing is that it's vetted by a big company is the abberation, and the notion that it's trustworthy is belied by the avalanche of unsafe and privacy violating apps that find their way into the store. F-Droid apps are actually more carefully vetted than Play Store apps, so there goes the trust rationale.You're the one muddying the waters.

You claim that you ""can install anything"" on Windows, but that is simply false. The system's Driver Signature Enforcement will prohibit the install of unsigned or invalid signatures on device drivers. Windows SmartScreen will also give you trouble by blocking unsigned apps.So yeah, you can bypass these protective measures and ""install whatever you want"" ultimately, but it is basically the same process as sideloading on Android, isn't it? Disabling a bunch of protections that are there for your safety?Your trust, honestly, doesn't mean jack shit. There is cryptographic signing, and certificate authorities, and processes to approve the certificates that authorized developers use. You don't got jack shit with your ""trust"" of Termux and Kodi.

The security vetting, the authentication, the scans that are done, whether by Google Play or by F-Droid, are a process that tries to eliminate egregious abuses and basically curate the collection so that the users have something to actually trust. Now you understand that actual trust comes in degrees, right? I don't trust everything on Play equally. There are plenty of different types of trust relationships between me and the Play Store and the devs who put their apps on it.But cryptographically, cybersecurity-wise, we need that CIA triad, and we need to authenticate that developers are who they say they are. And that authentication is the crux of cryptographic code signing. That we can trust that updates came from the source, and not a 3rd party injection or supply-chain attack. If Google or F-Droid countersigns it, then it's been through their vetting process as well. That's how cryptographic signing establishes trust relationships for computers.If your computer doesn't trust an app or a driver, it won't download, install or run it. Since you cannot teach a computer ""actual trust"" there must be an analogue to this. And it's working fine. I don't know what you're on about ""opposite to actual trust"". If you don't trust Google Play, that's a you problem.

So if you want to have a conversation about trusting curl and bash and random gists...Like I said, I installed software in many ways back in the day. I typed it in; I loaded off cassette tape; I loaded off disk. One common denominator was loading from trusted sources. My Atari cartridges were store-bought and not homebrew. I went to B.Dalton mostly for the software, and got it shrinkwrapped from the publisher.I had a number of classmates and colleagues who caught viruses and malware from loading and installing cracked software or untrusted programs... or even alleged porn, from shady sources. This is still a good way to get infected.When I get on a friend's computer, I often have occasion to congratulate them for being uninfected, and it's nearly always because they ""practiced good hygiene"" in terms of loading only trusted software from trusted sources.So you're correct, in that really nothing has changed.

Were it not for that, I would never have stopped using Huawei, IMO the best phone brand by a mile. But I'm too busy a person to depend on hacks and having to regularly find new workarounds to access my banks.

I'm beginning to think we need to consider such apps, and the hardware they run on, as the outsiders. Keep a cheap ""normal"" Android phone for those apps, and those apps alone. Then keep a ""real"" second device for everything else. Up to you which one gets the SIM card and provides connectivity for the other (and ordinary phone services).I'd rather go back to old-fashioned hardware dongles from banks – but hey, lacking that, maybe I'll just think of the first of those two devices as a clunky, overly expensive one of those.

It make some things that should be easy on Linux harder.

This is far from the only alternative. There are also Mobian, PureOS, postmarketOS and more. Unlike Ubuntu Touch, they allow you to run ordinary Linux desktop apps. Also there is hardware not tied to an ancient Android kernel, designed to run desktop GNU/Linux: Pinephone and Librem 5. The latter is my daily driver.

But to your point specifically, Play store and App Store have APIs to rate from within the app: when the pop up shows, app author does not have an option to avoid getting a 1-star rating (they are also time-restricted, eg. at most once every 180 days for Apple IIRC).What devs do though, is to preempt it with ""Are you enjoying our app?"", and only giving you a formal rating pop-up if you answer ""Yes"".

This is only an issue for Google compliant Android so projects like LineageOS will be fine. Depending on their implementation, this may even just be restricted to AOSP with Samsung and others just ignoring the extra restrictions.But, if they make compliance a requirement for being part of their parent programme, GrapheneOS will be in a tough spot.

""Sideloading"" doesn't refer to the installation process, but to the file transfer process. You're sideloading when you transfer, e.g. APKs from your notebook to your Android. Or, from a USB stick into your phone or something.In general, though, ""sideloading"" also refers to any ""non-app-store"" installation. It's a kind of colloquial shorthand. It's not really a technical term. But it's adequate for getting the point across.If you just called it ""installing"" without qualifying it, how would anyone know that it's a different process, or that it's accomplished not by navigating to the app store? It seems that you would invite ambiguity here!

""Sideloading"" refers to data transfer between two local, peer devices. Really, that is it. It is not ""something scary"" or something forbidden. It is not even really installing. It's data transfer.So ""before walled-gardens"" people would install software in many many ways. I originally typed it in from scratch, or from a magazine. I loaded it from tape. Or diskette. That's not really ""sideloading"" if you think about it, because it's just ""loading"" from peripheral storage.Later, when people dialed up on a PC, they could ""download"" software and then install it or do whatever with other data or media. They could also upload it. They could transfer it among devices locally. This was not, at the time, called ""sideloading"" but just transfer, or ""null modem"", or ""sneakernet"", or ""a station wagon full of backup tapes"".If we're going to use ""sideloading"" in the strictest sense, then we cannot actually refer to the process of downloading APK files separately and then installing them, because that's literally downloading. But that is the colloquial meaning now.Hey, if you want to coin a new term or neologism for it, by all means do so. But it seems absurd to downplay ""sideloading"" as having ""scary"" or ""negative"" connotations, when it really doesn't. You've got to look past the hype and F.U.D.Remember, there was a time when people considered FTP and torrenting to be dangerous or subversive. Perhaps they still do.

I don't agree with this definition. ""Sideloading"" sounds like loading something ""on the side"", as in secretly, like in the expression ""side piece"".

As someone from Germany, I don't want Google to nanny family members computing devices. They don't want it either.
It is completely absurd for an ad company in a surveillance state an ocean away to play IT services for everyone. This has already gone to far.Rather, there should be tools for value-aligned IT services and technically minded family members to help.

The future is analog. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Researchers from the University of California, Irvine have developed a transceiver that works in the 140 GHz range and can transmit data at up to 120 Gbps, that's about 15 gigabytes per second. By comparison, the fastest commercially available wireless technologies are theoretically limited to 30 Gbps (Wi-Fi 7) and 5 Gbps (5G mmWave). According to UC Irvine News, these new speeds could match most fiber optic cables used in data centers and other commercial applications, usually around at 100 Gbps. The team published their findings in two papers — the “bits-to-antenna” transmitter and the “antenna-to-bits” receiver — on the IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits.

“The Federal Communications Commission and 6G standards bodies are looking at the 100-gigahertz spectrum as the new frontier,” lead author Zisong Wang told the university publication. “But as such speeds, conventional transmitters that create signals using digital-to-analog converters are incredibly complex and power-hungry, and face what we call a DAC bottleneck.” The team replaced the DAC with three in-sync sub-transmitters, which only required 230 milliwatts to operate.

By comparison, a DAC that can keep up with 120 Gbps would consume several watts of power, making it unsuitable for smartphone and other mobile device use. “If we stuck to traditional methods, the battery life of next-generation devices would vanish in minutes,” UC Irvine Nanoscale Communication Integrated Circuits Labs director Payam Heydari said. “Our group's answer is a transceiver that leapfrogs over current limitations by performing complex calculations in the analog domain, rather than the power-hungry digital domain.”

Aside from its efficiency, the researchers said that the silicon is fabricated on 22nm node, using fully depleted silicon-on-insulator technology, which is so much easier to manufacture than cutting edge 2nm and 18A nodes from TSMC and Samsung. This could make it so much easier and cost-efficient to mass produce, encourage quick adoption of this in consumer devices. Moreover, the group also said that their new technology is a suitable alternative to the miles and miles of cabling that data centers require, allowing them to reduce their set-up and operating costs.

However, this technology is not without its challenges. Current 5G mmWave technology, which can go up to 71 GHz, has a range of about 300 meters, so you can expect this to have an even smaller radius. So, unless we see new innovations that could extend the reach of this high-speed wireless technology, we may see a future where our cities are dotted with high-speed cell sites.

The AC Milan striker believes Mexico has what it takes to shock the world and lift the FIFA World Cup in 2026, a tournament that will be played on home soil and one he sees as deeply personal after missing out on Qatar 2022.

“I believe we will make history,” Giménez said in an interview with ESPN. “As I said before, I'm a big dreamer. I want to be a world champion with Mexico.”

For Giménez, belief is not naïve optimism but a necessary starting point. He insists that dreaming costs nothing, but turning it into reality requires collective conviction.

“Of course I can see it happening,” he said. “Believing doesn't cost anything, and neither does dreaming. Now we have to put it into practice and spread that belief to everyone who joins us, because 130 million Mexicans together are strong.”

The 24-year-old forward also addressed the possibility of forming an attacking partnership with Jiménez, a duo that could become one of Mexico's most dangerous weapons heading into the tournament.

“I think we're two strikers who have done very well in Europe, and I believe we make a great partnership,” Giménez explained. “We know each other really well, and whenever we've played together, we've performed at a high level.”

Beyond the tactical fit, Giménez highlighted the chemistry and friendship he's developed with the Fulham striker through their time with the national team.

“He's a great friend,” he added. “Sharing moments with him in the national team brought us closer. We even text each other on WhatsApp sometimes. And honestly, I do feel that when opponents see both of us on the field, something happens - defenses react differently.”

The 2026 World Cup also represents unfinished business for Giménez, who was left out of Mexico's final squad for Qatar 2022 under then-coach Gerardo Martino, despite being close to making the cut.

“That experience left a thorn in me,” he admitted. “I've dreamed of playing in a World Cup since I was a kid. Being so close last time and not going made that desire even stronger.”

The thought of the tournament still keeps him awake at night.

“There are nights when you start thinking and thinking, and you can't sleep,” Giménez said. “That happens to me a lot when I think about the World Cup. I already see myself there, in the opening match, with all the people, at the Azteca. That image doesn't let me sleep because I just want it to be there already.”

Mexico are coming off a 1–0 win over Panama in a friendly match played exclusively with Liga MX players. This Sunday, they will face Bolivia as part of a preparation tour requested by manager Javier Aguirre, aimed at evaluating domestic-based players and getting a closer look at Central and South American opponents.","{'href': 'https://www.foxsports.com', 'title': 'FOX Sports'}","soccer"

Manchester United stunned Arsenal on Sunday by beating the Gunners 3-2 at the Emirates to make it two wins out of two for caretaker manager Michael Carrick. A Lisandro Martinez own goal gifted Arsenal the lead but the visitors hit back through Bryan Mbeumo. Dorgu and substitute Cunha then scored eye-catching goals to take all three points and dent Arsenal's title hopes.

Arsenal dominated the opening exchanges but needed a slice of luck to open the scoring. Bukayo Saka clipped the ball back to Martin Odegaard in the penalty area and his shot was flicked past Senne Lammens in the Manchester United goal by Martinez.

Manchester United responded well to the early setback, with Bruno Fernandes firing two chances wide. The equaliser then came from Bryan Mbeumo, who also profited from some good fortune. The Cameroon star pounced on a poor back from Martin Zubimendi and kept his composure to round goalkeeper David Raya and slot home to make it 1-1.

The game then sparked into life early in the second half as Dorgu lit up the Emirates with a stunning strike. Bruno Fernandes fed Dorgu the ball and he unleashed an unstoppable strike that flew past Raya and into the top corner from just outside the penalty area.

Mikel Arteta responded by making four changes to his team, sending on Ben White, Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze and Mikel Merino in search of an equaliser. Noni Madueke followed shortly afterwards as the Gunners struggled to carve out clear-cut chances. 

Perhaps inevitably the equaliser came from a set piece. Merino bundled home from close range after Lammens failed to punch clear a corner to make it 2-2. Yet the response from the Red Devils was swift and deadly. Cunha picking up possession and curling another unstoppable finish past Raya to secure a memorable afternoon for the visitors.

GOAL rates Manchester United's players from the Emirates...

Senne Lammens (7/10):

Made a good save from a Martin Zubimendi header in the first half and Saka in the second but was crowded out at the corner from which Arsenal made it 2-2.

Diogo Dalot (6/10):

A really solid afternoon at right-back and enjoyed a good tussle with Leandro Trossard.

Harry Maguire (8/10):

Rock solid at the back, where his aerial ability was needed, and brought the ball out of defence well before Dorgu hammered the ball home.

Lisandro Martinez (6/10):

Inadvertently handed Arsenal the lead by flicking past Lammens as he tangled with Timber. Great tackle in stoppage time to prevent an Arsenal attack.

Luke Shaw (7/10):

Did a very decent job up against Saka down the left for United.

Casemiro (8/10):

Into his last few months as a Manchester United player but this was an excellent performance. Commanding throughout and seemed to be everywhere at times.

Kobbie Mainoo (7/10):

Another start for Mainoo and a disciplined performance. Seems to be growing in confidence but looked tired in the second half, perhaps unsurprising given his lack of game time recently.

Amad Diallo (6/10):

Not his most effective game in a Manchester United shirt but provided some good deliveries that troubled Raya.

Bruno Fernandes (6/10):

Will feel he should have been on the scoresheet but wasted two great chances in the first half.

Bryan Mbeumo (8/10):

Gave William Saliba and Gabriel a tough afternoon and showed great composure to round David Raya and equalise for his ninth goal of the season. 

Patrick Dorgu (8/10):

Fairly quiet in the first half but scored a sensational goal to make it 2-1 to Manchester United.

Matheus Cunha (8/10):

Came off the bench and scored the winner with a wonderful curling strike. 

Benjamin Sesko (6/10):

Tried in vain to hammer the ball off the line but couldn't prevent Arsenal making it 2-2. 

Noussair Mazraoui (N/A)

Only given the last few minutes.

Michael Carrick (8/10):

Kept faith with the same XI that beat Manchester City and oversaw another very impressive win. His decision to swap Mbeumo for Cunha also paid off handsomely as the Brazilian scored a brilliant winner.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Watch out, Arne Slot! Liverpool make 'first call' to Xabi Alonso over head coach job as timeline set for Dutchman's departure","https://www.goal.com/en-ug/lists/arne-slot-liverpool-first-call-xabi-alonso-head-coach-timeline-departure/bltd7200965214c7d66","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 11:43:47 GMT","

Xabi Alonso has reportedly received a “first call” from Liverpool, with his interest in a future managerial role on Merseyside being sounded out. The World Cup winner is available at present after seeing a testing spell in charge of Real Madrid cut short after seven months. Arne Slot continues to oversee events at Anfield for now, but questions are being asked of his future.

More of those have surfaced on the back of a dramatic 3-2 loss at Bournemouth which saw the reigning Premier League champions suffer a seventh defeat of their uninspiring domestic title defence.

Slot guided the Reds to top-flight glory in dominant style last season, after taking over from Jurgen Klopp, but has struggled to bring the best out of an expensively-assembled squad this term - with little return being seen on record-breaking transfer investment.

According to Spanish news outlet AS, Liverpool are putting contingency plans in place when it comes to their head coaching role. They claim that “first” contact has been made with Alonso after seeing him unceremoniously ushered out of the Bernabeu - where he is said to have endured a strained relationship with the likes of Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham.

Despite lasting just 34 games in Madrid, Alonso's stock remains high on the back of his Bundesliga title-winning exploits at Bayer Leverkusen. He is fondly remembered at Anfield from his playing days and was asked about taking the reins there in 2024 when Klopp announced that he would be terminating his contract.

Alonso felt it “wasn't the right time to leave” Leverkusen at that stage, but he is now waiting on enticing offers. AS claims that the 44-year-old ex-Spain international is taking in “active rest” and “knows he'll be welcomed back to Anfield”. 

Liverpool are said to be “counting on him for the near future, or for the 2026-27 season”. Alonso, along with his representatives, have opened themselves up to contact from England. He is “determined” to retrace steps to Merseyside at some point.

Liverpool have “assured” Slot that he will “finish the current season”, with there no plans on their part to follow the lead of domestic rivals Chelsea and Manchester United when it comes to making mid-season changes - with Enzo Maresca and Ruben Amorim being relieved of their duties at Stamford Bridge and Old Trafford respectively.

The Reds are trying to “anticipate what might happen and find out if they can count on Xabi”. Discussions with his entourage are said to have been “positive”, which has brought “some relief to Liverpool”. He will be ready to answer an SOS call if one is sounded.

Slot, though, has been laughing off the supposed threat that Alonso poses to his job. He said ahead of a Champions League win over Marseille when asked if he had been in touch with the Spaniard: “Yes he called me and said: 'What do you think about the team because I am going to take over in six months, can you tell me a little bit more?' Or maybe earlier. Maybe he takes over tomorrow! No, no, no. This is one of the weirdest questions I ever got. What is there it say? I am working here for a little bit more than one and a half years and I really like my work over here. We won the league last season, struggled more in the league this season. That is also obvious, so yes what is there left to say?”

Reds captain Virgil van Dijk has said of rumours that refuse to go away: “That (question) was disrespectful. Criticism is justified if you look at what we are doing in the season, especially based on last season. It's been a difficult part of the season for us players and the manager as well but he has handled it well.”

The former world No. 1 nonetheless takes positives from his best major result in over a year despite losing to rival Tien in three straight sets.ByDavid KanePublished Jan 25, 2026 copy_link

Published Jan 25, 2026

MELBOURNE, Australia—At a certain point, Daniil Medvedev was just trying to get on the board.“I was just trying to win one more,” he said after losing 11 straight games to Learner Tien during his 6-4, 6-0, 6-3 defeat to the young American at the 2026 Australian Open. “I mean, I was trying to figure out what can I do to kind of disturb his level that he had at this moment. I do want to say I guess I did something, because it became 4-3, and I even felt like, you know what, 4-3, it's small chance. Then, well, there was not a big chance finally.“That's how I am no matter the score. I try to win one game at first, maybe one more after. The matches can turn a bit more probably in women's tennis, but in men's tennis as well we saw some crazy things. So, I just try to say to myself, like, ‘Till the last point, try to fight.' Then the last point was not for me this time.”Medvedev and Tien faced off for the first time at this tournament 12 months ago, with the American stunning Medvedev through five grueling sets in a late-night second round. The pair have played three more times since then, with Tien getting the better of the 2021 US Open champion in two out of the three.

Medvedev, who began the year by winning his 22nd ATP title in Brisbane, gave high praise to his opponent, who became the youngest American to reach a major quarterfinal since Andy Roddick in 2002.“He played great, super-aggressive,” said Medvedev. “Even when I was making good shots, he was making a better shot back.

“I think I should focus more in general,” Medvedev said in his post-match press conference. “If we take last, like, maybe eight tournaments, let's say starting from US Open, so I don't know if it's, like, eight, nine, I played great. I beat a lot of players. I played great against some top players. In general, I was going far in the results. Even here, I won two very tough matches against opponents who played well, Halys and Fabian.“So, I should try not to focus on this exact match, which was not good, because, I mean, he outplayed me, so that's not a good feeling. But I should focus more on the general picture and just continue working the way I did for the last tournaments.  And, again, if I manage to play good, beat all the players I have beaten in all these tournaments, I can get where I want. Of course, it's unfortunate to finish a Grand Slam like this when I was feeling well and confident, but it is what it is.”Tien will look to maintain his level against No. 3 seed Alexander Zverev in the last eight.

When Alex de Minaur was asked by Jim Courier about his involvement in wedding planning with fellow tennis player Katie Boulter following a third-round win at the Australian Open Saturday, the 26-year-old responded, “Are you doubting me, Jim?”“I am,” confirmed the four-time major winner.“No, this is like a 50/50 relationship right,"" continued De Minaur before being stopped by the master of on-court interviews.“You've not been married. You don't know,” stated Courier. “You're about to become a 49% shareholder of a really great company.”

“You've not been married. You don't know,” stated Courier. “You're about to become a 49% shareholder of a really great company.”

Two days later, De Minaur has seemingly accepted that reality.The Australian No. 1 delivered another stellar performance Monday evening inside Rod Laver Arena, dispatching fellow Top 10 competitor Alexander Bublik with a 6-4, 6-1, 6-1 victory.

He won 14 of the final 16 games to ensure there was no chance of Bublik turning this encounter “sideways.”“Of course going into this one, I kind of wanted my revenge. I knew what to expect and what I didn't do right the first couple times,” he told press.De Minaur is through to his seventh career major quarterfinal, though is yet to advance past that stage. If he is to end that dry spell, it will require the world No. 6 to overturn his 0-5 head-to-head against top seed Carlos Alcaraz.“It does help out that I'm feeling quite fresh. It's going to be a physical battle, right, because there are many, many things that Carlos does incredibly well on a tennis court, and one is making the rallies quite physical,” said De Minaur.“I'm going to go after the match. I'm excited for the battle. Yeah, ultimately it's something that I have never done, but, you know, there is always a first time for everything. I'm hoping that will be on Tuesday.”

					By Glenn Garner 

Associate Editor


	Although Domhnall Gleeson is currently making headlines in Park City, Utah, his head is in Ohio as he gears up for Season 2 of Peacock‘s The Paper.


	While discussing his new film The Incomer with Deadline, the Golden Globe-nominated actor revealed that he's started prepping for Season 2 of his The Office spin-off, in which he plays Toledo Truthteller newspaper editor-in-chief Ned Sampson.


	“I've got the haircut, so I'm getting back into [Ned mode],” he said at our Sundance Studio. “I had a perm in our film. So, I had a real-life perm, and the perm has now been cut out so I can go back and play Ned. We're reading scripts, and they're really exciting. And I'm incredibly excited to get dubbed back in. It's really nice to do something silly about journalism, which is a very serious thing.”

	











	Gleeson, “I think if we were doing a big paper, you would be getting into all sorts of stuff that would be difficult to talk about in any way that was funny. The fact that it's a really local place, you can find the small things that mean bigger things. And in a way, that's always the news that really matters, is the one that's just on your street. So yeah, we're loving it. I'm very lucky to be a part of it.”


	The day before the mockumentary sitcom premiered in September, Peacock gave the Greg Daniels/Michael Koman-created series an early Season 2 renewal. Shortly after, the show was given an NBC broadcast run.


	Featuring the same doc crew from The Office (2005-'13), The Paper follows Ned Sampson as he takes over the struggling Toledo Truthteller and transforms its oddball volunteer news staff into an impactful team of local journalists.

NY & Broadway Editor


	As of this snowy New York morning, most Broadway productions are expecting to tough out the state-of-emergency weather, with—so far—only a couple productions (Disney's The Lion King and Aladdin) officially canceling Sunday performances, a situation prompting some actors to express chilliness to the news.


	Late Saturday night, The Broadway League, the trade organization representing theater owners and producers, posted an Instagram message saying that “most Broadway shows in New York City are currently scheduled to perform tomorrow (Sunday) as planned,” news that some performers thought was pretty cold.

	











	“Hey @nycmayor @govkathyhochul can you please tell the Broadway league that there's a literal STATE OF EMERGENCY and it's not safe to be forcing the thousands of theatre workers (and ticket holders who can't cancel because of fine print) to come to shows??” wrote Jenna Bainbridge. who plays Nessarose in Wicked.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Bainbridge's castmate Danny Quadrino, who plays Boq, wrote, “The health and safety of your theatre workers should be at the forefront.”


	Telly Leung, who plays one of the Phantoms in the immersive off-Broadway Phantom of the Opera reboot Masquerade, responded to the League's post with, “@nycmayor. I am urging you to step in here. Theater workers are human beings who deserve to be safe in this weather emergency as well. @broadwayleague – I am urging you to do the right thing today for the safety of your workers and patrons.”


	As of this writing — the situation, of course, could change as the snow mounts and temperatures drop — only two Broadway shows have canceled Sunday performances: Both The Lion King and Aladdin note on their officials websites that Sunday performances are axed, with the shows resuming performances, as already scheduled, on Tuesday. Tickets for today's shows will be refunded.

	











	With subways and buses running, Broadway as a whole rarely shuts down due to weather. The last industry-wide closing due to snow was 10 years ago, when a Jan. 23, 2016, blizzard brought more than two feet of snow to the city.


	Off Broadway, Heathers: The Musical has canceled today's matinee and evening performances “out of concern for the safety of cast, company and audiences,” the production wrote in a press release. As is standard, ticket holders for canceled performances should return to point of purchase for exchanges or refunds.


	Other shows are pledging to tough out today's expected eight inches of white stuff. Broadway's Bug, the Manhattan Theatre Club offering, starring Carrie Coon and Namir Smallwood, announced a $45 flash sale for all remaining seats for today's 2pm matinee due to the storm. The musical Two Strangers Carry a Cake Across New York posted an Instagram message saying, “Don't be a stranger! Warm up with us today at 3PM,” and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child wrote on Instagram, “Escape the snow! Performances are ON for today!”


	“The Queens are reigning at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.,” writes the musical Six. “Get down at the castle, raise your voice and warm up with Six The Musical.” Chess writes, “Game on,” noting that the 3pm matinee will go on as scheduled. Stranger Things: The First Shadow has a note on its website reading, “Both performances will play as scheduled on Sunday, January 25, 2026. If you have any questions, please contact your original point of purchase for assistance.”


Oh, Mary! writes on Instagram, “ATTN: all snowmen, ice bastards, etc. Both performances of OH, MARY! on Sunday, January 25 are currently scheduled to continue as planned.” Buena Vista Social Club plans to stay on schedule for its matinee, too, as does Operation Mincemeat, Oedipus, The Book of Mormon and most other Broadway productions.


	“Snow day, show day! Both of today's performances of The Book of Mormon (matinee and evening) will perform as scheduled. Need last minute seats? Get 2-for-1 or upgraded Broadway Week tickets…”


	Ticket holders are strongly advised to check the individual websites and Instagram pages of the various shows for updates.

Friendship never ends.

Victoria Beckham reunited with the Spice Girls at Emma Bunton's 50th birthday bash after her son Brooklyn Beckham's scathing statement against his family.

The designer, known as Posh Spice, was photographed posing with Geri Halliwell-Horner (Ginger Spice), Melanie “Mel C” (Sporty Spice) and Bunton (Baby Spice) in England, on Saturday, per an Instagram snap.

The beloved girl group, minus Melanie “Mel B” Brown (Scary Spice), cozied up together and smiled widely.

“Happy birthday to the most beautiful soul @emmaleebunton,” Victoria, 51, captioned the photo. “I love you girls so much @gerihalliwellhorner @melaniecmusic xxxxxxx.” 

The mom of four's husband, David Beckham, 50, gushed over the special moment in the comment section, writing, “This made me happy ❤️.

“I can only imagine how the spice girls (sic) fans feel 😍 @spicegirls 😍 @victoriabeckham special night celebrating Emma @emmaleebunton x.”

Bunton, who celebrated her milestone birthday on Jan. 21, also responded, “Love you all so much ❤️.”

Victoria, meanwhile, put on a brave face after Brooklyn, 26, issued a bombshell statement about how his “controlling” parents have attempted to ruin his relationship with his wife, Nicola Peltz, 31.

“I do not want to reconcile with my family,” he wrote via Instagram last week. “I'm standing up for myself for the first time in my life. For my entire life, my parents have controlled narratives in the press about our family.”

“Recently, I have seen with my own eyes the lengths that they'll go through to place countless lies in the media, mostly at the expense of innocent people, to preserve their own facade,” the chef added.

Brooklyn also alleged that Victoria backed out of making Peltz's wedding dress at the last minute, leaving her scrambling to find another.

He also claimed that the “Wannabe” songstress danced on him inappropriately at the reception.

While David and Victoria have yet to address the allegations, the latter reportedly feels “betrayed because she's done everything she can to make” her son and Peltz “feel welcome and love Nicola like another daughter.”

An insider told the Mirror that the pop star has previously worked to protect Brooklyn from stories that “did not always paint him in the best of lights.”

However, she now “feels it's been thrown back in her face.” Victoria would normally do anything to avoid a family fallout, but she thinks they're both being unreasonable.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Every song from 'Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping,' ranked","https://www.avclub.com/popstar-never-stop-never-stopping-songs-ranked","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 15:06:06 GMT","

For reasons that remain unclear to me personally, the internet has decided that 2016 was a golden age worth yearning for. I, on the other hand, remember it as a never-ending humiliation ritual, but, well, to each their own. But even I have to admit that there was one beacon of light amidst the constant terrors: Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping, The Lonely Island's egregiously underrated celeb mockumentary (think Spinal Tap, but about a Bieber-core megastar whose meteoric rise and catastrophic meltdown play out as a fever dream of pop hubris, tabloid excess, and brilliant stupidity). It skewers everything from Behind the Music tragedy porn to TMZ slime to the self-importance baked into every DJ Khaled “motivational” ad lib, while also churning out ridiculous banger after ridiculous banger—and to this day, it remains the only thing that makes 2016 worth thinking about.

The task that lies before me has been called impossible by lesser men. After all, how can one rank 23 perfect songs? But, luckily for us all, I am a greater woman—a greater woman who, crucially, has watched Popstar enough to have fully memorized the movie, meaning no one will watch it with her anymore because apparently “it's not fun to watch something when the person you're watching it with says all the lines out loud while they're happening, Casey” (incorrect). One of its songs even ranked third in my 2019 Spotify Wrapped. 

But while I am, of course, a Style Boy 4 Life, I am also a music critic. As regular Paste readers might know, I, Casey Epstein-Gross, do not fuck around with rankings, whether they concern horses, Pauls, cities, or anything else—and I do not plan to start now. Thus, each song will be subject to an extensive dissection, its merits comprehensively analyzed and explained. As readers, you all deserve better than some half-hearted, arbitrarily-devised ranking. And let it be known that this will not be some paltry list of the snippets of songs that we're shown in the movie. The Lonely Island was generous enough to bestow upon us a full soundtrack with full-length versions of each and every track (plus a few extra), and I would rather gruesomely and publicly kill myself than besmirch their gift by only providing a bit of measly commentary on the mere thirty-second clips included in the film. These songs simply bang too hard to not be judged in full; anything else would be criminal. And I may be a bitch, but I'm a law-abiding one.

So, with all of that out of the way, strap in, grab your AquaSpin refrigerators and shit-filled pancakes and wooden sculptures titled “Government in Crisis” (for obvious reasons), and come along for the ride. Doink-de-motherfucking-doink, everyone. 

Look, some song was going to have to be last. I don't like it, but it's true. And while Seal is as suave and smooth as ever in “Ashley Wednesday,” the song itself isn't the greatest. Which, to be fair, is the point; it's the cheesy, bad love song Seal sings while Conner proposes to his girlfriend (Ashley Wednesday, obviously), at least until Seal's dulcet tones make the wolves Conner rented from partywolves.com burst into simultaneous fits of rage and attack everyone present at the proposal, Seal himself included. So, sad as I am to do it, I think I need to follow the precedent set by the wolves and put this one last. Sorry, Seal. I hope your wolf-induced scars heal soon. 

“Should I Move” is a perfectly funny song, but I see why it was relegated to bonus track status. Tongue placed firmly in cheek, Samberg-as-Conner and frequent Lonely Island collaborator Akon rap sincerely about the deeply traumatizing experience of struggling to decide whether to buy another house after just buying a first one. It's a great, synth-heavy parody of the #struggles of the rich, but it's rather familiar both sonically and thematically, and while Lonely Island does as good a job of it as they do everything, it's simply less exciting than the rest.

An obvious send-up of pseudo-rebellious pop anthems like Miley's “We Can't Stop,” except here, anti-authority posturing gets taken to its logical extreme. It's funny, undoubtedly, to hear lines like “Fuck off, you can't teach me shit / And if I was you, I'd slit my wrist” and “I hope you get butt-fucked in prison” set to a song that's cheesy, cheery, and insufferably twee-pop enough to be mistaken for a little-known Owl City deep cut. But it's also not particularly memorable, nor is it something I take a great amount of pleasure in listening to (I have wished death upon the Owl City sound since I was a tween). Once again, I can see why this one was left on the cutting room floor.

In an album of intentionally stupid songs, “Ibitha” might just be the stupideth. Conner's premise is literally: Spaniards say “thpain,” so I wrote a “thong” about it. That conceit, predictably, cannot carry an entire track—and that's the bit. What you get is a mid-2010s club anthem delivered with an aggressive lisp, plus a vague haze of celebrity xenophobia that isn't quite as sharp or distinctive as the album's other parodies. “Ibitha” is probably my least favorite song from the movie proper—although I do deeply enjoy the sheer stupidity of the part where Conner sings “Our tummies are full of Paella /  Here's a recipe of the Paella” and then lists the ingredients of Paella. 

Another bonus song, and while I do enjoy it as a riff on, like, “Thrift Shop” and Watsky and other mid-2010s “weird” rap, I can once again see why this one was sidelined. I like the production and beat here a lot more than the synth-pop of “Should I Move?” and the Owl City tweetronica of “Fuck Off,” but overall, “I'm A Weirdo” doesn't really do anything that other Popstar songs don't already do—and do better. There's a bit of early Tyler in its DNA, with Samberg trying his best at a more abrasive flow, but it sounds, in all honesty, like a song that was written for Popstar before the writers came up with Hunter the Hungry, whose tracks take everything “I'm A Weirdo” does then quadruples down. Conner's “I use a Mach10 razor down here / Seven more blades cuz I like it sheer” walked so Hunter's “Shaved my balls (kept the hair) / Knit that shit into a sweater (motherfucker's itchy as shit)” could sprint.

Have you ever wondered what Peter Tosh's “Legalize It” would sound like if it were written by three white guys in their mid-20s and about crack instead of weed? Unfortunately, you no longer have to wonder. Style Boyz' “Legalize It” begins with Conner smoking a spliff from “the wisest rasta I ever saw” (“Roots and culture seeped from his bones,” in case the cringe wasn't clear yet), loving it, realizing it was crack, and then immediately committing to the lifestyle, a la Always Sunny's Dennis Reynolds: “I love crack (Holy shit) / And now I am invincible (Fuck yeah).” It's very stupid and very funny, and a genuinely successful parody of white-boy reggae posturing—but Popstar's best songs don't just work as jokes; they slap. And there is no universe in which I am voluntarily listening to Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, and Akiva Schaffer go full rasta outside of the end credits.

Early on in Popstar, Conner claims the rise of the Style Boyz was in large part due to people noticing that “our lyrics were beautiful and insightful, poetic even.” The film then immediately cuts to a shot of an underattended dive bar concert where all three Style Boyz jump around with reckless abandon while screaming: “You're a motherfucking, titty-sucking, two-balled bitch with a popcorn pussy and a full-on dick! / Style Boyz in the house and we give a fuck, / So whip out ya nuts and shut the fuck up!” That's “Rock Roll Skate.” Poetic, indeed. The song in full is somewhat less effective than that perfectly-slotted verse, in large part because excess is best in moderation—and, perhaps, in smaller part because the soundtrack version is a lot more produced and restrained than the balls-to-the-wall chaos we get onscreen. Let the boyz off the leash! God knows this song in particular calls for it.

“Donkey Roll” is Popstar's in-universe answer to “Watch Me (Whip/Nae Nae)” and “Crank That”: a song that exists primarily to sell a dance. And like its real-world counterparts, the dance is iconic while the song itself is…serviceable. This is not a flaw—if anything, it's the entire point—but it does mean that divorced from the choreography, “Donkey Roll” isn't something I feel particularly compelled to revisit. Don't get me wrong, I love the Donkey Roll! It took the world by storm! It's the reason Usher started dancing! But, well, that's the dance. This is the song. 

Alright, y'all. Lock in. From here on out, things start getting genuinely difficult; we've gotten rid of all the duds and dud-adjacents, and now some hard choices have to be made. Thus, “Me Likey Dat” lands here—not because it's bad, but because it lacks a singular, defining moment that separates it from the tracks above it. One of the Style Boyz' earliest in-universe songs, it's lo-fi, communal, and built around call-and-response goofing more than punchlines: “When [something good happens]” / “Me likey dat!” It sounds exactly like three friends fucking around before fame calcifies their instincts, which is both its greatest strength and its limitation. Dumb, charming, and fun—just not essential.

Considering this song's only lyrics are “Birds, wind and birds / They fill my heart up with darkness so cold”—and that, in the film, they're sung intentionally terribly—it might be surprising that “Owen's Song” wasn't just a shoo-in for the bottom five. To you. Yes, the lyrics here sound like a Charlie Kelly original, but at least in my world, that's a plus, not a minus. And, more importantly, the beat fucking rips. That's the reason this song exists in the film, anyways: to show both Conner and the audience how good a DJ Kid Contact actually is when Kid Conner isn't there to clip his wings, and yeah, man, he's fucking good. Put this on in any club, and people will lose their shit, especially if the people are me. Really, it's only this low because I actually prefer the horrifically shitty vocals in the movie version (again: in my personal ideal world, all songs would remind me of Charlie Kelly), and I resent the fact that they were yassified to hell and back. Give us the OG tapes! Let Owen suck!

We've arrived at the final bonus track—and, in my expert opinion, the only one that truly deserved to make it into the film. “Maximus” was clearly meant to accompany the scene in which Conner discovers his beloved pet turtle has succumbed to his lifelong battle with SBS (soggy bone syndrome), and you know what? It absolutely should have. Over reverb-soaked harmonies and mournful organ, a heavily-autotuned Conner grieves Maximus with lines like “Do you remember we dressed like Ninja Turtles on Halloween / Then they put you on their firing line and shot you down / Your blood stains the pages of my magazine”—which is, honest-to-god, some appallingly good lyricism. I am being completely serious when I say I would praise this writing even if it appeared on a non-parody album. I mean, the mundanity of the Halloween memory, the hyperbolic symbolism of the firing line, the imagery transforming grief into something small and tangible and visceral?! They'll kill me for this, but I have to say it anyways: that one-two-three punch contains better songwriting than the entirety of Life of a Showgirl (and, crazily enough, that is a comparison I have made before). Then Conner's vocals dissolve into gurgles and sobs, still filtered through intense autotune as if to convince us they're just runs, and it's legitimately, like, a little bit affecting. It's not one of the soundtrack's best jokes or its best standalone songs, but it is absolutely perfect for what it is. I'd even argue that Popstar's greatest (and possibly only) sin might be cutting it. Justice for Maximus.

In the film, “Sick Glenda” only exists as a half-remembered relic, with the Style Boyz—high as hell—trying and failing to recall how it even went. Somehow, the full version captures that exact energy without overproducing it into oblivion. The beat is bouncy and stupid, the crowd laughs along, and everything is kept just lo-fi enough to preserve the feeling of three friends riffing before fame rotted their brains. Lyrically, it's about a girl named Glenda who was always sick when the speaker called her: “Glenda are you dying, or just avoiding me? / Either way's a bummer but I hope you're dying.” It's simple, it's dumb, and it feels perfectly in line with the early, pre-mythologized Style Boyz we only ever get glimpses of. Slight, sure—but deeply charming. Sometimes you just wanna know if your situationship is ditching you or not, and “Sick Glenda” is an awfully endearing way to do it.

There is not a Hunter the Hungry song in Popstar that doesn't go hard as hell. Hell, I maybe like them more than the early Tyler, the Creator tracks they're sending up, which is hugely embarrassing to admit as a music critic, but I need to speak my truth. Hear me out: it's like listening to Bastard or Goblin (complete with intentional fuck-you-I'm-edgy provocations a la “My grandmama is hot it makes me sick / It makes me wanna make out with her and suck on her tits”) without any of the cringe, because it's not actually being edgy or crude or violent for the hurr-durr-shock-value, it's satirizing that mindset. All the fun, (almost) none of the aging like milk. It just rules, man. The only reason this lands outside the top ten is simple: it serves the same purpose as another Hunter track that I just happen to like a little bit better. 

I am obsessed with this song in both theory and practice. In-universe, “Things In My Jeep” is Lawrence “Kid Brain” Dunn's desperate solo bid for relevance after being iced out of the Style Boyz—a bid that fails spectacularly, for reasons best enumerated by a sheepish Nas in a talking head I think about on the daily: “I didn't really relate to that song, because, you know, I had different things in my Jeep than he had in his Jeep.” Unfortunately, I can't fault Nas for his take, because holy shit does Lawrence have a lot of weird shit in his Jeep—by my count, Lawrence Dunn has 63 unique items in his Jeep, ranging from the small and feasible (Tic Tacs, condoms, exactly three quarters) to the overlarge (a whole American flag, a laundry heap, a surfboard). And every 20 or so items, we're treated to Linkin Park's Chester Bennington (?!?!) screaming “THESE ARE THE THINGS IN MY JEEP!!!” like his life depends on it, and if you haven't experienced it at least once in your life, you are not living. Does it work as a song? I mean, no, man, it's a list of things one guy has in his Jeep with no commentary save for “Prepare for adventure inside my Jeep / These are the things in my Jeep.” Do I care? Not even remotely. If this list was purely subjective, this song would rocket up into the top 5, because I fucking adore it—but I do understand Nas's critique, so here it falls. But Lawrence, my sweet prince, please know that if I were in the Popstar universe, I would have streamed this into platinum, items in my own Jeep be damned.

If we were only ranking the snippets as they appear in the film, “Mona Lisa” wouldn't stand a chance. But man, the song in full… I see the vision. I really do. It's an absolute earworm: glossy synths, falsetto hooks, a soulful bridge, and even a bizarre swerve into patriotism at the end, with Conner solemnly declaring, “I'm an American man, this is my native land / Where no one lies about paintings / But that's not the case in France.” (Damn right. ‘Murica, baby!) We get a whole verse of Conner shitting on none other than the Great Pyramid of Giza (“What did I find there? A dirty pile of bricks”), but the punchline doesn't come until the next chorus: “Mona Lisa, you're worse than the pyramids.” Other highlights include “Da Vinci must have sucked an art historian's dick,” accusing Mona Lisa of looking like uncooked bread (true) and needing some Rogaine (admittedly, also true), and the revelation that she resembles Dennis Franz—which, after looking it up, I regret to inform you is accurate. “Mona Lisa” is ridiculous, it's catchy, and once it's in your head, it will stay there, mocking you, as the image of Mona Lisa as NYPD Detective Andy Sipowicz now mocks me.

Much like “Mona Lisa,” this is a song I didn't realize would end up so high before I actually sat down and thought about it. While it works well in Popstar itself—as the backdrop for Conner4Real and Hunter the Hungry becoming BFFs4Life—the snippets in the film do not do justice to how much of a banger it really is. With riotous sax, maximalist production, an effervescently jaunty beat, and genuinely fun, spiky flows from both Chris Redd and Andy Samberg, “2 Banditos” is, against all odds, a legitimate bop (and by the “odds” it's against I am of course referring to lines like “Fucked your first cousin with a didgeridoo / And when she came, it sounded like ‘Wowowowowowowoowow'”). Samberg isn't as naturally sharp a rapper as Redd, but here it's like mere proximity juices his game; after Hunter spits “I'm on some white boy shit man, tryna stack a mil,” Conner jumps right in with “Yeah I'm also on my white boy shit, that's my birth right,” then follows it with “Call my dick the shooting star”—cue Hunter's quickfire interjection of “why?”—“'cause it burns right.” Killer Mike and El-P who? Also, the delivery of “do a little dance and drink a little WATAH” lives rent-free in my head and frequently reappears to guilt me into hydrating, and I appreciate the benefits to my health.

To once again quote beloved rapper Nas, “‘Karate Guy'? Are you kidding me, man? That song changed my life.” Look, I genuinely don't know what, exactly, “Karate Guy” could possibly be parodying, but you couldn't pay me to care. It's stupid to the point of being downright baffling, and I wouldn't want it any other way. The song is ostensibly about two things: liking to “kick it” while wearing cowboy hats, and painstakingly overexplaining extremely common slang. But you know what? Both of those things are utterly foundational to the human experience, and never have either been distilled into song as simply and beautifully as they are in “Karate Guy.” Like, fuck it, they're right; I am a karate guy! I don't care what temperature it is when I hang out with my friends, so long as it's “60° or 80° / There just has to be friends”! I do like to kick it—and when I say I like to kick it, I do mean “hanging out, dude, not kicking something with my foot”—and when I say anything, I do unnecessarily clarify my meaning out loud and at length because I live in constant fear of being misunderstood! Nas has never been more correct. “Karate Guy” is the song of my generation—nay, perhaps the song of the human race.  

The first (almost) full song we hear in the film, “I'm So Humble” is introduced by a little monologue from Conner4Real himself: “My fans and me, we're in love. My songs are love letters, and the arena is our bedroom. The stage… The stage is where we fuck.” Then the opening sample from The Marcels' 1961 “Heartaches” busts in, and reader, I gotta tell you—to continue Conner4Real's apt metaphor—I bust too. The concept is simple (a celebrity brags about how humble they are, and irony abounds) but, god, is it executed perfectly: “I guess in a way, bein' gracious is my weakness,” Conner shrugs, cheeky, “People say I'm so unpretentious for a genius.” The production is phenomenal, the hook is irresistibly sticky, and the song uses Dikembe Mutombo getting covered in a big pot of gumbo as a baseline measurement for humility—what's not to love? Even Mariah Carey adores it. It's a perfect thesis statement for Conner as a character and an unbeatable introduction to his solo career, and arguably one of the best pop parodies The Lonely Island has written, beautiful in its simplicity. It is also, by a wide margin, the best thing Adam Levine has ever done, and he should be sending The Lonely Island handwritten thank-you notes for the rest of his life.

Look me in the eyes and tell me this song doesn't fuck. You simply can't. This hit single from Claudia Cantrell (a fictional Katy-Perry-type played by a perfectly-cast Emma Stone) opens with a brutal, addictive beat that just screams early-2010s, The E.N.D-era pop, followed by Stone sexily whispering nonsense in Spanish before immediately translating said nonsense to English for all us idiot anglophiles (my favorite being “El burro es grande / That's a really big donkey!”), and then the chorus kicks us into a new stratosphere. The lyrics are aggressively stupid and rather gross (“Turn up the beef / Throw your body on the flame / Let your meat release / Juices dripping down like rain”) but Stone sells them. I would have played the absolute shit out of this in 2010. But none of that is why it's here. The Catchphrase Verse—“as it's now known”—is “Turn Up the Beef”'s raison d'etre. In-universe, it's Conner4Real's big post-Style Boyz breakout moment, but it is iconic in every universe. 

Of the 24 catchphrases here, not one makes sense—and not one misses. Sorry, Dad! Inky nuts! Squirrel jam! HATS! Balancing my checkbook! 100 gift baskets! You're now rocking with the Tesla boys! Baby Benjamin Franklin! Moped music! Costco samples like a mothafucka! Patrick Stewart money! I mean, need I go on? Every single one of these catchphrases is earthshattering, groundbreaking, history-making. To quote DJ Khaled, “When you have a catch phrase, the world is catched by your phrase.” And when you have 24 catch phrases, the world instantly detonates in sheer awe. I'm so catched by these phrases it's crazy.

Every movie-musical needs its grand conclusion, and Popstar does not disappoint. “Incredible Thoughts” pulls out all the stops, and by “stops” I mean Michael Bolton, a fish-costume-wearing Justin Timberlake (in-character as chef Tyrus Quash), the open ocean, a mid-song sax solo, ballet dancers, and gorgeously maximalist production. I particularly appreciate that The Lonely Island did not take the coward's way out and make the Style Boyz' triumphant reunion—Conner's stage presence finally buoyed by Owen's beats and Lawrence's lyrics once more—an actually good song with actually good lyrics. No, man, it's dumb as hell—but it's performed like it's the greatest piece of art ever created, and that sincerity is what makes it work. 

We're told Lawrence has spent his exile on a bumfuck-nowhere weed farm writing poetry, spinning beauty into truth with questions like: What if a garbage man was secretly smart? What if a man's ears were so big it demanded an apology? What if a house cat was addicted to “THA COCAINE”? Conner and Owen hear these revelations and, naturally, react like they've discovered the Dead Sea Scrolls. And because the film commits to that premise with a straight face—because everyone in the Popstar universe, talking heads included, treats the song as genuinely world-altering—a little part of you does, too. It's just so sweet! So grand! So wondrous! The Style Boyz are back and they're making a fish sing and they're doing the Donkey Roll onstage with Usher and they're singing a song that is ending all evil and everything is right and good in the world and nothing will ever be bad again! The boyz are right: “[their] minds blow my mind.” Incredible thoughts, indeed. How did their brain conceive them?

I mentioned earlier that a Popstar song landed in my 2019 Spotify Wrapped, and I am proud to announce it was none other than dark horse contender “Hunter the Hungry is Gon' Eat.” Yes, really. Look. This track just fucking rules. Like “Hey Ya Ho,” it's a perfect Odd Future parody, but it's also just a great song—meaner, grimier, catchier, stupider. The beat is unforgiving. The vocal pitch shifts are phenomenal. The chorus is monotone and hard as shit: “One round, head down, eyes up, nose down / Hunter the Hungry is gonna eat.” Chris Redd's harsh snarl is simultaneously furiously emotive and deeply indifferent, which is basically the exact sweet spot those early Tyler records were always trying to hit—and holy fuck, does he murder the flow throughout. The lyrics win the IDGAF championships every time: “Fuck a chorus, fuck my moms, fuck your dad, fuck this song / Seriously though, fuck this song, I can't stand it man, fuck this song, yo” (a line that, frankly, does a hell of a lot more for gay marriage than Conner's own “Equal Rights”; shoutout Hunter's gay moms, I guess!). 

My only gripe—aside from the use of the r-word, which, yes, unfortunately comes with the Tyler territory—is that I wish it were longer. Give me more of Hunter “eating beefcakes in the back of a Ford Taurus”! Give me more Dada nonsense about Campbell's Soup! Give me more grotesque little images about rabies babies and dick warts and itchy-as-shit pubic hair sweaters! Are the lyrics mostly gibberish? But I understand them. (“Blah blah, rap rap rap rap rap / You get it, you get it, everybody gets it”—and we do!). I wish I could put into words why this song rules as hard as it does, but there's something ineffable about it; I simply feel divinely compelled to replay it over and over. But to quote 2026's first meme, the newly-famous Tamara, “Hey so it actually only has to make sense to me and I don't feel like explaining it to anyone else.” And if that's not the most Hunter the Hungry mindset I've ever heard, I don't know what is. Chris Redd, I insist you enter the rap game post-haste. The people (me) need you. 

In his 2013 hit “Talk Dirty,” Jason Derulo sang about hooking up with girls whose native languages he couldn't understand. “Finest Girl” is Conner4Real's take on the “Talk Dirty” genre of mid-2010s pop (and looking at how stupid Derulo's is, it's a concerningly good one)—except this time the girl's dirty talk is perfectly intelligible on a linguistic level, just baffling on every other one: “Knew she was a freak when she started talking,” Conner croons, “She said… ‘Fuck me like we fucked Bin Laden.'” Perhaps this is what Derulo's girls were saying all along and he simply never knew.

As all “freaky kind of girls” are wont to do, Conner's girl keeps up with world events—or, “More specifically, one event / The time Osama Bin Laden got shot in the head.” And when she requests “intercourse to bring her to climax / With the clinical efficiency of the assassination of Bin Laden,” she means it: turban, tunic, full roleplay. The song is, perhaps, the best showing of The Lonely Island's talent for ridiculously brilliant and brilliantly ridiculous lyricism in the entirety of Popstar, which is saying something. It's so fucking dumb (“She said ‘Invade my cave with your special unit' / I said ‘He wasn't in a cave' but there was no stopping'”), yet it's also a pitch-perfect ridiculing of not only Derulo's inanity (“You're harboring a fugitive / Dat ass! / And my justice will be punitive / Imma smash”), but, oh, you know, the entirety of the “merciless and exact” American geopolitical self-mythology—and yes, that part lands even harder now that our godawful President would absolutely call Conner up and be like, “Come give me the deets in the White House Garden / I gots to know how you fucked her like we fucked Bin Laden.” Also, the song—not unlike the gun that shot Osama Bin Laden—simply bangs. It just bangs, and it's important for me that you know that.

This is—and I do not say this lightly—a perfect song. A merciless parody of Macklemore's painfully earnest 2012 anthem “Same Love” (which spent an impressive amount of time clarifying that Macklemore himself does not share the affliction commonly known as homosexuality), “Equal Rights” doesn't just satirize ally-pop, but takes Macklemore out back and shoots him in the head. Conner's not gay, guys, but if he was, he would want equal rights. He's not gay, but if he was, he would marry who he likes. “It's not fair,” he bemoans—”I'm not gay!” he cuts in—”that the government has a say in who can love who (I'm not gay!), or to which god you can pray (I'm not gay!!!)”

But the song's real genius is structural. Each verse escalates the same joke, with Conner's parenthetical asides growing longer, louder, stranger, and more desperate: first a simple “not gay,” then a reassuring “titties,” then a flurry of heterosexual signifiers (“beers, hoagies, sweatpants, not gay!”), until the final verse collapses into a panicked game of full-blown free association from the mind of a man in the midst of a homophobic psychotic break. For every one “gay is okay!” affirmation, there are about four “I have no qualms about calling you a slur” phrases (“Predator, flying kicks, not gay, big watch, not gay, missionary” goes the string following “true love trumps all,” for instance). 

Not only is it hilarious to see the cultural signifiers Conner believes to be the pinnacle of heterosexuality—lighter fluid, HD television, nunchucks, gym socks, Lynyrd Skynyrd, one-armed push-ups, and many more—Samberg's machine-gun delivery transforms all of it into gibberish run-on sentences, making it impossible to tell which phrases are meant as support and which are denial without further examination. By the end, Conner is frenzied and chanting “I'm not not not not not not not gay,” and the song's original message is long since obliterated. P!nk begrudgingly swoops in on a rainbow unicorn to sing about self-love, Conner keeps interrupting her with “I'm straight!” and “You're gay!” while she side-eyes him with disgust, and the whole thing lands in perfect, catastrophic form. Tragically, the final punchline only exists in the film itself, but it's too good not to include here: a talking head cameo from Ringo Starr, of all people, pops up just afterward, with Starr noting in mild confusion, “He's writing a song for gay marriage. You know, like it's not allowed. It's allowed now.” Absolute cinema.

Natasha Lyonne has stepped forward with a rare and vulnerable confession about her life. She took to her social media account to share that she has relapsed after nearly a decade of sobriety. 

The Emmy-nominated star revealed the news in her own words, choosing honesty and openness as she addressed the moment publicly.

“Took my relapse public, more to come,” Lyonne, 46, wrote in a post shared Friday, January 23, on X. 

She later responded to a fan offering support, adding, “Thanks, boss … for the grace, etc. Sending love back your way. May become a pothead or a nun. TBD.”

Her candid admission was met with an immediate outpouring of support from fans, many of whom Lyonne acknowledged with heart emojis and brief messages of gratitude as she navigates the next chapter of her recovery.

Fans responded with compassion, honesty, and solidarity, applauding Lyonne for her openness. 

Messages urged her to show herself grace, with one supporter writing, “Go easy on yourself,” while another added, “Hope you're doing okay, that's a tough thing to share.”

Others praised her courage and transparency. “Proud of you. Secrets multiply this disease….making public kills it. Addiction and recovery is a LIFELONG process. However… no matter how many steps back you take, it doesn't erase the HUGE leaps forward. You are an inspiration for many of us fighting….relapse or not. ❤️” one fan wrote. 

Another echoed that sentiment, saying, “Hey, it happens. It's not always a sweet story, but it needs to be told.”

Several messages came from those on similar paths. “Sending healing energy from one sober person to another ~~,” one supporter shared, while another reminded her gently, “you're only human, living life one day at a time like the rest of us.”

In a follow-up post early Saturday, January 24, Lyonne expanded on where she stands in her recovery.

“Recovery is a lifelong process. Anyone out there struggling, remember you're not alone,” the “Poker Face” star wrote. 

“Grateful for love and smart feet. Gonna do it for baby Bambo. Stay honest, folks. Sick as our secrets.”

She continued with another message centered on compassion and perseverance.

“If no one told ya today, I love you. No matter how far down the scales we have gone, we will see how our experience may help another. Keep going, kiddos. Don't quit before the miracle. Wallpaper your mind with love. Rest is all noise and baloney.”

Lyonne later thanked fans individually, writing “Love ya back” to one supporter and telling another, “We need better systems and to end shame — bill the Sacklers and stilettos or something but don't @ me for getting honest.”

Lyonne has spoken openly for years about her struggles with addiction, which began in the early 2000s and escalated quickly. 

In a 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly, she reflected on how dangerous and overwhelming that period of her life became. “Spiraling into addiction is really, really scary. Some things have a very A-to-B scientific effect,” she said at the time. 

“Like, alcohol is a depressant. Cocaine is a stimulant. And then, Cocaine plus heroin is bad! That's the point of my story, that's the moral. Coke plus heroin equals speedball. And speedball equals bad, you know?”

She went on to describe the gravity of that chapter with blunt honesty. 

“It's weird to talk about. I was definitely as good as dead, you know? A lot of people don't come back. That makes me feel wary and self-conscious. I wouldn't want to feel prideful about it. People really rallied around me and pulled me up by my [Expeltive] bootstraps.”

As per EW, Lyonne entered inpatient rehab in 2006 and, after getting sober, slowly rebuilt both her health and her career.

 She returned to acting with a 2008 off-Broadway production of “Two Thousand Years,” which she later credited as a turning point.

“[The play] really got me back on my feet,” she told EW. “It all sort of happened. I was on Pee-wee‘s, then I'm 16, and I'm in a Woody Allen movie. I never stopped to wonder if I knew how to act. I had to relearn it all and come by it in a much more honest fashion.”

As her career found renewed momentum, including widespread acclaim for projects such as “Russian Doll,” Lyonne continued to speak openly about recovery, accountability, and self-awareness.

 In a 2017 interview with The Guardian, she explained why honesty has remained central to her journey.

“I'm such an open book that I have no problem talking about it and speaking freely, but I've sort of said my piece on the subject,” she said. “The truth is, at the back of that addiction are feelings that so many of us have, that don't go away.”

She added, “Isn't everyone entitled to a moment of existential breakdown in a lifetime? Adulthood is making peace with being kind to oneself when a response to life that's so much more organic and immediate would be to self-destruct.”

Now, as she moves through this latest chapter, Lyonne continues to emphasize honesty, connection, and compassion, both toward herself and toward others navigating similar paths.

Warning: Spoilers for “Caught by Love” ahead!

Hallmark transported viewers to the Mediterranean island of Malta in “Caught by Love,” which premiered as part of the network's “Winter Escape” event. We recapped the entire film live so fans wouldn't miss a single swoon-worthy scene.

The film follows resort guest Annie (Rachael Leigh Cook), who, while on a journey of self-discovery, gets swept into an undercover investigation for stolen jewels that turns into an unexpected and adventurous romance. Luke Macfarlane plays private investigator Jake.

Read on for our complete recap of the film's most heartwarming moments.

Catch up on our live updates from “Caught by Love” when it premiered on the Hallmark Channel on Saturday, January 24, 2026:

Annie arrives at the hotel in a stunning red dress. She takes her sunglasses off, in awe of the view. She heads inside to the hotel lobby, but she accidentally trips. Jake is introduced as he helps her gather her things from the ground. The two part, but before Jake walks away, he notices the initials “JM” on Annie's luggage.

Annie goes to check in under the name “Joanna Mitchum.” A staff member shows Annie outside to give her a tour of the hotel, claiming that sometimes people just need “a new perspective” while on vacation.

We're introduced to a few guests: Kim, an influencer, as she shows off the pool to her followers. A couple sitting by the pool arguing as the husband can't stop going on his phone. Another man jumps into the pool. Another woman complains to a staff member at the pool that the chlorine is too strong for her.

Annie is shown to her room. She has a beautiful view of the Mediterranean. She's given an itinerary for her week long stay. She's told that Robert Carlyle, the owner of the hotel, will be there at the welcome dinner.

Annie makes a phone call to her friend Joanna, where she relays how her trip has been going so far. It's revealed that she was able to take Joanna's reservation since Joanna couldn't make it on the trip. Annie also took Joanna's luggage and her clothes on this trip. Joanna tells Annie when she stayed at the hotel that she left with a sense of clarity, and she deserves to have the same thing happen to her after everything she's done.

Later, at the welcome dinner, Robert is speaking to the guests. He says that their stay will be “a truly transformational experience.” He hopes that everyone leaves the resort with a renewed sense of purpose. Then he thanks everybody. 

Annie is sat at a table with influencer Kim. When Annie tries to order coffee from the waitress, the only beverages they have to offer are detox related. Annie tells Kim this is the first vacation she's had in a while. Kim tells her she's been wanting to come to the hotel for years. She also catches Annie staring at Jake at another table. Kim encourages Annie to go say “hello” to him, but Annie tells her that she's here to work on herself, not look for romance. Kim argues she can do both.

Meanwhile at Jake's table, the couple from the pool is there along with the woman who was complaining about the pool's chlorine levels. She's wearing a necklace that he keeps eyeing. 

Later, Annie finds Jake outside taking photos of birds. She goes up to him and gives him advice on the lens he's using. She admits that her mom was a photographer, so she picked up a few things. Jake thanks her for the tip, then he takes a photo of her. Jake insists that it's a great picture despite Annie's protests. When Jake thinks that Annie isn't looking, he starts taking photos of the guests down at the beach.

Back at her room, Annie discovers she's next door neighbors with the couple from earlier. He's on the phone with someone again. When his wife joins him outside, they introduce themselves as Caroline and Peter.

Jake is back in his room, and the staff member from the pool is there, too. Her name is Laura. Turns out, they're both undercover and working together. Jake thinks that Annie is Joanna Mitchum because of the initials on her luggage. The two go over the guests: Rebecca, with the necklace, is royalty, Colin, who jumped in the pool, is from silicone valley, Kimberly is a popular influencer, Peter is a real estate mogul, and his wife is a philanthropist. It's also their anniversary. 

In the newspaper, it reveals that there was a museum break-in and there's a reward for the necklace stolen. They have six days to figure out who the buyer of the necklace they're looking for is.

The next day, they're all about to go on a bike riding excursion. Jake goes up to Annie to talk to her, admitting it's been a while since he's biked. The group begin sight seeing. Annie helps Colin fix his bike. Jake is impressed by her skills. He hears Colin call her Annie. So, they officially introduce themselves. He asks about the initials on her luggage, so Annie admits that the luggage is her friend Joanna's, as well as her reservation. Jake makes it his mission to find out who Annie Collins is.

Annie explains that she knows everyone in the group, as she uses memory games to remember everyone's name.

Later, Jake is speaking to Laura. They were able to find out everything on Joanna, like the fact that she's a CEO of a cosmetic company. So, they think maybe Annie is doing her “dirty work.”

Meanwhile, Annie is at another session. She's trying to do aerial yoga. Kim notices that she's struggling, so they go to get a healthy beverage by the pool instead. Kim gets a text message that Annie notices she's troubled by. Jake interrupts them and asks Annie to lunch. Kim answers yes for her.

While at lunch, Jake notices her expensive watch, which surprises Annie, as it's Joanna's. Annie tells Jake that Joanna came to the hotel two years prior and it was life changing, which makes Jake ask if Annie wants to change her life, but Annie doesn't answer. Jake asks what Annie does for work, and she answers that she's in finance, too. But Annie doesn't want to be defined by her job, so she asks Jake what he likes to do instead, and he tells her he likes to collect stamps. Annie leaves lunch in a rush because she has to get to her next session.

Annie is in her next session. While she's trying to relax, the teacher tells Annie she needs to write a list of everything she wants to accomplish. It's time to leave the old Annie behind.

Meanwhile, Jake found Annie's Instagram account with Laura. She thinks that maybe Annie really is just on vacation. Their conversation is interrupted when Laura is told by her superior that she has to teach the next class.

Annie is with Kim again. Annie explains that she just got out of a relationship where she was trying to force a collection. She wants a genuine connection. Laura arrives. She's teaching the “herbal medicine” class, but she has no idea what she's doing. 

Annie is outside. She starts talking to Caroline, who tells her she's been here before. Caroline explains that when she came last, she was on a girl's trip. She was paired with Peter during one of the outings at the hotel. When she met him, he was spontaneous and full of life. Retelling this story seems to make her sad. She goes back inside the hotel room, leaving her sunglasses outside. 

Caroline and Peter are at the pool. He's distracted by his phone again.

Jake is on his way to room 17, which is Caroline and Peter's room. Annie catches him walking into the room.

Jake is busy searching the room. Annie walks into the room and confronts Jake searching through someone else's room. Jake admits he's a PI trying to track down a necklace stolen from the Met, and he believes one of the guests is here to buy it. He realizes that Caroline is on her way back, so he takes Annie outside to keep talking to her. Now, Annie thinks Jake was only speaking to her because he thought she was a jewel thief. Annie and Jake make it back to her balcony before Caroline gets outside. Annie promises Jake she won't tell anyone before he leaves. 

Later, when Annie is at aerial yoga again, she finds the article about the stolen necklace, and she realizes that Jake is right.

Meanwhile, Jake is at the pool listening to Colin on the phone. He hears him on the phone talking about a plan he has. Annie shows up and continues her conversation with Jake about the necklace. He admits “we” got an anonymous tip about the guest, and he reveals that Laura is actually working with him. They got a note signed by an “X.” Jake tells Annie he doesn't need anyone interfering with his investigation. They run into Caroline, who invites her and Jake to go into town as a double date. Jake asks Annie for her help and wants her to accept the invitation, so she does.

Jake tries to talk to Peter and asks about what kind of watch he's wearing. Peter just replies “expensive.” Caroline and Annie are in a jewelry store. Caroline comments on the fact that Peter has been on his phone the whole vacation. He suggested this trip, and Caroline thought it was to reconnect, but Peter's mind has been somewhere else entirely, so she's confused why he brought them there.

Now Jake needs to figure out who Peter has been on the phone with the whole time. Caroline asks Jake to take a photo of her and Peter. So, Peter has to hand Jake his phone for them to pose. While pretending to take a photo of them on Peter's phone, he scrolls through the phone. He finds a message from someone confirming a meeting the following day.

Later, Annie finds Jake swimming in the pool. He says it helps him clear his head. Annie joins him. Jake thanks Annie for her help that day. She feels bad for Caroline, since she doesn't seem to know what they're really doing there. Jake disagrees. Annie calls him out for assuming the worst in people, which he blames on his line of work. Annie thinks that someday someone is going to surprise Jake, and he tells her “I hope so.”

Jake shows up to Annie's room even later that night with a box of pizza, as they haven't had any unhealthy food since being there. They eat together. She asks how Jake knew Caroline was going to ask to take their photo. He tells Annie his observations about her, like she's sentimental. He claims to be good at reading people since he has 15 years of experience. So, Annie asks Jake to “read” her, too. Jake clocks that Annie is at a crossroads. He notices she feels out of her element, she's a rule follower, she's a planner, which makes him think that something in her life took her off her plane. He also calls her clever and knows she likes helping people. He rightfully guesses she wanted to be a lawyer. Annie tells him it didn't happen because her mom got sick, so she took a job at a local bank and got comfortable. Annie can't help but wonder if she's where she's supposed to be, so that's why she went on this trip. Jake observes that Annie is stronger than she gives herself credit for, and he tells her he likes her just the way she is.

The next day, Annie and Jake show up to the meeting Peter was supposed to be at. Annie asks Jake why he wanted to be a PI. He was on the police force for a decade, but then he decided he wanted to work a case on his own. When he solved the case and made his client happy, he knew he wanted to do that going forward. To solve this case, Jake tells Annie he just needs to get the right photos then send it to the proper authorities. Annie asks what Jake is going to do after he gets the photos. He tells her he's going to leave, but hopefully they can go out and celebrate first. 

Jake and Annie spot Caroline show up to the meeting spot without Peter. At first, they think maybe she's the one behind it. Turns out, Peter was setting all of this up to surprise Caroline with a sweet romantic gesture. This is why Peter was so distracted.

This means, they still don't know who the buyer is.

Jake admits to Annie that owning his own PI business is expensive, and Laura left an important career because she believed in him, but he's not sure how much longer he can keep them afloat. Therefore, he needs this case to work out. Annie tells Jake he wants to help them, for the greater good. She plans to just talk to the guests without taking any unnecessary risks. This makes Annie and Jake officially a team.

Later, Robert is hosting another dinner. Every guest stands up at the front with him in front of everyone else and says what they want to achieve. When Annie says she wants a house, Robert calls her out on this and asks if this is what she really wants. He tells her to give it another shot. Annie goes back to her seat.

After dinner, Annie follows Rebecca and hides behind the bushes to spy on her. While Kim is walking by, she notices Annie hiding in the bushes.

Laura disagrees with letting Annie help them, but Jake claims that she'll be useful. They need every set of eyes they can get. 

Annie and Jake are at the pool together watching another guest, Mr. Evers. Laura is there with them folding towels as she continues to pretend to be a staff member. Annie finds out that Jake and Laura used to be partners on the police force. He also admits that he's single. While Jake and Laura are discussing how to get more information, Annie goes to talk to Mr. Evers herself. She finds out more information about him after their conversation. Even Laura is impressed.

The next excursion is rock climbing. Jake encourages Annie to do it, despite being scared. Annie notices Kim distraught by another text. It's her boyfriend, who's stuck in London because of weather. Annie speaks to Robert. She asks his advice on how to figure out what she really wants. He believes she'll never be able to move forward if she's being controlled by fear. Annie decides to go rock climbing after all. Jake is at the top of the rock cheering her on along with the other guests. She makes it to the top after grabbing Jake's hand. They hug. She's in awe of herself.

Rebecca goes up to Annie. She tells her that her and Jake are the talk of the resort because everyone loves a good love story. But Rebecca is worried that Annie is getting caught up in something that isn't real since they're on vacation, and she warns Annie that it's very easy to “lose your heart if you're not careful.”

After rock climbing, Jake gives Annie white a rose from one of the tables. She tells him how much it meant to have him up there cheering her on, and Jake tells her she's easy to root for. They wish each other a good night. 

When Annie gets back to her balcony with her rose, Caroline is out on her own balcony. Annie is afraid that the feelings she has for Jake isn't real because they're on vacation. But Caroline asks Annie if she wants this to be real. Annie does. Caroline encourages her to tell Jake, then.

The next day, Annie overhears Colin speaking to someone on the phone. She tries to call Jake, but he's too busy in aerial yoga to hear her phone call. So, Annie goes to follow Colin by herself. He's heading to a yacht. She runs after him. She catches him shaking hands with someone and thanking them. Annie takes a photo of them on the boat.

Jake finally gets Annie's texts and sees that she's going on the boat by herself. So, he rushes out of yoga. 

Annie overhears Colin telling the man he's meeting that he'll wire him the money. But Annie's phone rings while she's on the dock listening to their conversation, giving her away. 

The boat is leaving, forcing Jake to swim after it. When he joins Annie aboard, it turns out that Colin just bought that boat. 

When they're back on land, Jake is lecturing Annie that he told her not to take risks. He was scared she could've been hurt. He regrets dragging her into this. So, he tells Annie to go back to the resort because he doesn't need her help anymore.

Annie gets back to the hotel and finds Joanna in the lobby. She wanted to spend the last couple of days she had together.

Later, after Annie fills Joanna in on everything, Annie admits she'd like to reapply to law school, but she's afraid of going backwards. Joanna tells Annie that she wanted her to take the time to figure out what made her happy, and if going back to school does that, then she wants her to go for it.

The next day, Jake finds Annie practicing aerial yoga all by herself. She finally figures it out. 

Jake and Laura discuss their plan. This is their last shot to figure out who the buyer is. There's an event with all the guests. Laura is working the party while Jake is in attendance. Annie brings Joanna to the event, too. Robert gives another speech to the guests. He thanks them and toasts to life being too short to not going after what you want.

Kim gets a text that makes her happy. She runs away. Jake notices this, so him and Annie go after her.

Annie and Jake find that Kim was meeting her boyfriend, who just showed up with a case. Jake looks inside the case. It's just camera equipment for Kim's vlogs. 

Jake goes back to his room and looks through his photos to see if he missed anything. He realizes that Robert was in the background of every photo.

Back at the party, Robert excuses himself for a meeting.

Jake and Annie both figure out that it's him. They follow Robert and find him buying the necklace, so Jake takes the photos he needs. But they're caught and brought to Robert, who discovers the photos. Jake takes the stolen necklace in the case and runs away with it until the feds show up. Turns out, Mr. Evens is a federal agent. Robert gets arrested by them.

Back at the party later that evening, Jake asks Annie to dance. Jake apologizes to Annie for the other night and tells her he couldn't have done this without her. 

The party breaks up as everyone finds out what happened with Robert. They also discover that Rebecca is Robert's ex-girlfriend.

Jake and Annie embrace and share a sweet kiss. He tells Annie he's going to give her a cut of the reward since she earned it. He tells her how much money she'd be getting, and she's in shock. He suggests she could use it towards law school tuition.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Fans Send Congratulations as HGTV's Jasmine Roth Reaches Major Milestone","https://entertainmentnow.com/hgtv/jasmine-roth-milestone-jcpenney-photoshoot/","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 12:09:38 GMT","

“Help! I Wrecked My House” star Jasmine Roth took to Instagram earlier this week, begging fans for help reaching a major milestone. Just days later, she achieved her goal and fans were overjoyed.

The HGTV star shared the exciting news that she reached 700,000 Instagram followers and won a friendly competition with husband Brett Roth, on Saturday, January 24. 

“Oh, my goodness! Look at this. Do you see what that is?” she said, showing her phone to her husband.

Brett couldn't “believe it,” saying, “It's gotta be fake, right?”

“No, it's not fake. This is real!” Jasmine exclaimed. 

Brett's theory was that his wife “took a screenshot” from somebody else's profile and “put her face on it.”

“No! This is 700,000 followers, way before Valentine's Day,” the designer said. 

The playful competition between spouses began after Jasmine asked her husband to partake in an awkward JCPenney photoshoot for Valentine's Day. 

After initially saying no, Brett made Jasmine an offer. 

If the HGTV star could gain 20,000 followers, bringing her Instagram following from 680,000 to 700,000, before Valentine's Day, Brett would agree to the holiday antics.

“You guys! I want this so bad,” Jasmine begged in the video shared on January 20. “Follow, then unfollow, I don't care but please! We have to do this JCPenney photo shoot.”

It didn't take long for fans to come through. 

“WE DID IT!!! THIS IS HAPPENING!! YOU GUYS ROCK!!! 👏❤️🏆😃🥳😍” she captioned her Saturday post. “Read it and weep Brett- hahaha!! His face when he realizes he's going to actually have to do this photoshoot. 💀💀”

The comments section of Roth's announcement was flooded with fans who helped make her dream a reality. 

“That look was TOO funny🤣🎉🎉 Can't wait to see the pictures🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻” one follower wrote.

“😂😂 You win! Honestly the algorithms have been sending me your posts for years. I watch and enjoy all of them. However, when the bet video came about, I hit that follow button so fast I sprained my finger,” another commented. 

A third added, “This is going to be epic! Jasmine, you and the girls need to play along!”

“Doesn't he know you are awesome and 700k is no problem for you! 😉” yet another fan wrote.

Jasmine didn't just reach her goal; she crushed it. As of Saturday afternoon, she's has surpassed 702,000 followers. 

“Load the camera JCPenney,” another fan chimed in.

Jasmine, you, your husband and y'all's girls ROCK!!!
YOU are SO LOVED and the proof is in the numbers😂😂😂

If you're following the conversation around genre films at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival, you've certainly heard about “Leviticus.” Adrian Chiarella's directorial debut, which tells the story of two teenage boys in rural Australia who fall in love but quickly find their small town using nefarious forces to keep them apart, has turned into one of the buzziest films in the Midnight program. 

Chiarella and stars Mia Wasikowska, Stacy Clausen, and Joe Bird stopped by the IndieWire Studio, presented by Dropbox, to discuss the film's use of the horror genre to tell a queer love story. As the writer/director explained, the film was partially a tribute to the LGBTQ artists who have influenced horror from the very beginning.

“I always wanted to reclaim this genre,” Chiarella said. “This is a horror movie, and I always felt like horror films were really shaped by queer writers for queer audiences, and in a lot of ways we were reclaiming that space. This is a film about two boys who fall in love, and about the community that tries to erase that feeling that they have for each other. And the curse that they unintentionally unleash.”

 










Wasikowska also praised Chiarella's vision, noting that she bought into the film immediately after reading the script.

“I just thought it was brilliant, the whole concept and the way that Adrian had chosen to tell this story,” she said. “It was written so assuredly, and I just thought it was completely brilliant. Some things you can just tell when you read them for the first time.”

Wasikowska falling in love with the script at first sight was no accident. Chiarella explained that his background working in film development taught him the importance of writing scripts that didn't just look good on screen, but are also enjoyable on the page. 

“I knew that the really great scripts that everybody talks about are the page turners,” he said. “I knew that I not only had to craft this into a good story with great characters, I also had to craft it in a way that it was presented in a way that everybody understood. Because it's not just about selling it, it's also about when you work with wonderful creative people like this, I think that if they connected with that first read, then their creative juices are flowing and they start bringing all kinds of great ideas to the table.”

Watch the full conversation with the “Leviticus” team above. 

Dropbox is proud to partner with IndieWire and the Sundance Film Festival. In 2026, 68% of feature films premiering at Sundance used Dropbox during production. Dropbox helps filmmakers and creative teams find, organize, secure, and share the content that matters most to any project.

Natasha Lyonne revealed she recently relapsed after decades of sobriety: “Took my relapse public more to come,” the actress wrote on social media Friday.


	“Recovery is a lifelong process. Anyone out there struggling, remember you're not alone,” Lyonne wrote in a follow-up post; the actress did not elaborate on the nature of the relapse.

Recovery is a lifelong process. Anyone out there struggling, remember you're not alone. Grateful for love & smart feet. Gonna do it for baby Bambo. 🎥❤️🥊 Stay honest, folks. Sick as our secrets. If no one told ya today, I love you. No matter how far down the scales we have gone,…


	The Poker Face star, who battled addiction issues in the early 2000s, had not used drugs since 2006, when she entered drug and alcohol treatment center for a heroin addiction. In 2012, Lyonne underwent open-heart surgery to repair a valve that was previously damaged “as a result of drug use,” she previously admitted.


	Lyonne added that she would reclaim her sobriety for “Baby Bambo,” a reference to her upcoming project about hockey player Sophie “Bambo” Braverman that she is writing and directing.

	“Stay honest, folks. Sick as our secrets. If no one told ya today, I love you,” Lyonne wrote. “No matter how far down the scales we have gone, we will see how our experience may help another. Keep going, kiddos. Don't quit before the miracle. Wallpaper your mind with love. Rest is all noise & baloney.”

	Lyonne has long been open about her addiction issues, saying in a 2017 interview, “I'm such an open book that I have no problem talking about it and speaking freely, but I've sort of said my piece on the subject. The truth is, at the back of that addiction are feelings that so many of us have, that don't go away.”

	Indie rock band Geese debuted on Saturday Night Live with two tracks from their latest album, Getting Killed.


	The foursome—joined by their touring keyboardist Sam Revaz—opened with “Au Pays du Cocaine” (In the Land of Cocaine), the eighth song on their 11-track album, which came out in September.


	The Brooklyn-based band's follow-up to 2021's Projector and 3D Country two years later, Getting Killed was a chore to make.


	“I was unhappy until the last possible moment,” frontman Cameron Winter, 23, told Rolling Stone last August. “Maybe even still. The whole process — maybe this is just how we make albums — but it's all kind of a waking nightmare until it's mastered.”


	Guitarist Emily Green agreed: “It does feel like a brute-force effort until the very end.”


	The album, recorded last January in Los Angeles, reached the top spot on the UK Independent Albums Chart, and is ranked fifth on Rolling Stone‘s list of the 100 Best Albums of 2025.

To his friends and family, Alex Pretti, the 37-year-old intensive care nurse killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents was an “American hero” who “dedicated his life to serving American veterans.”

He worked at Minneapolis's Veterans Affairs hospital and was known as a committed healthcare professional, dog lover and avid mountain biker.

He loved to be outdoors and had a mission to protect the environment. He also felt compelled to stand up and protest against Donald Trump's immigration crackdown in his city.

In doing so, Mr Pretti was shot dead by ICE agents, branded a “domestic terrorist” by the secretary for homeland security, and labelled as an “assassin” who was trying to “murder federal agents” by one of the US president's senior advisors.

“He cared about people deeply and he was very upset with what was happening in Minneapolis and throughout the United States with ICE, as millions of other people are upset,” Michael Pretti, his father said in the hours after the shooting.

“He thought it was terrible, you know, kidnapping children, just grabbing people off the street. He cared about those people, and he knew it was wrong, so he did participate in protests.”

Mr Pretti grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he was a boy scout and sang in the local choir. He later moved to Minnesota to attend the state university, graduating with a degree in biology, society and the environment.

After initially working as a research scientist, he retrained as a nurse and went on to work in the intensive care unit at the Veterans Affairs hospital.

One video posted by the son of a veteran who died at the hospital showed Mr Pretti giving his father a final salute.

“Today we remember that freedom is not free. We have to work at it, nurture it, protect it and even sacrifice for it,” Mr Pretti says in the video. 

“We may never forget and always remember our brothers and sisters who have served so that we may enjoy the gift of freedom.”

Colleagues told local media that he was deeply dedicated to his patients and frequently volunteered for extra shifts.

A LinkedIn profile believed to be associated with Mr Pretti states that he also attended Minnesota Medical School.

Dr Dimitri Drekonja, a colleague, described him as “a good kind person who lived to help”.

“He had such a great attitude. We'd chat between patients about trying to get in a mountain bike ride together. Will never happen now,” he wrote on social media.

Other colleagues said Mr Pretti had been working additional shifts in order to save money to buy a house and a car.

Activism appears to have been a consistent feature of his adult life, with acquaintances saying he regularly attended protests focused on social justice issues.

Mr Pretti is believed to have attended protests following the killing of Renee Good, who was also shot dead by ICE officers in Minneapolis less than three weeks ago, as well as after the death of George Floyd in 2020.

Mountain biking and the outdoors were described as his great passions. When not working, he spent time riding trails outside the city or hiking with his dog, Joules.

His mother, Susan Pretti, said her son also cared deeply about environmental issues.

“He hated that, you know, people were just trashing the land,” she said. “He was an outdoorsman. He took his dog everywhere he went. You know, he loved this country, but he hated what people were doing to it.”

Mr Pretti lived in a four-unit condominium building around two miles from the location where he was killed.

Neighbours told local media that he was well known in the area and always willing to help.

“We talk over the fence all the time. He's the sweetest, kindest, most unoffensive, most non-violent person you'd ever want to meet,” one neighbour told The New York Times.

Sue Gitar, who lived in the same building as him, described him as “a wonderful person” who would step in if anything suspicious was happening in the neighbourhood.

Mr Pretti was licenced to own a firearm. His ex-wife said he obtained a permit around three years ago and owned at least one handgun, but added that she had never known him to be physically confrontational, even when attending protests.

He had no known criminal record.

In video footage, it can bee seen that Mr Pretti was holding a phone and recording ICE agents when he went to help a female demonstrator they had pushed to the ground. 

He was pepper sprayed and bundled to the icy pavement himself. At this point, an agent appears to have pulled a 9mm pistol out of the scrum, which Mr Pretti was alleged to be carrying but never appeared to reach for. 

Shortly after the weapon was taken away, 10 gunshots rang out and Mr Pretti was dead.

The Trump administration has suggested Mr Pretti's death was linked to him carrying a weapon, with Stephen Miller, the US president's chief of staff, describing him as “an assassin” who was trying to “murder federal agents”.

On Saturday, Kristi Noem, the US secretary of homeland security, said: “This individual who came with weapons and ammunition to stop a law enforcement operation of federal law enforcement officers, committed an act of domestic terrorism. That's the facts.”

Late on Saturday, Mr Pretti's parents released an impassioned statement defending their son.

“The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting. Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump's murdering and cowardly ICE thugs,” the statement said.

“He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed,” it continued. “Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man.”

Mr Pretti's father said he had urged his son to be careful while protesting.

“We had this discussion with him two weeks ago or so, you know, go ahead and protest, but do not engage, do not do anything stupid, basically,” Mr Pretti told the Associated Press. “And he said he knows that. He knew that.”

A fundraiser set up for his loved ones labels Mr Pretti an “American hero”. It has already raised £250,000.

One donation has the comment: “Thank you for being a perfect human being who was still helping others at the last minute of your life, Alex. You don't deserve this.”

U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz joins ‘Fox News Sunday' to discuss the importance of acquiring Greenland, the need for new Arctic defense and ongoing protests in Iran.

China's top general has been removed and placed under investigation for misconduct in Chinese President Xi Jinping's latest purge of leading military commanders.

Gen. Zhang Youxia is being investigated for allegedly committing severe violations of party discipline and state laws, China's Defense Ministry announced Sunday. The general served as vice-chairman on China's Central Military Commission and was second only to Xi in military authority.

Another member of the commission, Liu Zhenli, has also been placed under investigation by China's ruling Communist Party. Liu is the chief of staff of the commission's Joint Staff Department.

Their removal is the latest military purge since October, when the Communist Party one of the commission's previous vice chairs, He Weidong. He was replaced by Zhang Shengmin, a Xi loyalist who survived the latest round of removals.

The staff changes come after President Donald Trump's administration released a new National Defense Strategy on Friday. The document shifts U.S. focus toward dominance in the Western Hemisphere rather than a longtime goal of countering China.

The document also reflects Trump's ongoing frustration with U.S. allies for failing to adequately contribute to their own defense. It says the U.S. will increasingly expect allied nations to handle their own security.

His administration is trying to distort the reality of Alex Pretti's killing.

On January 23, 2016, Donald Trump notoriously declared, “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters.” That statement was understood at the time as a metaphorical expression of the depth of Republican voters' commitment to him. Ten years and one day later, his administration's agents shot a disarmed man on the street in full view of the public. Perhaps we should have taken him not only seriously but also literally.

The dynamic Trump observed is that he had created a bond with his supporters that no outside facts could break, even something as blatant as a cold-blooded killing on an American street. And that is the nub of the crisis into which we have plunged over the past decade. All politicians spin and distort to some extent, of course. Trump's innovation was to grasp that, because the conservative movement had trained its devotees to ignore mainstream media and rely completely on information supplied by its own loyalists, his ability to control his supporters' perceptions effectively had no limit. And because his supporters would believe anything, he could do anything.

After Customs and Border Patrol agents shot and killed Alex Pretti in Minneapolis yesterday, the Trump administration immediately branded him a “domestic terrorist.” The specific allegation it employed to support this hyperbolic charge was that, because Pretti was carrying a firearm while filming and then clashing with agents, he intended to massacre federal officers. Even if that were true, it still would not remotely justify the fact that, according to multiple videos of the incident, agents shot Pretti after they had pinned him to the sidewalk and disarmed him.

Until very recently, conservative rhetoric has valorized gun ownership as a bulwark against tyrannical government, to the point of fetishization. Conservatives defended Kyle Rittenhouse as a hero for bringing a rifle to a chaotic protest in Wisconsin during the summer of 2020, as well as armed bands of protesters who marched into state capitol buildings during the COVID lockdowns.

Tyler Austin Harper: Minneapolis is a Second Amendment wake-up call

For Trumpists to infer homicidal intent from the exercise of a right they have fetishized is a Fifth Avenue–level mental reversal. Their view of the Second Amendment turns out to be no different from their view of the First: one whose protections apply exclusively to themselves.

The administration's immediate use of the terrorist label should be understood not just as a hyperbolic accusation of intent but as an umbrella term it applies to political opposition generally. “There is a large and growing movement of leftwing terrorism in this country,” White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has written. “It is well organized and funded. And it is shielded by far-left Democrat judges, prosecutors and attorneys general. The only remedy is to use legitimate state power to dismantle terrorism and terror networks.”

Miller wrote that message in October. His definition of terrorism does not require imputing specific motives to protesters who own a gun or, like Renee Nicole Good, drive a car. He has called forth state power on a scale that is coming to resemble the piecemeal extension of martial law. The more abusive the power of the state, the more angry people will become, which the administration then uses as a pretext to crack down harder.

The administration's allies, not all of whom wish to directly endorse summary executions, have played along with his logic, treating protesters' reaction to the crackdown as though it were its cause.

“For months, radical progressive politicians like Tim Walz have incited violence against law enforcement officers who are simply trying to do their jobs,” the National Rifle Association wrote in a statement yesterday. “Unsurprisingly, these calls to dangerously interject oneself into legitimate law-enforcement activities have ended in violence, tragically resulting in injuries and fatalities.”

Read: The truth about ICE's recruiting push

“The Left is in a cycle of constant self-radicalization—the resistance to ICE creates the predicate for tragedies that are used to justify ever-more resistance and the demand for the de-facto nullification of federal immigration law in Minneapolis,” National Review's editor in chief, Rich Lowry, wrote on X.

In reality, Minnesotans are taking to the streets to warn passersby of ICE's actions and to record them because, as multiple reporters have documented, federal immigration agents appear to be routinely violating the law. Democratic Party leaders in the state have urged residents to record activity in order to produce a record of these acts. That is why Pretti was holding his phone, not his gun, when he intervened to protect a woman being tear-gassed by CBP agents, who then killed him.

The phone, not the gun, is the weapon the administration fears. The phone produces evidence of its agents' misconduct, which is what the administration seems determined to destroy. Officials' insistence that citizens who record agents are provoking violent retribution is a justification for what is becoming a very literal war on truth.

If Trump himself, and not just one of his agents, actually shot somebody on the street, we can guess what would happen. He would call the victim a terrorist. His allies would say the victim had provoked their own death and blame Democrats for inciting the violence. A decade ago, Trump intuited at some level that the end point of his power to command the minds of his followers would be a killing on the street. What was once seen as a joke has attained the status of a prophecy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New DNA analysis rewrites the story of the Beachy Head Woman","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260125083421.htm","Sun, 25 Jan 2026 15:07:33 GMT","

A long-standing mystery surrounding a Roman-era skeleton discovered in southern England may finally be close to an answer.

Earlier studies suggested the young woman, known as the Beachy Head Woman, may have had recent ancestry from sub-Saharan Africa or the Mediterranean. New genetic research now points in a different direction, indicating she was most likely from Britain.

Using advanced DNA sequencing, researchers aimed to resolve questions that have surrounded the Beachy Head Woman for more than a decade.

A Skeleton Found in a Basement

The remains were rediscovered in 2012 during the Eastbourne Ancestors Project, when a box was opened in the basement of Eastbourne Town Hall. Inside was the skeleton of a young woman from the Roman era. A handwritten label indicated she had been found near the Beachy Head headland sometime in the 1950s, but little additional information was available.

Public attention grew after early research suggested the woman may have had recent sub-Saharan African ancestry. If correct, the skeleton would have represented rare early evidence of African ancestry in Roman Britain.

Later, unpublished research proposed a different origin, suggesting she may have come from the Mediterranean, possibly Cyprus. That conclusion, however, relied on poorly preserved DNA, leaving uncertainty around her true background.

New DNA Methods Bring New Answers

Researchers have since returned to the skeleton with improved analytical tools. According to Dr. William Marsh, one of the scientists who analysed the DNA, the new results suggest a much closer connection to Britain.

""By using state-of-the-art DNA techniques and newly published genomes, we were able to determine the ancestry of the Beachy Head Woman with much greater precision than before,"" William reveals. ""We show she carries genetic ancestry that is most similar to other individuals from the local population of Roman-era Britain.""

Dr. Selina Brace, an ancient DNA specialist and senior author of the study, says the evolving interpretation reflects how science progresses over time.

""Our scientific knowledge and understanding is constantly evolving, and as scientists, it's our job to keep pushing for answers. Thanks to the advancement of technology that has occurred in the past decade since Beachy Head Woman first came to light, we are excited to report these new comprehensive data and share more about this individual and her life.""

The research findings were published in the Journal of Archaeological Science.

Life in Roman Britain

Britain's earliest major encounter with Ancient Rome occurred in 55BCE, when Julius Caesar led a military campaign to what is now Kent. Roman Britain itself was established nearly a century later under Emperor Claudius.

At its height, Roman control extended from southern England to the Antonine Wall north of modern-day Glasgow. The region included extensive networks of forts, roads, and towns linked to the wider Roman Empire, facilitating movement across Europe, north Africa, and beyond.

Historical inscriptions and archaeological evidence show that travel between Britain and north Africa was common during this period and continued even after Roman rule ended. Ancient DNA studies have also identified people with mixed European and sub-Saharan ancestry living in Dorset and Kent during the seventh century.

What We Know About the Beachy Head Woman

During the Roman occupation, the area around Beachy Head was dotted with settlements and infrastructure tied to the empire. Archaeological sites nearby include a villa at Eastbourne, a fort at Pevensey, and rural communities at Bullock Down and Birling. Several burials have been found in the region, including adults and a child.

The exact burial location of the Beachy Head Woman remains unknown, but radiocarbon dating indicates she died between 129 and 311 AD, aligning with the Roman period in Britain.

Physical analysis of her skeleton offers further insight into her life. She was likely between 18-25 years old at the time of her death and stood slightly over 1.5 meters tall. A healed injury on her leg points to a serious but survivable wound earlier in her life.

Chemical signatures in her bones also provide clues about her diet. Carbon and nitrogen levels suggest she regularly consumed seafood.

From Early DNA Clues to Clearer Evidence

Initial genetic analysis began in 2017, when researchers first attempted to extract DNA from the remains. Those early results hinted at a Mediterranean origin, but the DNA was limited in quantity and quality.

Because the data were insufficient to support firm conclusions, the findings were not published.

By 2024, advances in ancient DNA techniques made it possible to recover far more genetic material. Researchers returned to the skeleton and successfully sequenced significantly higher-quality DNA.

This expanded dataset allowed for a more detailed comparison with known populations. The analysis showed the Beachy Head Woman's DNA most closely matched rural communities from Roman-era Britain, with no evidence of recent African or Mediterranean ancestry. Based on these results, researchers concluded she likely originated from southern England.

Reconstructing a Face From the Past

The improved DNA data also enabled modern forensic analysis. Scientists predicted that the Beachy Head Woman probably had light skin pigmentation, blue eyes, and fair hair. These findings were used to update her digital facial reconstruction.

As DNA technology continues to advance, researchers expect even deeper insights into the lives of people who lived thousands of years ago, allowing forgotten individuals like the Beachy Head Woman to be better understood within their historical world.
