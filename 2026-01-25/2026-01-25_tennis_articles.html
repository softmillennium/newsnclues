                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After racing out early and navigating a second-set surge from Victoria Mboko, Aryna Sabalenka leaned on her tiebreak poise to move into the Australian Open quarterfinals, where another teenage test awaits. 1 Aryna Sabalenka started fast and steadied late in a 6-1, 7-6(1) win over No. 17 seed Victoria Mboko on Sunday in Melbourne, booking her place in the Australian Open quarterfinals for the fourth straight year. Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play 1 and stepping onto Rod Laver Arena for the first time -- Sabalenka came out in punishing form. She raced through the opening set and surged ahead 4-1 in the second, taking full control in just over 45 minutes. But as in her previous two matches, the top seed's level dipped with a commanding lead. Mboko capitalized, breaking Sabalenka twice in the second set -- including at 5-4, after Sabalenka failed to convert three match points -- and later pulling the set back to deuce at 6-5, two points from forcing a decider. Sabalenka reset in the tiebreak, the scenario she has made her own over the past 18 months, improving to 20-0 in Grand Slam tiebreak sets as she closed out the win in 1 hour and 26 minutes. Sabalenka said beforehand that she hadn't yet had the chance to practice with Mboko or watch her play up close -- perhaps symbolic of the 19-year-old's rapid rise on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz over the past 12 months -- but Mboko's competitive spirit and tenacity still left her impressed. “What an incredible player for such a young age," Sabalenka said in her on-court interview. "It's incredible to see these kids coming up on tour. "I'm super happy with the win, once again in straight sets. Sabalenka later said that the midday Melbourne sun made serving difficult as the match progressed, and pointed toward that as one of the factors that helped Mboko climb back into the second set. You can break the serve," she said. Two breaks that she got, it was on the side when I was facing the sun. Yeah, I didn't deal that good with the serve. She done incredible job serving on that side. "I knew she's going to be fighting. I knew she's going to be trying. She kind of like has nothing to lose. "But yeah, I was just focusing staying in the moment, playing point by point, trying to get this win." A post shared by Australian Open (@australianopen) 29 seed Iva Jovic of the United States took down Yulia Putintseva of Kazakhstan 6-0, 6-1 to reach her first-career Grand Slam quarterfinal in under an hour in just her six major main-draw appearance. After racing out early and navigating a second-set surge from Victoria Mboko, Aryna Sabalenka leaned on her tiebreak poise to move into the Australian Open quarterfinals, where another teenage test awaits.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elina Svitolina bested Mirra Andreeva on Sunday night at Rod Laver Arena, defeating the No. Svitolina sits next, and on Sunday night she added to her total, advancing to her 14th career major quarterfinal -- and fourth at the Australian Open -- with a 6-2, 6-4 win over World No. 8 Mirra Andreeva in 1 hour and 23 minutes on Rod Laver Arena. She'll get another chance to improve those numbers in the quarterfinals, where World No. 3 Coco Gauff awaits in what will be their fourth meeting at the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz level. "I don't want to think too much about it," Svitolina said of her next match. "It's, like, another opportunity for me to go far in the tournament. I think right now this is the priorities for me." And before she could look ahead, she had to get through Andreeva, who arrived in Melbourne fresh off a title run in Adelaide and appeared poised for another deep push. Svitolina shut that door quickly, leaning on her experience to take control of the match's biggest moments and keep the 18-year-old from ever settling in. “I was expecting a tough battle and lots of long rallies,” Svitolina said. “I was trying to just move my feet extremely well today, be really focused and find the small holes in her game and try to use them.” She saved the first break point with a forehand winner of her own and rattled off five straight points to hold for 1-0. The last of those came on a wicked slice drop shot that gave her double break point and a chance to go up 3-0. Instead, Svitolina steadied herself again, saving the first break point with an ace and winning four straight points to hold for 2-1, avoiding a potentially devastating double-break deficit. Svitolina post-win interviews often leave us going awww and we aren't complaining. 6-4, Second set: That hold proved pivotal, as Svitolina broke back in the very next game, and after four straight holds, found herself leading 5-4. The net cord nearly helped Andreeva, but her slice return dipped just low, moving Svitolina within two points of victory. Andreeva saved one match point -- created by her own double fault -- but another unforced error, one of 33 on the night, handed Svitolina a second chance. The Ukrainian capitalized, burying one final forehand winner to end it. Her attention now shifts to Gauff, whom she trails 1-2 in their head-to-head. Her lone win, however, came five years ago in Melbourne. Elina Svitolina bested Mirra Andreeva on Sunday night at Rod Laver Arena, defeating the No.</p>

Medvedev and Tien faced off for the first time at this tournament 12 months ago, with the American stunning Medvedev through five grueling sets in a late-night second round. Medvedev, who began the year by winning his 22nd ATP title in Brisbane, gave high praise to his opponent, who became the youngest American to reach a major quarterfinal since Andy Roddick in 2002.“He played great, super-aggressive,” said Medvedev. Didn't find many solutions today on the court, which is rare, and I didn't feel that many times in my life like this. But, again, these things can happen.“He had, like, unbelievable match where everything went in. It did happen to me as well a couple of times, and you even kind of feel sorry for your opponent, because, ‘Okay, I can go for tweener now and probably with closed eyes and make it.' I should have, yeah, should have done maybe something a little bit better to try to disturb this rhythm of his.”Still, Medvedev took positives from his best Grand Slam result in over a year, having lost before the third round in all major outings in 2025.

Still, Medvedev took positives from his best Grand Slam result in over a year, having lost before the third round in all major outings in 2025. “I think I should focus more in general,” Medvedev said in his post-match press conference. “If we take last, like, maybe eight tournaments, let's say starting from US Open, so I don't know if it's, like, eight, nine, I played great. I played great against some top players. Even here, I won two very tough matches against opponents who played well, Halys and Fabian.“So, I should try not to focus on this exact match, which was not good, because, I mean, he outplayed me, so that's not a good feeling. Of course, it's unfortunate to finish a Grand Slam like this when I was feeling well and confident, but it is what it is.”Tien will look to maintain his level against No. 3 seed Alexander Zverev in the last eight. “So, I should try not to focus on this exact match, which was not good, because, I mean, he outplayed me, so that's not a good feeling.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz faced the sternest test of his 2026 Australian Open so far on Sunday afternoon, but the No. Alcaraz overcame 19th seed Paul 7-6(6), 6-4, 7-5 with a fourth-round performance packed with explosive shotmaking to improve to 12-0 in sets played so far this fortnight. Paul, owner of two Lexus ATP Head2Head victories against the Spaniard, quickly showcased the threat he posed by opening a 4-2 lead early inside Rod Laver Arena. Yet Alcaraz soon recovered and produced some scintillating tennis to reach his third consecutive Australian Open quarter-final. In the first game, serving, I thought I played a good game, but he came with really strong shots, really flat, and for me it was a bit difficult,” said Alcaraz in his on-court interview. The 22-year-old top seed fired 35 winners, according to Infosys Stats, en route to sealing a last-eight meeting with home favourite Alex de Minaur at Melbourne Park. With his two-hour, 44-minute victory, Alcaraz also stayed on track to become the youngest man to complete the Career Grand Slam (winning the singles title at all four majors). The current holder of that record is his countryman Rafael Nadal.

The 24-time tour-level titlist produced a series of winners off his forehand in particular that had the Rod Laver Arena crowd gasping at the combination of spin and sheer velocity. Paul, who won five of his first seven matches this season after not competing for the final three months of the 2025 season due to injury, continued to battle in trademark fashion in pursuit of his fifth Grand Slam quarter-final. However, although the 28-year-old did not lack moments of quality of his own, he was unable to sustain any real pressure on Alcaraz once the first set was gone. Alcaraz crucially claimed his third break of the match before serving out to improve to 6-2 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Paul. De Minaur booked his spot in the quarter-finals for the second time with a comfortable 6-4, 6-1, 6-1 win against 10th seed Alexander Bublik, who had no answers for the Australian on Rod Laver Arena. He has so much firepower and I lost to him the past couple of times.

With his win, De Minaur defeated a Top 10 player at a major for just the third time, while he also equalled his best result at a Slam. The 26-year-old holds a 0-5 record in major quarter-finals but will hope to change that record when he meets Alcaraz. He has dropped just one set this week in Melbourne.

In his Tuesday quarterfinal Alcaraz will play one of two Alexanders—No. 10 seed Bublik—but he won't have to suffer due to what are predicted to be sweltering conditions, thanks to the Australian Open's numerous roofs.“I have to control the things that I can control,” said Alcaraz, who leads De Minaur 5-0 in their head-to-head but has never played Bublik before. “You know, if it is going to be really, really hot on Tuesday and the roof is going to be closed, I gotta to be accepted that and just trying to play my best tennis on indoor.“So, whatever it is, I just will be ready.

Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play Playing in just her sixth Grand Slam, and her first as a seeded player, the 18-year-old American powered into her first major quarterfinal with a 6-0, 6-1 win over Yulia Putintseva in 53 minutes. Like Williams, she has reached this stage without dropping a set. “I feel great,” Jovic said after the match. So I just tried to keep it as far away as possible, and I'm just so happy to be in the quarterfinals.” 1 Aryna Sabalenka for the first time at the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz level, a challenge she's choosing to embrace. “I'm just going to try to keep taking care of my side of the net,” Jovic said. “Obviously she's number one for a reason and has had so much success at this tournament, but that's what I want. That confidence was on full display against Putintseva. Jovic showed only a hint of nerves in the opening game, falling behind a couple of break points. It's difficult to single out one part of her game, given how complete the performance was, but her ability to find winners, especially on return, stood out. Up triple break point in the fourth game, she followed a Putintseva save with a timely backhand winner to break for 4-0. She added another backhand winner to hold to love in the next game, then secured a third break to wrap up the opening set in just 25 minutes. The second set followed a similar script. Jovic kept producing winners, her serve remained rock solid -- landing 71% of first serves and winning 67% of those points, along with 73% of second-serve points -- and Putintseva's frustration grew, punctuated by a subtle racket toss. She has reached this stage in all three tournaments to open her 2026 season, becoming the youngest player to do so since Maria Sharapova in 2005. Iva Jovic hasn't waited long to reach her first Grand Slam quarterfinal, but that didn't keep her from rushing past Yulia Putintseva in 53 minutes Sunday to book her spot in the final eight at the Australian Open.</p>
