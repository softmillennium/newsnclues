                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Weekend moves are often driven less by fresh information and more by positioning adjustments, particularly after periods of heightened volatility earlier in the week. The currency's sharp rally raised caution across Asian trading desks, even as officials stopped short of confirming any action, per Bloomberg. Elsewhere, political risk in the U.S. added to an already unsettled backdrop. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said his party would block a major spending package unless funding for the Department of Homeland Security is removed, increasing the risk of a partial government shutdown. While such standoffs are familiar, they can tighten near-term liquidity conditions and weigh on sentiment across risk assets, particularly during periods of elevated positioning. More than $1 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out earlier in the week as traders reduced exposure following sharp moves across currencies and bond markets. Attention now turns to the week ahead, with investors also looking ahead to a heavy earnings week that includes results from several megacap technology firms. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold rates steady at its upcoming meeting, reinforcing a wait-and-see tone after last year's easing cycle.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, traders will be paying very close attention to Chairman Jerome Powell's post-meeting press conference, which could hold the real intrigue. His take on what to expect in the coming months and on recent hot topics, including President Donald Trump's affordability policy push and threats to the Fed's independence, could move both traditional and crypto markets. Let's dig into what is priced in and how Powell's comments could move markets. After delivering three back-to-back quarter-point cuts, the central bank is expected to stand pat on Wednesday. Further, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who has a vote on the Federal Open Market Committee this year, recently told The New York Times that he believes it is "way too soon" to cut rates again. A hawkish pause scenario involves Powell flagging lingering inflation risks, denting rate-cut bets and pressuring risk assets lower. Watch for dissenters to the Fed's rate pause, as they could amplify a dovish tilt. Trump's appointee, Stephen Miran, is expected to dissent in favour of a bold 50-basis-point cut. Powell will likely face questions about the rationale for holding rates steady, as well as the potential impact of Trump's affordability measures and related issues on key macroeconomic variables. "Given the recent performance of both U.S. asset markets and activity, he will struggle to argue that financial conditions are restrictive and need to be loosened. "Instead, the next macro leg lower in the dollar will likely have to emerge from poor data rather than Fed-speak," they added. Powell's potential nod to Trump's housing affordability efforts as being inherently inflationary in the near term might amplify market volatility. Trump recently said he has instructed his representatives to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, claiming it will drive down rates and monthly payments. He also issued an executive order requiring large institutional investors to refrain from buying single-family homes that families could otherwise purchase. Observers say these measures could front-load demand, boosting housing inflation. On the other hand, the impact of banning large institutional investors from buying single-family homes is likely to be limited, given small institutional ownership relative to the overall stock," Allianz Investment Management said in a note. Note that Trump's tariffs are already baked in with a delayed inflationary impact expected this year, as higher import costs filter through to the final consumer. Lastly, Powell might face questions about the DOJ investigation targeting him personally, which he calls political vengeance for not slashing rates fast enough to suit Trump, and about recent bond market volatility stemming from Japan's fiscal issues. He might dodge the probe while downplaying bond market fears. KuCoin captured a record share of centralised exchange volume in 2025, with more than $1.25tn traded as its volumes grew faster than the wider crypto market. Price stabilizes near recent lows after a volatile pullback from above $2. Disclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This matter occurred after he was imprisoned for the horrendous abuse of his previous partner Abi Lyle in 2010 and before the murder of Katie Simpson in 2020. Creswell was living in Caledon, County Tyrone at the time, travelling daily to an Antrim stable yard where he exposed himself to a female co-worker and threatened her partner. The couple – who we are calling Sarah and Ian – came to work in the yard from their native Scotland but quickly learned Creswell was “worshipped” and his toxic behaviour was never addressed, allowing it to fester. Sarah described him boasting of being in jail over Abi and saying his only mistake was “not finishing the bitch off” The yard owners had no interest in addressing this which only served to embolden Creswell further. Ian confronted Creswell who responded with threats to kill and other vile abuse. Ironically, he threatened to “snap” Ian's neck – something he had a propensity for with his previous victim Abi who was repeatedly strangled and latterly, Katie. She maintains if police had acted on her complaint Katie may well still be alive. “At the very least Creswell would have had some level of monitoring and the exposure charge would have brought sexual offending registration with restrictions and controls.” After learning of Katie's murder Sarah complained to the Police Ombudsman but this was rejected as PSNI maintained efforts to locate Creswell were unsuccessful as he was believed to be in the Republic of Ireland. By now, unknown to PSNI, the requested information had been obtained through other means tragically confirming no attempt was made to alert Gardai to either detain Creswell or activate safeguarding given the new allegations were sexual and threatening in nature.

It would not be appropriate to comment further while proceedings regarding a complaint are ongoing.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's underwhelming price performance continued into the weekend, with another dip to $88,000 registered earlier today. Most altcoins are in the red as well on a 24-hour scale, with ETH solidifying its place below $3,000. BTC remained still at first and traded above $95,000 during the weekend, but dumped hard on Monday morning when the Asian stock and most futures markets opened. The culmination took place on Wednesday when bitcoin slumped to $87,200, which became a new multi-week low. Then came a rollercoaster of a trading period with a run toward $90,000, subsequent rejections, and another attempt at that coveted level as Trump took the main stage at Davos and made some controversial remarks. He refuted previous statements that he might use force to take over Greenland, hinted at a potential deal with Denmark, and cancelled the aforementioned tariffs. It now trades below $89,000, with a market cap of $1.770 trillion. Ethereum fell from over $3,400 to under $3,000 in the past ten days or so, and has been unable to turn that resistance into support since then. ADA, BCH, DOGE, LINK, HYPE, and XLM are also in the red daily. RIVER has rocketed by another 23% and now sits above $60. The total crypto market cap is down by over $40 billion to $3.080 trillion on CG. Jordan got into crypto in 2016 by trading and investing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin has limped into 2026, flailing in the wake of a gold price boom that's catapulted it to an eye-watering $34 trillion market capitalization (triggering predictions of even more gains to come). Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price, which plummeted under $100,000 per bitcoin in November, has struggled to regain its early 2025 momentum as Bank Of America's chief executive issues a serious $6 trillion warning. Now, with bitcoin and crypto primed for an imminent, “massive” shock, bitcoin-backing BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder has become a surprise favorite to be named as U.S. president Donald Trump's pick as Federal Reserve chair. "I think [bitcoin] will take the place of gold to a large extent? Yeah, I do, because it's so much more functional than passing a bar of gold around,” Rieder, whose odds of being named as the next Fed chair have rocketed to almost 40% this week on the Polymarket prediction platform, told CNBC in 2020, adding, “I think bitcoin is here to stay.” “Until an announcement is made by President Trump, any reporting about the Federal Reserve chairman nominations process is pointless speculation,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to the Financial Times. “This has been a disappointing two days for crypto bulls who could have reasonably expected bitcoin … to have regained upward strength given the rebound in global equities since Wednesday afternoon.” "Expectations for at least two Fed cuts in 2026 continue to undermine the dollar, while concerns over U.S. public finances, political pressure on the Fed, and lingering global risks keep gold well bid on dips," Morrison said. “Despite short-term overbought signals, gold is on track for a strong weekly gain, and price action suggests pullbacks are being treated as opportunities rather than trend breaks. “Gaining nearly 7% since Monday, gold is recording its strongest nominal growth in history and one of its most powerful weeks in terms of momentum,” Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro chief market analyst, said in emailed comments, calling its current level “unthinkable" just a couple of years ago. “When the Fed began tightening monetary policy in 2022, money market fund holdings stood at $5.5 trillion. Stocks are fundamentally overbought, and bitcoin has fallen out of favour due to declining volatility.” Fears of further currency depreciation have fueled the so-called debasement trade in recent months, propelling the gold price towards $5,000 per ounce, while investors have also piled into silver. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market Trump said Rieder was “very impressive," in an interview with CNBC this week. And I can probably tell you, we're down to maybe one, in my mind,” Trump said. Former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, who has also been a vocal supporter of bitcoin and crypto, remains the front runner, according to Kalshi and Polymarket contracts, after former favorite Kevin Hassett, Trump's national economic council director, was all but ruled out of the race. Expectations that interest rates may fall sharply in 2026 once Trump replaces Powell have supported bitcoin, crypto and equity markets in recent months, with Trump repeatedly saying his Fed chair pick will have to promise to heavily cut interest rates. "For the crypto markets, this "politicized dollar" narrative serves as a long-term bull case, even if current prices are dipping. If investors lose faith in U.S. government debt and the Fed's autonomy, decentralized assets like bitcoin and "hard" assets like gold, which has already seen skyrocketing prices, become the logical hedge against institutional decay."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coinbase is proactively preparing for a future threatened by quantum computing, today establishing an Independent Advisory Board on Quantum Computing and Blockchain comprised of leading experts from Stanford and the University of Texas at Austin. “At Coinbase, security is our highest priority, and preparing for future threats, even those many years away, is crucial for our industry,” says Yehuda Lindell, Coinbase Head of Cryptography. The board, featuring researchers like Professor Scott Aaronson and Professor Dan Boneh, will publish position papers and issue recommendations to safeguard the crypto ecosystem against long-term quantum risks, marking a significant step towards bolstering blockchain resilience. “Preparing for that future requires collaboration across disciplines, rigorous cryptographic research, and proactive planning well before quantum computers become practical,” notes Coinbase, who are establishing an Independent Advisory Board to address this emerging threat. Coinbase is already implementing “product enhancements today,” including updates to Bitcoin address handling and internal key management, to bolster existing protections. This initiative extends to long-term cryptographic research, specifically advancing support for post-quantum signature schemes like ML-DSA within secure multiparty computation systems. The initiative recognizes that advancements in quantum computing pose a future, yet significant, threat to the cryptographic foundations of digital assets. Justin Drake, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, and Professor Sreeram Kannan, founder of EigenLayer, also contribute their expertise. The board's mandate encompasses publishing position papers and issuing recommendations for safeguarding against long-term quantum risks. This proactive approach complements Coinbase's post-quantum roadmap, including product enhancements and long-term cryptographic research into schemes like ML-DSA. This initiative acknowledges that while current blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are secure, advancements could “weaken or break” their foundations, according to company statements. The board will publish position papers, issue recommendations, and provide real-time analysis of quantum computing breakthroughs, ensuring proactive guidance for the industry.

Analysts believe that Bitcoin's recent bearish pullback might be a trigger for an altcoin rally in the coming week. As traders rotate their money into newer altcoins, Solana Mobile Seeker (SKR), Pump.fun, and Official Trump are expected to show bullish momentum this week. Bitcoin has been facing significant bearish volatility over the last seven days. BTC price dropped from the peak of $96K toward $88K, flashing a 7% drop last week. Coinglass data reveals that Bitcoin continues to face increased liquidation as it triggered over $25 million in total liquidations in 24 hours. Analysts say that while Bitcoin's drop may not have a major impact on an altcoin rally, it could give a small lift to newer altcoins this week. SKR token fell below its moving averages after recording over 200% gain last week. Though the price achieved a peak above $0.05 following listings on multiple tier-1 exchanges, it faced sharp selloff later. As of writing, Solana Mobile Seeker trades at $0.028, declining over 15% in the last 24 hours. However, SKR's drop below EMA20 trend line hints at a bearish control currently. If that happens, the pair could rise toward $0.05. Pump.fun is finding support near the $0.0024 level, showing that buyers are stepping in at lower prices. As of writing, PUMP price trades at $0.0026, surging over 5.2% in the last 24 hours. Any recovery is likely to meet selling pressure around the descending resistance line. In that case, Pump.fun price could rise toward $0.0033, where strong resistance is expected. TRUMP faced significant drop last week as it touched a low below EMA20 trend line. As of writing, TRUMP price trades at $4.88, declining over 0.7% in the last 24 hours. If weakness continues, the pair could retrace fully and fall to around $4.4-$4.1. Any short-term rebound is likely to run into selling pressure near the 20-day EMA. However, buyers are currently accumulating, preparing the TRUMP price to break its consolidation above $5.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Liquid Capital founder JackYi said on Friday that Ethereum's underperformance in comparison to Bitcoin reflects macro conditions and shifting market structure, rather than weakness in Ethereum's fundamentals. On X, JackYi responded to questions about why Ethereum remains nearly 50% below its prior cycle peak while Bitcoin trades roughly 40% above its previous high. He said the current cycle has been shaped by aggressive rate hikes, which limited performance across most crypto assets except Bitcoin. He said he expects that pattern to re-emerge once monetary conditions shift, adding that Ethereum has historically delivered larger gains during bull markets. On the other hand, Bitcoin was trading at $88,663, down by 0.9% over 24 hours. JackYi said the traditional four-year crypto cycle has weakened due to structural changes, including the rise of stablecoins, shifting crypto policies, and growing institutional participation. He argued that Ethereum benefits most from these changes as the primary settlement layer for stablecoins and on-chain financial services. He also addressed concerns around prolonged consolidation, saying Ethereum has spent months stabilizing near the $3,000 level. He said Ethereum remaining above $1,000 would keep his positions “absolutely safe.” Most recently, the firm borrowed $20 million USDT again and then put the money into Binance to buy 6,656 ETH, which were then sent to Aave (AAV). Trend Research owns 651,310 ETH, which is worth about $1.91 billion.Read also: Bitcoin Environmental Debate Intensifies After New Scientist Labels It ‘One Big Disaster' For updates and corrections, email newsroom[at]stocktwits[dot]com.</p>

CBDCs are central bank–issued digital legal tender stored in wallets, unlike UPI which transfers money between bank accounts without moving currency itself. What are the benefits of BRICS digital currency linkage?+ BRICS digital currency linkage can reduce transaction costs, improve transparency, curb illicit flows, and lower dependence on the US dollar-dominated SWIFT system. How does BRICS digital currency linkage help geopolitically?+ It allows trade with sanctioned countries like Russia and Iran, offering BRICS nations an alternative payments system beyond dollar-based global infrastructure. What risks does BRICS digital currency linkage pose?+ Major risks include regulatory coordination delays and possible US retaliation through tariffs, making cost–benefit analysis critical for India.
