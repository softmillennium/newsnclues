                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester United stunned Arsenal on Sunday by beating the Gunners 3-2 at the Emirates to make it two wins out of two for caretaker manager Michael Carrick. Dorgu and substitute Cunha then scored eye-catching goals to take all three points and dent Arsenal's title hopes. Manchester United responded well to the early setback, with Bruno Fernandes firing two chances wide. The Cameroon star pounced on a poor back from Martin Zubimendi and kept his composure to round goalkeeper David Raya and slot home to make it 1-1. Mikel Arteta responded by making four changes to his team, sending on Ben White, Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze and Mikel Merino in search of an equaliser. Noni Madueke followed shortly afterwards as the Gunners struggled to carve out clear-cut chances. Perhaps inevitably the equaliser came from a set piece. Cunha picking up possession and curling another unstoppable finish past Raya to secure a memorable afternoon for the visitors. GOAL rates Manchester United's players from the Emirates... Made a good save from a Martin Zubimendi header in the first half and Saka in the second but was crowded out at the corner from which Arsenal made it 2-2. Inadvertently handed Arsenal the lead by flicking past Lammens as he tangled with Timber. Great tackle in stoppage time to prevent an Arsenal attack. Did a very decent job up against Saka down the left for United. Into his last few months as a Manchester United player but this was an excellent performance. Commanding throughout and seemed to be everywhere at times. Another start for Mainoo and a disciplined performance. Seems to be growing in confidence but looked tired in the second half, perhaps unsurprising given his lack of game time recently. Not his most effective game in a Manchester United shirt but provided some good deliveries that troubled Raya.

His decision to swap Mbeumo for Cunha also paid off handsomely as the Brazilian scored a brilliant winner.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea manager Liam Rosenior has explained why Cole Palmer missed Sunday's Premier League clash with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. Rosenior also responded to recent transfer speculation amid claims Palmer is unsettled in London and is hankering after a return to Manchester. Palmer has endured an injury-interrupted campaign for Chelsea that has limited him to just 10 Premier League starts to date. The England international sat out the midweek win over Pafos in the Champions League due to a "tiny" injury but had been expected to return against Crystal Palace. Rosenior told Sky Sports why Palmer had missed the match, saying: "Unfortunately for us, Cole's not quite right for this one. I've said before in press conferences we want to make sure that every player is 100 per cent. There's no use risking players in January for what we want to achieve. Chelsea coped well without Palmer in a comfortable win thanks to goals from Estevao Willian, Joao Pedro and Enzo Fernandez. Pedro was happy to take all three points, telling Sky Sports: "We knew this would be a tough game, they have a strong team.

Rosenior was also quizzed on Palmer's future at Chelsea amid reports claiming he's 'homesick' for Manchester. Recent speculation has claimed that Palmer could be tempted back to former club Manchester City if Pep Guardiola moves on in the summer. Rosenior insists he has spoken with Palmer and that he is still happy to be a Chelsea player: "I've had numerous conversations with Cole and he seems, and is, very, very happy to be here. Every player goes through difficult moments in their career with injuries, but that is no indication of his quality." Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Chelsea's win over Palace makes it four wins out of five for Rosenior since he took charge of the Blues following Enzo Maresca's departure, and the Chelsea boss was thrilled to see his team ease past the Eagles and above Liverpool in the table. He told BBC Match of the Day: "Very pleased. This is always a very difficult place to come. It's frustrating to not have a clean sheet in the last few minutes - I wanted three in a row and we should've got one, we were 3-0 up against 10 men." We can be better on the ball, especially in the first half but in terms of what I want to see from a team performance, it was a very good one." Rosenior will be hoping that Palmer is fit enough for their next game against Napoli in the Champions League on Wednesday. Chelsea are one of eight teams sitting on 13 points going into the final round of league phase fixtures and know that a victory should be enough against the defending Serie A champions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lucas Vázquez (Curtis, 1991) has made a comeback through the front door. After months of ostracism following an untimely injury, the Spanish international returned to Kasper Hjulmand's starting XI, and he couldn't have done it in a more decisive way: netting the winning goal against Werder Bremen (1-0). His last league start dated back to October 4, 2025, against Union Berlin. However, after getting back into rhythm in the Champions League against Olympiacos, Hjulmand decided to bet on the veteran ex-Madridista in a 100% Spanish right flank alongside Aleix García and Alejandro Grimaldo. A Goal for the Personal History Books With the clinical vision of a man who has played 402 elite matches, he found Maza at the edge of the box, who returned a pinpoint wall-pass. In the one-on-one, Vázquez was clinical, beating Backhaus with a surgical cross-shot. It is his first in a Bayer Leverkusen shirt and shatters an astonishing statistic: to find a goal scored by Lucas away from the Santiago Bernabéu, you have to travel back in time to April 17, 2015, during his spell at Espanyol against Levante. Although Bayern's lead remains light-years away (18 points), the recovery of Lucas Vázquez provides Hjulmand with a high-caliber asset for the season's home stretch.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. More than half a billion ticket requests have been made for World Cup 2026 games, which will be hosted by cities across the United States, Canada and Mexico, FIFA reported this month. The U.S. is expecting more than 5 million international visitors, not to mention the tens of thousands of soccer fans here at home that will not only pack stadiums but also flood fan zones from coast to coast, including in New York , Los Angeles, Kansas City and Atlanta over the six-week tournament, which kicks off on June 11. This once-in-a-generation opportunity also brings a nationwide, multifaceted rollout of security measures to prepare for potential threats ranging from drone incursions to cyberattacks. However some human rights advocates have expressed fears that the Trump administration will use law enforcement operations around the World Cup to target migrants as part of the White House's aggressive deportation policy. “Under the Trump administration's policies, immigration enforcement at major sporting events can tear families apart and could expose people fleeing persecution to life-threatening danger,” Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. And there is also trepidation from fans traveling from abroad after the Trump administration broadened its visa ban to 75 countries. The Department of Homeland Security announced earlier this month that it plans to invest $115 million in counter-drone technologies to protect World Cup games, and also events celebrating the country's 250th anniversary this year. The funds will be managed by a new DHS office that will focus on buying and deploying drone and counter-drone tech. “Drones represent the new frontier of American air superiority,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement. FEMA, which is under the umbrella of DHS, said in December that it had allocated $350 million to the 11 states hosting World Cup matches. That money is earmarked for the purchase of counter-drone tech. While most drones are more disruptive than are they overtly dangerous — though there have been cases of falling devices causing serious injury to people on the ground — the war in Ukraine has proven that even relatively inexpensive, commercially available racing drones outfitted with explosives can be used as potent weapons. Last week, leaders from the military, law enforcement, and local governments gathered to participate in "tabletop exercises overwhelmingly focused" on drone attacks at World Cup events, where large numbers of people will be gathered in places at predetermined times. Politico reported about the war games that local and state law enforcement agencies in the U.S. have been “encouraged to purchase equipment that can jam inbound drones or redirect them to their origin," and to seek reimbursement for their purchases through a $500 million federal grant program. The World Cup is larger than it has ever been. "The more we build out these things and automate and scale larger — more days, more games, more teams — the more we have to find a way to do that efficiently, and they're not scaling out the human labor force to do it," Chris Grove, director of cybersecurity strategy for Nozomi Networks, a provider of cybersecurity for operational technology told Dark Reading, a cybersecurity news site. Digital threats aren't just a theorized vector for malicious behavior; there is precedent. Grove warned that this year, as a result of heightened political polarization in the U.S., there will likely be an increased likelihood of "hacktivists" targeting the World Cup to make statements. "I think there's more potential and concern for disruption around hacktivists this time around than four years ago," he says. "Four years ago was just a different political and social landscape." Donald Lane, a former Secret Service agent, told the U.S. Sun that while physically attacking an event has become more difficult thanks to increased surveillance and threat-detection technology, malicious actors have found plenty of vulnerabilities through the use of remote access. “Bad actors are realizing they can cause a lot of destruction by accessing these things remotely, which can be just as devastating as a physical attack," the told the outlet. Targeting systems that manage electricity, gas, and water are all possible options for potential bad actors. Securing the physical locations of games will fall largely to a combined force of federal, state and local law enforcement. Postell is a former Secret Service agent and will oversee security preparations alongside local law enforcement. World Cup hosting cities will likely see increased police presence, controlled traffic corridors, and the presence of state and federal law enforcement as has been seen before during major events like the Super Bowl. San Antonio did the same in 2025, but used two-ton stone barriers to block vehicle entry to its Market Square, News 4 San Antonio reports. Michael Donnelly, Georgia's TSA federal security director, said officials at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in host city Atlanta are preparing for a massive influx of foreign and domestic travelers. "It's going to be an extremely, busy time when we have games," he told Fox 5 Atlanta. He said that the TSA would be utilizing unspecified "new technologies" to help with screening and expedite wait times as travelers arrive. The Trump administration's aggressive anti-immigration policy - which has seen nearly 3 million people deported and thousands arrested by masked ICE agents and held in detention centers - appears to have left foreign visitors wondering what welcome awaits them in the U.S. In December, Giuliani was asked by reporters if Trump will rule out ICE raids at World Cup games. In January, Lebanese diplomat and FIFA fan Mohamad Safa, announced he'd canceled his World Cup tickets because of the Trump administration's draconian anti-immigration policies. The waived visa program applies to citizens of many European countries and other American allies. The DHS proposal means those visitors may be sujected to expanded scrutiny. If implemented, the new proposal would give Homeland Security the ability to screen travelers' social media posts for any sign of "anti-American" sentiment, even if they aren't seeking long-term stays in the U.S. Trump has said that he "can't wait to welcome soccer fans from all over the globe” but has already banned visa applications for visitors from 21 nations including Iran, Brazil, Colombia, and Egypt — which all have teams in the World Cup or competing to qualify for the event. While exceptions have been made for World Cup teams, their immediate families, and coaching staff, the same cannot be said of their supporters. Trump's immigration crackdown is a concern for domestic fans as well. In July, an asylum seeker in the U.S. took his children to a Club World Cup soccer tournament final and was arrested by ICE, detained for three months, and was then deported to a country where he felt he could be killed, according to Human Rights Watch. FIFA responded on June 3 that it “expects … host countries take measures to ensure that any eligible persons who are involved in the Competition are able to enter the respective countries,” and “is actively working on this matter with relevant authorities.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Liverpool pivoted to poach Arne Slot from Feyenoord, and went on to lift the Premier League title in the Dutchman's first season in charge. Alonso, meanwhile, wasn't able to best Bayern Munich for a second straight year, but did enough to convince the hierarchy of Real Madrid that he should be the person to replace the long-serving Carlo Ancelotti. Under pressure from the get-go, Real Madrid were humiliated by Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup, losing 4–0, and Alonso quickly saw his authority undermined by a dressing room of players who weren't afraid to show their frustrations towards his decisions. Less than two weeks after his axing, Spanish publication AS report that Liverpool have been in contact with Alonso's camp, as they explore their own options after an indifferent second season under Slot. He spent five years at the club as a player from 2004–09, winning the Champions League and Super Cup in 2005, and built a strong connection with supporters. “Of course there is a bond with my former club, but for now this is my place,” Alonso said in December, when he was still employed as Real Madrid's manager. That proved to be true as little over a month later Alonso was given the boot by Real Madrid president Florentino Pérez. The report from AS indicates nothing has changed in regards to Alonso's recent comments. Liverpool's approach is said to have been met with a “positive response,” reiterating their belief that strong options are out there should Slot's position become untenable. The big question is whether Liverpool are prepared to part ways with Slot. He delivered an unexpected Premier League title in his maiden campaign, when many felt that both he and the club would need to acclimatise to the departure of Klopp. Consequently, Liverpool found themselves in a position they didn't expect to be in and bumped up their plans of a squad overhaul. They spent over £400 million ($538.9 million) on new players, breaking the British transfer record twice to sign Florian Wirtz and then Alexander Isak, and were the overwhelming favourites to retain their crown in the eyes of many pundits, supporters and neutral onlookers. Instead, Liverpool have lost their way this season, failing to properly integrate their new signings—injuries have played a major part—and get them up to speed. They've also had to deal with the sudden, tragic death of forward Diogo Jota in July. At the time of writing, Liverpool have lost 10 times across all competitions from 34 matches played, winning just half (17). They've already been beaten seven times in the Premier League—Saturday's 3–2 defeat to Bournemouth their most recent arrear—which is three more than they lost in the entirety of last season. The pressure is building on Slot, with disjointed performances and an alarming amount of goals conceded the primary concern, and there's been suggestions he could be removed from his role. Spanish media suggest he'll be given until the season's end, by which time a decision will be made on whether to formally pursue Alonso—it's unlikely he'll take another job in the meantime and will instead enjoy some time off before getting back on the touchline.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This summer's FIFA World Cup already looks set to be a controversial one, with the UK government now warning England fans about the potential perils of travelling. Considering the goings-on in the US right now, it was perhaps always going to be chaotic in the build-up to the event, and Donald Trump has made sure of that, thanks to his hefty travel ban list, which is likely to prevent fans of teams such as Haiti and Iran from even travelling. Iranian officials boycotted the World Cup draw late last year but were perhaps relieved that they did so after a rather confused event that included performances from The Village People and Nicole Scherzinger, while England fans finally found out their group stage opponents. Although England's fixtures against Croatia, Ghana and Panama take place in the US, knockout fixtures could see them travel to Mexico, and now the UK government has issued a warning about the precautions they will need to take there, even if the beer and match tickets are likely to be much cheaper. The UK government's Foreign and Commonwealth Office has issued a raft of warnings, ranging from alcohol intake to drugs and corrupt police officers, as fans start to book their flights and hotels ahead of what promises to be a huge footballing summer. If you have any concerns, get advice from your tour operator or the local authorities. “There have been deaths and cases of serious illness caused by alcoholic drinks containing methanol in Mexico.” England fans certainly have a reputation for travelling abroad and running into trouble with local enforcement officers, but in Mexico, it's important they don't get arrested by someone who doesn't even have the authority to do so. The FCDO add: “Be wary of criminals posing as police officers and trying to fine or arrest you for no reason. “Some genuine police officers have extorted money from tourists for alleged minor offences or traffic violations.” Fans are urged to avoid wearing expensive-looking clothing, jewellery or watches and to limit the amount of cash or credit cards they carry. You'll also have to be careful for the group games in the US, as one step out of line and Trump might just try to keep you there.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every January, some clever-clogs team will be chasing the quadruple before shamefully ending up with something embarrassing like only the Premier League and Champions League to show for it. Of course, there's a good reason that the Full Quad in the world's only proper football, which is obviously English football, and the four proper trophies available – Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, Carabao Cup – has never been done. There is literally no shame in failing to complete it; that you can get past the halfway point of the season with something so impossible still theoretically possible is itself extraordinary. And Arsenal are right now among the less convoluted quad-chasers. They are current favourites in each of the four competitions. We have, through necessity, allowed all manner of bullsh*t pots into this, but we have limited ourselves to Europe's top five leagues for our own sanity. Unfortunately, that does mean no place for Celtic, whose 1966/67 Quintuple contains all the proper ingredients (European Cup, Scottish League, Scottish Cup, Scottish League Cup) as well as a Glasgow Cup which, given the historical if not current nature of Scottish fitba, is at least as good as a League Cup probably. But if we included them, we'd have gone down a long, arduous yet inevitable road that leads directly to Linfield's 1961/62 Septuple and pure delirious madness. A Quadruple containing neither European nor domestic league glory? F*** all the way off, you cheeky scamps. You're trying to pull a fast one here and we'll not have it. This was Pep Guardiola's Barcelona at the peak of their powers and an indisputably great side, no doubt about that. They don't need a Quadruple to prove it. We'll give you La Liga, obviously, especially after losing just once all season and still only edging out Real Madrid by three points in an epic tussle. But the rule that any cup containing the word ‘Super' is bobbins is immutable and in play twice here. The UEFA and Spanish Super Cups are (or were at the time) both two-team low-wattage affairs (albeit the Spanish version was played over two legs) and not really major titles. It must be quite nice to be able to go “This is the worst Quadruple we've ever won”. This is the worst Quadruple Bayern Munich have ever won. A far better one in 2012/13 opened the Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup doors, gifts that were duly accepted. In accordance with tradition, Guangzhou Evergrande were beaten en route to World Cup glory, while penalties were needed to exact a measure of revenge on Chelsea for the 2012 Champions League final in the UEFA Super Cup. Even though four is definitely more than three. Can't think why this is less venerated. Not every day you beat Gamba Osaka and Quito to land the Club World Cup. Or beat Portsmouth on penalties to win the Community Shield. You can stick That Night in Barcelona up your arse, quite frankly. Scores grudging bonus points for the fact they've done this particular quadruple four times since replacing Lyon as French football's dominant force. There's a very obvious reason it's not as good as 2024/25's effort, but three of the four here are at least actual competitions containing multiple matches and more than two entrants. We also quite enjoy the fact that because PSG weren't even letting anyone else have a go in the League Cup – winning six of the final seven renewals – it was just abolished altogether. We assume that's why it was chucked in le bin anyway. The Trophee des Champions sounds much better than ‘Community Shield' and less deceptively bombastic than ‘Super Cup' but amounts to the same thing. It's just a glorified friendly between league winners and cup winners, and PSG have won loads of the buggers. This is a Quadruple built around a Domestic Treble and therefore not too tinpot, but inevitably loses some points because farmers and no Europe. A Proper Domestic Double is a high-quality cornerstone of any respectable Quadruple, and Barcelona tick that box in style here, putting a three-game April wobble behind them to win their last five league games by an absurd aggregate score of 24-0 to pip Real Madrid by a point. Sevilla were beaten in extra-time for Copa del Rey glory, but alas it then goes once more into the realm of the tinpot. Athletic Bilbao offered minimal Supercopa resistance, while Guangzhou Evergrande (it is always Guangzhou Evergrande) and River Plate (it is quite often River Plate) were sorted out with little fuss in the Club World Cup. The Champions League bid came a cropper against eventual finalists and domestic rivals Atletico Madrid in the last eight. Al-Jazira and Gremio were dispatched in the Club World Cup and Manchester United in the UEFA Super Cup. Real also finished second behind actual Tottenham in their Champions League group stage, and third in La Liga. The whole Quadruple obsession vaguely reminds us of the razor blade wars when Gillette and Wilkinson Sword would constantly set out to one up each other by just adding blade after unnecessary blade. And that brings us to Manchester City's 2018/19 season, in which their Champions League hopes collided with the unstoppable chaotic banter force of Spurs with inevitable consequences, but they did complete an unprecedented English Domestic Treble. An achievement Sir Alex Ferguson had declared impossible, rightly acknowledging the League Cup is far harder to win than the Champions League. And, sure, a lot of that was because it's City and people in general still don't care about City the way they do United or Liverpool or even Arsenal. Whack in the good ol' Community Shield, and you have a Quadruple. And with all three proper pots pocketed in a league where that had never happened before or since it remains one of the better ones. And you can't really blame anyone for coming off second best to Spurs with Fernando Llorente in his pomp, can you? Were it not for an extremely careless Copa del Rey quarter-final defeat over two legs to Celta Vigo, this would be challenging for top spot. The league title was snaffled after a typically forthright to and fro with Clasico rivals Barcelona, while a slightly scruffy Champions League group stage featuring three draws on their way to second place behind Dortmund was put right in a dominant march through the knockouts. They know their way around a UCL knockout tie better than most, a bother with which Man City are about to collide. Napoli and Bayern were beaten home and away in the last 16 and quarter-finals, while a 2-1 second-leg defeat to Atletico mattered not a jot with a 3-0 lead in the bag from the first. On to the final in Cardiff, and a 4-1 shellacking for Juventus. Super Cup and Club World Cup formalities were also completed along the way, although extra time was required against both Sevilla in the former and Kashima Antlers in the latter. We're going to go right ahead and say it: winning the Champions League is better than winning the French Coupe de la Ligue. Let it never be said we are afraid of molten takes here. PSG seemed pretty happy, all in all, with a season that finally delivered that long-awaited first Big Cup success alongside a customary sprinkling of domestic baubles. But we're still pretty annoyed that the abolition of the French League Cup meant no Proper Quad was achieved. On the flipside we are, in truth, relieved at their failure to win the summer's Club World Cup because then we'd have had to decide which, if any, season it belonged to and we can't be remotely arsed with that noise. Of course, this season could set new benchmarks despite Coupe de France embarrassment. Having already won all three of the Glorified Friendlies available to them post-quad – Trophee des Champions, UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Intercontinental Cup – and with a live interest retained in both Ligue 1 and Champions League there is a tinpot quintuple very much up for grabs. There is no Carabao equivalent in Germany, so this does have to go down as a largely unimprovable effort for Bayern, for whom a Quadruple featuring no tinpottery whatsoever is thus impossible. Won all three major pots in some style, breaking all manner of records on their way to a ludicrous 25-point victory margin in the Bundesliga and winning their six DFB-Pokal games by a combined aggregate of 20-2. Arsenal gave them an almighty scare in the Champions League last 16, winning 2-0 in Munich after a 3-1 Bayern win at the Emirates appeared to have put the tie to bed three weeks earlier. Sauntered past supposed European superpowers Juventus and Barcelona by scoring 11 goals and conceding none before outlasting Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund at Wembley to take the Big Cup.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, it's time for someone new to get involved. France were — in modern times — that rare thing, a victorious host nation. As with many World Cups, there was a wider political angle. Amid a rise in support for far-right National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, who had repeatedly criticised the national side for having too many players born outside France, or from an immigrant background, France's eventual success was seen as a victory for the side's multiculturalism as much as its football approach. Aime Jacquet had enjoyed great success with Bordeaux in the 1980s, and subsequently worked for the national side as technical director and then assistant manager, during which time France failed to qualify for World Cup 1994. He was then appointed as manager, but was constantly criticised in the French press, largely for being too conservative. Even in victory, Jacquet was still rattled by the previous negativity towards him. But we have been unfairly criticised at times, and I'll never forgive those critics who were so severe on us after we failed to qualify for USA 94.” He never coached another game after the World Cup final, reverting to his position as technical director. Missing out on World Cup 1994 was still considered a national embarrassment. The side also struggled to reach Euro 96 — a Youri Djorkaeff free-kick in a qualifier against Poland probably kept Jacquet in his job — and while France reached the semi-finals of that tournament, they didn't score a single goal in four hours of knockout football. Outside France, there were questions about precisely how much this was a football-mad country. Star players were leaving after the Bosman ruling, and French tax rates meant its clubs couldn't compete financially. Nevertheless, France seemed to suddenly become obsessed midway through the tournament — the more France progressed, the more its citizens watched matches in big groups in public places, rather than at home. France ended the tournament with a 4-3-2-1 formation, which lacked both attacking width and speed. Striker Stephane Guivarc'h was mocked for his inability to score a single goal at the competition. He was retrospectively praised for his ability to hold up the ball and run the channels, but he constantly slipped when through on goal, or haplessly scuffed the ball. “No team has ever won the World Cup with such ineffective forwards,” said the editorial in World Soccer magazine. Behind, Zinedine Zidane and Djorkaeff provided some attacking spark — Djorkaeff from slightly higher up the pitch, offering more of a goal threat in open play. Earlier in the competition they had offered more speed and urgency, particularly when using a young Thierry Henry from the wing, and David Trezeguet at times too. Meanwhile, Christoph Dugarry started up front and scored France's opening goal of the competition, although was ruled out for most of the tournament with a hamstring injury. 🏆 David Trezeguet was the youngest member of France's 1998 #WorldCup-winning squad, netted the golden goal that won them EURO 2000 and remains their 5th highest all-time scorer 🇫🇷 In the 4-0 win over Saudi Arabia, goalkeeper Fabien Barthez got away with a two-footed lunge and left-back Bixente Lizarazu was also lucky not to be dismissed for a last-man foul. In the semi-final, Lilian Thuram ended up five yards behind his fellow defenders to play Davor Suker onside for Croatia's opener. Later on, Laurent Blanc was controversially sent off after whacking Slaven Bilic in the chest, prompting Bilic going down holding his head. That meant Frank Leboeuf coming in for the final to play alongside Marcel Desailly — and then Desailly was sent off midway through the second half for a wild challenge on Cafu which resulted in a second booking. This meant France ended the tournament with backup Leboeuf playing alongside Petit, who had dropped back from midfield into the position he used to play with Monaco. It was all a bit more ramshackle than often portrayed. Zidane had long been cast as France's superstar, and given he scored twice in the first half of the final to give France a 2-0 lead they never looked like relinquishing, he became the poster boy for this side — literally, as his face was projected onto the Arc de Triomphe while Parisians celebrated up and down the Champs Elysee. But this wasn't Zidane at his best — his outstanding tournament was Euro 2000, and he performed better at World Cup 2006 too — and in the aftermath of the tournament most journalists' attempts to create a best XI didn't feature his name. Here, he was sent off in the 4-0 group stage victory over Saudi Arabia for stamping on Fuad Amin, which meant he was suspended for two matches. Upon his return, he was marked out of an uneventful goalless draw with Italy by his Juventus team-mate Gianluca Pessotto in the quarter-final, but was excellent against Croatia in the semi. It later emerged that Ronaldo had experienced a series of convulsions while having his afternoon nap, and had spent several hours in hospital. He arrived at the Stade de France separately from his team-mates. He eventually played the full 90 minutes, but was clearly lacking his usual spark. Amid these pre-match worries, Brazil had barely warmed up before the game, and never really got going. France dominated without playing spectacular football, and were 2-0 up at half-time thanks to Zidane's two headers, both after beating Leonardo to reach an inswinging corner. “Scoring two with my head is unbelievable,” he said afterwards. There was little reaction from Brazil, even after Desailly's red card on 68 minutes. 2-0 seemed a fair scoreline, but Petit added the icing on the cake after being slipped in by his Arsenal midfield colleague Patrick Vieira, to make it 3-0. 🔊 "The day of glory has arrived," sung @FrenchTeam players & fans as La Marseillaise boomed across Paris #OnThisDay in 1998 🏟️ This was a right-back who had never previously scored for France — and never would do so again — but he momentarily transformed into a goalscoring machine, first grabbing the equaliser a minute after Suker's goal and then, even more improbably, curling home with his left foot from outside the box. “It was what I call my Miles Davis moment,” he later told The Guardian. “Footballers can be like artists when the mind and body are working as one. It is what Miles Davis does when he plays free jazz — everything pulls together into one intense moment that is beautiful. During this period, winning the World Cup seemed to primarily be about collecting clean sheets. France had a strong defence, they protected them with solid holding midfielders, and they ultimately conceded only two goals in seven matches, a stark contrast from Brazil. “We conceded 10 goals in our seven games,” acknowledged Brazil captain Dunga afterwards. “You cannot expect to win the World Cup like that.” Brazil would return four years later with a better defence — and a fit Ronaldo.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CARSON, Calif. (Jan. 24, 2026) – A debut day for forward Reilyn Turner followed by a deluge of second-half goals, with five arriving in a 12-minute span, powered the U.S. Women's National Team to a 6-0 victory against Paraguay at Dignity Health Sports Park, the most visited venue in USWNT program history and home of the LA Galaxy in Major League Soccer. The win kicks off 2026 for the U.S. ahead of SheBelieves Cup in March, three matches against Japan in April and World Cup Qualifying later this year. Forward Trinity Rodman made her highly anticipated return to the U.S. Women's National Team fresh off re-signing with the NWSL's Washington Spirit in a groundbreaking deal. On Saturday, the forward earned her 48th cap and first since April 5, 2025, when she scored to help the USWNT defeat Brazil 2-0 in Inglewood, Calif. At 23 years old, Rodman is the most experienced player on this January roster, leading the group in caps and goals (12). Against Paraguay, the Laguna Niguel, Calif. native sported the captain's armband for the first time in her career and led a Starting XI that averaged just 9.6 caps entering Saturday's match. Joining Rodman in the starting lineup was Turner, a fellow Orange County native. Saturday marked the international debut for the dynamic Portland Thorns FC attacker who hails from nearby Laguna Beach, Calif. Turner was one of three players to debut on Saturday, with midfielder Sally Menti and and forward Maddie Dahlien, who subbed on in the second half, became the 287th and 288th players to earn caps for the Women's National Team. Three minutes later, Rodman capped off her monumental week with a goal of her own, the 12th of her career and first since 2025, which resulted in a jubilant celebration from tonight's captain. In the 58th minute, Sentnor chased down a long through ball from Gisele Thompson, the Angel City defender and Studio City, Calif. native, who played tonight in front of her hometown crowd. Sentnor finished a right-footed strike into the lower left corner to add to the U.S. lead and record her second career brace. After receiving a pass from Bethune, Sears took a couple dribbles and slid her shot past Patricia López, the Paraguayan goalkeeper who subbed on for Cristina Recalde at halftime. Sears' finish rounded off a swarm of goals for the U.S. Women's National Team and tallied the team's fourth straight clean sheet, going back to 2025. U.S. goalkeeper Mandy McGlynn, earning her fifth cap, played a full 90 minutes and wasn't called into action until the 42nd minute when she calmly collected a cross into the box from Paraguay. Prior to kickoff at Dignity Health Sports Park, U.S. Soccer honored former USWNT forward and Los Angeles native Christen Press in a pre-match celebration. The two-time World Cup winner announced her retirement from professional soccer last fall. Press concluded her international career with 155 caps and ranks No. 9 all-time in goals for the program with 64. Next, the U.S. Women's National Team heads 117 miles north – stadium to stadium – to face another South American opponent, taking on Chile at Harder Stadium on Santa Barbara, Calif., on Tuesday, Jan. 27 in the final tune-up before the SheBelieves Cup (Click here to view tickets | 7 p.m. PT / 10 p.m. From about eight yards from goal at a difficult angle, the forward slid a low shot with her left foot that rolled inside the near post and into lower left corner of the goal. USA – ALLY SENTNOR (IZZY RODRIGUEZ), 47th minute: After Olivia Moultrie and Rodriguez combined nicely on the left wing, Rodriguez slipped a pass into the path of Sentnor slashing inside the box. USA – TRINITY RODMAN (TARA RUDD), 56th minute: This goal came off a combination of two Washington Spirit players. She slammed home a low, left-footed strike into the right corner of the net to grab a goal in her first match as captain. USA – ALLY SENTNOR (GISELE THOMPSON), 57th minute: Out of the back, Thompson thread a long vertical ball through the Paraguayan defense for Sentnor. Sears took two dribbles – one short, one long – to fire a low strike with her right foot that rolled into the left, lower corner.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trinity Rodman capped off an excellent week in style, scoring her first goal for the U.S. women's national team in nine months during the team's 6-0 win over Paraguay on Saturday that was defined by their second half dominance. It did eventually come in first half stoppage time courtesy of Reilyn Turner, who connected with her Portland Thorns teammate Olivia Moultrie and scored from an angle to notch her first international goal on her debut. Ally Sentnor also impressed with a brace bookending that 10 minute spell, while substitute Emma Sears bagged the sixth and final goal of the game less than 10 minutes after coming on. She was able to go 63 minutes, though, a sign that her fitness is trending in the right direction as she and her teammates begin to shake off the preseason rust. The USWNT close out their January camp with a friendly on Tuesday against Chile at Santa Barbara's Harder Stadium. A slow first half gave way for an uber-productive second half, one in which the team followed through with Emma Hayes' vision of a team that takes advantage of the opportunities in front of them. Ally Sentnor bagged a brace, Trinity Rodman returned to the scoresheet and Olivia Moultrie excelled in midfield but a lot of players showcased their talents today, making it a strong start for all in 2026. 78' The USWNT are not finished taking cracks at goal, unsurprisingly, the latest coming from substitute Maddie Dahlien in her first cap. She finds herself near the endline and takes an angular shot at Paraguay's goal, something that Patricia Lopez should handle but fumbles. She goes straight for goal, making her way into the box before hitting a pacy shot that goalkeeper Patricia Lopez cannot keep out. 63' USWNT head coach Emma Hayes makes all five of her remaining substitutes to close out the game. [clears throat] Emily Sams, Hal Hershfelt, Maddie Dahlien, Sam Menti and Emma Sears come on, Kennedy Wesley, Tara Rudd, Izzy Rodriguez, Lo'eau LaBonta and Trinity Rodman come off. Rodman passes off the armband to 20-year-old Claire Hutton, making her another first-time USWNT captain today. Tara Rudd connects again with an attacking teammate, this time Ally Sentnor, who is essentially alone in the box and beats goalkeeper Patricia Lopez with ease. 56' This game has officially slipped out of Paraguay's grasp. The USWNT benefit yet again from club teammates connecting well, this time Tara Rudd's long ball towards Trinity Rodman. Today's USWNT captain made a run into the box and was never going to miss from close range, scoring her first goal for the national team since April of last year -- and capping off an excellent week for her in style. Croix Behune is denied of her first international goal moments earlier with an impressive point-blank save from Patricia Lopez but she is responsible for creating the USWNT's next goal. The USWNT may have struggled for the first goal but they wasted no time finding a second, with Ally Sentnor finishing things off. Again, a club and country connection was responsible here -- the Kansas City Current's Izzy Rodriguez slips the ball through traffic to find Sentnor, who also scored from an angle to double the USWNT's lead. Emma Hayes said to expect changes and on that front, she is a woman of her word -- Croix Bethune is on for Reilyn Turner, the goalscorer, at halftime. Paraguay have also made a change in goal to start the second half, bringing on Patricia Lopez in the place of Cristina Recalde. It may have taken a while but the USWNT have a deserved lead heading into the halftime break, the stats very clearly laying out their dominance - they had nearly 70% of the ball, took nine shots while facing just one and posted 1.44 expected goals to Paraguay's 0.05. Reilyn Turner, though, has so far made the most of her debut with the game's only goal so far, a nice follow-up to a strong rookie season with the Portland Thorns. 45'+3 The long wait for a goal is finally over, with Reilyn Turner bagging a goal in her debut - and near her hometown of Lakewood, California! Olivia Moultrie spots club and country teammate Turner making a run and sends the ball to her left, the ball zooming past a few Paraguay players before meeting Turner. 40' The USWNT have stpped things up after a mid-tempo patch in the middle of this half but like many of their opportunities in front of goal, they end up winning a corner that they cannot do much with. Trinity Rodman and Reilyn Turner have had some notable chances but again, nothing is really coming off for the hosts - they have six shots, one on target but just 0.54 expected goals so far. 30' ...And just as I say that, the USWNT look a little dangerous in front of goal. Izzy Rodriguez darts down the wing, a reflection of the fact that she and Gisele Thompson are making those aggressive forward runs against Paraguay, and tries to connect with Trinity Rodman. The ball is in front of her but the timing's off so she cannot get a great hit on it. 30' Half hour gone by on the clock, and there's been some disjointed play as to be expected. Emma Hayes alluded to this during yesterday's media availability, mentioning that we might see some things look "a bit clunky." 26' The USWNT's quick start has tapered off a little bit, allowing Paraguay to settle into the match a bit more. Trinity Rodman is an easy target for her teammates, who continue to send the ball her way after carving their way around Paraguayan opponents. There are different players responsible for the chaos, though - Olivia Moultrie and Lo'eau LaBonta have tried to connect with Rodman and Ally Sentnor has caused real problems for Paraguay while playing in and around the No. Paraguay's high line, while an ambitious choice, is making it easy for the USWNT to take advantage of their attacking opportunities. It feels like sooner rather than later that the hosts will find a breakthrough. 6' It takes almost no time at all for the USWNT to edge towards Paraguay's goal, with Gisele Thompson making an important run on the flank and Kennedy Wesley taking a shot that Paraguay 'keeper Cristina Recalde making the save and forcing the ball out for a corner. Christen Press is on the pitch at Dignity Health Sports Park in a familiar sight for U.S. Soccer ceremonies - a framed jersey with her name and number of caps (155), a bouquet of flowers in hand, federation dignitaries and Press' family members on the pitch ... and the player's dog, Bob! It's nice to see Bob partake in an important day for his mom. Hello from USWNT vs. Paraguay at Dignity Health Sports Park! Christen Press spent some time with media in the mixed zone and here's what she had to share about Trinity Rodman She's having a very good week, and I think we're all really proud of her, and in a lot of ways, she does represent sort of the next phase, the next generation, in a big way, like her personally," Christen Press on Rodman. "So much of what we all did as leaders and players on this team was to try to create a reality like the one that she has today, where she gets to be her full self and her big personality and make the money that she deserves and earns. I think the pressure of playing for this team is real, and it will never go away, and that's the privilege. You won't always be on the national team. But while you have the honor of bearing the weight of so many people in this country's hopes and dreams and joy on their Sundays. It's a really special thing, and I know she'll do us all proud." Press becomes the latest accomplished veteran in a long line of them to have a moment such as this one, something Emma Hayes likes to use as a meeting point between a history-making version of the team and the current group of rising talents -- and also a chance for her to respect the legacies those players left behind. She is joined in the lineup by the likes of Mandy McGlynn in goal and Washington Spirit teammate Tara Rudd (formerly McKeown) in defense, while Reilyn Turner will earn her first cap via a starting role. USWNT starting XI: Mandy McGlynn, Gisele Thompson, Tara Rudd, Kennedy Wesley, Izzy Rodriguez, Lo'eau LaBonta, Claire Hutton, Trinity Rodman, Ally Sentnor, Olivia Moultrie, Reilyn Turner Substitutes: Claudia Dickey, Ayo Oke, Emily Sams, Riley Jackson, Croix Bethune, Hal Hershfelt, Kate Wiesner, Sally Menti, Emma Sears, Maddie Dahlien, Yazmeen Ryan, Jameese Joseph The visitors will be hoping for a better outing this time around with a team headlined by midfielder Claudia Martinez, who is reportedly set to join Trinity Rodman at the Washington Spirit in time for the 2026 season. Paraguay starting XI: Cristina Recalde, Fiorela Martinez, Tania Riso, Maria Vega, Daysy Sanchez, Cindy Ramos, Danna Barcete, Limpia Fretes, Claudia Martinez, Griselda Garay, Fatima Acosta Substitutes: Patricia Lopez, Naomi de Leon, Maria Tamay, Erika Cartaman, Yanina Servin, Milagros Rolon, Belen Talavera, Nabila Perruchino, Agustina Varela The USWNT's first camp of the year falls outside of a FIFA window and lands just before Gotham FC's participation in the first-ever FIFA Women's Champions Cup, leaving Emma Hayes with plenty of spots to fill on her roster in the absence of several regulars. It means, though, that Hayes can continue her period of experimentation for at least another month and extend her plans for the national team beyond the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil and the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. Emma Hayes revealed in her pre-match press conference on Friday that, should she be fit enough to start, Trinity Rodman will wear the captain's armband against Paraguay. Rodman said on Friday that she plans to fill the leadership void during this month's friendlies, adding a professional maturity to her game. Read more on Rodman's new leadership status here. Midfielders (8): Croix Bethune (Washington Spirit), Hal Hershfelt (Washington Spirit), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current1), Riley Jackson (North Carolina Courage), Lo'eau LaBonta (Kansas City Current), Sally Menti (Seattle Reign FC), Sam Meza (Seattle Reign FC), Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns FC) The countdown to November's World Cup qualification tournament is officially underway, this month's friendlies - including Tuesday's against Chile in Santa Barbara - will offer an important chance for players to impress head coach Emma Hayes as she inches closer to that looming deadline. Stick around for pre-match coverage and updates once the USWNT's first game of 2026 begins. There is no gambling offered on this site.</p>

Christen Press welcomed herself to the U.S. women's soccer team by scoring twice in her debut in the first game of 2013. The team said goodbye Saturday at Dignity Health Sports Park, honoring Press before its first game of 2026, a 6-0 win over Paraguay. In between, Press played 154 more times for the U.S., winning two World Cups, an Olympic bronze medal and scoring 62 more goals, retiring as the ninth-leading scorer in  team history. But  those are just numbers because as good as Press was, she wants to be remembered for the legacy she left behind, for the barriers she broke, for the inspiration she continues to provide for  players who  followed her to the national team. As much as U.S. women's national soccer team coach Emma Hayes would like to have her full roster at the ready, having several veteran players out presents an opportunity. “I feel really lucky that I had the opportunity to play long enough to overlap with some of these young players and be able to see the growth of the game, how far it's come, and be able to see what the next generation of player feels like. Talk about following in Press' footsteps: The first score Saturday came from Reilyn Turner of the Portland Thorns, like Press a Southern California native who scored her first U.S.  goal on a left-footed shot in the first half of her international debut. The second goal, less than two minutes into the second half, came from Kansas City's Ally Sentnor. And that opened the floodgates, with the U.S. getting an own goal from Paraguay's Fiorella Martínez followed by scores from Trinity Rodman — who was celebrating the three-year contract, reported to be worth a record $6 million, she signed Thursday with the Washington Spirit — a second goal from Sentnor and another from Emma Sears. Ten months later, playing with Angel City FC in the NWSL, she shredded the anterior cruciate ligament  in her right knee, an injury that required four surgeries and nearly 25 months to repair. She never played another game for the national team and made just three more starts for Angel City before announcing her retirement last October. By then Press, 37, had made the transition from soccer star to businesswoman and media personality with Re-Inc, a gender-neutral community-driven fashion brand, and the Re-Cap Show,  an  award-winning soccer podcast, both of which she runs with wife and former teammate Tobin Heath. U.S. midfielder Trinity Rodman celebrates after scoring in the second half against Paraguay on Saturday. “I have spent a lot of time looking at the business of women's sports and how we need to reimagine it. “In a dream world, I'd be able to continue to influence the ecosystem as a businessperson.” As a preschooler she played with older kids in co-ed league because one team was short a girl. “I didn't touch the ball once,” she remembered years later. “I picked daisies and waved to my mom.” She went on to win two CIF Southern Section titles at the Chadwick School and a Hermann Trophy at Stanford before starting a club career that took her to eight teams in three countries. It's a résumé that already is challenging the next generation of national team players. “I admired her for a long time,” said Seattle Reign winger Maddie Dahlien, 21, who made her national team debut Saturday. You never know when your opportunity will be. “I've always admired her and thought what a fantastic football player she is. Very different to what was a more traditional American forward at the time,” Hayes said. For Press, it was a celebration that marked the transition from one stage of  life to the next. I miss the discipline and ritual that football brings to my life.” Trinity Rodman re-signed with Washington Spirit on a deal reportedly worth more than $2 million annually, making her the NWSL's highest-paid player.
