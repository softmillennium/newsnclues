                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Twelve-year-old Milan-based tech conglomerate Bending Spoons has quietly become one of the tech industry's most prolific buyers, now owning Meetup, WeTransfer and many others, but it remains largely unknown to the general public. Despite its catchy name, the company has stayed remarkably under the radar, and it typically makes headlines only when it adds another recognizable brand to its portfolio — the latest in date being Eventbrite, which it agreed to buy for $500 million last December. Its focus is on acquiring underperforming but popular tech brands, then transforming them to serve millions of users more efficiently. The company tends to make news when it restructures these acquired companies, often through significant layoffs, or makes controversial changes to beloved products — as it did with both Evernote and WeTransfer. Still, Bending Spoons remains largely unknown, even though its roster of products has served more than a billion people, with over 300 million monthly active users and 10 million paying customers. Bending Spoons describes itself as a company that acquires and transforms digital businesses. However, it didn't start that way — Bending Spoons' founders had taken a stab at building their own apps and products before eventually shifting their focus. The little-known backstory is that Bending Spoons was born out of the remains of Evertale, a Copenhagen-based startup that participated in Disrupt SF 2011's Startup Alley and raised seed funding for its photo-sharing app, Wink. Evertale failed not long after, and investors were able to exit, but its founders and a couple of employees kept working together, initially on in-house apps. Soon enough, the team made its first acquisition, followed by many others, CEO and co-founder Luca Ferrari told the venture podcast 20VC in a rare interview. In 2020, Bending Spoons made an exception when it created and donated Immuni, Italy's official COVID-19 contact-tracing app. While this focus on efficiency and revenue overlaps with private equity strategies, Bending Spoons claims a key difference: It “aims to hold forever, and has never sold an acquired business.” It is building a live portfolio, not collecting internet relics or presiding over a tech graveyard. To be clear, Bending Spoons' acquisition targets so far haven't necessarily been failing businesses — many still had substantial user bases and revenue. Let's recap these key deals, and what happened in their aftermath. While Bending Spoons acquired several companies between 2014 and 2021, including the AI-powered photo enhancer Remini, its most notable acquisitions happened more recently. The first half of following year, 2024, was particularly active, with the acquisition of Meetup, app maker Mosaic Group, and Hopin's StreamYard all happening within six months. In July 2024, it went on to acquire the publishing platform Issuu and the file transfer service WeTransfer, where it later cut staff and made changes to its free plan, introducing stricter limits. In December 2025, WeTransfer's cofounder Nalden criticized Bending Spoons' decisions and said he was building another file transfer service. In November 2024, Bending Spoons announced it would spend $233 million on an all-cash take-private deal to acquire video platform Brightcove. Bending Spoons also announced its intention to acquire Vimeo in a $1.38 billion all-cash deal, and soon after, to acquire AOL from Yahoo for an undisclosed amount. In December 2025, Bending Spoons announced it would acquire yet another well-known brand: Eventbrite. Once again, it may pay much less than Eventbrite was once worth — only some $500 million, a far cry from the company's $1.76 billion valuation when it went public in 2018. Earlier this month, Eventbrite stockholders filed a lawsuit in Delaware to upend the take-private deal over voting rights, and Eventbrite is currently fighting an effort to fast-track this challenge. Since October 2025, Bending Spoons has been one of Europe's rare tech decacorns (companies valued at more than $10 billion). This comes on the heels of Bending Spoons' latest funding round: $270 million from investors, including T. Rowe Price and earlier backers Baillie Gifford, Cox Enterprises, Durable Capital Partners, and Fidelity, plus a $440 million secondary share sale by existing shareholders. Ferrari's stake in Bending Spoons is now reportedly worth $1.4 billion, while co-founders Matteo Danieli, Luca Querella, and Francesco Patarnello each hold stakes worth $1.3 billion, according to Forbes estimates based on shareholder data published by the Italian Business Register. Though long bootstrapped, Bending Spoons had previously raised equity financing several times, including in September 2022 and early 2024. Upon announcing its new funding in October 2025, Bending Spoons said it would support future acquisitions and investment in its proprietary technology and AI capabilities. Bending Spoons said it intends to continue pursuing new acquisitions that expand its portfolio of consumer and enterprise digital products, and it now has funding to afford more prominent targets going forward — as confirmed by its decision to acquire Eventbrite. (Not long before acquiring AOL, Bending Spoons was also rumored to be eyeing app maker Elysium and Typeform, the Barcelona-based SaaS company known for its form creation tools.) Presumably to support its continued efforts to acquire companies, it also has openings across various roles, with new hires initially working from its Milan headquarters before gaining the option to work from offices in London, Madrid, and Warsaw, or remotely. In fact, despite warning candidates that Bending Spoons is a “demanding environment,” the company has said it already received more than 600,000 job applications in 2025, a figure that will likely climb as its recent deals generate additional attention. In November, Ferrari had told Reuters that should it decide to go public, Bending Spoons would probably list in the U.S., where tech companies tend to achieve higher valuations.

Researchers from the University of California, Irvine have developed a transceiver that works in the 140 GHz range and can transmit data at up to 120 Gbps, that's about 15 gigabytes per second. According to UC Irvine News, these new speeds could match most fiber optic cables used in data centers and other commercial applications, usually around at 100 Gbps. “But as such speeds, conventional transmitters that create signals using digital-to-analog converters are incredibly complex and power-hungry, and face what we call a DAC bottleneck.” The team replaced the DAC with three in-sync sub-transmitters, which only required 230 milliwatts to operate. By comparison, a DAC that can keep up with 120 Gbps would consume several watts of power, making it unsuitable for smartphone and other mobile device use. “If we stuck to traditional methods, the battery life of next-generation devices would vanish in minutes,” UC Irvine Nanoscale Communication Integrated Circuits Labs director Payam Heydari said. “Our group's answer is a transceiver that leapfrogs over current limitations by performing complex calculations in the analog domain, rather than the power-hungry digital domain.” Aside from its efficiency, the researchers said that the silicon is fabricated on 22nm node, using fully depleted silicon-on-insulator technology, which is so much easier to manufacture than cutting edge 2nm and 18A nodes from TSMC and Samsung. Moreover, the group also said that their new technology is a suitable alternative to the miles and miles of cabling that data centers require, allowing them to reduce their set-up and operating costs. Current 5G mmWave technology, which can go up to 71 GHz, has a range of about 300 meters, so you can expect this to have an even smaller radius. So, unless we see new innovations that could extend the reach of this high-speed wireless technology, we may see a future where our cities are dotted with high-speed cell sites.

Modder Jiachen Liu on X decided to remedy this issue by transplanting an RTX Titan core and 24GB of GDDR6 memory. Armed with all these upgrades, the modified RTX 2080 TI HoF (or supercharged Titan RTX, whatever you want to call it) was recorded pushing a whopping 18,038 points on the graphics score for 3DMark TimeSpy Extreme. To understand just how crazy this score is, the average score for two Titan RTX graphics cards in SLI is around 17,000 points, and an average RTX 3090 score is around 14,000 points in TimeSpy Extreme. 2080Ti HOF >> TITAN RTX modIt's time to do justice for this beautiful PCB with a fully unlocked TITAN core and 24GB of HC16 memory.

Again, all of this was done with one GPU. Maybe one day we'll see the same card paired in SLI with another card with the same Titan GPU swap. If that happens, we could see some new records being broken. 18,000 times two equates to a TimeSpy Extreme score that outperforms even an LN2 overclocked RTX 5090.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Not because of Transformers, but because I—a millennial and self-proclaimed Cartoon Network kid—grew up on Dexter's Lab, and man, did that show burrow its way into my brain. Maybe if I hadn't been so awful at doing useful stuff like math and chemistry, Dexter might have compelled me to become a scientist or an engineer. As you may have gathered from reading this, though, I didn't do that. I say “next best” because this road, unbeknownst to me at the time, is one that led me straight to something that scratches that childhood itch just as much as lab coats and beakers: a big friggin' robotic Transformer. The Soundwave G1 is an impressive robot with bad sound. When I first saw Robosen's new ultra-expensive, elaborate Transformer robot, the Soundwave G1, it was hard not to get excited. In case you didn't catch my missive when this thing was launched, the Soundwave G1 takes Robosen's robotic Transformers (yes, there are many) a step further and features a Bluetooth speaker mode that can be used when Soundwave is all crumpled up in its cassette player form. That's sick for hardcore Transformer fans since it brings the original schtick of Soundwave to life, but also for me personally because I pay my bills in part by reviewing speakers. In short, my interests collided here in a big way, which means I got a chance to test out Soundwave myself, and boy, do I have some thoughts. I'm going to try to do both right now, and for the sake of all the potential Transformers fans out there reading this, I am going to start with the fun stuff first. How, you might ask, is the Soundwave G1 as a toy? When you pick it up, you can feel all the robotics inside, which is because there are a lot. According to Robosen, there are “28 high-precision intelligent servo motors” and 84 custom microchips. Even the cassette player portion pops out for dramatic effect, though you cannot actually play real tapes with it, which is a bummer. In Robosens' defense, I can only imagine fitting a tape deck in this thing would be an engineering nightmare. In terms of look and feel, it's the robot toy most people my age wanted as a kid, and for $1,400, it damn well should be. The Soundwave G1 also understands quite a few commands. With the help of a built-in microphone, you can shout at your expensive robot and get it to do things. Altogether, there are 48 pre-programmed voice commands that include stuff like “attack” or “defend,” which make the robot shoot with its included toy gun and gesture. There are also more Transformers-specific commands like “Megatron” or “Laserbeak,” in which the Soundwave G1 says stuff from the show while gesticulating. A fun fact here is that they got the original Soundwave voice actor, Frank Welker, to come in and do some voice acting for the robot. By shouting “Hey Soundwave, transform,” you get to watch the robot dramatically bend all of its limbs up and curl into a tape player from a robot mode or vice versa. It's wild, but also that leads me to my first and biggest downside of the Soundwave G1. I fear Soundwave, after all the years of laser battling with Autobots, may be a little hard of hearing. Time after time, I was forced to scream at this giant hunk of plastic, begging it to do stuff. C'mon, Robosen; if I wanted to be agitated by a voice assistant, I would just talk to my Nest speaker at home. That's partially because canonically, Soundwave talks in a vocoder-like voice that blends synth and human speech, but also because the speakers aren't the best (which is something I'll get into more later). With all that said, there is an app where you can punch in commands on your phone. There's other stuff you can do in the companion app, too Here, you can use a touchscreen D-pad to tell Soundwave to walk around (it can move left, right, forward, or backward), and you can even program your own actions. Action programming, I must warn you, is pretty far from intuitive, though I did have some minor success with using the block-based programming UI to get Soundwave to do simple stuff like twist its arms. Honestly, that may be my favorite app-based touch since I'm a big fan of the original score with all of its obnoxious guitar and '80s riffage. Lastly, there's a “mini theater” mode where Soundwave is meant to do what amounts to a short demo while you watch a video in the app, but I couldn't really get the feature to work correctly. In Robosen's defense, I was using an early version of the app to test Soundwave, so maybe that had something to do with it? As I mentioned before, there are two ways to review the Soundwave, and the second is as a Bluetooth speaker. By shouting at Soundwave to transform, you can use Robosen's robot as a Bluetooth speaker. All you have to do is pull up your phone's Bluetooth and connect, and boom, you're in business. As I wrote when this robot was first announced, I was curious about whether the Soundwave G1 would actually sound decent. I mean, it's a toy, to be sure, but it is also $1,400, so decent sound isn't totally out of the question, right? I'm sad to say my first inclination was correct; the Soundwave G1 sounds sort of bad. It's not unlistenable, but definitely not a speaker that you're going to want to use for anything other than the novelty of it all. Sound is pretty flat and one-dimensional, and for what I assume are engineering reasons, the sound actually emanates from the back of the robot when it's in cassette mode, which is not ideal for fidelity. It's bad enough that I sort of wish that Robosen had leaned into the badness, applying some kind of tape-like effect to the audio you listen to that makes it feel as though the '80s are alive and well. I mean, this thing doesn't actually play tapes, but what if it sounded like you were playing tapes? A nice touch is the inclusion of physical buttons on the Soundwave G1, which can be pressed and used as you would on a tape player. When I listened back to my recordings in the app, though, or tried to play them from the robot by pressing the play button, I didn't hear much of anything. Maybe the microphone on my robotic son is defective? And even if I did speak Decepticon, I wouldn't have to speak very much of it. I think, if you're lucky, you'll get an hour and a half out of the Soundwave G1, and that's at lower volumes. That bad battery can be a little dangerous, too. This is all to say that you do not want to use the Soundwave G1 as a Bluetooth speaker in any sort of serious way, which is probably fine for most people. But if you, like me, entertained the idea that Soundwave would sound decent, you can rid yourself of that fantasy now. That's more than a brand new iPhone 17, or two Nintendo Switch 2s, or almost half the price of a Chevy Chevette in 1984. But maybe you've been robbing banks with the Decepticons and have money to blow. And maybe you want to use a little bit of that cash on a robot that you can impress your friends with for five minutes. If you're that person, then I guess go for it: the Soundwave G1 is an impressive robot when it works, and you don't have to shout at it 400 times to transform. The Bluetooth speaker stuff is definitely a parlor trick, but as long as you know that going in, I'm going to say no harm, no foul. I don't know, call me soft, but it's just hard to get mad at a robot transformer that I don't think most people are expecting to do much other than, well, transform. If you want a good Bluetooth speaker, go buy that; if you want a robot that makes you feel like a kid again, and you're wealthier than I'll ever be, then I guess do as Megatron does and go with the Soundwave G1.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rather, it's a traditional, teardrop-shaped, behind-the-ear hearing aid that takes its name from Phonak's new Spheric Speech Clarity 2.0 system, designed to enhance the understandability of conversations in noisy conditions, no matter what direction the voices are coming from. Yes, Phonak Audeo Infinio Ultra Sphere is indeed a mouthful. For this review, I'll call it the Ultra Sphere. The new DeepSonic DNN (deep neural network) chip is responsible for multidirectional speech processing in noise. Are two chips better than one for hearing clearly? I wore the Ultra Sphere hearing aids for a week to find out. The Ultra Sphere hearing aids are visibly larger than most modern behind-the-ear (BTE) aids, clearly due to the extra silicon inside. But while they're more readily visible to outside observers, that differential doesn't noticeably impact comfort, even with long-term wear. Both hearing aids have a two-way rocker button used for power, volume, and media control. Tap control is also an option for certain Bluetooth functions, but this is disabled in the MyPhonak app by default. The units carry an IP68 weatherproof rating and are available in seven colors. You'll also be fitted with your preferred eartip style (open, closed, or Phonak's new wax-resistant EasyGuard domes) during your professional evaluation. These prescription hearing aids worked quite well across the board in my testing. Tuned professionally by a Phonak representative, their claims of hearing better in noisy conditions were accurate, mildly—though not transformatively—dulling background sound in most cases. It's nearly impossible to quantify exactly how much better the Ultra Sphere aids worked compared to other models on this front. This light hiss effect was sustained throughout my experience, but I could only detect it when there wasn't any other noise in the room. The aids offered an appropriate and gentle level of support—never overwhelming me with sound when I didn't need it and overall improving my ability to understand speech both in person and while watching TV. High-pitched and sharp sounds like keyboard taps and mouse clicks registered a bit too loudly for complete comfort, but this could likely be improved with a return visit to the audiologist. Bluetooth streaming quality is very good for BTE hearing aids. These aids can't effectively cancel heavy ambient noise during media streaming (particularly with open eartips), but on the whole, they were good enough for casual music and phone call usage. However, I encountered a few brief connectivity drop-outs during listening sessions. I was stunned by how comfortable these hearing aids are, even for long periods of wear stretching into multiple hours. Phonak specifies a huge battery range of up to 56 hours, depending on usage patterns. Phonak offers several add-ons that work with the Infinio Ultra line, including its TV Connector (about $320), which plugs into your television and pipes sound straight to your hearing aids, similar to how Auracast works, bypassing the need for ambient sound amplification. This device, which sells for a hefty $1,800 to $2,000, is a portable microphone that can also be used to pipe remote sounds into the Phonak hearing aids. The mic can also be clipped to a lapel or worn like a pendant to amplify the wearer's voice (and only the wearer), picking up audio from a person standing up to 80 feet away. It's insanely powerful, though I noticed it also had a tendency to pick up every sound in between me and my desired source: running water, rustling clothes, people chewing, and so on. (Prices can vary widely and are dependent on the provider.) My classic advice on this front still stands: Most people with moderate hearing loss will do perfectly well with one of our over-the-counter hearing aid picks, and save a lot of cash to boot. Those with more profound hearing loss and/or the need for significant tuning may want to consider a more sophisticated hearing support device like the Ultra Sphere.

But digging deeper, it quickly became clear that they didn't understand how to run my software correctly; and in many other places they bent over backwards to cherry-pick, and made a lot of bold and completely wrong claims. Correcting the record would place their software far below mine.Mind you, I'm VERY happy to see newer toolkits which are better than mine -- I wrote this thing over 20 years ago after all, and have since moved on. After a lot of back-and-forth however, it became clear that the journal's editor was too embarrassed and didn't want to require a retraction or revision.

A lot of what you had to say shaped the way I think about computer science. The journal agreed with me, and rejected the paper.A couple of months later, I saw it had been published unchanged in a different journal. This is one of the reasons you should never accept a single publication at face value. But this isn't a bug — it's part of the algorithm. It's just that most muggles don't know how science actually works. Once you read enough papers in an area, you have a good sense of what's in the norm of the distribution of knowledge, and if some flashy new result comes over the transom, you might be curious, but you're not going to accept it without a lot more evidence.This situation is different, because it's a case where an extremely popular bit of accepted wisdom is both wrong, and the system itself appears to be unwilling to acknowledge the error.

You can do a blameless postmortem guiding a change in policy which ends in some people getting fired. In theory maybe, but in my experience the blameless postmortem culture gets taken to such an extreme that even when one person is consistently, undeniably to blame for causing problems we have to spend years pretending it's a system failure instead. I think engineers like the idea that you can engineer enough rules, policies, and guardrails that it's impossible to do anything but the right thing.This can create a feedback loop where the bad players realize they can get away with a lot because if they get caught they just blame the system for letting them do the bad thing.

Not necessarily, although certainly people sometimes fall into that trap.

The most toxic person I ever worked with, who culminated in dozens of peers quitting the company before he was caught red handed sabotaging company work, was actually one of the nicest and most compassionate people during interviews and when you initially met him. He, of course, was a big proponent of blameless postmortems and his toxicity thrived under blameless culture for longer than it should have.

It could also well be that Joe did the same thing at his last employer, someone in hiring happened to catch wind of it, a disorganized or understaffed process resulted in the ball somehow getting dropped, and here you are. If Joe dropped the production database and you're uncertain about his intentions then perhaps it would be a good idea to do the bare minimum by reducing his access privileges for the time being. No more than that though.Whereas if you're reasonably certain that there was no intentional foul play involved then focusing on the individual from the outset isn't likely to improve the eventual outcome (rather it seems to me quite likely to be detrimental).

It's not enough to merely identify a given cause and call it a day, you have to do something to change or address it to reduce the future likelihood of negative behaviors and outcomes; it's how I can rationalize not necessarily faulting a homeless person in a system that fails to address underlying causes of homelessness and people incentivized not to show empathy or compassion towards them, but also rationalize vilifying the wealthy classes who, despite having infinite access to wealth and knowledge, willfully and repeatedly choose to harm others instead of improving things.Villainy and Heroism can be useful labels that don't necessarily simplify or ignorantly abstract the greater picture, and I'd like to think any critically-thinking human can understand when someone is using those terms from the first rung of the ladder versus the top rung.

I've read multiple times that a large percentage of the crime comes from a small group of people. Jail them, and the overall crime rate drops by that percentage. ← It took more words to describe the act in that very sentence. If the two things match, you have a single idea. Simple.Speaking personally, if someone's very first contact with me is a lie, they are to be avoided and disregarded. I don't even care what "kind of person" they are. And getting to the root cause of their stuff or rehabilitating them is not a priority for me; that's their own job. Such is life in the high-pressure  world of impressing rdiddly.

If we equate being bad to being ignorant, then those people are ignorant/bad (with the implication that if people knew better, they wouldn't do bad things)I'm sure I'm over simplifying something, looking forward to reading responses. Personally, I do believe that there are benefits to labelling others as villains if a certain threshold is met. It cognitively reduces strain by allowing us to blanket-label all of their acts as evil [0] (although with the drawback of occasionally accidentally labelling acts of good as evil), allowing us to prioritise more important things in life than the actions of what we call villains. You aren't going to magically sidestep cause and effect.The act itself is bad.The human performing the act was misguided.I view people as inherently perfect whose view of life, themselves, and their current situations as potentially misguided.Eg, like a diamond covered in shit.Just like it's possible for a diamond to be uncovered and polished, the human is capable of acquiring a truer perspective and more aligned set of behaviors - redemption. Thinking otherwise may be convenient but is ultimately misguided too.So the act and the person are separate.Granted, we need to protect society from such misguidedness, so we have laws, punishments, etc.But it's about protecting us from bad behavior, not labeling the individual as bad.

I don't buy that for a moment. It presumes people do not have choices.The difference between a man and an animal is a man has honor. Each of us gets to choose if we are a man or an animal. Each of us gets to choose if we are a man or an animal. These failures aren't on that list because they require active intent. Both can be pursued without immediately jumping to defending a crime Blameless post-mortems are critical for fixing errors that allowed incident to happen. On the one hand, it is possible to become judgmental, habitually jumping to unwarranted and even unfair conclusions about the moral character of another person. Sure, pathological systems can create perverse incentives, even ones that put extraordinary pressure on people, but moral character is not just some deterministic mechanical response to incentive. Murder doesn't become okay because you had a “hard life”, for example. And even under “perfect conditions”, people would misbehave. In fact, they may even misbehave more in certain ways (think of the pathologies characteristic of the materially prosperous first world).So, yes, we ought to condemn acts, we ought to be charitable, but we should also recognize human vice and the need for justice. In some cases, it would even be harmful to society not to harm the reputations of certain people. The latter (externalization) is obvious when people habitually blame “systems” to rationalize misbehavior.

We know for an absolute fact that changing the underlying system matters massively but we must continue to acknowledge the individual choice because the system of consequences and as importantly the system of shame keeps those who wouldn't act morally in check. So we punish the person who was probably lead poisoned the same as any other despite knowing that we are partially at fault for the system that lead to their misbehavior. The fact that they can publish lies and others are happy to build on lies ind indicates the whole community is a cancer. The fact that the community rejects calls for correction indicates its metastasized and at least as far as that particular community the patient is dead and there is nothing left to save.They ought to be properly ridiculed and anyone who has published obvious trash should have any public funds yanked and become ineligible for life.

We need to recognize that in our assessments. We must reward good choices and address bad ones (eg the study authors'). We should also change environments to promote good and oppose evil so the pressures are pushing in the right direction. Until then, there is ongoing harm to public science. Until then, there is ongoing harm to public science. He really may be that, or maybe he's having an extraordinarily stressful day, or maybe he's just not integrated with the values of your society ("cutting the line is bad, no matter what") or anything else BUT none of all that really helps you think clearly. So you left your values now too because you are busy fighting a stereotype.IMHO, correct course of action is assuming good faith even with bad actions, and even with persistent bad actions, and thinking about the productive things you can do to change the outcome, or decide that you cannot do anything.You can perhaps warn the guy, and then if he ignores you, you can even go to security or pick another hill to die on.I'm not saying that I can do this myself.

Turns out that calling someone on their bullshit can be a perfectly productive thing to do, it not only deals with that specific incident, but also promotes a culture in which it's fine to keep each other accountable. It's also important to recognize that there are a lot of situations where calling someone out isn't going to have any (useful) effect. In such cases any impulsive behavior that disrupts the environment becomes a net negative. It's also important to base your actions on what's at hand, not teaching a lesson to "those people". It's fine and even good to assume good faith, extend your understanding, and listen to the reasons someone has done harm - in a context where the problem was already redressed and the wrongdoer is labelled.This is not that. This is someone publishing a false paper, deceiving multiple rounds of reviewers, manipulating evidence, knowingly and for personal gain. And they still haven't faced any consequences for it.I don't really know how to bridge the moral gap with this sort of viewpoint, honestly.

But if you start from an assumption of bad faith your judgment will almost certainly be clouded and thus there is a very real possibility that you will miss useful courses of action.The above is on an individual level. From an organizational perspective if participants know that a process could result in a bad faith determination against them they are much more likely to actively resist the process. This is what we see in the aviation world and it seems to work extremely well. Assuming good faith tends to be an important thing to start with if the goal is an objective assessment.

Getting mad at the arsonist doesn't help. This isn't going to happen, so the right thing to do is for the vast majority of practitioners to just ignore academia whilst politically campaigning for the zeroing of government research grants. Maybe the answer to building a resilient system lies in why it is still up. Unfortunately academia as a pursuit has never had a larger headcount and the incentives to engage in misconduct have likely never been higher (and appear to be steadily increasing). When the opposition is called evil it's not because logic dictates it must be evil, it's called evil for the same reason it's called ugly, unintelligent, weak, cowardly and every other sort of derogatory adjective under the sun.These accusations have little to do with how often people consider others things such as "ugly" or "weak", it's just signaling. These accusations have little to do with how often people consider others things such as "ugly" or "weak", it's just signaling. This is true though, and one of those awkward times where good ideals like science and critical feedback brush up against potentially ugly human things like pride and ego.I read a quote recently, and I don't like it, but it's stuck with me because it feels like it's dancing around the same awkward truth:"tact is the art of make a point without making an enemy"I guess part of being human is accepting that we're all human and will occasionally fail to be a perfect human.Sometimes we'll make mistakes in conducting research. Sometimes these mistakes will chain together to create situations like the post describes.Making mistakes is easy - it's such a part of being human we often don't even notice we do it.

On the other hand, it sounds like this workplace has weak leadership - have you considered leaving for some place better? If the manager can't do their job enough to give you decent feedback and stop a guy giving 10 min stand ups, LEAVE.Reasons for not leaving? A blameless organization can work, so long as people within it police themselves. As a society this does not happen, thus making people more steadfast in their anti-social behavior I've seen a lot of variety in the ethical standards that people will publicly espouse. > Vonnegut is not, I believe, talking about mere inauthenticity. He is talking about engaging in activities which do not agree with what we ourselves feel are our own core morals while telling ourselves, “This is not who I really am. I am just going along with this on the outside to get by.” Vonnegut's message is that the separation I just described between how we act externally and who we really are is imaginary.https://thewisdomdaily.com/mother-night-we-are-what-we-prete... No the complicity isn't right.The banality of evil.

For starters, the bar should be way higher than accusations from a random person.For me,there's a red flag in the story: posting reviews and criticism of other papers is very mundane in academia. Some Nobel laureates even authored papers rejecting established theories. For me,there's a red flag in the story: posting reviews and criticism of other papers is very mundane in academia. Some Nobel laureates even authored papers rejecting established theories. So where is the author's paper featuring commentaries and letters, subjecting the author's own criticism to peer review? Other than just the label being difficult to apply, these factors also make the argument over who is a "bad person" not really productive and I will put those sorts of caveats into my writings because I just don't want to waste my time arguing the point. I think it makes a lot more sense to label them clearer labels which we have a lot more evidence for, like "untrustworthy scientist" (which you might think is a bad person inherently or not). I have a relative who lives in Memphis, Tennessee. A few years ago some guy got out of prison, went to a fellow's home to buy a car, shot the car owner dead, stole the car and drove it around until he got killed by the police.One of the neighbors said, I kid you not, "he's a good kid" But there is a concern which goes out of the "they" here. Actually, "they" could just as well not exist, and all narrative in the article be some LLM hallucination, we are still training ourself how we respond to this or that behavior we can observe and influence how we will act in the future.If we go with the easy path labeling people as root cause, that's the habit we are forging for ourself. We are missing the opportunity to hone our sense of nuance and critical thought about the wider context which might be a better starting point to tackle the underlying issue.Of course, name and shame is still there in the rhetorical toolbox, and everyone and their dog is able to use it even when rage and despair is all that stay in control of one mouth. Using it with relevant parcimony however is not going to happen from mere reactive habits. If we go with the easy path labeling people as root cause, that's the habit we are forging for ourself.

On my side-project todo list, I have an idea for a scientific service that overlays a "trust" network over the citation graph. Authors and institutions that accumulate too many of such sketchy works should be labeled equally. Over time this would provide an additional useful signal vs. just raw citation numbers. You could also look for citation rings and tag them. I think that could be quite useful but requires a bit of work. The idea failed a simple sanity check: just going to Google Scholar, doing a generic search and reading randomly selected papers from within the past 15 years or so. It turned out most of them were bogus in some obvious way. A lot of ideas for science reform take as axiomatic that the bad stuff is rare and just needs to be filtered out. Once you engage with some field's literatures in a systematic way, it becomes clear that it's more like searching for diamonds in the rough than filtering out occasional corruption.But at that point you wonder, why bother? There is no alchemical algorithm that can convert intellectual lead into gold. If a field is 90% bogus then it just shouldn't be engaged with at all. But at that point you wonder, why bother? There is no alchemical algorithm that can convert intellectual lead into gold. If a field is 90% bogus then it just shouldn't be engaged with at all. Publishing does not say anything about your quality as a researcher, since anyone can do it.2) Being published doesn't mean it's right, or even credible. No one is filtering the stream, so there's no cachet to being published.We then let memetic evolution run its course. This is the system that got us Newton, Einstein, Darwin, Mendeleev, Euler, etc. It works, but it's slow, sometimes ugly to watch, and hard to game so some people would much rather use the "Approved by A Council of Peers" nonsense we're presently mired in. 2) Being published doesn't mean it's right, or even credible.

Still I'm skeptical about any sort of system trying to figure out 'trust'. Just too many people trying to get into the system (and getting in is the most important part). The system ends up promoting an even more conservative culture. What might start great will end up with groups and institutions being even more protective of 'their truths' to avoid getting tainted.Don't think there's any system which can avoid these sort of things, people were talking about this before WW1, globalisation just put it in overdrive.

When you added it up, most of the hard parts were Engineering, and a bit Econ. You would really struggle to work through tough questions in engineering, spend a lot of time on economic theory, and then read the management stuff like you were reading a newspaper.Management you could spot a mile away as being soft.

It's rare to see someone in academics who is willing to set their own reputation on fire in search of truth. “Most Published Research Findings Are False” —> “Most Published COVID-19 Research Findings Are False” -> “Uh oh, I did a wrongthink, let's backtrack at bit”.Is that it? If IFR is low then a lot of the assumptions that justified lockdowns are invalidated (the models and assumptions were wrong anyway for other reasons, but IFR is just another). So Ioannidis was a bit of a class traitor in that regard and got hammered a lot.The claim he's a conspiracy theorist isn't supported, it's just the usual ad hominem nonsense (not that there's anything wrong with pointing out genuine conspiracies against the public! Wikipedia gives four citations for this claim and none of them show him proposing a conspiracy, just arguing that when used properly data showed COVID was less serious than others were claiming. Grokipedia's article is significantly less biased and more accurate.

Those seem mostly explainable by good-faith wishful thinking and motivated reasoning to me, while that paper seems hard to explain except as a knowing fraud.

The case for lockdowns was being promoted based on, amongst other things, the idea that PCR tests have a false positive rate of exactly zero, always, under all conditions. This belief is nonsense although I've encountered wet lab researchers who believe it - apparently this is how they are trained. In one case I argued with the researcher for a bit and discovered he didn't know what Ct threshold COVID labs were using; after I told him he went white and admitted that it was far too high, and that he hadn't known they were doing that.Gellman's demands for an apology seem very different in this light. Ioannidis et al not only took test FP rates into account in their calculations but directly measured them to cross-check the manufacturer's claims. Nearly every other COVID paper I read simply assumed FPs don't exist at all, or used bizarre circular reasoning like "we know this test has an FP rate of zero because it detects every case perfectly when we define a case as a positive test result".

Judging from PubPeer, which allows people to post all of the above anonymously and with minimal moderation, this is not an issue in practice. It has 0 comments, for an article that forgot "not" in "the result is *** statistical significative". The word "bad" loses its meaning if you explain away every bad deed by such people as something else.

You guys are saying that drink driving does not make someone a bad person. Where do you draw the line for someone being a bad person?I mean with this line of reasoning you can "explain way" every bad deed and then nobody is a bad person. So do you guys consider someone to be actually a bad person and what did they have to do to cross that line where you can't explain away their bad deed anymore and you really consider them to be bad?

But if you're going to quote the whole thing it seems easier to just say so rather than quoting it bit by bit interspersed with "King continues" and annotating each I with [King]. With the above, I think we've empirically proven that we can't trust mathmeticians more than any other humans  We should still rigorously verify their work with diverse, logical, and empirical methods. Also, build ground up on solid ideas that are highly vetted. They'll also oftne use a reliable formalism to check other formalisms. (Who knows except when tested empirically on many programs or proofs, like CompCert was.) They'll also oftne use a reliable formalism to check other formalisms. (Who knows except when tested empirically on many programs or proofs, like CompCert was.) But, we still need people to look at the specs of all that to see if there are spec errors. (Who knows except when tested empirically on many programs or proofs, like CompCert was.) And therein lies the uncomfortable truth: Collaborative opportunities take priority over veracity in publications every time. These probably have bigger chance of being published as you are providing a "novel" result, instead of fighting the get-along culture (which is, honestly, present in the workplace as well). but not politically) harder to do because they possibly mean you have figured out an actual thing.Not saying this is the "right" approach, but it might be a cheaper, more practical way to get a paper turned around.Whether we can work this out in research in a proper way is linked to whether we can work this out everywhere else? How many times have you seen people tap each other on the back despite lousy performance and no results? It's just easier to switch private positions vs research positions, so you'll have more of them not afraid to highlight bad job, and well, there's this profit that needs to pay your salary too.

As I said, harder from a research perspective, but if you can show, for instance, that sustainable companies are less profitable with a better study, you have basically contradicted the original one. Benefits we can get from collective works, including scientific endeavors, are indefinitely large, as in far more important than what can be held in the head of any individual.Incitives are just irrelevant as far as global social good is concerned. Award prize monies split between the first two or three independent groups demonstrating a result.The 6k citations though ... I suspect most of those instances would just assert the result if a citation wasn't available. I suspect most of those instances would just assert the result if a citation wasn't available. If the flow of tax, student debt and philanthropic money were cut off, the journals would all be wiped out because there's no organic demand for what they're doing. They are pushed to publish a lot, which means journals have to review a lot of stuff (and they cannot replicate findings on their own). The result is papers getting popular even if no one has actually bothered to replicate the results, especially if those papers are quoted by a lot of people and/or are written by otherwise reputable people or universities. Living VPs Joe Biden — VP 2009–2017 (became President in 2021; after that he's called a former VP and former president)Not likely the one referenced after 2017 because he became president in 2021, so later citations would likely call him a former president instead of former VP.Dan Quayle — VP 1989–1993, alive through 2026Al Gore — VP 1993–2001, alive through 2026Mike Pence — VP 2017–2021, alive through 2026Kamala Harris — VP 2021–2025, alive through 2026J.D.

That's not right; retractions should only be for research misconduct cases. It is a problem with the article's recommendations too. But I agree with the point about replications, which are much needed. But the article is generally weird or even harmful too. Going to social media with these things and all; we have enough of that "pretty" stuff already. Secondarily, very few studies are replicated in the first place unless there is a demand for linked research to replicate it before building on it.There are also entire fields which are mostly populated by bullshit generators. Certain branches of psychology are rather interesting in that space. Certain branches of psychology are rather interesting in that space. Maybe, I cannot say, but what I can say is that CS is in the midst of a huge replication crisis because LLM research cannot be replicated by definition. So I'd perhaps tone down the claims about other fields. Pushing for retraction just like that and going off to private sector is…idk it's a decision. She was just done with it then and a pharma company said "hey you fed up with this shit and like money?" I went into software but still have connections back to academia which I left many years ago because it was a political mess more than anything. edit: as per the other comment, my background is mathematics and statistics after engineering.

Now I am proficient in spoken and written Spanish, and I can perfectly understand what is said, and yet I still ran the English through Google Translate and printed it out without really checking through it.I got to the podium and there was a line where I said "electricity is in the air" (a metaphor, obviously) and the Spanish translation said "electricidad no está en el aire" and I was able to correct that on-the-fly, but I was pissed at Translate, and I badmouthed it for months.

But no one will tell you even if they encounter. But no one will tell you even if they encounter. If they can't get it after many tries, they just move on, and try some other research approach. If they claim it's because the original study is flawed, people will just assume they don't have the skills to replicate it.One of the problems is that science doesn't have great collaborative infrastructure. Or maybe if you're lucky there's an email list for people in your field where they routinely troubleshoot each other's technique. But most of the time there's just not enough time to waste chasing these things down.I can't speak to whether people get blackballed. There's a lot of strong personalities in science, but mostly people are direct and efficient. But accusing someone of fraud is a serious accusation and you probably don't want to get a reputation for being an accuser, FWIW.

I've also seen the resistance that results from trying to investigate or even correct an issue in a key result of a paper. Even before it's published the barrier can be quite high (and I must admit that since it's not my primary focus and my name was not on it, I did not push as hard as I could have on it) “We're all just here to do work and get paid. He's just doing what they make us do”. Most people are just “I put thing in tube. Make money by telling government about tube thing. We need to throw all of this out by default. For science, we need the scientific method applied with skeptical review and/or replication. Our tools, like statistical methods and programs, must be vetted.Like with logic, we shouldn't allow them to go beyond what's proven in this way. So, only the vetted claims are allowed as building blocks (premises) in newly-vetted work. If not, they are re-checked for the new circumstances.

We need to develop education for people about how humanity actually works. We can improve steadily over time.On my end, I've been collecting resources that might be helpful. That includes Christ-centered theology with real-world application, philosophies of knowledge with guides on each one, differences between real vs organized science, biological impact on these, dealing with media bias (eg AllSides), worldview analyses, critical thinking (logic), statistical analyses (esp error spotting), writing correct code, and so on.One day, I might try to put it together into a series that equips people to navigate all of this stuff.

For example, look at how people interact with LLMs. Lots of superstition (take a deep breath) not much reading about the underlying architecture. But this here is just warm air build on a fundamental misunderstanding of how to measure and interpret citation data. “Your email is too long.”This whole thing is filled with “yeah, no s**” and lmao.More seriously, pretty sure the whole ESG thing has been debunked already, and those who care to know the truth already know it.A good rule of thumb is to be skeptical of results that make you feel good because they “prove” what you want them to.

They are not going to came forward and say "I misinterpreted the data and made long reaching conclusions that are nonsense, sorry for misleading you and thousands of others".The process protects them as well. Someone can publish another paper, make different conclusions. Even if it's clear for anyone who digs a bit deeper it will not be communicated to the audience the academia is supposed to serve. It's there to serve the population not to exist in its own world and play its own politics and power games. Someone can publish another paper, make different conclusions.

Today the elites rule the plebs by saying "Science sasy so, so you must do this".Author doesn't seem to understand this, the purpose of research papers is to be gospel, something to be believed, not scrutinized. There is a reason scriptures were kept away from the oppressed, or only made available to them in a heavily censored form (e.g. the Slaves Bible). (By a tortured analogy, you could say that Catholicism and Orthodoxy are common law Christianity, while Protestantism is civil law Christianity. )From a Catholic or Orthodox perspective, there is a living tradition from the days of Jesus and the Apostles to present day.

For example there is a long history of studies of the relationship between working hours and productivity which is one of the few things that challenges the idea that longer hours means more output. Even if you support sustainability, criticizing the paper will be treated as heresy by many.Despite our idealistic vision of Science(tm), it is a human process done by humans with human motivations and human weaknesses.From Galileo to today, we have repeatedly seen the enthusiastic willingness by majorities of scientists to crucify heretics (or sit by in silence) and to set aside scientific thinking and scientific process when it clashes against belief or orthodoxy or when it makes the difference whether you get tenure or publication.

Then you have to choose apps you trust, and it's easier to trust open source apps.What GrapheneOS brings in terms of sandboxing is that the Play Services run sandboxed like normal apps.

I agree that this is the perception but anyone working in the mobile space on both platforms for the past ~2 years will know Google is a lot more hard nosed in reviewing apps for privacy concerns than Apple these days (I say this negatively, there is a middle ground and Apple is much closer to it - Google is just friction seemingly in an attempt to lose their bad reputation).

If I don't like one privacy compromising feature, I couldn't use the app at all.Android may have improved this in the last few years, but I found it to be a dealbreaker for the entire platform.

Android may have improved this in the last few years, but I found it to be a dealbreaker for the entire platform. I remember that it was being introduced like... more than a decade ago? iOS can just force everybody to use liquid glass with one update, Android has to think more about backward compatibility. Everything else I agree with, but the Android camera APIs do not allow developers to build good device independent camera apps the way they are available on iOS. Social media apps have historically been worse in Android, because of lax app and privacy controls.> What else is there, where is the advantage?Personally, I'd rather not have Google buried deep inside all aspects of my phone. > What else is there, where is the advantage?Personally, I'd rather not have Google buried deep inside all aspects of my phone. Personally, I'd rather not have Google buried deep inside all aspects of my phone. Since some updates ago, my keyboard is still broken if I type too fast, and autocorrect been essentially broken for the same amount of time. Must be happening for ~years now, still waiting for a new update to finally fix it.At least on Android you can change the keyboard to something else if you'd like, instead of being stuck with what your OS developer forces on you. How's that different than Google Messages being exclusive to Android? People on Android I've run into seem to have a half dozen apps and use anything but the built in messaging.A few months ago while on a trip I ran into an older couple that wanted some picture I took in a place they weren't physically up to going. They had Android, and the guy opened about 5 or 6 different messaging apps, not really knowing what any of them were, it seemed like a real mess. I sent them using Messages over RCS, assuming they'd go to Google Messages, or whatever the default equivalent standard app is for Google (they seem to have changed it a dozen times). It could be that the pictures were taking a while to send, my phone showed they sent, but he had no idea where to look or where they might have went, despite having so many messaging apps. I hope he is able to find them or they came through with a notification once he had a better single.Having one good app that everyone uses is better than the default app being sub-par, or so constantly in flux that the users and smattered about to dozens of different apps that can't talk to each other.

I mean, one could say the exact same thing but swapping Google with Apple. This is especially relevant for the camera, but also various other sensors and hardware modules that exist inside these phones.That said, in recent years there are just a number of other areas that android is much better at such as deeper AI integration, which goes back to even prior to the current LLM craze. That said, in recent years there are just a number of other areas that android is much better at such as deeper AI integration, which goes back to even prior to the current LLM craze. And because of that Sarafi has made our lives miserable. Now you have a crappy app that only works on some devices, and now with no tabs, no links, text you cannot select anymore because they used the wrong component, etc.Ugh. I didn't take WebUSB seriously until I steered someone to flashing a small firmware onto something and they could do it straight from the browser! And it was a nice workflow too, just a few button and a permission click.Two other examples I can think of are flashing Via (keyboard) firmware and Poweramp using WebADB via WebUSB to make gaining certain permissions very easy for the layman. I imagine it's gonna get more and more user in enterprise too.Firefox is seriously behind by refusing to implement it.

Consider the fact that Chromium has to specifically blacklist Yubikey and other known WebAuthn vendor IDs, otherwise any website could talk to your Yubikey pretending to be a browser and bypass your 2FA on third party domains.I'm conflicted on WebUSB because it's convenient but on the balance I think it's too dangerous to expose to the general public. I don't know how it could be made safer without sacrificing its utility and convenience.

For values of “just work” close to 0.Make a picture, connect with a Windows PC, iOS needs a password, then the picture is not visible to the PC, disconnect, go with Apple photos to look at the picture, repeat connecting, with password, now it is visible.Try to set up a hotspot, there is no button to turn the hotspot on/off.So yes, it “just works" Make a picture, connect with a Windows PC, iOS needs a password, then the picture is not visible to the PC, disconnect, go with Apple photos to look at the picture, repeat connecting, with password, now it is visible.Try to set up a hotspot, there is no button to turn the hotspot on/off.So yes, it “just works" You can even put it on the settings drawer. Look for "personal hotspot".I don't have a mac anymore, but IIRC you could even turn it on from the paired mac. Do Android phones come with a physical button to enable hotspot? Another example is Sonos, where the iOS app contains TruePlay to tune your speakers. They can do this because there is relatively few iPhone models (microphones). But this is a general, noticeable trend, where developers will add more / better / polished features to the iOS app. I researched iOS vs Android last year so some of my info may be out of date but this is what I collected.Apple iOS exclusives (or earlier app versions because devs prioritized iOS):  ChatGPT iOS app -2 months before Android Sora -2 months before 2025-11 Android Bluesky iOS app -2 months before Android (February 2023 iOS invitation-only beta; April 2023, it was released for Android) Blackmagic Design camera 2023-09-15  -9 months before Android  2024-06-24 Halide camera app  https://old.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/17klq40/what_are_some_good_examples_of_iphoneexclusive/k7efznt/ Zoom F6  https://zoomcorp.com/en/us/software-product-page/software-sub-cat/F6-control-app/   https://apps.apple.com/us/app/f6-control/id1464118916 Godox Light    https://www.diyphotography.net/godox-finally-launches-android-app-for-the-a1-but-only-for-some-phones/ ForeFlight Mobile   https://support.foreflight.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004919307-Does-ForeFlight-Mobile-work-on-Android-devices  https://old.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/1883eya/the_authoritative_answer_to_why_isnt_foreflight/ Adobe Fresco Procreate FlexRadio SmartSDR SSDR  2023-10-27T13:15:09+00:00  https://community.flexradio.com/discussion/8029186/smartsdr-for-android-device Google Android app exclusives  TouchDRO for milling Kodi media player There really aren't many popular/prominent Android-only apps that's intended for direct consumer download from the Google Play Store.

The tone of that seems like you thought I was taking the discussion into fanboy evangelism and therefore Android needed to be defended. That wasn't the intent and I already tried to downplay my comment by stating the iOS ecosystem specifics do not matter to 99% of mainstream users. Yes, everybody on HN already knows Android has a much bigger market share.The point was simply to inform the gp asking the question about iOS that there are apps and niches he may not be aware of. You answered to:>> I don't see any iOS advantage with the apps anymore.With a list of apps, some of which only listed because they got Android support a few months later. ).I get why those apps matter to you, but it feels a bit arbitrary. While the quote refers to something that was more general (which suggests that "at a point, iOS had a lot more quality apps"). I am just saying that the answer "no but I checked the app I like on iOS and a handful of them don't exist on Android" was kind of one anecdotal data point in the discussion.And my point about Android having a bigger market share was that my intuition is that probably popular apps end up on Android eventually, or alternatives exist.I honestly really don't care if people prefer iOS, Android, GrapheneOS, or a Linux for mobile distro. >> I don't see any iOS advantage with the apps anymore.With a list of apps, some of which only listed because they got Android support a few months later. ).I get why those apps matter to you, but it feels a bit arbitrary.

Literally the only reason I have iOS devices is because of app availability in this category. The apps that are more specialized to reach OS tend to prioritize iOS because if you look at app revenue, iOS users wildly outspend Android users. At least this was true when i was doing mobile shit a couple years agoThat doesn't mean the android app sucks, but it's usually given lower priority. That doesn't mean the android app sucks, but it's usually given lower priority. Whenever there is an app with full feature parity (WhatsApp) you assume at best it can be equal, based on nothing. Whenever there is a choice in apps, they're often cross-written in something that allows easy porting, and very similar, or the native Apple solution is much smoother. It's rare that an app just feels better on Android, and usually limited to cases where a specific app is only available on Android or, you know, Google. Android at least has features like scoped storage.Where is the ios equivalent of newpipe? iOS isn't particularly open source friendly, but mostly people don't do it because of personal incentives, not because it can't be done.It's subjective, and I get that, but what you miss is that features are subjective too. Missing parity apps are only relevant when you care about that feature; at no point in my life have I ever thought my life would be better or more convenient if I could only torrent on my phone.But having an app that is responsive and works well has made my life better. (Ironically, I've kind of noticed this is part of the Unix ethos writ small: do one thing and do it well. It's not exact, and iOS for sure has tons of crud everything apps.

If Google isn't careful they could find themselves in a downward spiral situation, stuck between apple on one side, and android forks on the other.And the last answer is, as always, money- browser is deemphasized on iOS, and so it's weaker feature set matters less- iOS is generally easier to develop for because of less device differentiation- on average iOS has significantly wealthier users who tend to be higher return or paying customers (seriously, look it up). This in turn leads companies to invest more heavily in iOS.- easier integration due to a narrow system services ecosystem (no Google vs Samsung slapfights)- unified platform advantage (apps written for iOS easily port to the watch and tablet, unlocking larger markets, and justifying greater spend in developing apps)- apples review process is significantly stricter (for better or for worse)Yes, Apple doesn't have something like fdroid, and that's really disappointing and honestly a legitimate dealbreaker for a lot of people And the last answer is, as always, money- browser is deemphasized on iOS, and so it's weaker feature set matters less- iOS is generally easier to develop for because of less device differentiation- on average iOS has significantly wealthier users who tend to be higher return or paying customers (seriously, look it up).

The real problem is that Android vendors mess up with the OS in weird ways by adding custom ultra battery savers, removing APIs etc. which is much less predictable than dealing with a few Apple devices, that are more homogenous.Then many vendors ship their own apps which are buggy and you need to know that vendor's Z Calendar app has a weird bug to account for.

Your BIO on HN is:> I HAVEN'T SHOWERED AT ALL! Android has a reputation for being unsafe precisely because of sideloading (as well as low Google Play fees, looser app review, accessibility services and remote access).This policy is bad for us HNers, but objectively good for the 95+% of people who will never sideload a legitimate Android app, but are extremely likely to get caught by scammers.The heavy US skew of HN really distorts the arguments here, as Android-based scams aren't as common in AMerica due to the prevalence of iOS in that region.

To resolve the problem, scammers would deceive the victims into downloading a malicious app, in an Android Package Kit (APK) file format, sent through WhatsApp. Google could let users add their own signing keys (like browsers allow), and it might be they will let students or power users do this, or they could do what F-Droid does in packaging FOSS apps without developers having to provide extra PII information. If they do neither of these things, it de facto means they're only after control at the expense of normal users. In fact I don't know anyone among any of my friends or family that have ever had that issue.Every last one of my non-technical friends and family have been hit by spyware on their windows devices.To say I'm extremely skeptical that this has anything to do with protecting users is an understatement.In fact I'm willing to go out on a limb and say it's a nearly non-existent issue outside of people being targeted by nation states.Would love to see some numbers backing up the claim that sideloading is resulting in mass exploiting of Android devices because I can't find them.

The consensus online appears to be “oh, yeah, that's the OIS module, you have to expect it, they all do that”. Well, iPhones also have OIS and they don't do this.Android might be “good enough” in hardware now but it's definitely still behind.

Whether they did it out of the goodness of their heart or because a regulator forced them, it's still got usb-c When they introduced Lightning in 2012, they made a commitment to all of the third-party hardware developers that iPhones would support it for a decade. I'm sure the EU pressure helped but USB-C iPhones shipping in 2023 is right on that original timing. Oh right, because they collected license fees and royalties for Lightning, reportedly $4 per cable. Truth is, apple fought EU hard, we saw it from inside quite well. Backstabs, some cheap tricks trying to delay and evade this, even when it was clear how things will be.

The strategy of doing everything you can to make sure your customers truly and utterly despise you and want to spit in your face is probably not productive. They only need to attract users with "free" and cheap services so that advertisers think their campaigns are reaching enough eyeballs. Whether or not that's the case, and whether or not the end user has a good experience, is hardly relevant. One area Android has a clear advantage is Android TV devices verified by Google, because there is a much wider array of streaming apps of all kinds available. However google doesn't seem to focus on this very much, and if you look for forum recommendations for google android streaming devices it's very often the NVIDIA shield pro from 2019. Hopefully that device will I'll be supported for a few more years because there seems to not be good easily available alternatives. If the rumors are true that the whole anti-sideloading thing is mostly because some governments complained, it might not have to do with a business strategy at all.

Androids are like that out of the box unless you spend over a thousand dollars, and those only last for about half the time (a combination of inferior hardware and inferior software). It doesn't matter if you have a 120Hz screen if the UI only updates at 20.This is why the only killer feature for Android (outside the cameras) is adblocking- which, of course, is what Google wants to prevent. They don't want you to run real Firefox (with the only effective adblock remaining), and they want you to pay for YouTube Premium rather than using NewPipe (or some other ReVanced successor) so you can't get out of paying 10 bucks to listen to a video with the screen off. iPhones don't generally become too slow to realistically use until their support lifetime expires.

Another reason it should have been broken apart years ago. You just don't want ads, and it is still possible to not see them. Google pays content creators so little they have all started including ads in their videos. Meanwhile, Google is more and more aggressive with their own ads interrupting videos and pushing you to subscribe to their expensive offer.Some people, like me, have just stopped watching YouTube. Other are turning to blocking ads.It's the usual tug of war between revenues and UX but I don't think consumers have to feel bad about not playing by Google's rules.

It's the usual tug of war between revenues and UX but I don't think consumers have to feel bad about not playing by Google's rules. The actual data could be hosted p2p across all the users devices, and any missing data retrieved one-time-only from real youtube servers. The real challenge is delivering good enough performance that your site is better than waiting through 30 seconds of ads; and making it worth your time to run the site: there's hassle, legal risk, and it's not like you can run ads to make some cash. In Apple's case this has been the only Apple business to grow at all in several of the recent years. In fact there's quite a few Apple businesses that look like they are "revenue neutral", most famously iPads. )So not only are they enshittified, and you see them getting worse and worse over time, but the financial statements show: if you're expecting this to get any better either in the Apple or Google case, you're insane. Because clearly ads for scams are worth it for advertisers, and most other types of ads are not worth it. "Are governments/institutions that are totally dependent on these systems willing to pay to either improve phones or make an alternative available? ", again has boatloads of evidence that the answer is NO, in all caps. Top results are promoting Apple or Google themselves, everything else are ads, and very bad deals that trivially will neither accomplish the promised financial independence nor weight loss. Or should I put it like this: the credit card deals advertised are so bad they might achieve weight loss. By the way ads designed to mislead, which the top ads for either search obviously are, are what both Google and Apple promised time and again never to do. So not only are they enshittified, and you see them getting worse and worse over time, but the financial statements show: if you're expecting this to get any better either in the Apple or Google case, you're insane. Because clearly ads for scams are worth it for advertisers, and most other types of ads are not worth it.

As an non-apple tech user, apple phone hardware has very few things that interest me or put them above the others.Its better integration with software that did put them above, since it was optimized for a very narrow band of hardware so could get far even with subpar hardware (till M chips came but these days they are almost on par with Snapdragons). But that software has a list of issues much bigger than hardware above so no, thank you.

I tend to not use Apple not due to cost (I honestly believe it's OK to pay a premium for quality; I might disagree they offer it today though, as I do use a couple of their devices at work), but because of how closed their ecosystem is (and yes, all my personal devices are running some sort of Linux, and Android phones are rooted and with bootloader unlocked). Not everyone has the US culture of running their life on credit.Because when life changes, it isn't only their phone they lose.The only single time I had a contract, because it was the only way to get a Nokia N70, I learnt never to do another one ever again.

I mostly buy my phones outright too, but I am under no impression that everybody else does it as well. As a result, quite a lot of people use the "I can't believe they could make and sell an entire phone at this price" Xiaomi and similar phones. In many places the default is prepaid SIMs with separately purchased phones. Sometimes the prepaying can be automated (e.g. in Russia), sometimes it involves you physically going to a shop once a month or so (e.g. in Egypt).

No one cares about RCS, everyone uses WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Messenger, Line, etc...Core features are stuff like being able to search for a business through the phone app, Maps telling you where you parked your car, unprompted, compatibility with the casting protocol, the ability to make ANY app the default for a particular task, the ability to sideload, the fact you can switch phone brands and get whatever hardware you want but your core OS with all your accounts stays the same. Basically the ability to do what you want win your OS and no one restricting your phone's features.As for Google's strategy, it's the same as Valve's.

Both Qualcomm and Mediatek have caught up on the phone SoC market.The Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 has a slightly better CPU than the A19 Pro but a slightly worse GPU.

You forgot to mention how poor iPhone security is. Not surprised the same kind of person that buys an iphone also fell for samsung.

Not most placesI think it's weird you come at this from an antitrust angle when I would totally make the argument the other way.If there's pressure to remove this feature, then it's from companies that make apps that anyone can pull up in Revanced and they can patch it and can be running a version of a piece of software that shouldn't exist with "premium" features enabled. I don't think there's an argument against it really besides that. At least not an honest, intelligent argument....Ultimately, I doubt many would jump to Apple.

Much better camera sensors, much better silicon carbon batteries etc in Oppo, Vivo, Honor and Xiaomi devices than anything Apple produces.

Look at the latest Xiaomi, Oppo and other Chinese manufacturers, Apple would love to have the hardware they are shipping right now. From batteries to cameras and screens, apple is way behind on hardware tech. Yeah they are better than Samsung - but Samsung has also massively fallen behind what's the state of the art.>>is another customer Google has to pay exorbitant fees to a competitor to access.Last time I checked, it's apple paying Google, billions of dollars a year?

If any of these manufacturers decide to include an EMR pen in the body of the phone, like Samsung's S-Pen, they'll have me as a customer. This is true, but their phones don't ship with Google services out of box (at least the last time I checked). So in reality, "Google's Android" is really mostly Samsungs and Pixels. Also software installation in Android has been high friction for a while. Installing an APK on my phone is at least 10 clicks. By all means let people curate and use safe lists of software, but let's not pretend that making the life harder for the few registries containing solely open source and vetted software is in any way about making people safer. If there's anyone people need to be protected against, it's Alphabet and Apple and the entities they let in intentionally, rather than specter of "growing trend of scammers". Google just wants a tighter grip on their software chain, which is understandable if they were Apple but they're not. The term originated far before this debacle, and carries a meaningful distinction than just "installing". Specifically it means installing from a non-first party source. You might not agree the restriction should exist, or that even the concept of first party source at all, but for communication purposes it's worth having a simple word to describe that concept, rather than something like "installing from a non-first party app store". >Specifically it means installing from a non-first party source.Just like 99% of software running on computers in the world today?

Android chose the inverse framing and that choice isn't neutral. Right, which is why they used "sideload".>In other ecosystems the store path is described as "store install" not the other way around. No, this is just being non-neutral in the opposite direction. And neutrality here isn't about mirroring current usage frequency (which is unique to Android and recent relative to the history of computing), it's about continuity with prior computing norms. Even when one distribution path dominated in practice, it didn't get to redefine the base verb. Apple invented out of thin air the notion of a "first-party" software source or that computer users can only install software approved by a central authority. It's amazing how many confidently wrong people are springing up out of the wordwork to present revisionist history about the meaning of "install" like it's ancient wisdom. It's usage was varied, irregular, and not at any threshold of popular acceptance for one meaning or another.Windows, Dos, Linux, and online self-hosted services had no notion of "sideloading", or at least no usage of that vocabulary and did not use this notion of "install" that is now being retrospectively declared a longstanding historical norm. Even now, that's not a term used in Windows or Linux. Even Apple, who very much in practice utilize this controlled distribution model but even they don't use this sideloading/installing verbal distinction. In Apple's lexicon installing is neutral with respect to where an app comes from.So it's staggering to see a specific term of art that deviates from historical precedent that only is used in an Android context and only relatively recently in the history of computing be referred to as if its observing a longstanding precedent across all of computing.

Don't users and vendors have a right to call a thing what it is, or use different terms for different procedures?It seems absolutely nuts to try and censor this word, because y'all believe it was foisted on you by "lawmakers".

On Windows MacOS and Linux you can install anything. Windows SmartScreen will also give you trouble by blocking unsigned apps.So yeah, you can bypass these protective measures and "install whatever you want" ultimately, but it is basically the same process as sideloading on Android, isn't it? You don't got jack shit with your "trust" of Termux and Kodi. It means nothing to the end-user.We do not work in "trust me bro" territory when it comes to signing software, anymore.

There are plenty of different types of trust relationships between me and the Play Store and the devs who put their apps on it.But cryptographically, cybersecurity-wise, we need that CIA triad, and we need to authenticate that developers are who they say they are. And that authentication is the crux of cryptographic code signing. That's how cryptographic signing establishes trust relationships for computers.If your computer doesn't trust an app or a driver, it won't download, install or run it. Since you cannot teach a computer "actual trust" there must be an analogue to this. I don't know what you're on about "opposite to actual trust".

So if you want to have a conversation about trusting curl and bash and random gists...Like I said, I installed software in many ways back in the day. One common denominator was loading from trusted sources. This is still a good way to get infected.When I get on a friend's computer, I often have occasion to congratulate them for being uninfected, and it's nearly always because they "practiced good hygiene" in terms of loading only trusted software from trusted sources.So you're correct, in that really nothing has changed.

No experience, but if they lock out Android I probably will. Were it not for that, I would never have stopped using Huawei, IMO the best phone brand by a mile. Then keep a "real" second device for everything else. Up to you which one gets the SIM card and provides connectivity for the other (and ordinary phone services).I'd rather go back to old-fashioned hardware dongles from banks – but hey, lacking that, maybe I'll just think of the first of those two devices as a clunky, overly expensive one of those.

Unlike Ubuntu Touch, they allow you to run ordinary Linux desktop apps. But to your point specifically, Play store and App Store have APIs to rate from within the app: when the pop up shows, app author does not have an option to avoid getting a 1-star rating (they are also time-restricted, eg. at most once every 180 days for Apple IIRC).What devs do though, is to preempt it with "Are you enjoying our app?

Who on earth wants popup ads in Chrome installing shit? Designing a product so that almost all of it's intended users can operate it safely seems like the right decision. I guess if you take the old saying extremely literally, you could conclude that every fool is guaranteed to be parted with 100% of their lifetime available money regardless of what anyone else tries to do to stop that, but that's not true – and why old sayings (with a respectable 75% of the words right) taken literally aren't a good basis for decision-making.

For that matter, why even invest resources into fraud detection or law enforcement? All of that money is coming out of somewhere, and why should my tax dollars go toward catching fake nigerian princes when it's just helping idiots anyways?/s > That explanation broadly matches what we're seeing in recent versions of Google Play, where new warning messages emphasize developer verification, internet requirements, and potential risks, while still allowing users to proceed. And... What about accountability for hosting distributing spyware, malware loaded apps from Google Playstore and hundreds of copy cat, misleading apps?Why can't they pose a question when the phone is setup?- Yes, I want to sideload- No I dont wantIf the user says NO then to later enable it to allow sideload Yes, the user needs to factory reset phone. The rules don't apply to billion dollar corporations. The Playstore is filled with malware that pretend to be a different app. I have twice now had to recover the devices of family members when they installed malware on Samsung phones running up to date firmware.That malware to this level is even possible is another matter. I decided to Google the company after a few days. I was immediately confronted by thousands of reports by angry users, complaining about how after they tried the app, they got locked into a yearly subscription at exorbitant prices and it was impossible to cancel. The company itself is registered in some offshore tax haven.They used to scare us, that if we went to those shady pirate websites, somebody would steal our credit cards and steal our money. They used to scare us, that if we went to those shady pirate websites, somebody would steal our credit cards and steal our money. For Google everything is about protecting revenue, even when doing so exposes their users to real harm, and that's why they will not address the issue of copycat apps, poor practices on play store security or anything else that lowers the number of downloads on apps on play store. But, heaven forbid, I want to download an app that doesn't create revenue for them onto a phone I OWN, Google spends money lavishly.The Internet cranks are right. Like if it was "you need to do the developer 7-tap of the version label in settings", it'd be like "whatever". But given how long this process has taken, I suspect that is not what they've planned - it wouldn't take this long to develop, it certainly wouldn't take this long to explain.So I suspect that we're actually in the "Maybe Later" phase of "Google wants to control which apps you install: [ ] Yes [ ] Maybe Later". And I mean, if their proposed solution turns out to be "Me and 25 of my closest friends can install apps I make by phoning home to Google servers", then like, I can do that on iOS too. And if I'm not going to have meaningfully more control of my Android device, I may as well just go to iOS where Apple at least have a better privacy record and don't seem to have have an all-encompassing goal of "where can we put AI features to drive AI usage metrics up the most?"

But of course, I have that in a separate Android box, so I'm not forced to update to a new OS when replacing a TV (as I just did this week). When Google inquired in court how that could be if Apple doesn't even allow any form of side-loading, including other app stores (which Google does allow)The judge said, I shit you not, Apple doesn't have any competitors on their platform, therefore they can't be anti-competitive.Probably one of the worst most off the rails rulings ever. Or maybe the risks of monopolies and monocultures in computing. The same reason I use Linux for 25 years (not ideological, but it just makes most sense by far). The Apple/Google OS duopoly exists by design, they view bootloader unlocking and sideloading as threats because they break that controlThey want to be able to define and/or revoke your existence in the systemNo escape, because no alternative 1) a .apk that was not developer-verified2) without informing Google of this Apple already offers digital ID in some states. Google needs to be able to do the same thing.Age verification laws for online services will actually require something like a digital ID and Apple and Google want to be the providers.

If a company has a way to pay (by having another business entity in another country), then it probably works. In general, though, "sideloading" also refers to any "non-app-store" installation. "Sideloading" refers to data transfer between two local, peer devices. That's not really "sideloading" if you think about it, because it's just "loading" from peripheral storage.Later, when people dialed up on a PC, they could "download" software and then install it or do whatever with other data or media.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pretti was an American citizen and a registered nurse who worked in the Department of Veterans Affairs, according to a colleague who spoke to the Guardian. Pretti's killing comes 17 days after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross shot Renee Nicole Good, a mother of three. Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara said during a press conference on Saturday that information about what had led up to Pretti's fatal confrontation was limited, but at a separate press conference, Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol commander overseeing federal operations in Minneapolis, claimed to have a full assessment of what had taken place. He claimed the man had two loaded magazines and lacked identification, and alleged that Pretti intended to “massacre law enforcement,” while the Border Patrol agent who killed Pretti, he said, had extensive training. The Department of Homeland Security reiterated Bovino's claims in a post on X that has been viewed over 17 million times at the time of publication, and the narrative was carried unquestioningly by right-wing outlets, like the Post Millenial, which published a story headlined: “Armed agitator Alex Pretti appeared to want 'maximum damage' and to 'massacre' law enforcement when shot by BP in Minnesota.” Key portions of these claims are contradicted by publicly available evidence. On Truth Social, President Donald Trump weighed in to blame Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Vice President JD Vance backed up Trump's criticism of local leadership, sharing a screenshot of the president's Truth Social post and writing on X: “When I visited Minnesota, what the ICE agents wanted more than anything was to work with local law enforcement so that situations on the ground didn't get out of hand. The local leadership in Minnesota has so far refused to answer those requests.” Walz, in a press conference, referred to the federal narrative as “nonsense.” Nick Sortor, one of a group of right-wing influencers camped out in Minneapolis to cover ICE's campaign there, falsely referred to Pretti as an “illegal alien” and added that he “was armed with a gun and attempted to PULL IT on agents as he was being apprehended.” Pretti was a US citizen and born in Illinois, according to family members, who had no criminal record. Quoting a video of the shooting, Jack Posobiec, a right-wing influencer with close ties to the White House, wrote on X: “It is most certainly illegal to disrupt federal law enforcement operations and doing so while armed is not only unlawful, it is a good way to get shot.” While right-wing podcaster Tim Pool labeled Pretti “a radicalized leftist” in a post on X without providing any evidence, he also disagreed with Bovino's claim about killing multiple law enforcement officers: “There's no reason to think he was trying to massacre LEOs,” Pool wrote, referring to law enforcement officers. I believe that we have the right to remove any and all people who entered our country illegally,” Smith wrote. A bunch of pussies, drunk on power going around intentionally escalating violent interactions and intimidating US citizens.” In your inbox: Maxwell Zeff's dispatch from the heart of AI</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>No matter how we look at it, EVs are much friendlier and safer to the environment. Some people argue the source of electricty can be contested against because that involves fossil fuel burning again, but in today's world we are rapidly moving away from it and towards nuclear/hydel/wind methods for generating power.I hope ICE cars completely become a thing of the past in the next couple of decades to come. Some putting off soot clouds, white smoke, nothing visible but clearly not doing complete combustion. Sometimes I wonder if half the cylinders are even working.I've heard one car like that is the equivalent of a surprisingly large number of modern ICE cars is in good shape.I love EVs. But I think the “are new EVs worse than new ICE” discussions so often miss a fact.The pollution from ICE isn't just from very modern well tuned vehicles, things vary wildly. But all EVs use the same power supply (assuming local grid only), so no individual vehicles put off 10x the pollution per kWh.

Reminds me of how I didn't really notice cigarettes until they were banned from public spaces and the base level of normal was recalibrated. You can smell these cars from halfway up the road sometimes, when they're 100 metres ahead. One good thing about driving an EV is that weird oil or hot coolant smells are from someone else's car (and not a problem with your car)(although yes technically many EVs have coolant loops) (although yes technically many EVs have coolant loops) "They were driving with a 10 gallon coolant tank on the roof, presumably because the coolant loop had a big leak and needed continuous topping up". There just simply aren't that many things to burn or leak and still have a functioning vehicle. There are also lower ongoing costs for maintenance and fuel.There is still the secondary wealth filter of having a place to park and charge, of course. Second, places with high touch governments already lose out on business due to registration arbitrage. In the neighbourhood I live, there's a guy who visits someone here several times per week. Some day that guy is going to rear-end my car and break my neck because his brake lines finally gave out.Also, the compulsory car inspections only work for honest people.

It's more ‘I could have replaced a few cells in my battery pack, but the car bricked itself when I opened the pack! Notably many recent ICE cars aren't much better. Regardless, there's nothing cleaner than no combustion, and I can't wait until EV‘s have replaced them all Here's a bunch of those surveys: https://evcentral.com.au/which-is-best-for-the-environment-e...Keen to hear your expert opinion on what (eg) the International Energy Agency got wrong.

Could be coolant, but "coolant into engine" failure modes are generally rare and are usually the kind of thing that needs to get fixed promptly. I should note the power increase may not have a major impact on newer cars where the cat has been optimized to reduce it's negative power impact.Infact a popular tuner company, APR, that provides flashes tested the recent Volkswagen GTI and R generation with their most common tune and determined that with their tune removing the cat had a nominal impact.

When they have head gasket problems it tends to be combustion gas into coolant which blows the coolant out the expansion tank until equilibrium is reached. Many V engines have intake gaskets that can leak coolant into the intake or oil or both.Regardless, if you can taste coolant in the exhaust the car is basically at the point of "fix it now"> I might be mixing up blown heads with cracked manifolds which often go hand in hand since temp extremes in engines fissure cast parts like the manifold.A sizable minority of cars don't even use cast manifolds anymore. While it's possible for cast manifolds to crack in a way that makes them leak that's rare and it's more common for them to crack their mounting tabs off. Steel exhaust tubing can and does sometimes break after many years of vibration, say nothing of rust.While cylinder heads can crack it usually takes the kind of overheating that requires major work to fix in order to make it happen so just about nobody is driving around with a cracked head.

All in all, a well tuned ICE is better for everyone than a poorly tuned one, if you had to pick between the two. How do we even allow selling cars without HEPA filters. One of the reasons I wrote the comment above is because my filter has worn out and needs replacing, so all of a sudden I can smell all this nonsense again.1000% with the money. This is why forklift trucks and Zambonis run on propane instead of petrol or diesel. If you burn gas, you get no carbon monoxide or unburnt fuel because it runs ever so slightly lean and all the fuel is burnt.This means keeping the air clear is just a case of getting rid of carbon dioxide and water, so you can open some vents (warehouses have great big vents, big enough for trucks to drive in and out...) and let the place air out.

(Edited to add) Hmm actually people are already doing LPG conversions today as it's cheaper. Not sure if all LPGs are as pollution free, though. You can get ones with a complete set of LPG injectors and an ECU that takes its timing from the petrol injectors, and these are incredibly efficient. They're a bit harder to install (you need to drill holes in the intake manifold, it's a faff) but the engine can be mapped for even more power than on petrol and a tiny amount of pollution.There's still a lot of CO2 and water vapour, but as previously discussed you're burning all this shit anyway so you might as well extract useful work from it.The time to have done this was 25 or 30 years ago, when it was ridiculously cheap to buy gas and there were a lot of old-fashioned carburettor-fed cars that were incredibly badly polluting.

They are not the legal ones: somehow people smuggle out the rockets and the flying airburst ones, and set them off in our parking lot, or very nearby.I am fairly sure that I heard authentic gunfire on NYE.My hypothesis is that the cars are deliberately making "rat-a-tat-tat" noises that sound sorta like gunfire, in order to cover or mask real gunfire, should it ever occur. That the motorists with those cars are probably gangstas who are assigned to just lay down aural cover for whatever hijinks may or may not transpire that night.

Otherwise you may be smelling cars who have had the cats stolen. Even if it means they're burning a 1/3 of their fuel, that's still less in the short term than the $1500 it may cost to fix it.It's insanely rare I get the sense that the person is running really dirty on purpose.I don't know what a realistic fairway to fix it is. Seems like the kind of thing where a little government group to find the worst 0.1% of cars on the road and just get them back to reasonable levels would be a huge help.But that's not how we do things.

Additionally, a lot of conservatives love to "Roll coal", and literally will shit up the environment on purpose just because they feel schadenfreude from pissing of an environmentalist. Some people remove catalytic converters when they install a performance exhaust. Nobody is doing it for louder noises because the muffler portion is what dampens the sound.Also I wouldn't say it's “a lot of Americans”. We have emissions inspections in most major cities and your car won't pass if you remove the catalytic converter. Also I wouldn't say it's “a lot of Americans”.

I haven't noticed people removing the catalytic converters just for noise. The rare time I see a car that wants to be loud it usually just seems to be the exhaust end they changed, or maybe removed the muffler.The kind of stuff I'm complaining about mostly seems to be older cars, or those in poor mechanical shape.

Running EVs in densely populated regions is probably a lot better for the population on the whole even if the net pollution would stay the same, IMO.Still no EV is even better, but we've created a world where transport is often required so, one step at a time I guess. Still no EV is even better, but we've created a world where transport is often required so, one step at a time I guess. Further, particle emission from brake dust is mitigated in EV's that use regen braking. One of my ev's can go days without phycical brake usage, and another uses the brake pads so infrequently it has an automatic mode to touch the discs occasionally just to keep them from building up rust.tire particles --- different compounds can effect that, but will always be a side effect of tires on vehicles. Though I suppose that EVs and hybrids are heavier than similar gas powered counterparts, so tire wear is worse. But we won't, because then capitalists will make less money. So 1 out of 20 cars in California is an EV. Less commut and more collective transportation is going to be far more significant in term of global impact, whatever the engine type. "When California neighborhoods increased their number of zero-emissions vehicles"Obviously neighborhoods/cities/states didn't increase anything. It was just rich people living there buying fancy cars. Of course, this needs to be described as a great accomplishment of local government.And nowhere in the article is the obvious solution even suggested: advancing electric car technology so they're cheaper than ICE cars. And I don't mean charging extra tax while cutting public transport to make sure poor people don't go anywhere anymore, I mean fixing the technology so everyone has transport, for less money.

Some people credit Tesla with kick starting the EV revolution. Californian governance kick started Tesla.Their EV efforts go back to the ZEV mandate in 1990. Their EV efforts go back to the ZEV mandate in 1990. Shouldn't the obvious solution be based on observable reality? I mean, this isn't even a very hard thing to model. Smart connectivity essentially comes "for free" if the manufacturer wants to hit 5 safety stars, so its not going away, and will come to ICE cars as they modernize the vehicle architectures. Yes, there are some security threats, but solving them is more valuable than trying to design a car around true firewalls. I hear people on this site complain about these things all the time. It's important to realize the reason for that.Crashes by human drivers are hugely disproportionately by people who are driving drunk or with insufficient sleep or significant distractions etc. Waymo can beat a drunk driver, and therefore can beat the human driver arithmetic mean which has the drunk drivers averaged in.That doesn't mean it's any safer than driving an ordinary car when you're not drunk.

The computerization of formerly mechanical features making it harder to DIY repair is a separate but also valid concern, though I'm not sure how it applies to EVs.Added: see https://x.com/IntCyberDigest/status/2011758140510142890 for exactly the kind of thing that nobody wants.

I was under the impression most EVs cut off the connection to the high voltage battery almost all the time they're not in use.They rely on a 12 V battery or a 48 V battery like a normal car.The only thing I'm aware of that special is that if that low voltage battery gets low enough the car will detect it and recharge it from the high voltage battery, temporarily connecting it for that purpose.

Which leads to "fun" situations when that battery runs out, like not being able to get into your car or start it. However not much power is needed, so a tiny portable jump pack is enough to get things going.Both me and my sister has experienced this, me a Nissan Leaf and her a VW ID.4, good times. It could also result in a noticeable "vampire" drain on the high voltage battery which looks bad and could put you at a disadvantage vs. competitors. All it's connected features appear to come from Android Auto or Apple Car Play. AKA from a connection to your phone.I like the looks of it because it appears to be a serious EV unlike too many which are just some company getting their toes wet.

Even a carbureted motorcycle I owned from the early 2000s had "analog" gauges with values given to it from a computer!

You know that a backup camera can be added to practically any car right? My ~2002 Toyota has a Pioneer deck from around 2007 (I guess?) My wifes 2012 Toyota hybrid has a reversing camera using some POS cheap Chinese deck that's so shit it doesn't even support Bluetooth audio.No part of reversing cameras are dependent on any of the "modern" trends in cars that are being discussed here.

(Battery heating is inexplicably an extra $300 option, and not available on the base trim AFAICS?) How on earth did we survive as a species before our cars could make automated phone calls? That's extreme of course but there are probably a lot of accidents that happen in low-density rural country areas or late at night when there aren't many people around. Would you also question why we have mandatory airbags and traction control? Would you also question why we have mandatory airbags and traction control? I reluctantly bought an LG with webOS (least bad option available) a couple of years ago. For some reason they weren't content to let the TV menu/remote work with up/down/left/right buttons.That's too fucking predictable, and anyone who's used a tv in the last 2 decades could use it....Let's give it a fucking nipple, just like those horrific fucking IBM/Lenovo laptops.Then of course it also tries to "help" by detecting HDR content and change view mode... while something is playing.... which makes the screen go black for several seconds.

What business case is there for a "dumb" EV?By using touchscreens and software for most functionality, you dramatically reduce your supply chain overhead and better enhance margins (instead of managing the supply chain for dozens of extruded buttons, now you manage the supply chain of a single LCD touchscreen).This was a major optimization that Chinese automotive manufacturers (ICE and EV) found and took advantage of all the way back in 2019 [0] - treat cars as consumer electronics instead of as "cars".Edit: Any answer that does not take COGS or Magins into account is moot.

I suppose they could still remote kill the car though, and have no idea what would happen if I hit the emergency button. A high quality switch/button assembly is still cheaper for a give lifetime (100k, 200k, whatever), which is why it's what the 3rd world compact cars all use. The switches start losing when you start having a ton of different sets of features the car needs to support. Sell and product with enough margin to make money. Don't sell it at or below cost, then spy on your users and sell them to the real customers, the advertisers.“Dumb” stuff has a very simple and honest business model.

You only want „dumb” bc the other car companies fk'd it all up. when was the last time you saw a Tesla and went “oh cool car!”? We could have been running cars on that for decades, but getting people to make their dirty polluting inefficient old petrol cars run on fuel that emits carbon dioxide and water with no HC, CO, SOx, NOx, or particulates was nowhere near as profitable as selling them lots of debt to buy cleaner greener diesels.And we're burning the fuel they'd run on anyway. And we're burning the fuel they'd run on anyway. If a petrol-fuelled car goes on fire, the fuel tank will explode. The tanks are usually thin plastic and will split open in an accident, spilling fuel everywhere.By contrast, the LPG tanks are pretty much indestructible and if you remove a tank from a car that's been on fire (a lot of taxis are LPG-powered and seem to go on fire late at night for some reason, especially if they're parked in the wrong part of town) you'll find the tank is still about as full as it was before the car got burnt.

FYI, if you want to search for this, it is called "The long tailpipe" theory (1) or "long tailpipe fallacy".1) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_long_tailpipeAnd it is a fallacy for obvious reasons, includinga) electricity generation is more flexible, and rapidly shifting to solar and other non-polluting sources.b) Moving pollution away from people is better.

I would argue that this provides us the possibility of energy flexibility, which is a good thing given the current global geopolitical situation You think we need 800-1200 mile batteries?As for charge speed, the twice a year someone needs more than 400 miles isn't as significant in real world EV usage...I plug in on a dopey 1.3kW (~115V, ~12A) outlet and my car is at 80% charge in the morning.

More like, more people should understand how EVs can easily work for them, and then try to shoehorn gas-powered vehicles into the few niche they need to be in.How often does someone need a 400 mile range again?

On top of this EVs tend to push ideas from Software/Tech companies, such as recurring revenues (because the underlying technology lends itself to it better).Personally I'm unsure that this will be accepted by all consumers as much as is needed. After all the automotive marketing has since Ford insisted that driving was about "freedom". So some pivot needs to happen in the messaging. Suppose decades is a lot of time to change it. Personally I think EVs are nonsense, and a better utopia would be making sure public transport is abundant, high-quality and free.

Define "improve" ?One way for "ICE cars completely become a thing of the past" is for there to be lots of cheap, reliable, second-hand EVs.

You know what would make my kids more free? If they could just play outside without the giant death machines flying by with their operators looking at their phones well over the speed limit.I'm trapped in a world where I need to spend a good chunk of my life in a cage just to work and eat, and you call that "freedom". Can't change direction (one lane no junctions), can't change speed (vehicles in front and behind), can't stop (flow of traffic), can't break concentration (driving), can't change body position (car cabin is tiny, seats and hand/feet controls are fixed, no space to stand), can't look away for more than a moment (responsibility of driving).And the only places to go are on the predetermined road, from a car park, to a car park, following a lot of strict prescribed rules about how.This meme of “freedom” is brainwashing and marketing (which has been picked up as an identity thing by the right wing recently).There's nothing free about having to use a $20,000 vehicle to buy bread because no other options are available.

For example EVs depend on charging, so we're seeing more public charge points, as well as more home chargers, work chargers and so on.ICE depends on gas stations (which is the tip of the gasoline distribution industry.) As demand for those services drop off, so they'll become harder to find.

That doesn't say anything about how long it takes for them to die or how reliable the tech is. There aren't many 10+ year old EVs yet, and demand is limited. This is changing, and EVClinic will be the first of many aftermarket EV repair shops. They've been aiming for the same or worse in regular cars for over a decade now.That being said, there is an incentive for EVs: competition from China:https://www.electrive.com/2026/01/19/byd-extends-battery-war...Very much like when Japanese cars first got a foothold in the US.

As it stands the Nissan Leaf is an outlier only in Norway, where it was practically a free car due to subsidies, otherwise their growth is pretty much in line with other EVs. I'm a bit EV obsessed so spend a lot of time answering questions about them online, the longer warranty is 100% impacting buying choices. It needs to be fixed, because aside from someone being left with the economic bag of disposing of the vehicle, it is actually an environmental issue to build these batteries.Just not as bad of an issue as running ICE cars for the same period of time.People tend not to think more than a certain amount of time away for some reason.

And typically for little money.Now everything is glued and messy to swap so the manufacturer can sell you a battery swap for much much more money than it used to cost.I believe cars should have swappable somewhat standardized batteries. Or maybe Tesla has the best batteries right now, so you get that. And once you have to swap the battery, you again just pick the best manufacturer at the time - who might not even be a car manufacturer at all but rather someone specialized in batteries exclusively.And since hopefully 10 years have passed since you bought the last battery, chemistry has improved so you pick from options that are all (hopefully a lot) better than the battery you had initially.We could have some proper competition where manufacturers would have to compete on pricing and performance.But car manufacturers don't care. And opening their cars to third party batteries and not keeping up as many walls as they can is the opposite of that.So until forced by regulation every manufacturer will continue to put batteries in their cars that only they themselves will sell and put a slightly different one in every car.

Tesla lets you use it all, which gets bigger range numbers (for a time) but at the cost of degradation, if you use it. If you get maximum profit from the maximum social good, people will do that (or find a way to cheat); but as it stands, theres money to be made in not doing this and the consumer won't care too much if its 9 years or 10 years that their car lasts, so its not hurting sales to not fix this (even if fixed perfectly, it would take 10 years to prove after all! Who will convince manufacturers to integrate standardised batter packs instead of the more profitable “built-in phone style” that is used today, and the automotive marketing machine is really strong and will (correctly) lean on the idea that by having the battery replaceable would require less rigid car bodies, so their current incentive would be to fight this initiative and they would probably lead with the safety angle.The anti-EV propaganda already works pretty well with the very little it has to work with (farming batteries is harmful), so, imagine what they could do with something of actual substance. I think I'm dreaming, the investment would have to be enormous, who wants to hold stock of so many batteries?

Is that why EV sales have absolutely sky rocketed? Overall, EVs are likely a net win on the combination of these two things, and a big win on exhaust emissions, but it would be nice if we could shift to lighter and smaller vehicles and increase the mix of non-cars such as e-bikes and mass transit.Source: https://www.eiturbanmobility.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/4... We know it is disingenuous because no one cares about this when discussing overweight trucks and SUVs. Good news about a reduction in pollution from EVs? It's like the "At what price" meme around headlines about China.Going forward, I will downvote any comment about "brake pollution" and "tire pollution" that does not begin with - specifically - "This is a bigger issue for large, gas-powered trucks and SUVs", and invite you all to do so to.

Yes, EVs have a weight penalty of ~250-500kg of battery currently.Battery technology is rapidly advancing, when Na-ion batteries are introduced more widely, the whole range anxiety issue will become moot, because a recharge will take as long as refueling an ICE vehicle.The weight difference will also start to reduce, both due to newer batteries, but also moving to lighter weight construction and increased use of alternatives to steel.Arguing for ICE technology in 2025 is like Blackberry/Nokia users complaining about the loss of keyboards & T9 texting.

This is not news to anyone who drives an EV and keeps an eye on the readout showing current power usage/regen. In practice, when letting off the accelerator, existing EVs will instead regen brake. It's true though that using this mode will extend the life of your tires. Next time you do this keep an eye on the actual power readout. The point I'm making is that EVs apply more braking than ICE vehicles do, due to the specifics of the implementation of regen braking that all manufacturers have chosen.> You can coast in EV as wellNot without literally putting it in neutral. If you just take your foot off the accelerator, any modern EV will apply some amount of regenerative braking. It's not really possible to hold the accelerator pedal at the exact position where you are not applying motor power but also have 0kW of regen braking, certainly for any extended period of time.If your point is that someone could make an EV to which regen braking contributes no more to tire wear than an ICE vehicle, you're correct. Even the ones that allow you to "turn off" regen braking will generally apply 1-2kW of regen if your foot is off the accelerator.

Even the ones that allow you to "turn off" regen braking will generally apply 1-2kW of regen if your foot is off the accelerator. The regenerative braking and smooth acceleration are much more pleasant. Hyundai and Kia EVs have a 5 level setting for what happens when you lift up on the accelerator, either partially or fully.At level 0 the regeneration is so low that I don't notice a difference between that and being in neutral. It slows down way less than an ICE does when not in neutral.> If you just take your foot off the accelerator, any modern EV will apply some amount of regenerative braking. It's not really possible to hold the accelerator pedal at the exact position where you are not applying motor power but also have 0kW of regen braking, certainly for any extended period of time.Tire wear is not a linear function of acceleration. Is there any reason to believe that variations from not being able to hold your foot perfectly steady, assuming you aren't have spasms, will be big enough and/or last long enough to make a non-trivial difference?

You can reduce the total braking force needed by extending the time, in which case aerodynamic forces and rolling resistance will contribute some more to the reduction in speed.In an EV with one-pedal driving you can still stop quickly or slowly. In an ICE car you can stop slowly with more coasting or quickly with more braking force.I don't see how the drivetrain is going to make a difference to the amount of braking needed to stop and thus force exerted on the tire.

Generally they do not allow you to turn it off. My main point is that most people don't turn it off. Regen is lossy, so there's no incentive in slowing down to capture 1W just to speed up and spend 1.1WPorsche has modes for coast and regen. Applying brakes in coast mode will use regen up to a threshold and then use conventional pad/rotor.So I am sorry to inform you that you're just wrong.There are EVs that can coast.EVs are not braking more.Whether you use conventional brakes, engine braking, or regen braking, it's all the same to the tires.

If instead those 80 passengers each drove alone in a Kia Niro EV it would be about 4 000 pounds each, so an axle weight of 2000, so the damage would be proportional to 160 x 2000^4 = 2.56 x 10^15.That's 125 times less road damage than the bus!Another interesting 4th power calculation is EV vs ICE. Tanker trucks, especially when they are traveling between wherever they load and wherever they unload, are very heavy.I calculated what would happen in a hypothetical city where everyone drove the ICE version and then all switched to the EV version, and how many tanker truck gas deliveries that would eliminate.

I wasn't talking about passenger buses, because thats unlikely going to happen in US. Everytime a discussion comes on ICE vs EV, the fossil fuel proponents immediately jump to but EVs weigh more (debatable) and cause more damage. The damage they cause is insignificant compared to 18-wheelers. I'm not entirely sure if EVs weigh more either, maybe the earlier models did, but energy density keeps increasing. Also, there is no compelling reason to have 300+ mile range batteries when most of the trips are under 3 - 5 miles. Instead I've heard many arguments that bike lanes and pedestrianization are forms of gentrification, but resulting "ghettoes?"

(And a quick search shows that people do study this.) The auto industry seems to have ran out of early adopters already. Now they need a kick in the privates to make cheap EVs. Also, someone who doesn't think in SV lattes may not afford to buy a car with unknown reliability. Compare the same category of car in gasoline and EV versions. Not much by silicon valley latte standards of course. Compare the same category of car in gasoline and EV versions. Have you looked at the bulk of cars people are buying new? Plus how much is the EV version of a 60k usd truck? EVs tend to do better, because they can do most of their breaking through the motor and recuperate a part of the energy2) Tire abrasion. EVs tend to do worse here, because they tend to be heavier.So yes, EVs aren't a panacea, but overall on the topic of air pollution, they score much better than ICEs.

Plenty of people like cigarettes and opium too, that doesn't mean you want your kid exposed to the smoke. BUT I don't think switching to EVs will help reduce CO2 in any way - not even if all the EVs are charged using 100% solar/wind. The narrative usually is "I get an EV instead of an ICE, charge it with regenerative energy and have 0 emissions, thus not burning oil and saving on CO2".But that is not how a globalized world with free markets works. In order to save on CO2, we would need to keep that oil not burned by the EV underground, but that does not take place. The market reality is that oil price will just drop with less demand from ICE vehicles. But with falling prices, other business models that require refined oil will become viable and the oil is still burned - just somewhere else. No one so far has made a good argument why the Saudis or Russians would leave their ressources underground, just because demand from ICE vehicles drop.

OK.And did you go to Economics 201?Because there, you might have learned that the basic economic principles you describe as "economics 101" are the equivalent of the "spherical cow in a frictionless vacuum"-type examples you get in introductory physics classes.In the real world, demand is affected by all kinds of things, and sometimes, a product or service is just no longer desired by the population. Of course not, because people don't need them. You'd barely sell any, and those purely as a novelty.While there's still a lot of work to do to make it fully possible, and certain political groups are actively working against it, the world at large recognizes that getting off of fossil fuels is an important goal.

Even if the pollution is identical, moving it from where everyone lives and works over to more isolated areas where power plants are would still be a big benefit.We know EVs are cleaner than that. And when the pollution is centralized in one power plant it's also more economically feasible to apply filtration or particle capture isn't it? And when the pollution is centralized in one power plant it's also more economically feasible to apply filtration or particle capture isn't it? Nitrogen pollution is usually reasonably local to the plant but also can be srubbed. Its not practical to scrub moving objects, but it is for stationary generators.Same with particulates, you can capture quite a lot with electrostatic scrubbers. The only downside is that traffic creates a lot of pollution, and the engine noise (not honking, there's very little of that) is so bad that you need to yell to a person standing next to you to have a conversation.As a visitor, I can't claim to know how to fix the problems facing locals, however I can't help but feel that urban centers would be 1000x better with mass adoption of EVs (bikes, cars).

Shanghai's French concession is so quiet and peaceful now that most cars are EVs. I think tier 1 Chinese cities are in a league of their own though. Thailand strikes a good balance of accessibility and development - that said I certainly agree that there are noticeable signs of it being a developing country. There will be no new fast subway in San Francisco and there will be no maglev in NYC. There will be no autonomous buses in Sydney and London will be entirely devoid of skyways.This is the nature of growth. I agree it seems hard in NYC, SF, etc but other cities have added transit Really step back and imagine a world where the modern EV [1] was first to market and a gasoline combustion engine was second.Who would actually decide to switch from a modern EV to gasoline on purpose of their own choice?The downsides of gasoline cars are actually pretty crazy: complicated engines and transmissions with heavy maintenance schedules, emissions, more NVH, worse interior space and packaging, need to wait for HVAC rather than it being ready ahead of time, need to go to a special gas station to add fuel, worse/slower performance.You would have this laundry list of downsides and your only potential plus sides are faster fueling on road trips over 4 hours long, lower curb weight, and lower cost.And those three minor down sides are very likely to be resolved sometime within the next 10-20 years.

I periodically have to stop and think about how annoying it might be in city driving with the constant stop and go.But someday I might buy myself a little shitbox with a manual that I can park on the street, maybe a Fiat 500 or something. Then they got crushed by Henry Ford's and GM's production lines. And then the depression.The Model T was a farm car. 50% of the population lived in rural areas, and they didn't have electricity. There was a market for an urban electric short-range car, it just didn't hit the economy of scale at the right time. 50% of the population lived in rural areas, and they didn't have electricity.

Yes the population of people out there is much smaller, but if you've ever spent serious times in these parts of the country you'd realize petroleum runs everything.Even in a world where electric vehicles came first this would still be the case. Even in a world where electric vehicles came first this would still be the case. But today we've got basically the opposite.I would disagree with the idea that petroleum would run everything out there if EVs came first but I won't argue that point super hard with you. I can see and understand how petroleum is a lifeline for things like oil heat, generators, etc.Still, batteries are very well-suited to off-grid usage, and EV batteries can even power your house for a week or more in the event of a power outage. Let's not forget that solar panels exist.There are entire islands that have switched from imported diesel fuel power generation to grid scale solar+battery and they have had a great deal of cost savings and reliability benefits.

Plus now you have problems moving tonnes of food, water, ammunition on BEV vehicles that no longer have reliable charging access. Being unable to supply your military is more or less a death knell for any fighting force.Even setting aviation aside, a lot of the reason why gas engines were adopted was because agriculture was among the first to do so, they were less finicky then ox and horses. Rural areas didn't have access to electricity like cities did at the time though; It was a lot easier to have a tin of whatever liquid fuel (gasoline was a byproduct of kerosone production at the time).

Many Chinese car buyers' first vehicles are electric, and many of those people buying cars are quite used to electric scooters as their transportation method.Speaking of wars, how many wars for oil would be avoided if there wasn't a widespread dependency on cheap oil? If the gas price ever goes above $5-7/gallon in America it basically triggers a recession.

Anyone who likes the sensations of driving and not just going fast in a straight line. When you show me the equivalent of an EV Lotus Elise, I'll be properly swayed. Where are the Mitsubishi Eclipse, Toyota Celica, Toyota MR2, Chevrolet Camaro, Z4/Supra getting discontinued, Focus RS, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, the list goes on? The Nissan Z was just updated but sales have been abysmal. There are a number of electric supercars and hypercars on the market: https://www.roadandtrack.com/rankings/g45639363/best-electri... Chinese cars are a "better deal" because they give more bang for the buck. Japanese cars, on the other hand, are very "stingy" due to decades of near monopoly. Although to be fair new ICE cars are also a luxury item. Most people can only buy used ICE cars these days A few cars from Stellantis that are available in ICE and EV variants are now actually cheaper in the EV variant. This reflects the reality that batteries are now cheap and EVs don't have a lot of moving parts. So, they should be easier and cheaper to assemble. Driven by component and cheap battery availability.Used EVs are widely available now as well. You can get some amazing deals on cars that mostly still have their drive trains + batteries under warranty. These are mostly still the relatively expensive models from a few years ago.The cheap EVs that are now on the market will inevitably start penetrating the second hand market in larger and larger numbers. Cheap ICE cars are disappearing rapidly from the market as models are being discontinued by manufacturers and as the market shares for ICE vehicles keep on shrinking. You'll still be able to get your Ford Fiesta. Or the new electric model that they are rumored to launch soonish.

So those better off are slowly being pushed towards EVs (or at least hybrids), and the vast majority of others still relies on importing like 15 years old second-hand cars (EURO 5 standard) to replace their 25yo cars (EURO 3 standard). In the capital, cars below EURO 4 are even banned when air pollution gets really bad, but the vast majority doesn't even realise this rule exists because their cars are now EURO 4 or above. I live in one of those poorer ones where most people can't afford new cars, but even if you can, the percentage of brand-new ICE cars that are even available for purchasing is going down pretty fast in recent years.

You also don't have a gas station inside your apartment. From an air pollution perspective you are much better off a half mile from 10 jets taking off, than you are surrounded by a hundred idling gasoline cars. And the semi is such vaporware that I forgot it was even a thing. Standing near the average car isn't that bad at all. EVs are way better, but it's not that bad.But stand near a car that has some sort of exhaust problem or isn't burning fuel correctly and it's bad. Just horrible to breathe.I've found cabin air filters either activated carbon help immensely. I started buying them on someone's recommendation but I had no idea how much they affected things.I've driven on brand new asphalt and not noticed the smell.

It would help to have 400+ kWh batteries and megawatt chargers. At current prices, the standard range battery in a Lightning (which is nominally about 107kWh or so) should cost under $10K. They will not be able to shrink the battery enough to offset the cost of putting in an engine and generator. For one, they have to stay competitive with the Dodge EREV pickup, which will have a ~90kWh battery.My guess is they leave out one or two modules from the standard range pack and price the truck starting at $70K. They won't make a ton of money, but they might be able to get a nice boost in volume to make up for it.

One problem they are experiencing is rust and glazing on the pads from disuse.They are heavier than the equivalent sized ICE so have more tire wear, but dont have to be that large in an absolute sense. They are heavier than the equivalent sized ICE so have more tire wear, but dont have to be that large in an absolute sense. One pedal drive can still use the brake pads, regen braking is what saves brake usage regardless of one pedal drive being on or not. It's not a hard sell: no more oil changes, no more annual emissions-testing bill, no transmission to ever worry about, and a massive chunk of storage under the hood where the gas engine would be – plus a bunch of outlets all over for powering or charging tools. When I then tell them that I spend about $30/month on charging the thing (at home) compared to my former gas budget of ~$150-200/month, it becomes even more of a no-brainer.And none of this has anything to do with climate change. It's just plain and simple practicality.They tend to ask about range. I get around 300 miles on a full charge when road-tripping, and Buc-ees has some pretty cheap chargers (still cheaper than gas would be) that get me back on the road in about the time it takes me to use the bathroom, grab and eat some brisket, and change the baby's diaper.

Most cars are far too heavy and should be made lighter. Only Mazda seems to understand this and that's why the Mazda SUVs/sedans are by far the best driving vehicles in their class.

Oil not used in ICE cars is just used someplace else.Electric cars are great for the city/suburbs but don't really make a dent in the larger resource usage issues facing us. Electric cars are great for the city/suburbs but don't really make a dent in the larger resource usage issues facing us. You're missing that the supply drops as well since it is not economical to produce the same amount of oil as before at a lower price.As long as the supply curve does not change (and nothing about EV usage changes the supply side here), a reduction in demand leads to lower consumption.Edit: And in addition, your chart doesn't show anything like you purport it to show. By your claim, oil consumption by non-Western countries should have been drastically higher in 2000-2007 when oil prices were lower than they are today. Switching to EVs would act as a reduction in demand and therefore reduce overall oil usage, at least as compared to a world where vehicle transport required ICE vehicles.

I'd like to see the same attention being given to plastics (so much single-use crap and how much of it can be recycled? ), synthetic clothing, and all kinds of other chemicals including the ones we put in ourselves (pharma, food) and the environment, like fertilizers or the byproducts of mining today's fashionable minerals like lithium.

You just have to love the irony when something like Science is deemed 'settled'-- in that regard, it's almost as if we went back a few centuries.There's certainly a lot to be said for humans needing to take better care of the planet.
