                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Building a healthy romantic relationship takes time and intention. To genuinely know someone, you must understand what matters to them — their likes and dislikes, passions, limits — and respecting those traits even when they differ from your own. In fact, many strong couples come to appreciate differences, recognizing that a person's history, quirks and tendencies are what make them unique. Here are eight phrases couples who are truly close use when talking about each other, and they should be relationship goals for all of us. If friends are shocked by a comment or action they make, you might just smile and shrug. Everyone has their own quirks, odd habits or routine preferences, from how they drink coffee to how they fold their towels. These are little things that no one else probably knows about them. Intimacy means understanding your partner's fundamental ideas, beliefs and principles. Knowing someone deeply means understanding their fears, vulnerabilities and emotional triggers. When those struggles surface, you respond with empathy rather than judgment or defensiveness. Knowing your partner means accepting that you can't — and shouldn't — try to change who they are, even if it's something you really dislike about them. True growth only happens if they choose it. Even in long-term relationships, there's always more to learn. When couples truly know each other, discovering something new feels like an opportunity to grow, not a threat.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Senate is set to vote this week on a massive House-passed $1.2 trillion package to fund the Department of Homeland Security, along with a wide swath of government, before the Jan. 30 deadline. But the shooting of 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis is now threatening to derail the funding package as a growing chorus of Democrats warns they will oppose it unless funding for the Department of Homeland Security is stripped out. "I can't vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances," said Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats and helped end last year's 43-day shutdown, on CBS's "Face the Nation" on Sunday. "Take up DHS by itself, let's have an honest negotiation, put some guardrails on what's going on, some accountability, and that would solve this problem. He voted repeatedly to open the government during the last shutdown as his Democratic colleagues pushed for an extension of Obamacare subsidies. It's unclear whether Republicans who control the House can or will do so. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats have broadly threatened to tank the funding measure if it includes DHS funding. "Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included," said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in a statement on Saturday night. Republicans hold a 53-47 vote majority in the Senate, meaning Democratic support will be needed to pass the measure. Of the 47, two are independents who caucus with Democrats. Some Democrats were already opposed to the funding measure, which, in addition to DHS, includes the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Education, State, and Treasury. But Pretti's death is rapidly galvanizing Democratic opposition to the measure. "No, I am not voting for this funding," said Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar on NBC's "Meet the Press" on Sunday. "Our Republican colleagues have to stand up and stop this." The top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, has also said she will oppose the package if it includes DHS funding. Murray warned earlier in the week that the "suggestion that a shutdown in this moment might curb the lawlessness of this administration is not rooted in reality." "Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences," Murray said on X Saturday. "I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands. It's still possible that enough Democrats join with Republicans to pass the funding bill and avoid a shutdown. DHS may also be less hindered during a shutdown if it taps the hundreds of billions of dollars that congressional Republicans injected into the agency as part of their "One Big Beautiful Bill" law passed last summer. But that's far from a guaranteed outcome. Several Democrats who joined with Republicans last year to end a record 43-day government shutdown have warned they will oppose the bill if it includes funding for DHS. "I will not support the current Homeland Security funding bill," said Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., who is one of the Democrats who joined Republicans to end the last shutdown. "Let's pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans' constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement's essential role to keep us safe." Complicating matters further is a massive snowstorm over Washington, D.C., and wide stretches of the U.S. The Senate canceled votes on Monday due to the storm, shortening an already tight timeline to avoid a shutdown.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Soon, parents and guardians can open a Trump account for their children — and a number of large employers are piling on the incentives to get set up. But, in some cases, that is just the half of it. To help fund these savings accounts from the outset, a growing list of companies, including SoFi, Charter Communications, BNY, BlackRock, Investment Company Institute, Robinhood and Charles Schwab, announced they will match the federal $1,000 contribution for employees' children. "Those are higher income earners, so it's not clear to me how likely that is to help wealth building writ large," said Madeline Brown, senior policy associate at the Urban Institute, a Washington-based think tank. Other funds may also be available, depending on certain criteria. Children 10 or under and born before Jan. 1, 2025, — who wouldn't qualify for the $1,000 initial deposit from the Treasury — could get a $250 contribution thanks to a $6.25 billion pledge made by tech CEO Michael Dell and his wife, Susan. Children in Connecticut may qualify for an additional donation from billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio and his wife, Barbara. Philanthropists in other states could follow suit as part of a "50-state challenge," Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at a White House press conference last month. As it stands, those additional donations are geared toward families who live in a ZIP code where the median income is less than $150,000. Trump accounts, also known as Section 530A accounts, were created to encourage early wealth building as part of President Donald Trump's "big beautiful bill," which Congress passed in July. To open the account, an election must be made on IRS Form 4547, named for Trump's presidential terms. Form 4547 can be filed separately or with your 2025 tax return as soon as Jan. 26, which marks the official start of the 2026 tax filing season. Later in the year, this election can also be made via Trumpaccounts.gov. Once an account is established, parents, guardians, grandparents and others can contribute up to $5,000 a year in after-tax dollars up until the year before the beneficiary turns 18. The annual contribution limit adjusts for inflation after 2027. As part of the $5,000 limit, employers can contribute up to $2,500 per worker per year, which won't count as taxable income, according to the IRS. Qualifying charitable organizations and state and local governments can also make contributions that do not count toward the $5,000 limit. Experts say the additional Trump account contributions could make a difference over time. That account could be worth about $6,800 after 18 years, assuming 7% annual returns, according to certified financial planner Ivory Johnson, founder of Delancey Wealth Management in Washington. He is also a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council. Many experts encourage families to accept "free money" from the Treasury, an employer or other sources. But beyond that, families can also weigh other investing options, such as 529 college savings plans and taxable brokerage accounts, among others, depending on their goals and timeline.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than 850,000 customers in the U.S. as far west as New Mexico were without electricity ‍and over 10,000 flights were canceled on ‍Sunday during a monster winter storm ‍that paralyzed eastern and southern states with heavy snow and ice. As snow, freezing rain and dangerously frigid temperatures swept into the eastern two-thirds of the nation on Sunday, the number of power outages continued to rise. As of 10:47 a.m. EST (1547 GMT) on Sunday, more than 850,000 U.S. ‌customers ‌were without electricity, according to PowerOutage.us, with at least 290,000 in Tennessee and ​over 100,000 each in Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana. Other states affected included Kentucky, Georgia, Virginia and Alabama. More than 10,200 U.S. flights scheduled for Sunday were canceled, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Washington, D.C.'s Ronald Reagan National Airport said airlines had canceled all flights at the airport on Sunday. Delta Air ⁠Lines on Sunday said that it intended to operate on a reduced schedule "subject to real-time frozen precipitation and afternoon storm conditions." The airline had adjusted its schedule on Saturday, with additional cancellations in the morning for Atlanta and along the East Coast, including in Boston and New York City, and said it would move experts from cold-weather hubs to support de-icing and baggage teams at several southern airports. The National Weather Service's latest forecast for Sunday through Monday morning calls for heavy snow from the Ohio Valley to the Northeast, including up to 18 inches in New England. Much of the Southeast and parts of the Mid-Atlantic are expected to get rain and freezing rain. Calling the storms "historic," President Donald Trump on Saturday approved federal emergency disaster declarations in South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Indiana, and West Virginia. "We will continue to monitor, and stay in touch with all States in the path of this storm. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have declared weather emergencies, the Department ‌of Homeland Security said. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, at a news conference on Saturday, warned Americans to take precautions. "So we'd encourage everybody to stock up on fuel, stock up on food, and we will get through this together." The Department of Energy on Saturday issued an ‍emergency order authorizing the Electric Reliability Council of Texas to deploy backup generation resources at data centers and other major facilities, aiming to limit blackouts in the state. On Sunday, the DOE issued an emergency order to authorize grid operator PJM Interconnection to run "specified resources" in the mid-Atlantic region, regardless of limits due to state laws or environmental permits. U.S. electric grid operators on Saturday stepped up precautions to avoid rotating blackouts. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The World Economic Forum's flagship conference took place between 19-23 January, and leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump, billionaire Bill Gates and Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang delivered speeches and spoke on panels. This year's theme was "A Spirit of Dialogue," as geopolitical uncertainty and international trade tensions dominated conversations. René Carayol, a leadership coach to Fortune 500 and FTSE 100 executives and world leaders, broke down what the most effective communicators did at this year's World Economic Forum, in a conversation with CNBC. Carayol, who has worked with Nelson Mandela, former Russian president Mikhail Gorbachev, former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and many more, was frank about the key ingredients to powerful public speaking and communication. French President Emmanuel Macron and Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney were "two masterclasses" in public speaking, leadership, and influence, according to Carayol. Macron gave a special address in Davos on Tuesday, and in a hard-hitting speech, he hit back at "bullies" after Trump renewed threats of tariffs against Europe, as well as 200% levies on French wine, which have since been dropped. The French leader warned of a world "without rules" as international law is being disregarded and called for global cooperation to address instability. This was all delivered with blue aviator-style sunglasses due to an eye infection, which Carayol said, lent a "Tom Cruise" feel to Macron's presentation. His stance was "upright, looking up, looking powerful," which exuded an aura of being "unafraid, unapologetic, and gave all of Europe backbone." Carney delivered a similar message to Macron's in his own speech at the WEF on Tuesday, where he said the world's "middle powers" must unite against coercion from the world's largest. "Great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons. Carney's facial expression did much of the talking as he remained "extremely serious and grave" throughout his speech and didn't break a smile once. He also used intonation to create gravitas. "He was serious ... he wanted the world to know that they are not backing down against Trump without ever mentioning him," Carayol said. "Macron was the one you'd go away with and remember, Carney was the one you'd respect." "Trump was all over the show, off script, rambling, no real point, because he was doing his 'TACO.' Trump always chickens out when someone stands up to him," he said. However, Carayol noted that Trump is usually  "brilliant" and "when he's on top form ... you won't agree with what he says, but the way he says it." Carayol recalled the lead up to the U.S. Presidential elections in 2024: "He's at his best when he's in a competitive environment. Business leaders may communicate differently from heads of state because CEOs must be more conscious of how their words affect their companies' stock prices, while world leaders can utilize stronger rhetoric, according to Andrew Brodsky, a management professor at the University of Texas and the author of "PING: The Secrets of Successful Communication." "World leaders often have other communication tools at their disposal because they don't have to worry about a stock price," Brodsky told CNBC. "Notably, world leaders use strategies like leveraging negative emotions, such as anger, and highlighting potential existential threats to their country's future to motivate their population." On the opposite end, if tech CEOs show a lot of "negative emotion or dwell on the risks" of technology like AI, then their company's stock price would likely be affected, or staff would lose trust in the company and leave. Instead, Brodsky highlighted that one of the best communication styles in leadership is using "imagery, metaphors, and stories" to share a vision with audiences. For example, when Satya Nadella discussed AI advancements at the WEF this week, he compared it to how transformational PCs were when they were first introduced and even noted that the impacts of AI are "10x, 100x" times that. "Rather than emphasize the technical elements, Nadella communicated his vision for the future of AI through using simple metaphors in a way anyone could understand," Brodsky said. Additionally, Jensen Huang was asked about whether AI would increase or decrease the number of jobs, and instead of using statistics, he told a story about how AI actually increased the number of jobs in the radiology industry. "Rather than relying on high-level cross-industry statistics, Huang was able to use a story about radiologists to show the positive impact of AI. By using a story, he was able to make what he was saying feel much more tangible and meaningful to the audience in a way that statistics by themselves simply can't," Brodsky said. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates also stood out during a panel, as he mostly maintained eye contact with the audience while being asked questions by interviewers and other panelists. "This seemingly small choice made it feel like Gates was speaking directly to the audience and bringing them into the conversation," Brodsky added. -- Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said on Sunday her government will take necessary steps against speculative market moves, in the wake of a yen spike that heightened traders' alert over the chance of currency intervention. Japanese government bonds and the yen have sold off in recent weeks on concern Takaichi's expansionary fiscal policy and the slow pace of interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan could lead to additional debt issuance and too-high inflation. "I won't comment on specific market moves," Takaichi told a Fuji Television talk show, when asked about the bond selloff and the yen's declines. "The government will take necessary steps against speculative or very abnormal market moves," she said without elaborating. A weak yen has become a source of headaches for Japanese policymakers as it pushes up import costs and broader inflation, hurting households' purchasing power. Takaichi has compiled a big spending package to cushion the blow from rising living costs and vowed to suspend for two years the 8% sales tax on food, triggering a spike in bond yields that increases the cost of funding Japan's huge public debt. Takaichi has been under pressure to deal with the bond market rout, which has accelerated with her decision to call a snap election on February 8 to seek a mandate to gear up her expansionary fiscal policies. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signalled Washington's displeasure over the repercussions from the rising Japanese yields, saying last week that it was "very hard to disaggregate the market reaction from what's going on endogenously in Japan." "I've been in touch with my economic counterparts in Japan, and I am sure that they will begin saying the things that will calm the market down," Bessent said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Since then, Takaichi has stressed that Japan can secure enough funds for the tax suspension without issuing debt. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda on Friday signalled the central bank's readiness to work closely with the government to contain sharp rises in yields, including by conducting emergency bond-buying operations. While most parties are calling for a cut to the consumption tax, several opposition parties have proposed investing the BOJ's holdings of exchange-traded funds and government reserves set aside for currency intervention, and using the proceeds to fund a consumption tax cut. Takaichi's ruling coalition appears cautious of the idea. "Using reserves set aside for currency intervention would require selling U.S. Treasuries," Takayuki Kobayashi, a senior official of Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), told the NHK programme. "That could affect markets and cause a lot of problems." Alex Saito, a senior official in the LDP's coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party, known as Ishin, pointed to problems that could emerge by tapping the BOJ's ETF holdings to fund a tax cut. "Tapping BOJ assets risks undermining the central bank's independence, and would be a dangerous step that could further weaken the yen and push up long-term interest rates," Saito told NHK. In September, the BOJ decided on a plan to sell its huge ETF holdings, accumulated during its decade-long stimulus programme, at an annual pace of 330 billion yen ($2.1 billion).

Immigration agents, in full view of filming protesters, tackled 37-year-old Alex Pretti to the ground before one shot him multiple times. The shooting occurred as thousands of protesters converged in downtown Minneapolis to rally against the Department of Homeland Security's Operation Metro Surge, which has flooded Minnesota with ICE agents since December. Tensions have been high since officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good on January 7. This year, though, "that's not what we're being called to do," he said. Instead, he said the store has distributed about 4,000 3D printed whistles, which Minnesotans have been using as an alert and protest system against ICE. Marshall said that the store has also served as a space for the community to come in, relax, and process what they've been seeing. "It feels like a way of connecting with our community that we haven't really felt before. For small business owners in Minnesota, it's been an eventful — and not necessarily lucrative — January, as they instead turn their attention to supporting their communities. Many businesses also opted into an income hit on January 23, when unions and faith leaders called for a suspension of work, school, and shopping to protest ICE's actions. Local news site Bring Me The News compiled a growing list of over 200 local establishments' social media posts about their plans to participate in the economic blackout day. Some said they planned to donate that day's revenue; others shuttered completely or opened as a free community space. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a January 20 press release, "Since President Trump took office, DHS has arrested over 10,000 criminal illegal aliens in Minnesota, and we are NOT slowing down. Our law enforcement officers are saving countless American lives." ICE did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. In a statement, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that the Trump administration's immigration operations "have resulted in countless dangerous criminal illegals being removed from the streets." "Making American communities safer will create an environment in which all businesses can thrive in the long term and their customers can feel safe," Jackson said. Catzen Coffee, a specialty coffee shop with an attached cat lounge, will not be doing business on Friday, but plans to open for those who need a space to hang out — free coffee and cat cuddles included. "January always sucks," Matt Cole, the owner of Oh Yeah! National Retail Federation's spending data shows an average drop in retail sales of 17.3% from December to January over the last five years. An analysis from consumer research firm Consumer Edge of credit and debit card data found that spending in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area by households earning under $100,000 has tracked lower than the national average over the four weeks ending January 10. The full-time role he works in addition to his homemade baking business has been keeping him afloat. Cole isn't the only one pivoting from normal business. JP Pritchett, the owner of adult store Smitten Kitten in Minneapolis, said that they usually devote January to ramping up for Valentine's Day, which they described as the "Super Bowl" for adult stores. "But this year, I don't care about that. Instead, Pritchett said, "We stopped all regular business and created a free store inside Smitten Kitten where people could come get food or send a trusted friend or neighbor to come get food, toiletries, lots of diapers, formula, baby wipes — all the things that are really important to sustain life if you're in hiding." Marshall, the owner of Mischief Toys, said that after promoting the store's whistle distribution, he received a notice from ICE requesting verification of his workers' employment eligibility. He said that shuttering on the 23rd sends a message "that our community is much more important than our bottom line," which he believes is a positive. "We'd like to sell toys," Marshall said, adding that he'd prefer to spend January cleaning and painting "because it's so damn cold here," but with heightened tensions in the city, "we're going to step up as much as we can."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration is taking a 10% stake in USA Rare Earth as part of a $1.6 billion debt-and-equity investment package aimed at helping the company develop a domestic mine and magnet facility, two sources familiar with the deal told Reuters. The deal and a separate $1 billion private investment will be unveiled on Monday and Oklahoma-based USA Rare Earth will host a morning conference call with investors to discuss the terms, according to one of the sources who was briefed on the plans. The White House did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. USA Rare Earth declined to comment. China is the largest global processor of rare earths, a group of 17 minerals used to make a range of electronics and military equipment. The U.S. produces only small volumes of rare earths, which has sparked a push in recent years from Washington to increase output. USA Rare Earth has been developing a mine in Sierra Blanca, Texas, with Texas Mineral Resources — slated to open by 2028 and which has a magnet manufacturing facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma — that is expected to launch later this year. As part of the USA Rare Earth investment, Washington will receive 16.1 million shares in the company along with warrants for an additional 17.6 million shares, according to the sources. Both would be priced at $17.17 a share, near where the company's stock traded earlier this month. A senior Trump official said last month that the administration was planning more "historic deals" with the U.S. mining sector to increase production of lithium, rare earths and other critical minerals used in national defense, artificial intelligence and other related areas. USA Rare Earth has hired Cantor Fitzgerald, a financial services firm chaired by Brandon Lutnick, the son of U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, to help with fundraising efforts, one of the sources said.
