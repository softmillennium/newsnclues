The countries insist Iran resume talks with the US, yet they don't demand that the US refrain from bombing again.

France, Germany, and the UK (E3) have announced they will trigger snapback sanctions on Iran at the United Nations. This will launch a 30-day process that will likely culminate in the full reinstatement of all U.N. sanctions lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. The move will carry four major consequences.

First, the U.N. Security Council will formally adopt the demand — pushed by Israel — that Iran cease all uranium enrichment. Israel designed this demand to sabotage nuclear diplomacy and edge the conflict toward war.

Next, a U.N. arms embargo on Iran will return, potentially curbing Tehran's ability to rebuild deterrence against future Israeli or American strikes, provided Russia and China treat the snapback as legitimate and enforce it.

Third, Iran's already fragile economy will deteriorate further; its currency has already taken a hit.

And finally, far from advancing diplomacy, the measure risks accelerating escalation. While Israel hardly needs a pretext to launch another strike on Iran, as I have argued, snapback could provide useful political cover — a thin veneer of legitimacy — for renewed attacks.

The E3 argues that snapback is necessary to pressure Iran into resuming talks with the U.S. and granting the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) access to its nuclear facilities, including disclosure of the stockpile of 60% enriched uranium.

On the surface, these demands may seem reasonable. But Tehran has legitimate reservations. Iranian officials suspect the IAEA of leaking sensitive information that enabled Mossad's assassination campaign against their nuclear scientists, and they fear that revealing the stockpile's location could simply invite another round of U.S. airstrikes.

Moreover, Iran was at the negotiating table when Israel and the U.S. began bombing it. The E3 now insists Tehran return to talks, yet they make no parallel demand that Washington refrain from bombing again.

Perhaps most importantly, given the unbridgeable gap over enrichment, Trump's limited patience for diplomacy, and Israeli pressure to resume hostilities, restarting talks that are almost certain to collapse — unless both sides show greater flexibility on enrichment — only increases the likelihood that war will start sooner rather than later.

But that may well be the point. The E3 of today bears little resemblance to the one of two decades ago. When it was created in 2003, its purpose was to prevent the Bush administration — fresh off its disastrous and illegal invasion of Iraq — from launching another war, this time against Iran.

Today, the geopolitical context has shifted. Iran's alignment with Russia in Ukraine has recast it as a direct threat in Europe's eyes. The EU is also far more dependent on the transatlantic relationship than it was 20 years ago, while successive rounds of sanctions have rendered Iran a negligible economic partner for Europe.

Escalation with Iran through snapback now serves two EU objectives: punishing Tehran for supporting Russia in Ukraine, and aligning Europe with hawkish elements in the Trump administration — an alignment calculated to ease tensions in other areas of a transatlantic relationship under unprecedented duress.

In this sense, the E3 constellation that was designed in 2003 to prevent war may, in 2025, be pushing us closer to one.

But don't take it from me. After all, Germany's chancellor has openly admitted that Israel “did Europe's dirty work for it” by bombing Iran in June.

Some restaurants in the US capital have closed their doors as workers stay home rather than risk deportation

Hernán was at the Latin American restaurant that he owns with his brother in the Northwest quadrant of Washington DC last week when his staff started getting phone calls and messages about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) checkpoints in the neighborhood. The employees, scared that they might be targeted and racially profiled, asked if they could go home.

Within hours, Hernán had to close their doors, and the restaurant hasn't been open since.

“Literally after President Trump brought the national guard on DC, everything stopped,” said Hernán, who requested his last name not be used due to fears of Ice retaliation. “Everything disappeared because the bike delivery guys, they're scared. They're not on the streets right now. My people, most of my cooks are Spanish[-speaking] and they don't want to go to DC right now.”

Hernán, who also owns a restaurant in Maryland, said he was hoping to be able to reopen in a few weeks if and when the Trump administration's takeover of the DC police ends and immigration enforcement arrests become less frequent. But the future is unclear for him and many restaurant owners in the US capital.

Already suffering from fewer customers due to the administration's almost three-week-long crackdown, restaurants are also having to contend with staff shortages because many immigrants, both documented and undocumented, fear coming into DC and being on the streets, and some have been detained by Ice.

Trump has attempted to claim that the crackdown is benefiting restaurants. “Half the restaurants closed, because nobody could go, because they were afraid to go outside,” he told reporters on Monday about Washington before his intervention. “Now those restaurants are opening and new restaurants are opening up.”

Across the city, the opposite is true. Some restaurants, like Hernán's, have had to close their doors. But more have had to make do with fewer workers, fewer delivery drivers and fewer customers.

“Restaurants will close because you have troops with guns and federal agents harassing people … making people afraid to go out,” José Andrés, the well-known Washington restaurateur, wrote on social media.

Immigrants account for 253,000 workers, or 36% of the workforce, in DC's restaurants, hotels and related sectors, according to Migrant Insider, which cited data from FWD.us. Included in that total are 42,000 self-employed immigrant entrepreneurs running local food and service businesses.

Maketto, an Asian restaurant and marketplace in north-east DC, posted on social media on Monday that its immigrant workers had been affected.

“Last week, two of our beloved team members were detained while simply walking home from work,” the restaurant wrote. “They remain in custody, and our hearts are with them and their families.” The restaurant did not respond to a request for comment.

Hernán said the pause in business was incredibly hard on a small, family-owned business, especially after the slow summer months. He's looking for people who live in DC, speak Spanish and English, and are willing to come into work so that they can reopen. “But I don't know if we can find people,” he said.

About a mile away, near the Columbia Heights neighborhood, a sign in Spanish on the door of Elizabeth Pupusería & Deli hung up last week read: “We are closed temporarily during the terrible situation in our larger neighborhood. We hope to serve you again soon. Let's take care of ourselves and stay safe in our homes.”

Elizabeth Rodriguez, a Salvadorian immigrant who owns the restaurant and has been in Washington for roughly 20 years, told the Guardian that the restaurant was fulfilling some orders that prior customers call in, but its doors were not open to the public.

“It's a very ugly thing because the nerves, the nerves go up,” Rodriguez said in Spanish about the situation in DC. “The clients don't come for the same reason. Our business relied on construction workers because they are the big groups that came to bring various orders for all their colleagues. And they haven't worked all month.”

She said she paid her workers collectively about $500 a day, and after Trump's crackdown on 11 August, she was only bringing in $300 a day. She hasn't been able to pay any of her staff these last two weeks – only she and her daughter-in-law are coming in.

“We are seeing what we can do so as not to close definitively,” she said. “I know that it is only supposed to be one month, but suddenly it is very complicated because the rent, the bills, you have to pay them the same.

“We are asking God for this to change because if we don't, we can't pay many months of rent,” she added.

The restaurant doesn't typically allow delivery, but Rodriguez is thinking about changing that if it reopens because so many people don't want to leave their homes. But even that is difficult, she said.

“Today I said, ‘Today is the right time to add delivery,' so I called DoorDash and he told me that he doesn't have workers because most of them have been taken and others are afraid to leave.”

Ice has reportedly been targeting delivery drivers on mopeds, worsening the crisis for restaurants.

Several videos of Ice detaining delivery drivers have spread across social media, and the Washington Post reported, citing anonymous police sources, that Ice is accompanying officers with DC's Metropolitan police department to conduct traffic stops of moped drivers to check their immigration status.

“You don't want to go outside,” Yonatan Colmenarez, an asylum seeker who came from Venezuela two years ago and has driven a moped around DC, told the Post. “It gives you a kind of emotional damage; you're not sure who they might be.”

Government faces calls for police reform amid violent clashes across Jakarta and demonstrations in other cities

Hundreds of Indonesians have protested at sites across Jakarta over the death of a man hit by a police vehicle, in the first big test for Prabowo Subianto's nearly year-old government.

The man, a motorcycle ride-sharing driver, was hit at the site of violent clashes near parliament on Thursday as police sought to disperse demonstrators protesting about a number of issues including lawmakers' pay and education funding.

The protests on Friday afternoon in the capital of south-east Asia's largest economy prompted a number of schools to close early, and banks and businesses to ask employees to work from home. The military was deployed in some areas, footage broadcast by local media showed.

Drivers, students and Indonesians from other walks of life gathered outside the country's parliament and police headquarters in Jakarta to protest on Friday, throwing rocks at the gates and chanting: “Killer. Killer.”

One of the protesters, Pendi Nasir, a 43-year-old motorcycle driver, called for the police to conduct a transparent investigation into the death of the driver, Affan Kurniawan. “We don't want our colleagues here to become victims of this riot again,” he told Reuters, urging action against those at fault.

The standup comedian Aci Resti attended a protest at the parliament against the housing allowance for lawmakers. “I'm here to voice the opinions of my friends, who are fed up with everything, with the members of the House of Representatives, with everything, with the government,” she said.

Protesters were undeterred by the earlier remarks of Prabowo, the country's president, who called for calm, expressed condolences for Kurniawan's death and ordered a thorough investigation.

“I am shocked and disappointed by the excessive actions of the officers,” Prabowo said in a video message. “I have ordered a thorough and transparent investigation … and officers involved must be held accountable.”

Drivers wearing their signature green jackets also staged protests in other cities, including Surabaya and Bandung on Java island, and Gorontalo on the island of Sulawesi.

Amid the unrest, the rupiah closed 0.9% weaker against the US dollar, at 16,495. The stock index fell by as much as 2.3% to hit its lowest point since 12 August, before closing 1.5% down after recovering some of its losses on Friday.

“If Prabowo isn't careful … protests may devolve into chaos,” Made Supriatma, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, told Reuters.

As Thursday's protest persisted into the night, local media reported that riot police fired teargas and used water cannon to try to disperse people.

The capital's police chief, Asep Edi Suheri, said that during the clashes on Thursday an armoured police vehicle had hit and killed Kurniawan, who worked for the ride-sharing services Gojek and Grab. He apologised to Kurniawan's family.

A motorcycle drivers' association said Kurniawan was not involved in the protests.

On Friday afternoon, the national police official Abdul Karim told reporters that authorities would detain for 20 days the seven police officers who were in the vehicle that hit Kurniawan for a breach of ethics and said questioning was taking place.

After Kurniawan's death, a group led by motorcycle drivers protested in front of the riot police's headquarters on Thursday night and on Friday, local media reported.

Kurniawan's funeral was attended by hundreds of fellow ride-sharing motorcycle drivers, who escorted his body to the burial site in a convoy of two-wheelers through the centre of Jakarta.

“We are deeply disappointed, especially with the security officials and national police chief,” Ari Potret, a driver who attended Kurniawan's funeral, told Reuters. “This is barbaric.”

Jakarta Legal Aid urged the government to release 600 people who had been arrested during the demonstrations.

            Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst has decided not to seek reelection to a third term, two people familiar with the decision say, and is poised to make an announcement next week.
    


            Ernst, 55, has been wrestling with the decision for months, but began telling friends in recent days.
    


            Her retirement creates an open Senate seat in Iowa. Rep. Ashley Hinson is making plans to jump into the race, one GOP official says. National Republicans, anticipating Ernst's retirement, have long said they believe Hinson would be a strong candidate.
    


            A crowded field of Democrats is already running. The party's primary field includes state Rep. Josh Turek, a Paralympian wheelchair basketball player, state Sen. Zach Wahls, Knoxville Chamber of Commerce executive director Nathan Sage and Des Moines School Board chair Jackie Norris.
    


            CBS first reported Ernst's decision.
    


            Ernst has come under fire since responding “we are all going to die” to a constituent at a town meeting who raised concerns about Medicaid cuts in Trump's policy megabill.
    


            She was first elected in 2014 on a pledge to cut government spending with her signature slogan: “Make ‘em squeal.” As the Republican Party has evolved under President Donald Trump, Ernst has often struggled to strike a balance between GOP voters identifying with Trump's “Make America Great Again” movement and those who don't.
    


            A decade ago, Iowa was a critical swing state won by Barack Obama twice and then by Donald Trump in 2016. The state swung partially back in Democrats' favor in 2018, with Democratic candidates winning three of Iowa's four US House seats. But Republicans have dominated since then — winning all statewide races except auditor, a post held by current Democratic gubernatorial candidate Rob Sand, and ultimately claiming all four House seats.
    


            Trump won there by 8 percentage points in 2020 and 13 points in 2024.
    


            However, Iowa Democrats point to the party's stronger performance compared to 2024 results in special elections this year — including a victory in a conservative state Senate district this week — as evidence that the tide could turn in 2026.
    


            Democrats, needing a net gain of four seats to win control of the Senate in next November's midterm elections, are seeking to expand the field of potentially competitive GOP-held seats.
    


            The party's top target is an open-seat race in North Carolina. But Democrats also aim to be competitive in some combination of Maine, where Democratic Gov. Janet Mills this week said she is “seriously considering” running against GOP Sen. Susan Collins; Ohio, where former Sen. Sherrod Brown is attempting to mount a political comeback by running against incumbent Republican Sen. Jon Husted; and Texas, where Sen. John Cornyn faces a stiff primary challenge from conservative firebrand Attorney General Ken Paxton — who Democrats view as a more favorable general election opponent.

Submitting a complaint is now a “multi-step, illogical navigation process,” the senators said.

In a letter sent to Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon on August 25, a group of Democratic senators, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts), condemned the department's decision to remove the ‘Submit a Complaint' button on the Office of Federal Student Aid's (FSA) website.

Since Trump's inauguration in January, the department has laid off approximately 1,300 people, close to half of its staff. Many of those employees handled borrowers' complaints, according to the senators.

The senators first raised these issues in a letter to the Education Department in March. In response, the agency assured Warren that “the button to submit a complaint has been moved from the top of the webpage to the footer and renamed ‘submit feedback.'”

But the senators say the department's response was “highly misleading and incomplete.” 

“What was once a simple click from the Department of Education's homepage, is now a multi-step, illogical navigation process,” they wrote in their August 25 letter. “Prior to the Trump Administration, submitting a complaint on the Federal Student Aid website involved a clear button on the home page labelled ‘Submit a Complaint.'”

Now, the process is far more complicated. On the bottom of the FSA homepage, on the left hand side, in a font smaller than almost everything else on the page, it says: “Help Center | Contact Us | Site Feedback.” If the user clicks on “Site Feedback,” a pop-up asks, “What kind of feedback are you sharing today?” Two options are provided — “Website Feedback” and “Other.” If the user clicks “Other,” they're finally provided with a link to submit a complaint. 

In March, Politico reported that emails between Education Department staffers show that they intentionally hid the button in order to reduce the number of complaints received. 

“Removing the ‘Submit a Complaint' button on Studentaid.gov is already underway,” Mell Brittian-Smith, a senior Education Department employee, wrote in an email obtained by Politico, adding that they would also like to remove the word “feedback” from the site. 

“I believe this change would help decrease contact center volume and the number of complaints that the Ombuds office receives — so an overall win,” she wrote.

In Fiscal Year 2024, the Education Department received just under 290,000 complaints; over 90 percent were submitted through the website, according to the Federal Student Aid's 2024 annual report. More than half of those complaints were related to student loan repayment. The second most common complaint concerned navigating the student aid application process.

Like many federal agencies, the Trump administration has gutted the Department of Education, which the president has said he plans to eliminate. As Department of Education secretary, McMahon, a former professional wrestling executive, has championed budget cuts, layoffs and, ultimately, the end of the department altogether. Earlier this year, the department stopped forgiving student loan debt for people enrolled in the Income-Based Repayment Program, without notifying Congress or borrowers. The program allows borrowers to have the balance of their debt forgiven after making 300 payments, which typically takes about 25 years. The department has not said when it will resume forgiving borrowers' debt.

“Removing the ‘Submit a Complaint' button on Studentaid.gov is already underway,” Mell Brittian-Smith, a senior Education Department employee, wrote in an email obtained by Politico, adding that they would also like to remove the word “feedback” from the site. 

“I believe this change would help decrease contact center volume and the number of complaints that the Ombuds office receives — so an overall win,” she wrote.

In Fiscal Year 2024, the Education Department received just under 290,000 complaints; over 90 percent were submitted through the website, according to the Federal Student Aid's 2024 annual report. More than half of those complaints were related to student loan repayment. The second most common complaint concerned navigating the student aid application process.

Like many federal agencies, the Trump administration has gutted the Department of Education, which the president has said he plans to eliminate. As Department of Education secretary, McMahon, a former professional wrestling executive, has championed budget cuts, layoffs and, ultimately, the end of the department altogether. Earlier this year, the department stopped forgiving student loan debt for people enrolled in the Income-Based Repayment Program, without notifying Congress or borrowers. The program allows borrowers to have the balance of their debt forgiven after making 300 payments, which typically takes about 25 years. The department has not said when it will resume forgiving borrowers' debt.

Michael Bloomberg and anti-DEI pundit Bill Ackman are just two of the many billionaires showering cash on Cuomo.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

As the housing crisis and wealth inequality emerge as top issues for voters in New York City, mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani has called for higher taxes on the rich to pay for services and famously suggested that billionaires should not exist. Mamdani's viral campaign handily defeated Andrew Cuomo, New York's former governor, in a Democratic primary earlier this year. As expected, billionaires and billionaire-owned companies such as Airbnb and DoorDash are now spending big to defeat Mamdani and influence the race. 

An analysis of new campaign finance filings by influence trackers at the nonprofit public interest research organization LittleSis found that multiple billionaires and their companies have funneled more than $19 million into political action committees (PACs) that support Cuomo or oppose Mamdani and other candidates. With names such as Fix the City, Inc. and Affordable New York, such super PACS provide a vehicle for elite New Yorkers and corporate interests to influence public opinion on the race. 

For example, the short-term rental company Airbnb reported a $5 million donation to Affordable New York, a group that has spent heavily on city races and reported spending $1.3 million opposing Mamdani and his progressive ally, city comptroller Brad Lander. According to SEC filings, Airbnb's three billionaire co-founders —  Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk, and Joe Gebbia — collectively control 79 percent of the voting power at the company. Venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, backed by billionaires Michael Moritz and Douglas Leone, holds a further 10 percent. 

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

Airbnb and other short-term rental companies with a similar business model face backlash from tenant unions and housing advocates for contributing to a historic housing crisis in New York City and across the country. Like in other cities, regulation of short-term rentals is a hot button issue in New York, often pitting tenants against landlords, homeowners, and tourists.   

In contrast to the list of more than a dozen billionaires lining up behind Cuomo, Mamdani, a democratic socialist and state assemblyman, has benefited modestly from the support of a single billionaire known for supporting education reform and LGTBQ rights. Elizabeth Simons, a hedge fund heiress and bilingual educator, gave $250,000 to the pro-Mamdani PAC New Yorkers for Lower Costs. The group has spent $921,045 supporting Mamdani and $426,835 opposing Cuomo, according to LittleSis. 

Even as pundits attack Mamdani for his comments on non-local topics such as Israel's bloody occupation of Palestine, his proposals for freezing rent prices and raising taxes on the richest 1 percent to boost public transportation and other services have exhilarated many working and middle class voters. Indeed, in the Democratic Party primary for the mayoral race, Mamdani earned 56 percent of the ranked choice vote, despite being a relative newcomer to city politics, promptly terrifying New York City's real estate lobby and the billionaire class. 

PACs receiving donations from billionaires also spent campaign cash during the Democratic primary to defeat progressive Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller who is allied with Mamdani, and his predecessor, Scott Stringer. Stringer and Lander dropped out after Mamdani upset Cuomo in the primary by a 12-point margin. 

At 33 years old, Mamdani is making a splash in the national media and maintains a solid lead in most polls. However, Cuomo has decided to run as an independent and stay in the mayoral race, which remains competitive as outside money flows in. 

Also running as an independent is incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, whose reelection campaign has been marred by corruption allegations that led to investigations and criminal charges against at least 10 of the mayor's aides, appointees, and associates, according to ABC News. Adams was charged with covering up bribery and illegal campaign contributions in September 2024, but the Justice Department dropped the federal charges under President Donald Trump, who has pressured Adams to comply with his brutal crackdown on immigrants. 

Adams denies any quid pro quo for the dropped charges and rejected Trump's call to deploy National Guard troops in New York City this week as the president continues to scaremonger about “crime” as a pretext for military deployments in major cities. Adams also apologized to New Yorkers for the scandals surrounding his tenure in an interview on August 27 but maintained that he has not broken the law. 

Local activist Curtis Sliwa is running for mayor on the Republican ticket. Along with Adams, Sliwa is lagging behind Mamdani and Cuomo in the polls. 

Perhaps the most visible and influential billionaire in the race is former mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is also known as New York City's richest man at the top of the Bloomberg finance and media empire. Bloomberg has donated $8.3 million to Fix the City, a super PAC founded to elect Cuomo and defeat Mamdani. The group has spent $14.7 million supporting Cuomo and $7.8 million opposing Mamdani after receiving a total of $12.3 million from billionaire donors, according to LittleSis. 

Mamdani earned 56 percent of the ranked choice vote, despite being a relative newcomer to city politics, promptly terrifying New York City's real estate lobby and the billionaire class. 

Then there are the millionaire and billionaire co-founders and CEOs behind the freelance food delivery company Doordash, including Tony Xu, Andy Fang, Stanley Tang, and Evan Moore. Doordash gave $1 million to the pro-Cuomo group Fix the City and $1.8 million to Local Economies Forward NY, a super PAC that lists Doordash as its top donor on a sparse website. Local Economies Forward NY reported spending $368,247 supporting Cuomo while funneling additional funding toward multiple city council candidates. 

Bill Ackman, the billionaire power donor and self-styled anti-DEI pundit, has also lined up behind Cuomo with a $500,000 donation to Fix the City. Ackman, a hedge fund manager and longtime Democratic donor who backed President Donald Trump in the 2024 elections, also gave $250,000 to New Yorkers for a Better Future 2025, a PAC that spent money on city council campaigns. It remains unclear whether this committee funded by Ackman is related to New Yorkers for a Better Future Mayor 2025, which WABC reports is preparing to spend $20 million against Mamdani in the general election, according to LittleSis. 

Other notable donors donating to support Cuomo or defeat Mamdani include:  

The race remains tight despite Mamdani's upset in the primaries. A poll released on August 27 shows Cuomo pulling ahead of Mamdani if Adams and other candidates drop out of the race. With New Yorkers preparing to vote on November 4, money will undoubtedly continue pouring in, and researchers will be looking forward to the next deadline for campaign finance reports to reveal how deeply the ultra-wealthy are willing to invest in the Big Apple's next mayor.

BUDAPEST, August 29. /TASS/. After the conflict in Ukraine is over, EU leaders and Vladimir Zelensky will have to answer as to why they sought to protract hostilities instead of doing what they must to achieve peace, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said.

According to the top Hungarian diplomat, due to the European Union's serious political mistakes, including its military support for Ukraine and anti-Russian sanctions, Europe has turned into a "continent of war," has lost its competitive capacities and now is lagging behind the United States and China.

"Instead of putting an end to the war, they opted to expand it, which entailed apparent losses for Europe from the point of view of its socio-economic security, inflation, growing food, energy prices and so on. And once the war ends, European political leaders will have to answer the question of why they chose this strategy. It is becoming clear why Western European leaders are not interested in the cessation of the war," he said addressing the Transit annual political festival in Tihany on Lake Balaton shore.

He noted that over the three and a half years of hostilities the situation in Ukraine has deteriorated dramatically. "Half of the country is in ruins, hundreds of thousands of people have died, millions have become refugees seeking to escape an economic collapse, and so on and so forth. And if an agreement is signed now, it is obvious that because of the battlefield situation it cannot be more favorable for Ukraine than the deal that would have been done three years ago. That is why the question of why they did not want to negotiate three and a half years ago when a more advantageous deal was quite possible will be asked not only to the European leaders but also to the Ukrainian president," Szijjarto said.

Zelensky, in his words, will have to explain to the Ukrainians why he cut short peace talks with Russia in Istanbul in the spring of 2022. "Why wasn't any peace agreement signed there? Who did such instructions come from and who forced Zelensky not to sign this agreement and continue the war? These are very serious questions the [European] political elite is reluctant to answer today," the top Hungarian diplomat emphasized.

The Russian and Ukrainian delegations held peace talks in Istanbul in the spring of 2022 and reached an agreement on settling the conflict. However, this agreement never took effect because Kiev changed its position due to the interference of Western leaders. The agreement bound Ukraine to proclaim its neutral, off-bloc status and refuse from deploying foreign-made weapons in its territory.

It “is another clear example of retaliation against federal employee union members,” AFGE's national president said.

In the lead-up to Labor Day in the United States, President Donald Trump on Thursday escalated his attack on the union rights of federal employees at a list of agencies with an executive order that claims to “enhance” national security.

Trump previously issued an order intended to strip the collective bargaining rights from hundreds of thousands of government employees in March, provoking an ongoing court fight. A federal judge blocked the president's edict — but then earlier this month, a panel from the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit allowed the administration to proceed.

Government agencies were directed not to terminate any collective bargaining agreements while the litigation over Trump's March order continued, but some have begun to do so, according to Government Executive. On Monday, the 9th Circuit said in a filing that it would vote on whether the full court will rehear the case.

Amid that court fight, Trump issued Thursday's order, which calls for an end to collective bargaining for unionized workers at the Bureau of Reclamation's hydropower units; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service; National Weather Service; Patent and Trademark Office; and US Agency for Global Media.

Like the earlier order, this one cites the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. As Government Executive reported Thursday:

Matt Biggs, national president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, whose union represents a portion of NASA's workforce along with the American Federation of Government Employees, suggested that the administration's targeting of NASA — IFPTE's largest union — was in retaliation for its own lawsuit challenging the spring iteration of the executive order, filed last month.

“It's not surprising, sadly,” Biggs said. “What is surprising is that on the eve of Labor Day weekend, when workers are to be celebrated, the Trump administration has doubled down on being the most anti-labor, anti-worker administration in US history. We will continue to fight in the courts, on the Hill, and at the grassroots levels against this.”

Everett Kelley, national president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), which also sued over the March order, said that “President Trump's decision to issue a Labor Day proclamation shortly after stripping union rights from thousands of civil servants, a third of whom are veterans, should show American workers what he really thinks about them.”

“This latest executive order is another clear example of retaliation against federal employee union members who have bravely stood up against his anti-worker, anti-American plan to dismantle the federal government,” Kelley declared, taking aim at the president's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

“Several agencies including NASA and the National Weather Service have already been hollowed out by reckless DOGE cuts, so for the administration to further disenfranchise the remaining workers in the name of ‘efficiency' is immoral and abhorrent,” the union leader said. “AFGE is preparing an immediate response and will continue to fight relentlessly to protect the rights of our members, federal employees, and their union.”

NEW YORK, August 29. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump has ordered that former Vice President and ex-Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris be barred from receiving government security protection provided by Secret Service agents, CNN reported.

According to the broadcaster, Harris had been granted six months of protection after her term ended, which was set to be extended for another year under a directive signed by former President Joe Biden shortly before leaving office. Trump's order revoked this directive.

"You [Secret Service agents] are hereby authorized to discontinue any security-related procedures previously authorized by Executive Memorandum, beyond those required by law, for the following individual, effective September 1, 2025: Former Vice President Kamala D. Harris," CNN quoted the document as saying.

MOSCOW, August 29. /TASSA/. Future security guarantees for Ukraine should not be a condition for negotiations, but the result of a peaceful settlement, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said at a briefing.

According to the diplomat, Vladimir Zelensky continues to sabotage the negotiations on Ukraine and continue the conflict, while the words he chooses mirror those used by leaders of terrorist cells of the past.

TASS has compiled key statements by the official representative of the Foreign Ministry.

- Zelensky undermines the talks: "Zelensky continued to take steps leading to the sabotage of the peace negotiation process and escalation of the conflict. On August 21, he told foreign journalists about Kiev's refusal to legally recognize the territories irretrievably lost by the clique, repeating his delusional maxims about their occupation."

- Zelensky's statements look eerily similar to those of terrorist leaders of days past: ‘He announced some surprises for the Russians and expressed hope for the presence of Canadian forces in Ukraine. The maple supporter of military intervention backed this idea, continued this idea, and promised to allocate $500 million for drones under the American arms purchase program. This refers to the list of priority requirements for Ukraine. And you know what's amazing? It's amazing that the vocabulary, well, I'm not talking about facial expressions at all, but Zelensky's vocabulary completely repeats the vocabulary of the leaders of terrorist cells of the past."

- Future guarantees of security to Ukraine should not be a condition for negotiations, but the result of a peaceful settlement, taking into account the root causes of the conflict: "It is necessary to understand that provision of security guarantees is not a condition, but the result of a peaceful settlement based on eliminating the root causes of the crisis in Ukraine. That, in turn, will guarantee the security of our country."

- The West's security guarantees proposals for Ukraine are directed against Russia and can only lead to destabilization: "By their very nature, based on the rudiments of colonial thinking, the guarantees of so-called security that are being discussed in Europe, of course, are not such, as they lead to the degradation of strategic stability at the regional and global levels."

- Moscow proceeds from the fact that "the options offered by the collective West are one-sided, built with the obvious expectation of containing Russia."

- In Brussels, the cessation of oil supplies to Hungary and Slovakia after the attack of the Ukrainian army on August 14 and 22 on the Druzhba pipeline on the Russian territory is not considered dangerous for the EU: "It is noteworthy that in this context, the Ukrainian media are replicating the position of the European Commission, which, in response to a request, informed that in Brussels - just think about it - they do not see any danger to the European Union from the cessation of oil supplies to Hungary and Slovakia. I would like to ask: is this any way to act towards your colleagues in the European Union? It seems at this point you've already turned against your own members. Now it turns out that you are not in favor of the economy, now it turns out that you are in favor of making it worse for those who are inside your European structure."

WASHINGTON, August 29. /TASS/. US Vice President JD Vance has said that he is ready to take on the presidency if Donald Trump is unable to serve out his term.

"I feel very confident the president of the United States is in good shape, is going to serve out the remainder of his term and do great things for the American people," Vance told USA Today. "If God forbid, there's a terrible tragedy, I can't think of better on-the-job training than what I've gotten over the last 200 days," he added.

The Axios news website reported earlier that JD Vance was seen as a likely contender for the 2028 Republican presidential nomination.

            President Donald Trump revoked Kamala Harris' Secret Service protection on Thursday, according to a copy of a letter reviewed by CNN.
    


            Former presidents receive Secret Service protection for life. Harris, as a former vice president, received six months of protection after leaving office, according to federal law. That period ended on July 21. However, her protection had been extended for an additional year via a directive –﻿ not made public until now – signed by then-President Joe Biden shortly before leaving office, according to multiple people familiar with the undisclosed arrangement.
    


            That is the order Trump canceled in his letter, titled “Memorandum for the Secretary of Homeland Security” and dated Thursday.
    


            “You are hereby authorized to discontinue any security-related procedures previously authorized by Executive Memorandum, beyond those required by law, for the following individual, effective September 1, 2025: Former Vice President Kamala D. Harris,” the letter reads in full.
    


            The order to remove Harris' detail came from the White House, one official with the Secret Service told CNN.
    


            The decision was not part of a security review or new threat assessment, the source said. Leadership within the agency did not flag any security concerns or push back from the White House's order, the official said, who noted that Harris's detail would range from a dozen to a few dozen agents depending on her schedule and shift changes for 24-hour security.
    


            Trump's ending of Harris' protection comes as she soon embarks on a multi-city, high-profile book tour around the release of “107 Days,” her new memoir on her short presidential campaign, set to be released September 23. That will put her more in the public spotlight than she has been since leaving office, during which time she's attended only a few public events.
    


            “The Vice President is grateful to the United States Secret Service for their professionalism, dedication, and unwavering commitment to safety,” Kirsten Allen, a Harris senior adviser, told CNN.
    


            Presidents and presidential candidates face frequent security threats. There were two assassination attempts against Trump during his run for president last year.
    


            Harris, according to people familiar with her security operations, faced particular security concerns given that she was the first woman and first Black woman in the role. Those concerns only increased after she became the nominee, the people familiar with her security operations told CNN, and was still at a high level into January following the campaign, with feelings about the election still raw.
    


            A Biden spokesperson declined to comment on what led to his signing the order extending Harris' protection.
    


            But what will now disappear is not just the agents assigned to guard her in person, 24-7: Secret Service protection includes constant analysis of threat intelligence and covering in-person situations, emails, texts and social media. With her detail canceled, Harris aides are worried they will lose the same access to threat warnings, the people familiar with her security operations said. Her home, in the middle of Los Angeles, will also stop being protected by federal agents.

            The cost of mounting any similar level of protection privately would be expensive, possibly going into the millions of dollars annually.
    


            Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, lost his own personal detail on July 21 under the standard provisions for a former vice president's spouse.
    


            California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom was briefed on Harris losing her protection late Thursday. A person familiar with the discussions told CNN that the governor's office could not comment on security arrangements or methods which may be activated as a replacement.
    


            However, Newsom spokesperson Bob Salladay expressed outrage about Trump making the change.
    


            “The safety of our public officials should never be subject to erratic, vindictive political impulses,” Salladay told CNN.
    


            Harris, as a Los Angeles resident, could also receive protection from the city police department. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Newsom were in touch Thursday evening about the situation.
    


            “This is another act of revenge following a long list of political retaliation in the form of firings, the revoking of security clearances and more. This puts the former Vice President in danger and I look forward to working with the Governor to make sure Vice President Harris is safe in Los Angeles,” Bass told CNN in a statement.

European defence ministers pledged Friday to ramp up support for Ukraine and increase pressure on Russia, a day after a Russian air assault on Kyiv killed 23 people and badly damaged a European diplomatic compound.

Outrage over the attack propelled Europe's leaders to condemn Russia even before Friday's meeting and call for tougher measures on Moscow like seizing frozen assets, further sanctions and increasing support for Ukraine's military and membership in the European Union.

“Everybody understands that, considering how [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is mocking the peace efforts, the only thing that works is pressure,” said Kaja Kallas, foreign policy chief for the European Union.

They also discussed European troops' deployment in Ukraine to guarantee security and monitor a peace that seems distant as American efforts to broker peace between Ukraine and Russia appear stalled.

Kyiv's European allies are looking to set up a force that could backstop any peace agreement, and a coalition of 30 countries, including European nations, Japan and Australia, has signed up to support the initiative. Kallas said that in terms of security guarantees for Ukraine, the U.S. is demanding that Europe carry “the lion's share” of the burden.

Military chiefs are figuring out how that security force might work. The role that the U.S. might play is unclear. Trump has ruled out sending U.S. troops to help defend Ukraine against Russia.

On Thursday, two missiles landed about 50 metres from an EU diplomatic mission in Kyiv, shattering the office's windows and doors but causing no injuries there. The EU summoned Russia's envoy in Brussels, Karen Malayan, and told her that damages to the mission “are serious and constitute a violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,” said Anitta Hipper, an EU foreign policy spokesperson.

The UN Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting on air strikes against Ukraine on Friday afternoon at the request of Ukraine and five European council members – Britain, France, Slovenia, Denmark and Greece. Two of Ukraine's top envoys were set to meet Friday with the Trump administration regarding mediation.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky after Thursday's attack on Kyiv.

She said that Trump “was not happy about this news, but he was also not surprised.”

Leavitt noted that Ukraine has also launched effective assaults on Russia's oil industry in recent weeks.

“Perhaps both sides of this war are not ready to end it themselves,” Leavitt said. “The President wants it to end, but the leaders of these two countries … must want it to end as well.”

In Copenhagen, Kallas said defence ministers from across the 27-nation bloc discussed increasing sanctions on Russia, ramping up defence supplies to Ukraine's army and European contribution to postwar security guarantees, which could include EU training missions into Ukraine once a ceasefire is in place.

At a news conference following the meeting, Kallas said the ministers had discussed ways to work around Hungary's refusal to back Ukraine. She said the EU has €6.6-billion blocked by Hungary's veto that could potentially be sent to Ukraine via NATO's new Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List approved by Trump.

On Thursday, the United States approved a US$825-million arms sale to Ukraine that will include extended-range missiles and related equipment to boost its defensive capabilities.

Lithuania's Defense Minister Dovilė Šakalienė said the attack on Kyiv on Thursday shows that hope now for peace is “naive” and that “all Putin is doing is really stalling, actually cheaply buying time to kill more people and to imitate sort of willingness to maybe stop his own murderous actions.”

She said Europe must deal with Russia more forcefully, like seizing frozen Russian assets.

“That is actually one power that we are not using enough yet,” she said. “Over 200 billion of Russian assets would be extremely helpful in both pumping this money in Ukrainian defence industry and buying American weapons.”

Simon Harris, Ireland's Defence Minister, said more must be done to force Russia to end the war.

“It's imperative that those of us in the European Union now consider further sanctions, what more measures can be taken to increase the pressure on Russia to end this brutal and aggressive war on Ukraine and the huge impact that that's having on civilians,” he said.

European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen began a tour of EU nations bordering Russia or Belarus on Friday, including visits to arms factories and border installations. She met Friday with Latvian Prime Minister Evika Silina and toured a drone manufacturer.

MOSCOW, August 29. /TASS/. Future security guarantees for Ukraine should be the outcome of a peaceful settlement addressing the conflict's root causes, rather than a precondition for negotiations, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.

"It is important to understand that providing security guarantees is not a condition, but the result of a peaceful settlement based on eliminating the root causes of the crisis in Ukraine. This will also ensure the security of our country," the diplomat stressed.

The diplomat also outlined what Moscow believes the outcome of negotiations should entail: "Demilitarization, denazification, Ukraine's neutrality and non-nuclear status, recognition of territorial realities, protection of the rights of Russians and Russian speakers, and an end to the persecution of canonical Orthodox."

"Security guarantees must be grounded in a common understanding that respects Russia's security interests - not in attempts to turn Ukraine into some kind of rabid beast," she added.

Zakharova argued that Western proposals on security guarantees for Ukraine would have the opposite effect, fueling instability. "Essentially rooted in the rudiments of colonial thinking, the so-called security guarantees being debated in Europe are nothing of the sort. They only accelerate the erosion of strategic stability both regionally and globally," she stressed.

According to her, Moscow views Western initiatives as "one-sided schemes aimed at containing Russia, designed to pull the Kiev regime deeper into NATO's orbit."

She noted that Western efforts undermine Ukraine's neutral, non-aligned, and non-nuclear commitments enshrined in the 1990 declaration on state sovereignty. "This line violates the principle of indivisible security and casts Kiev as a strategic provocateur on Russia's borders, raising the risk of the alliance being dragged into armed conflict with our country," Zakharova warned.

"Nothing new has been invented here - international legal literature is full of such tactics. And yet this is the strategic provocateur we now have on our borders," she concluded.

WASHINGTON, August 29. /TASS/. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair (1997-2007) and Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump's son-in-law, will work together to develop a post-war plan for the Gaza Strip, Barak Ravid, a correspondent with Axios, reported, citing White House officials.

According to him, Blair and Kushner, who was a senior adviser to Trump during his first presidential term in charge of the Middle East, got the US leader's "blessing" to intensify work on the plan to govern the Palestinian enclave. Finding an acceptable alternative to the radical Palestinian movement Hamas would be central, Ravid wrote, specifying this was the principled position of Israel also shared by the United States.

The ex-British prime minister and Trump's son-in-law don't have an answer yet as to who would take over the Gaza Strip instead of Hamas and ensure security there after hostilities end. While finalizing a plan may take time, the White House expects it to be ready when the Israeli military operation ends. By that time, the United States should lead the effort toward "an internationally accepted governance structure" in the Gaza Strip that would guarantee security to Israel and allow the Jewish state to pull out its troops from the enclave, according to Axios.

On August 27, Trump met with Israel's Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer to hold talks on resolving the Gaza conflict. The meeting was attended by Blair, Kushner, US Vice President JD Vance, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, and several other senior US officials.

Many parents support their adult kids financially in their 20s and 30s.Brinja Schmidt/iStockPhoto / Getty Images

Good morning. This week, I wrote about how empty nesting might become a past concept as more parents are supporting their kids financially well into their 20s and 30s. 

How long should parents support their kids? According to Bank of Montreal's Real Financial Progress Index released earlier this month, 29 per cent of Canadians surveyed believe financial support should last as long as the parents are alive. Twenty-two per cent said it's when their child secures full-time employment, with 18 per cent planning to assist financially until the child moves out of the family house. 

How parents consider the situation depends on their family dynamic and financial health, says Hervin Pesa, certified financial planner at Aware Financial in Calgary.

“It boils down to personal and family values,” he says. “I've seen cases in which people refuse to retire until they know their kids are completely set up.”

Put another way, money originally earmarked toward ramping up parents' retirement savings is going toward helping their kids instead, he says. That could mean financial assistance with a down payment for a house or paying a certain percentage of the adult kid's expenses for an indefinite period of time.

At clients' requests, Mr. Pesa has worked on mini-plans addressing both the parents and the kids. Some parents, for example, have enough to retire and need more financial data, reassuring them it still works with adult kids at home. He says some kids are on track to have a strong financial footing, but parents still worry about retiring. 

Mr. Pesa says that generally, immigrant families have always embraced the full nest with no restrictions. Kids are encouraged to stay home until they marry and start their own respective families. Even if kids have no desire to partner up and/or have kids of their own and have achieved financially independent status, remaining at home is perfectly fine, he adds. 

“In some of these cases, the kids actually purchase properties and keep them as rentals while staying with their parents,” he says.

Still, as adult kids at home consider their situation and delayed milestones, that may cause them to rethink whether parenthood is in their cards for the future. The same BMO survey found that while seven in 10 members of Generation Z and millennials would like children, they worry about financial security. 

And it's more than a valid feeling, as 53 per cent of Canadians surveyed admitted that having children did compromise their financial security.

WASHINGTON (Jiji Press) — The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration on Thursday started displaying one of the two original copies of the instrument of surrender of Japan in World War II as part of a special exhibition to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the war this year.

The instrument was signed on Sept. 2, 1945, aboard the USS Missouri battleship anchored at Tokyo Bay by then Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu, Gen. Douglas MacArthur, supreme commander of the Allied Powers, and others.. It will be on display until Oct. 1.

The other copy is kept in the Japanese Foreign Ministry's Diplomatic Archives.

The original copy of the Imperial rescript on the signing of the instrument of surrender, inked by Emperor Showa is also on display at the U.S. archives.

Prosecutors in Washington on Aug. 28 downgraded a charge against a man who was seen on camera throwing a sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection agent during the federal takeover of the D.C. police after a grand jury declined to indict the man.

Instead of pursuing a felony indictment, prosecutors charged former Justice Department employee Sean Dunn with a misdemeanor assault against a federal law enforcement officer. Misdemeanors do not require grand jury approval.

A Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv overnight on Aug. 28, which left 23 dead, is undermining peace efforts led by U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukraine's allies, President Volodymyr Zelensky said later the same day.

"It is a strike against Ukraine. It is a strike against Europe. And it is also a strike by Russia against President Trump, and against other global actors," Zelensky said in an evening address.

At least 23 people were killed in the attack on Ukraine's capital, including four children, authorities said. Three of them were aged 2, 14, and 17. Sixty-three people, including 11 children, were injured. Among them, 30 were hospitalized, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported.

"This strike clearly shows that Russia's goals have not changed. They want war — and they are striking not only our people, not only our cities and communities. Russia is now striking at everyone in the world who seeks peace," Zelensky said.

Zelensky denounced Russian President Vladimir Putin for the strikes on Kyiv. He urged for additional sanctions to be imposed on Moscow and for tariffs to be imposed on Russia's trading partners.

Trump has previously threatened to impose secondary sanctions in the form of tariffs against Russia's trading partners if Moscow does not work towards a peace deal to end its war against Ukraine.

"In Washington, we heard that Putin is supposedly ready to end the war — to meet at the leaders' level and resolve key issues. But instead, he chooses (ballistic missiles) over any real steps toward peace," Zelensky said.

Trump has previously proposed facilitating a bilateral meeting between Zelensky and Putin, which could then be followed by a trilateral meeting with the U.S. leader.

"He kills children in order not to talk about when and how peace will come. The problem is that he is not afraid to strike even against the leaders he makes promises to," Zelensky said.

Putin and Trump met in Alaska on Aug. 15 as the U.S. leader intensifies efforts to broker a peace deal.

"A clear response of the world to this evil is needed. There are no deadlines that Putin would not break. There are no diplomatic opportunities that would not be ruined because of Russia. Strong steps are needed," Zelensky said.

Trump previously issued a deadline of Aug. 8 for Russia to reach a peace deal with Ukraine or face additional sanctions.

Even as Russia refused to cease hostilities by the deadline, no additional measures were imposed by the White House.

At least 25 people were killed in the attack on the capital, including four children, authorities said. Three of them were aged 2, 14, and 17.

Kallas met with the ministers in Copenhagen on Aug. 29 to discuss several issues, including security guarantees for Ukraine.

"I welcome that there is broad support today to expand our EU military mission mandate to provide training and advice inside Ukraine after any truce," Kallas said.

The fire started as a result of a Ukrainian drone attack on Aug. 28 near a village close to Gelendzhik, a Russian resort town on the Black Sea coastline, according to the reports.



Russia has quietly expanded its Votkinsk missile plant to produce intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States. Its output has reportedly tripled since 2022, strengthening Russia's capacity to wage war. 



Security guarantees for Ukraine should include provisions related to army funding, agreements with NATO members, and sanctions against Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

Some 22% of respondents said they are very pessimistic about a possible peace deal in Ukraine, while 45% said they are somewhat pessimistic, according to a Gallup poll.



"The organizers prefer to turn a blind eye and further ruin the festival's reputation," read the statement issued by Ukraine's foreign and culture ministries.

The pumping station near the village of Naytopovichi in Bryansk Oblast, a Russian region bordering Ukraine and Belarus, was hit overnight on Aug. 29, the Ukrainian military reported.

"This funding goes on top of the 1 billion euros ($1.17 billion) military aid that Belgium has already delivered," Ukraine's Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal said.

The Ukrainian delegation in New York will reportedly brief the international community about the scale of destruction and will urge an immediate ceasefire and the protection of civilians.

The U.S. State Department approved a military sale to Ukraine for Extended Range Attack Munition (ERAM) missiles and related equipment worth an estimated $825 million, the agency announced on Aug. 28.

Former Iowa State Sen. Jim Carlin, who has mounted another U.S. Senate bid, spoke to Fox News Digital about his policy views

Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa will not run for re-election in next year's midterms, three sources confirm to Fox News.

And the 55-year-old Ernst, who was first elected to the Senate in 2014, is expected to make an official announcement next week.

Ernst, a retired Army Reserve and Iowa National Guard officer who served in the Iraq War, has been wrestling for months whether to run for re-election in 2026.

The senator's decision to retire rather than seek a third six-year term creates an open seat in Iowa. 

IOWA REPUBLICAN TARGETS GOP SEN JONI ERNST FOR OUSTER, SAYING 'SHE DOESN'T VOTE LIKE' REPUBLICANS

GOP Rep. Ashley Hinson, a former TV news anchor who is in her third term representing Iowa's 2nd Congressional District, which covers the northeastern portion of the state, is planning on running to succeed Ernst, multiple sources confirm to Fox News.

KEY HOUSE GOP MODERATE DON BACON WON'T SEEK RE-ELECTION

Iowa was once a top battleground state that former President Barack Obama carried in his 2008 and 2012 White House victories. But the state has shifted to the right in recent election cycles, with President Donald Trump carrying the state by eight points in 2020 and by 13 points last November.

Republicans currently hold both of the state's U.S. Senate seats – Ernst and longtime Sen. Chuck Grassley  – and all four of Iowa's congressional districts, as well as all statewide offices except for state auditor, which is held by Democrat Rob Sand, who's running for governor next year.

But Democrats in Iowa are energized after flipping two GOP-held state Senate seats in special elections so far this year.

Four Democrats are already running for Senate in Iowa. The field includes state Rep. Josh Turek, a Paralympian wheelchair basketball player, state Sen. Zach Wahls, Knoxville Chamber of Commerce executive director Nathan Sage and Des Moines School Board Chair Jackie Norris.

Ernst first grabbed national attention 11 years ago with her "make 'em squeal" ads as she won the high-profile Senate election in the race to succeed retiring longtime Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin.

The senator, thanks to her military background, has often taken a lead on defense issues.

Since Trump's White House victory in 2016, Ernst has tried to strike a balance between her support for the president as she hued to a more traditional Republican agenda. 

Earlier this year, Ernst sparked a controversy after "we are all going to die" as she responded to a voter at town hall meeting who raised concerns over Medicaid cuts in the GOP's sweeping domestic policy bill.

Republicans are aiming to not only defend, but expand, the current 53-47 Senate majority in next year's elections.

Senate Republicans enjoyed a favorable map in the 2024 cycle as they flipped four seats from blue to red to win back the majority.

But the party in power—clearly the Republicans right now—traditionally faces political headwinds in the midterm elections. Nevertheless, a current read of the 2026 map indicates the GOP may be able to go on offense in some key states.

In battleground Georgia, which Trump narrowly carried in last year's White House race, Republicans view first-term Sen. Jon Ossoff as the most vulnerable Democrat incumbent up for re-election next year.

They're also targeting battleground Michigan, where Democratic Sen. Gary Peters is retiring at the end of next year, and swing state New Hampshire, where longtime Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen decided against seeking a fourth six-year term in the Senate.

Also on the NRSC's target list is blue-leaning Minnesota, where Democratic Sen. Tina Smith isn't running for re-election.

But the GOP is defending an open seat in battleground North Carolina, where Republican Sen. Thom Tills decided against seeking re-election.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A grand jury refused to indict a man who was captured on video hurling a sandwich at a federal agent. Prosecutors dropped another case after complaints that police illegally searched a man's satchel and found a gun. Judges, too, have balked at keeping several defendants in jail, citing weak evidence and dubious charging decisions.

President Donald Trump's crackdown on crime in the nation's capital has generated a torrent of charges against people caught up in a surge of street patrols. Judges, defense attorneys and even grand jurors are already poking holes in many cases.

“I've seen things over the past 72 hours that I've never seen in federal court,” U.S. District Judge Zia Faruqui said Wednesday during a hearing for a man who was jailed for five days on a misdemeanor marijuana possession charge. Later, he added: “It feels like some sort of bizarre nightmare.”

Trump has framed the three-week-old operation as a campaign to eradicate rampant crime and “take our capital back.” The judges and lawyers adjudicating the criminal cases say they're striving to strike a delicate balance between protecting public safety and preserving civil liberties.

Teams of federal agents and troops are patrolling the streets of Washington, D.C., helping police arrest hundreds of people. The courts are struggling to keep up with the burgeoning caseload. Some people have been held in jail for days while waiting to appear before a federal judge in district court.




Edwin Jonathan Rodriguez, a 25-year-old recent college graduate, has a permit to carry a concealed firearm in Maryland. But he spent eight days in jail after police stopped his car near The Wharf neighborhood in Washington on Aug. 19 and said they found his registered gun, around 20 ounces of marijuana and drug paraphernalia.

U.S. Magistrate Judge G. Michael Harvey wasn't buying the government's contention that Rodriguez is a dangerous drug dealer.

“The cases in which drug dealers register their guns are exceptionally rare,” Harvey said as he ordered Rodriguez's release. “The government's case has got some challenges.”

Police officers and unspecified “federal partners” stopped Rodriguez because he was driving a Lexus with a license plate on the back but not the front of the vehicle, prosecutors said in a court filing. Defense attorney Joseph Scrofano accused law enforcement of jumping to baseless conclusions about the contents of the car.

“We don't hold people based on assumptions,” Scrofano said. “We hold people based on evidence.”

Rodriguez, a budding architect who graduated from Morgan State University in December, doesn't have a criminal record. But he faces a charge that carries a mandatory minimum prison sentence of five years if he's convicted.

The White House says over 1,200 people have been arrested and 135 firearms have been seized since the surge started on Aug. 7. The city's police department says crime rates have plunged in the district, including a 60% decrease in carjackings, a 56% drop in robberies and a 58% reduction in violent crimes as of Wednesday compared to the same one-week period in 2024.

Over 30 people arrested during the crackdown have been charged in district court, where the most serious crimes are prosecuted. Approximately half of them are charged with assaulting officers, agents or National Guard members, according to an Associated Press review of court records. The rest are charged with illegally possessing guns, drugs or both.

The volume of cases in district court pales in comparison to the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, which led to charges against nearly 1,600 people in the same courthouse. But the riot arrests were staggered across four years and all 50 states, easing the burden on the court.

Former federal prosecutor Michael Romano, who spent more than 17 years at the Justice Department and helped supervise Capitol riot prosecutions, said he never had a grand jury refuse to return an indictment in one of his cases. He said the Trump administration's efforts to appear tough on crime may have backfired with many D.C. residents, who serve on federal grand juries.

“Sometimes when you arrest people with scant evidence and you overcharge them, the community doesn't like it and the evidence won't support it,” said Romano, who resigned from the department earlier this year. “This illustrates the danger of having a Justice Department where attorneys can't do their job and can't properly evaluate whether cases are going to be good or not.”

At least three people have been arrested on assault charges for spitting on federal agents or troops on patrol. A viral video captured a Justice Department attorney hurling a “sub-style” sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection agent. But a grand jury refused to indict him on a felony charge — an extraordinarily rare failure for prosecutors.

“Grand juries, judges, we will not simply go along with the flow,” Faruqui said.

He questioned why people have been locked up for days for relatively minor offenses that typically aren't handled in district court. Faruqui said he shared his concerns with the leadership of U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro's office and hopes they can reduce the waits for detention hearings and initial court appearances.

Earlier this week, Pirro and Faruqui verbally sparred over her office's handling of a case against a man who was arrested at a Trader Joe's supermarket last month. Police officers said they followed Torez Riley into the grocery store and found two unregistered guns inside his satchel. He was charged with being a felon in possession of firearms, but Pirro's office dropped the case a week later.

During a hearing Monday, Faruqui said he was “absolutely flabbergasted” that Riley was jailed for a week before his case was dismissed. He said it was “without a doubt the most illegal search I have ever seen in my life.”

Pirro, a former Fox News host whom Trump appointed in May to lead the nation's largest U.S. Attorney's office, responded with a statement accusing Faruqui of having “a long history of bending over backwards to release dangerous felons in possession of firearms.”

On Thursday, Harvey ordered the release of a man who was arrested on Aug. 16 after a traffic stop by members of the U.S. Park Police and U.S. Marshals Service. The magistrate pressed a prosecutor to explain why the driver, Amarian Langston, was charged with illegally possessing a handgun that officers found beside a road after he crashed the vehicle. The prosecutor, Kyle McWaters, acknowledged that nobody saw Langston toss the weapon.

Prosecutors separately charged Langston's girlfriend in D.C. Superior Court, which hears less serious cases and is handling the bulk of the surge-related arrests. McWaters said the law allows the government to charge both with illegally possessing the same gun even though it allegedly belonged to the girlfriend.

Said McWaters: “I'm not saying it's an easy hill to climb, your honor.”

Some National Guard units patrolling the nation's capital at the direction of President Donald Trump have started carrying firearms.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Since sending the National Guard to Los Angeles and Washington, President Donald Trump has openly mused about sending troops to some of the nation's most Democratic cities — including Chicago and Baltimore — claiming they are needed to crack down on crime.

The threats to expand a federal intervention have legal experts and some military officials raising concerns that Trump is considering novel ways to use National Guard troops in American cities that could set up conflicts not seen since the civil rights era.

Though most violent crime has fallen in recent years in the cities Trump has called out, the Republican president said Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker “should be calling me, and he should be saying, ‘Can you send over the troops please?' It's out of control.”

Whether Trump can repeat what he's done in LA and the nation's capital — call up the National Guard and have it assist a surge of federal law enforcement and immigration officers — is an open question and likely to become a point of contention should he press forward.

Here's a look at how Trump has used troops in U.S. cities, what the law allows and what could come next:




Trump first deployed troops to Los Angeles in early June over Gov. Gavin Newsom's objections by putting the California National Guard under federal jurisdiction, known as Title 10, to protect federal property from protests over immigration raids. 

Besides 4,000 Guard members, Trump later sent 700 active duty Marines, and California sued over the intervention. The Guard went on to help protect officers during immigration arrests.

While Trump pushed the limits of the law, the lawsuit centers on whether the president was allowed to use the Guard to closely shadow federal law enforcement and whether that runs afoul of the prohibition on using the military as law enforcement, known as the Posse Comitatus Act, said Todd Huntley, director of the National Security Law Program at the Georgetown University Law Center.

Meanwhile, the unique status of the District of Columbia National Guard — Trump is their commander in chief — means he has been able to use it for everything from armed patrols to trash cleanup without any legal issues. Because it is on state and not federal orders, legal restrictions on law enforcement don't come into effect.

“Where we have a big question mark” is whether “the governor of a state has to consent to the sending of troops to his state,” said Huntley, a retired Navy captain and judge advocate. 

The Trump administration is planning to surge officers to the nation's third-largest city for an immigration crackdown, two U.S. officials said.

The Department of Homeland Security asked Naval Station Great Lakes outside Chicago for support on immigration operations, including with facilities and logistics, the base said this week. The Illinois National Guard and the base said they had not received requests regarding a mobilization of troops to Chicago.

If Trump wants the freedom to use the National Guard as he pleases in Chicago, the easiest legal path is to invoke the Insurrection Act — a vaguely worded 1792 law that allows the president to deploy federal troops inside the U.S. to conduct law enforcement, an exception to the restrictions of the Posse Comitatus Act.

The law offers sweeping powers to the president, envisioning armed conflict within the United States.

“The orders would be given by him … and the governor of the receiving state would not have a say in whether he allows them into the state or not or allows them to conduct a mission in the state,” Huntley said.

However, Huntley calls this “the nuclear option.”

A D.C. National Guard official, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said invoking the Insurrection Act over a broad topic like crime could allow the Guard to be deployed indefinitely.

Another possibility is Trump deploying the D.C. Guard, which he commands, to another state, the official said.

If the D.C. Guard is put on federal orders — something Trump has the power to do — it could lead to some rare situations, including federalized D.C. Guardsmen sent to another state that in turn could activate its own Guard as a counter, Huntley said.

The possibility is not without precedent.

“The resolution of that could be basically what we saw in Alabama during the civil rights era. To take the ability of that state governor of using state National Guard forces away, the president could simply federalize them,” Huntley said.

In 1963, President John F. Kennedy federalized the Alabama National Guard as part of the now-famous standoff with Gov. George Wallace, who refused to step aside and allow Black students to integrate the University of Alabama. Wallace eventually relented.

In an executive order signed Monday, Trump ordered Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to create “a specialized unit” within the D.C. Guard “dedicated to ensuring public safety and order.” 

He also directed Hegseth to ensure every state's Guard is ready to assist federal and local law enforcement in “quelling civil disturbances and ensuring the public safety and order” when needed. It also calls for each to have units “reasonably available for rapid mobilization.”

The Pentagon has not given more details of what Trump's order will mean for the National Guard. A defense official confirmed that Hegseth's office was aware of the order and that they were reviewing it and its specific requirements.

All state Guards already have a “reaction force” that is aimed at responding to a wide variety of incidents with an initial force of 75-125 personnel within eight hours and a follow-on force of up to 375 personnel within 24 hours, according to a National Guard fact sheet.

And the D.C. National Guard already has a unit that is made up entirely of soldiers trained as military police.

Gov. Wes Moore (D-MD) said he would “absolutely welcome” federal support to help lower crime in Baltimore after pushing back on President Donald Trump's comments about the city's high crime rates. 

“I would absolutely welcome federal support, but I also know that federal support is going to be necessary and required,” Moore said on Fox News's the Will Cain Show on Thursday.

Moore's comments came after a back-and-forth between him and Trump regarding Baltimore's crime rate. When Trump deployed federal troops in Washington, D.C., he also highlighted crime in Baltimore. 

Moore reiterated he would not activate the Maryland National Guard and wrote a letter to Trump, inviting the president to join him for a public safety walk in September to show Baltimore's progress in lowering crime. 

“If there's anything Maryland has proven over the last two years, it's that we can achieve performance without being performative,” Moore said. “Progress requires the right tool for the right mission. Asking the patriotic citizen soldiers of our National Guard to police our cities doesn't meet that test.”

Trump responded to Moore's invitation, saying he “would much prefer that [Moore] clean up this Crime disaster before I go there for a ‘walk.'”

Baltimore ranked third in “violent crime” per capita, which is 347.3% above the national rate, according to FBI crime data released in 2024. 

TRUMP SAYS HE HAS ‘RIGHT' TO SEND NATIONAL GUARD TO FIGHT CRIME IN CITIES ‘IN DANGER'

Moore said in the Thursday Fox News interview that the only federal support he “questions” is the deployment of the National Guard. 

“We would love to have additional support for license plate readers, things that we know that can actually stop crimes as they're happening and making sure people are brought to justice,” Moore said. “And not have $30 million cut from public safety budgeting that is coming from the federal government.” 

Baltimore recorded 68 homicides this year, as of July 1. The midyear Baltimore Police Department report said this was a 22% year-over-year decrease in homicide and 19% decrease in nonfatal shootings. 

The Maryland governor also said he would love to see the federal government ban ghost guns, as well as investments in local law enforcement. 

TRUMP'S CLASHES WITH DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS SET STAGE FOR 2028 RACE

Moore said safety was one of the reasons he ran for governor. 

“When I became the governor, I said our No. 1 priority was going to be public safety,” Moore said. “While we still have very real work to do, we are also very clear that the results we have started to see in the past 2 1/2 years are deeply encouraging.”

According to a new Harvard Center for American Political Studies-Harris poll, a majority of people support Trump's actions in Washington, with 54% saying it's “justified” and “necessary.” The poll was conducted online from Aug. 20-21 among 2,025 registered voters within the United States.

As the National Weather Service scrambles to hire up to 450 people to restore deep cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency, potential applicants are being asked to explain how they would advance President Donald Trump's agenda if hired.

A posting from the weather service's parent agency seeking meteorologists asks applicants to identify one or two of Trump's executive orders “that are significant to you, and explain how you would help implement them if hired.”

It's among screening questions added to government job applications as part of a “ merit hiring plan” that Trump announced at the outset of his second term, and it's not unique to the weather service positions. But some experts said they are alarmed at the prospect that a candidate's ideology could matter for jobs in science.

“The fundamental question is, will this make forecasts any better? That's the job of the weather service,” said Rick Spinrad, who led the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which includes the weather service, under former President Joe Biden. 

“These people should be hired for their knowledge in meteorology or hydrology or information technology or physics — not civics. ... Bottom line, I'd rather have a great forecaster who's never read an EO than a policy muck who's taken one meteorology class,” he said, referring to executive orders.

Spokespeople for NOAA didn't respond to emails seeking comment.




Before Elon Musk left DOGE, it cut hundreds of NOAA forecasters and other employees soon after Trump took office. Experts warned that the vacancies could hurt forecasts and dangerous consequences for people if extreme weather warnings were slowed.

NOAA confirmed in early August that it had received approval to hire as many as 450 people for critical positions within the weather service after this spring's deep cuts.

Trump has issued numerous executive orders, and applicants could presumably choose any to endorse — or none at all, since the application says responses aren't required, only encouraged.

But Trump has consistently attacked clean energy and climate science while promoting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which emit planet-warming gases. One of his first executive orders, which he dubbed “ unleashing American energy,” directed agencies to sweep away any “undue burden” to fossil fuel development. That order also canceled a series of orders from Biden that addressed climate change.

Under Trump, NOAA has stopped tracking the cost of weather disasters worsened by climate change. His administration has also moved to shut down two NASA missions that monitor a potent greenhouse gas and plant health — data seen as helpful for measuring the impacts of climate change.

Trump's second term has been marked by accusations that he has politicized science, most recently with the ouster of the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for not being “aligned” with the president's agenda. Separately, employees of the Environmental Protection Agency, National Institutes of Health and Federal Emergency Management Agency have issued declarations of dissent with agency actions. Some EPA and FEMA employees who signed those letters were put on leave.

Another screening question asks applicants how their “commitment to the Constitution and the founding principles of the United States” inspired them to seek the job. A third asks how they would use their skills to improve government efficiency and effectiveness.

Craig McLean, a former NOAA acting chief scientist under Biden and during Trump's first term, said none of the questions are relevant to weather service positions. NOAA and the NWS are responsible for daily weather forecasts, severe storm warnings and climate monitoring, among other tasks.

“Asking a meteorologist to define how they as a new employee, are going to make the government more efficient is ludicrous,” McLean said. “I'd rather understand how well they are prepared to use the forecast tools and make a timely and accurate forecast.”

Jeff Masters, a meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections and co-founder of Weather Underground, said the questions amount to a loyalty test that will discourage many qualified applicants from applying.

“Whether or not you support the President's Executive Orders will not enable a meteorologist to make a better forecast or issue a more timely tornado warning, and should have no place on a job application for the National Weather Service,” Masters said by email.

GENEVA (AP) — Finland's Air Force, now part of NATO, still flies swastikas on a handful of unit flags — but is preparing to phase them out, largely to avoid awkwardness with its Western allies.

The history of the Finnish air force's use of the swastika, which since the 20th century has largely been associated with Nazi tyranny and hate groups, is more complex than at first appearance. It is an ancient symbol and Finland's air force began using it many years before the birth of Nazi Germany.

Change has been underway for years. A swastika logo was quietly pulled off the Air Force Command's unit emblem a few years ago. But swastikas have remained on some Finnish air force flags, raising eyebrows among NATO allies, tourists and other foreigners who spot them at military events.

“We could have continued with this flag, but sometimes awkward situations can arise with foreign visitors. It may be wise to live with the times, Col. Tomi Böhm, the new head of Karelia Air Wing air defense force, was quoted as saying in a report Thursday by the public broadcaster YLE.




The Defense Forces, in an email to The Associated Press on Friday, said a plan to renew the air force unit flags was launched in 2023, the year Finland joined NATO, but said it was not linked to joining the alliance. The aim, it said, was “to update the symbolism and emblems of the flags to better reflect the current identity of the Air Force.”

It referred to an article in daily Helsingin Sanomat on Friday, which said the reason for the removal was a perception that the swastika has been an “embarrassing symbol in international contexts.”

Finland, which shares a long border with Russia, joined NATO in April 2023 over concerns related to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Teivo Teivanen, a professor of world politics at the University of Helsinki, said the flags in question were introduced in the 1950s and today are flown by four Air Force units. 

The Air Force and the Finnish public generally had for years insisted the swastikas used in Finland's air force “have nothing to do with the Nazi swastika,” said Teivanen, who this month had a book published whose Finnish title translates as “History of the Swastika.” 

But now, following Finland's integration with NATO, policymakers have decided “there's now a need to get more integrated with the forces of countries like Germany, the Netherlands, and France — countries where the swastika is clearly a negative symbol,” he said. 

Teivanen said that in 2021, German air force units bowed out of a final ceremony following exercises at a military base in Finland's Lapland region after learning that the Finnish swastikas would be on display.

Finland's air force adopted the swastika emblem in 1918 soon after country gained its independence after more than a century of Imperial Russian rule. 

Count Eric von Rosen of neighboring Sweden donated Finland's first military plane in 1918, which bore his personal symbol, the swastika.

The Finnish air force soon after adopted a blue swastika on a white background as the national insignia on all its planes from 1918 to 1945. After the war, the imagery remained for decades on some Air Force unit flags and decorations as well as on the insignia of the Air Force Academy.

But that doesn't mean there is no Nazi connection at all.

Von Rosen, an aristocratic explorer and ethnographer, was the brother-in-law of Hermann Goering, a decorated World War I German fighter pilot who became an early Nazi Party member. Goering went on to lead Germany's Luftwaffe during World War II under Hitler.

The Finnish air force stressed that its use of the symbol had no connection to Nazi Germany, although Finland entered into a reluctant alliance with the Third Reich during World War II.

New flags — featuring an eagle — will be published when the work has been completed and the flags are introduced into use for events like parades and local ceremonies, the Defense Forces said, without saying when that would happen.

“The traditional Von Rosen swastika emblem, in use since 1918, has already been removed from most other Air Force emblems during earlier reforms, so its removal from the unit flags is a logical continuation of this work,” the emailed statement said.

Christina Haack, who is starring alongside her ex-husband Tarek El Moussa and his wife Heather Rae El Moussa in "The Flip Off," explained why she believes that her estranged husband Josh Hall's exit from the series was for the best.

Christina Haack's highly publicized third marriage has come to a close — and her ex‑husband, Josh Hall, isn't holding back his thoughts on the matter.

Following the finalization of their divorce earlier this week, Hall took to Instagram with a scathing message aimed at the HGTV star.

"Excited to spend Labor Day weekend in the real reality," Hall captioned a photo of himself wearing a cowboy hat and petting a saddled horse.

"Finally, legally divorced and a free man," he continued. "I've always worked hard, kept what's mine, and declined hand outs, and I'm keeping it that way. Lesson learned: don't marry someone who needs constant public validation and will use your personal drama for attention."

A source close to Hall told Fox News Digital, "This was one of the most fair divorces in reality TV history. Josh agreed to split everything he and Christina earned together, and they each walked away from the divorce with everything that they had made prior to the marriage."

The source claimed that Hall's assets – including his car collection – were independently acquired. 

"Josh bought each and every one of those cars on his own. Hence, he kept them," the insider confirmed. 

The source added that Hall voluntarily waived spousal support, even though the couple had no prenuptial agreement in place, remarking, "Given there was no prenup, Christina should send Josh a thank you."

Since the divorce is finalized, Hall is focused on leaving the drama behind him.

"This era of tabloid theatrics is over for Josh. He couldn't be happier," the source concluded, noting that he's ready to move on — permanently. 

"Josh is happy to never have to speak to her again."

A California judge officially signed off on the divorce on Aug. 26, marking the end of the contentious union.

Prior to filing for divorce, Haack and Hall filmed footage for the HGTV show "The Flip Off" alongside her first ex-husband, Tarek El Moussa, and his second wife, Heather Rae. However, Hall only appeared in the premiere episode of the show due to his split from Haack.

During a February episode of "The Flip Off," Haack shared an update on their settlement negotiations as she claimed that Hall had continued to make her "financial offers" and "wants to retire off me."

"Honestly, if I would've really understood the repercussions of all of this, I would've gotten a prenup, or I would've never married him," she said, per People.

In July, Haack and Hall both filed their own divorce petitions, each citing irreconcilable differences as the reason for the dissolution of their marriage. Hall requested spousal support and asked the court to terminate Haack's ability to receive spousal support from him.

Meanwhile, Haack requested the court terminate both of their ability to be awarded spousal support. In a court filing, she stated that Hall "should not need" spousal support because he has his own source of income.

Haack and Hall began dating in March 2021 and secretly married in October of that year. The former couple later had a formal ceremony in Hawaii.

The pair did not share any children together.

President Donald Trump is facing some backlash from on his plan to allow 600,000 student visas for Chinese nationals to be issued, including Hudson Institute senior fellow Michael Sobolik.

A China expert warns that President Donald Trump's Chinese student visa push amid trade talks between the United States and China could exacerbate the growing CCP "influence" in American universities.

China policy expert Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, explains where things stand right now, as several conservatives sounded the alarm on how the push could enable the Chinese Communist Party's influence in the U.S.

Sobolik explained that Chinese students in the United States can become a major national security liability, adding that the CCP has taken advantage of Chinese nationals to "advance malign influence operations."

"They do this by re-appropriating basic and applied research in American universities, taking it over to China, and stealing American innovations, essentially," he said. "And they also will conduct espionage. They will silence Chinese students on American campuses and force them to either advance the CCP propaganda line or silence them. And that's just unacceptable."

Sobolik continued by pointing out the history of the trade agreements between Trump and Xi Jinping.

"I think it's partially a function of the fact that [Trump's] trying to get to a trade deal with Xi Jinping and he wants to smooth that road, make sure there aren't any bumps along the way, much like he did in his first term when he was trying to get his phase one trade agreement with China negotiated," he said.

President Donald Trump said in a Tuesday cabinet meeting that the "college system would go to hell very quickly" if the Chinese student visa policy were significantly altered.

"And it wouldn't be the top colleges, so it'd be colleges that struggle on the bottom. And you take out 300,000 or 600,000 students out of the system," Trump said.

"I like having, and I told this to President Xi that we're honored to have their students here. Now, with that, we check in with careful and we see who's there," the president continued.

"President Trump isn't proposing an increase in student visas for Chinese students. The 600K references two years worth of visas," a White House official told Fox News on Thursday. "It's simply a continuation of existing policy."

Sobolik said universities will ultimately go along with the "repressive tactics of China," as he says students are willing to attend American institutions for their full price.

"It's not just STEM programs and security risks. It is not just what China's government is doing on these campuses. It's how universities are complicit in it because they need that money. It's all about the bottom line for them, and American values suffer in the process," Sobolik added.

A debate over U.S. intervention against drug cartels spiraled out of control as Alejandro "Alito" Moreno and Gerardo Fernández Noroña clashed in a shocking on-camera brawl. (Senado de la Republica)

A Mexican Senate session descended into chaos on Wednesday when two senior politicians traded blows following a heated debate over the U.S.' involvement in the fight against drug cartels.

Video captured the explosive moment when Alejandro "Alito" Moreno, head of the opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), and Gerardo Fernández Noroña, the Senate president of the ruling Morena Party, violently shoved one another after lawmakers finished singing the national anthem to close the day's session. 

The clash erupted after a tense debate, during which the Morena Party and its allies reportedly accused PRI and the conservative National Action Party lawmakers of calling for U.S. military intervention in Mexico, a claim the opposing parties denied, according to the New York Post. 

The issue has grown especially contentious following reports that President Donald Trump authorized U.S. military force against Latin American drug cartels designated as terrorist groups.

Moreno, who claimed his party was denied the floor, was seen approaching Fernández Noroña, reportedly saying, "I'm asking you to let me speak," while clutching the Senate president by the arm.  

"Don't touch me!" Fernández Noroña reportedly yelled back, as the two politicians violently shoved each other as colleagues scrambled to intervene. 

In the scuffle, Moreno also clashed with one of Fernández Noroña's collaborators, cameraman Emiliano González González, who was knocked to the floor. Another lawmaker was seen yanking the Senate president's suit jacket and taking a swing at him as he tried to escape the mayhem.

Fernández Noroña accused Moreno of threatening to kill him, according to local reports.

"He hit me and told me ‘I'm going to break your mother, I'm going to kill you,'" Fernández Noroña said in a press conference, according to El Pais.

Moreno countered that the ruling party was silencing opposition voices and insisted Fernández Noroña had instigated the fight.

"Let it be clear: the first physical aggression came from Fernández Noroña," Moreno said in a post on X Wednesday. "There was an approved agenda. Minutes before reaching the corresponding point, Morena changed it to their convenience to silence us and prevent the opposition from speaking out. Their obligation was to give me the floor, and they didn't do it."

Fernández Noroña is also calling an emergency session Friday to propose expelling Moreno and the three other PRI lawmakers as a result of the scuffle, the New York Post reported.

Fernández Noroña and Alejandro Moreno did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

NEW YORK (AP) — The CDC is in chaos and some groups are starting to step in and take over work the agency was doing.

The moves come in response to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s extensive — and some say illegal — restructuring and downsizing of the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

Many public health veterans see an agency wracked by a leadership crisis, staff cuts, budget cuts and unprecedented levels of political meddling. The concern hit a crescendo when the White House moved to oust the agency's director and some top CDC leaders resigned in protest.

But even before CDC Director Susan Monarez was fired, some organizations started pursuing new ways to do jobs formerly handled by the CDC.

Some are working to preserve longstanding vaccination recommendations. Some are trying to release information that CDC has stopped providing. Others aim to maintain health data collections at risk of being lost.

But these outside efforts don't have the federal funding, resources, legal mechanisms or platform that have been the underpinning of the nation's public health system. As noble as they are, these patchwork efforts probably won't cut it, some experts say.

“There may be some workarounds,” said Dr. Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health. “But I'm not sure it's fair or appropriate that people feel like they have to turn to private groups instead of the government.” 




For decades, the CDC has set the nation's standards on vaccines — which ones are recommended and who should get them. 

The recommendations were guidance, not law. But they were automatically adopted by doctors, school systems, health insurers and others.

They were the result of a lengthy data review process involving a panel of outside experts, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

But in May, Kennedy — a longtime leader in the anti-vaccine movement — announced COVID-19 vaccines would no longer be recommended for healthy children and pregnant women. He made the decision without input from the ACIP. 

In June, he abruptly dismissed the entire panel, accusing them of being too closely aligned with manufacturers. He replaced them with a handpicked group that included several vaccine skeptics, and then shut the door to several doctors groups that had long helped form ACIP recommendations.

It's not clear what other changes are in store for ACIP, but a number of medical groups say Kennedy can't be counted on to make decisions based on robust medical evidence. 

The moves sparked a group of public health researchers and others to form the Vaccine Integrity Project, based at the University of Minnesota, which is aims to become the kind of compiler and reporter of medical evidence that the CDC and ACIP have been in the past.

In mid-August, the group held an ACIP-like Zoom meeting, in which subject-matter experts presented lengthy reviews of recent research about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19, flu and RSV vaccines for children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.

It also featured a four-person panel of experts, including the editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine. Like ACIP members, they asked presenters questions about their analyses. 

Presenters made clear that they had to base their presentations on what had appeared in medical journals and was publicly available; they weren't privy to unpublished surveillance and safety data that CDC collects.

The group is not making vaccination recommendations itself. But it is working with doctors organizations that are. One is the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which has said pregnant women should continue to get COVID-19 shots — counter to what Kennedy announced. Another is the American Academy of Pediatrics continuing to recommend them for children ages 6 months to 2 years.

But as medical societies split from CDC, it's not yet clear which recommendations insurers will heed when making coverage decisions. And there remain a number of other questions, such as: What will happen in states that have vaccination policies tied to ACIP recommendations?

In Massachusetts, Democratic Gov. Maura Healey included language in a $2.45 billion supplemental budget bill that gives the health department authority to set its own recommendations and requirements if the federal government “fails to maintain a robust schedule of vaccine recommendations.”

Some other efforts now underway:

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the CDC teamed up with researchers at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School on www.vaccines.gov. The website told about newly developed vaccines recommended to protect against the coronavirus and served as a search engine to help people find nearby pharmacies that had the shots in stock.

But the site gradually dropped information about vaccines and why they were recommended, and this year became a stripped-down version that simply said: “Find a pharmacy near you” and a box to type in your zip code. When the government's contract with Boston Children's Hospital ended in late July, the site stopped working altogether.

Researchers at Boston Children's Hospital this month restarted a version of the site that existed before the pandemic, www.vaccinefinder.org. 

“We're turning back to what it was,” said John Brownstein of Boston Children's, who founded the site. “Obviously, as a (government) site it carries more weight. But if that isn't in the cards, we're very happy to carry the torch.”

Last month, the Association for Dental Safety launched a new institute for dental safety that was designed to pick up some of the work done by the CDC's Division of Oral Health, which was eliminated in the spring. The new institute is first focused on updating infection controls guidelines for dental offices, which the CDC last updated in 2003.

“Without a doubt, ADS is the best choice to continue oversight of dental infection prevention and control guidelines, ensuring recommendations are current, scientifically sound, translated into lay terms and disseminated to those who need them on a daily basis,” said Nicole Johnson, former associate director in the CDC's Division of Oral Health, in a press statement.

The CDC's Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, which annually surveys women across the country, lost its entire staff — about 20 people — in layoffs this year. It was the most comprehensive collection of data on the health behaviors and outcomes before, during and after childbirth. Researchers have been using its data to investigate the nation's maternal mortality problem.

Some states that have the money and motivation might decide to run similar surveys, just within their borders. California runs its own, PRAMS-like survey. 

But “if states are doing their own thing, then we don't have national, comparable data across jurisdictions and across time,” meaning its not possible to see where problems are most severe and which policies to reduce maternal deaths are working, said Jamie Daw, a Columbia University health policy researcher focused on pregnancy. 

Kennedy recently fired about 100 CDC staffers who provided training, education, and advice to state and local violence prevention programs, and evaluate how well they were working. 

“What's the point in knowing the about the rates of violence if you're not going to do anything about it?” said Sarah DeGue, one of the laid-off CDC researchers.

But existing programs still need technical guidance and expertise. In May, DeGue founded Violence Prevention Solutions, a consulting firm, to help community organizations develop and evaluate programs. 

“It's us trying to rebuild what we had somewhere else, in a different way, so that all the knowledge and experience and resources that we had can still be available,” she said.

Chicago resident Cata Truss joins ‘Fox & Friends' to discuss President Donald Trump's proposal to send the National Guard to help curb crime in Chicago, and the reaction from local leaders.

Senate Republicans are behind President Donald Trump's desire to send the National Guard to Democrat-led cities and states with high crime rates, and some are even open to sending troops to blue cities in their own states to clean up the streets.

"Blue cities like Memphis need all the help they can get to combat violent crime," Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., told Fox News Digital in a statement.

Trump's desire to replicate his crime-fighting efforts in Washington, D.C., where he federalized the local police and sent in the National Guard to patrol the streets and Metro stations, led him to signal plans to send troops to Chicago and Baltimore, two blue cities in blue states with high rates of crime.

The likely move has riled up Democratic senators from Illinois and Maryland, who accused the president of playing "political theater" in D.C. and making an attempt to "play dictator" with the U.S. military.

Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., charged that Trump's National Guard threat was "nothing more than a power grab to distract from his disastrous policies," while Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., told Fox News Digital in a statement, "Trump's threats to invade our cities are not the answer – and are sad attempts to distract from his failures to actually put forward solutions to these and other issues facing our communities, like the rising cost of living."

"Instead of politicizing our great City of Baltimore, which Trump knows nothing about, he should just button it up while federal, state, and local law enforcement do their important work," he said.

Republicans, however, have largely backed Trump's decision to bring in the National Guard to the district and have considered extending his federalization of the Metropolitan Police Department — or allowing him to bypass Congress altogether to maintain his grip on the local police — after the 30-day window expires.

Some welcome the idea of troops coming to crack down on crime in their cities with open arms.

Memphis, for example, is ruby-red Tennessee's largest city and has one of the highest violent crime rates in the country. Similar to Baltimore and Chicago, it is led by a Democratic mayor. Blackburn told Fox News Digital that she'd welcome Trump to send troops to the city.

"I support the Trump administration's efforts to restore law and order in lawless cities across America, and I'll continue to work with the president, Attorney General [Pam] Bondi, and FBI Director [Kash] Patel to do whatever it takes to make cities like Memphis safe again," she said.

And in St. Louis, another major city that consistently cracks the top 10 of violent and overall crime data pools, Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., recently worked with Patel to secure funding for a surge of FBI agents dubbed as "one of the largest per capita infusions of full-time agents and intel personnel in the nation."

Schmitt signaled an openness to troops coming to St. Louis and charged that "for too long, local leaders in blue cities have been more focused on the rights of criminals than victims, and it's allowed crime to run rampant."

"American families want and deserve to feel safe in their communities, and I'm glad to see President Trump doing what it takes to enforce the rule of law and increase public safety," Schmitt said in a statement to Fox News Digital. "His efforts in D.C. have been hugely successful, and I have no doubt other cities could benefit from increased law enforcement presence."

Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte said Thursday that he filed a second criminal referral to the Department of Justice against Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, whom President Donald Trump is attempting to fire.

Pulte said the new referral relates to a third mortgage at her Cambridge, Massachusetts, property. In government ethics filings, he has alleged misrepresentations about that condominium and two other homes in Michigan and Georgia, which she listed as her “primary residence” when she obtained mortgages in 2021 during her time as a Fed governor.

In the latest complaint, Pulte alleged that Cook took out a mortgage on the Massachusetts condo for $361,000, which she said was a second home, and claimed that less than a year later, Cook said she had earned between $15,000 and $50,000 in rental income and listed it as an investment property.

“Representing the property as a second home may have allowed Cook to secure a lower ‘Second Home' mortgage down payment and rates, as investment properties typically carry higher down payments and higher rates due to increased risk,” Pulte wrote in the complaint.

Pulte was appointed to lead the FHFA by Trump earlier this year and has worked on Trump's behalf in his anger with the Fed and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.

Trump moved to fire Cook earlier this week after Pulte's first criminal referral. The move teed up a contentious legal fight. 

Cook filed a lawsuit in federal court on Thursday that claimed Trump's move is “illegal” and is an effort to control the central bank. Her lawyers have categorized the mortgage dispute in Pulte's first criminal referral as an unintentional “clerical error.”

IT IS UNCLEAR IF FEDERAL RESERVE GOVERNOR LISA COOK SHOWED UP TO WORK AFTER TRUMP FIRING

A judge is expected to hear the case Friday morning on Cook's push for a restraining order as she looks to remain in her role.

For months, Trump has unsuccessfully demanded that the Fed cut interest rates. Before his attempt to oust Cook, Trump had seriously considered firing Powell.

JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Protests erupted for a fifth day Friday in multiple cities and tensions soared across Indonesia, a day after a delivery rider was allegedly run over by a police armored vehicle during clashes between riot police and students protesting  lawmakers' allowances.

Protesters marched to the headquarters of the police mobile brigade in the capital Jakarta on Friday, and some attempted to storm the compound. Police used water canons and fired rounds of tear gas to push back the demonstrators, who hurled bottles, rocks and flares at them.

One group of rioters set fire to a five-story building near the police compound in Kwitang neighborhood of central Jakarta, causing several people to be trapped inside. Some students halted their protests to help soldiers and residents rescue those trapped.

Other protesters destroyed traffic signs and other infrastructure, causing traffic to come to a standstill in the area. Demonstrators also attacked police trucks and patrol cars and damaged several government offices in the unrest that soon led crowds to looting and burning vehicles.

Shops and malls near the protest sites and Glodok Chinatown in Jakarta shuttered early over safety concerns as residents were still haunted by the May 1998 riots when racial violence against Chinese Indonesians broke out in Indonesia during violent protests that led to the fall of the Suharto dictatorship.

Amid the 1998 violence, over 1,000 died and thousands more were bankrupted or fled the country.

Clashes between rock-throwing demonstrators and riot police also broke out in other cities across the country, including Surabaya, Solo, Yogyakarta, Medan, Makassar, Manado, Bandung and Manokwari in the easternmost Papua region.




Ride-hailing drivers in the cities of Malang, Bengkulu and Pekanbaru staged a solidarity protest over 21-year-old delivery driver Affan Kurniawan's death.

As night fell, the clashes continued and quickly rippled in Jakarta and beyond, with tear gas lingering in the air and protesters refusing to disperse.

In Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city, protesters stormed the governor's office compound after destroying fences and torching vehicles. Security forces fired tear gas and used water cannons, but demonstrators fought back with fireworks and wooden clubs.

Protesters in Bandung and Makassar burned down local parliament buildings and demonstrators in the ancient royal cities of Yogyakarta and Solo called for sweeping police reform and asset seizure from corrupt officials. They set tires ablaze and damaged the regional parliament building.

The unrest came after a video on social media apparently showing the death of the motorcycle taxi driver during Thursday's clashes shocked the nation and spurred an outcry against the security forces.

Kurniawan was reportedly completing a food delivery service order when he was caught in the clash following days of violent demonstrations. 

Witnesses told local television that the armored car from the National Police's Mobile Brigade unit suddenly sped through the crowd of demonstrators and hit Kurniawan, causing him to fall. Instead of stopping, the car ran over him.

Thousands of motorcycle riders, along with rights activists and politicians attended Kurniawan's burial on Friday. They filled a major traffic circle in the heart of the city and sprawled into its main thoroughfares.

President Prabowo Subianto appealed for calm and expressed condolences in a televised speech.

“I am deeply concerned and deeply saddened by this incident,” Subianto said. “I was shocked and disappointed by the officers' excessive actions.”

The former general said he has been closely monitoring developments surrounding the protests, and said he has ordered a thorough investigation. He called on people “to remain vigilant against elements that constantly stir up unrest and seek chaos.”

“In a situation like this, I urge all citizens to remain calm and trust in the government I lead, which will do what's best for the people,” Subianto said.

Authorities confirmed that seven members of the police motor brigade who were linked to the incident have been detained and questioned, though the driver of the armored vehicle has not yet been identified.

As new protests broke out in cities across the southeast Asian country late Friday, Subianto, accompanied by several members of his Cabinet, visited the modest house of Kurniawan's parents in central Jakarta. He said the government would ensure financial support for the victim's family. 

Nationwide protests began Monday after reports revealed that all 580 lawmakers received a monthly housing allowance of 50 million rupiah ($3,075) in addition to their salaries. The allowance, introduced last year, is almost 10 times the Jakarta minimum wage.

Critics argue the new allowance is not only excessive but also insensitive at a time when most people are grappling with soaring living costs and taxes and rising unemployment.

﻿A very Future Perfect newsletter mailbag.

For the last few years, we've been asking Future Perfect newsletter readers what their biggest questions are. And while we usually answer privately, we figured we'd try something new: a reader mailbag!

This week, we've answered questions from three readers on classic FP issues: artificial intelligence, animal welfare coverage, and, of course, altruistic kidney donations. We'd like to do more of these, so if your question wasn't featured — or privately answered — please stay in touch for a chance to be included in the future.

Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

We're also kicking off the process for our annual Future Perfect list of changemakers. We're looking for experts, humanitarians, activists, movers, and shakers in global health, broadly speaking.

By which methods can one ascertain that whatever is produced by AI is exact and truthful?

For any question you're considering asking an AI model, the first thing you need to do is think about its epistemic nature: Is the answer knowable in an objective way? Or is it subjective?

The best use case is a situation where it's hard for you to come up with the answer, but once you get an answer from the AI, you can easily check to see if it's correct. I find chatbots particularly helpful for semantic search — that is, cases where I say, “There's some psychology theory or idea in philosophy that basically says XYZ, but I can't remember what it's called or who said it, help!” The chatbot will give its best guess, and then I can just fact-check that.

Same with other empirical facts that are verifiable through observation or data — anything from “What's the boiling temperature for water?” to “Is it true that humans share 98.8 percent of their DNA with chimpanzees?” While you can easily verify the first by yourself through observation, you'll need to rely on experts' data for the second. In that case, you need to feel confident that what's produced by your fellow humans is exact and truthful. We've developed tools that increase our confidence, like the scientific method, so if you're consulting scientific experts, you can at least have some degree of confidence that they're reporting observable and repeatable facts.

Then there are domains that are inherently subjective. If you've got the type of question for which there is no One True Answer, you'll want to be more hesitant about using AI. I think ethical dilemmas fall into this category; no matter how much OpenAI tries to create a “universal verifier,” AI will always be limited in its ability to advise you on how to handle an ethical dilemma, because there's no One True Ethics. So, you might see what thoughts an AI model provokes in you, but don't trust it as giving you the final answer, especially if what it's saying seems off to you. In other words, you can use it as a thought partner, but don't treat it like an oracle.

— Sigal Samuel, senior reporter 

Ok, after more than five years as a vegan and 73 years on the planet, I want to know why the great majority of journalists consistently abandon everything they learned about objectivity when it comes to a multitude of issues with the monster industry known as “animal agriculture?” And I want to know how to combat that bias effectively.

It is a huge blind spot for most of them. My best guess is the conditioning is so strong. It starts as a toddler, is reinforced by the parental relationship, expands to extended family, friends, reinforced again by all types of advertising media, entertainment, etc. Then they go to journalism school and are taught by instructors who also have this blind spot.

So later a reporter will go to a “chicken farm” and empathize with them when they tell their story about losing thousands of birds to avian flu — their sense of loss is not about the birds; it's about the money. The reporter presents the story without questioning the basics. Things like “where are all the male birds?” [and] “how is it possible for anyone to think that 35,000 birds could be forced to live together in a building without reasonable access to the outdoors?” and “why does it smell so bad?” and “why do you have permission to confine animals without their permission?”

I think the reason is pretty simple: Journalists are people with their own biases, just like everyone else. That's evident in how little coverage factory farming receives in the first place — it involves the abuse of billions of animals and hundreds of thousands of workers, and is a leading cause of many of our environmental problems, yet only a handful of US journalists write about it full-time (including yours truly). Most news outlets and editors don't take factory farming seriously, which is why I'm proud to work at Vox, where we do.

That's the most fundamental problem. But secondarily, while there is plenty of fantastic coverage of factory farming, more often than not, I find I'm disappointed with a lot of it, too. I see a few recurring issues:

I've written one story about how the media could cover these issues better, and I hope to keep covering that in the future.

— Kenny Torrella, senior reporter

Stories like Dylan Matthews's years ago led me to investigate donating a kidney to a stranger. I asked my doctor about it, and surprisingly, instead of encouraging me to save a life, he tried to talk me out of it. 

He told me that it is illegal to donate a kidney to a stranger! I live in Hong Kong, and maybe the reason for prohibiting even the donation of a kidney to a stranger is the fear that people would secretly accept payment from the kidney recipient. But I don't know why. Anyway, I thought about donating while on a vacation in the US, but it would require too much time, so I gave up. 

Unfortunately, my second kidney will probably die with me in old age, and someone with kidney failure will needlessly die. Anyway, maybe another story idea would be about paying kidney providers in countries other than the US?

Most people aren't as generous as you!

In the US, only a sliver of living donations go to strangers. Meanwhile, over 100,000 people sit on kidney waitlists. And, as you indicate, the need for kidneys is a global problem, too.

Many places only allow donations to relatives or known recipients (or require tough ethics reviews for unrelated donors), while a minority — like the US, UK, Canada, and Australia — offer a formal pathway for anonymous “good Samaritan” donors. In Hong Kong, where you're based, you can donate to a family member easily, but unrelated donations need official approval, and there's no standard program for that. (That's probably why you were discouraged.)

This patchwork exists for a reason.

In the 1990s and 2000s, there was a serious trafficking and transplant tourism problem. In 2007, the WHO estimated that about 5–10 percent of kidney transplants involved trafficking, and countries like the Philippines and Pakistan became hubs for foreign patients buying organs from desperate locals.Transplant experts met in Istanbul in 2008 and wrote what became the worldwide rulebook. The Istanbul Declaration pushed countries to crack down on coercive sales of organs. Every country had its own laws, but began incorporating the declaration's recommendations. As a result, transplant tourism dropped sharply in Israel and the Philippines once new rules kicked in, and tighter oversight became the norm across Europe.

But, in its efforts to shut down trafficking, the declaration argued that compensating donors at all “leads inexorably to inequity and injustice.” There was little empirical data to back that claim, but because it came from a major international statement it hardened into gospel: organ donation must be “financially neutral.”

But neutrality isn't actually neutral in practice. Living donors lose wages, take time off work, take medical risk, and sometimes even face higher insurance premiums after donating. We don't call that exploitation — but it is a penalty for doing the right thing.

And it's inconsistent with how we treat other socially valuable, risky, or unpleasant work. We pay people to do jury duty. We pay clinical trial participants. In many places, we even pay plasma donors.

There is one striking exception: Iran.

It's the only country with a regulated system that pays kidney donors. Iran established this system in 1988, and today performs about 2,500-2,700 kidney transplants annually, and it claims to have essentially eliminated its waiting list. It's a proof-of-concept that incentives can be structured.

The US debate is inching in that direction. Congress's End Kidney Deaths Act would offer a federal tax credit to people who donate a kidney to a stranger. Donors would receive a $10,000 tax credit annually for five years, so not quite direct payment, but certainly a help. The act, which has not been voted on yet, acknowledges that donation involves real costs: time off work, medical risks, recovery time.The path forward globally isn't throwing out Istanbul's anti-trafficking work, but to build on it with smart incentives and guardrails so people can donate altruistically if they want to. That means actually testing new approaches, but doing it carefully. Give donors independent advocates, make sure there's time to think it over, and guarantee lifelong follow-up care.

In the meantime, you might not be able to easily donate your kidney to a stranger right now in Hong Kong, but the needle is moving in the right direction.

Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine and author of "My Mother and I," says Prince Harry won't be sharing more secrets as he seeks to extend an olive branch to the royal family.

Prince Harry is refusing to give any more explosive tell-alls in hopes of reconciling with his father.

The claim was made by Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, who recently wrote a new book about King Charles' relationship with the late queen, titled "My Mother and I."

"I can't see Harry giving loads and loads of television interviews or writing another book," Seward told Fox News Digital. "I think his direction will concentrate on as much charity work as he can find that interests him, or he feels that he can really help with… Hopefully, Harry will just rebuild his life."

"The future for Harry is a difficult one," Seward admitted. "I'm not sure what the future holds for Harry. I'm sure Harry's not sure what the future holds for Harry. But he's going to concentrate on his charity work, which isn't a huge amount of work at the moment. But [in 2027] he has the Invictus Games in the U.K."

"He very much hopes that his father will attend," Seward continued. "And I think his father will probably attend because his father is head of the armed forces as monarch. People in the Invictus Games were once in the armed forces or are still in the armed forces with their disabilities. It's very important, and it's Harry's big achievement. I think that his father will attend."

The Duke of Sussex has been estranged from his family since he and his wife, Meghan Markle, quit royal duties in 2020 and moved to California. The couple cited the unbearable intrusions of the British press and a lack of support from the palace as their reasons for stepping back.

Since then, the couple has aired their grievances in interviews and documentaries. Harry's 2023 memoir "Spare," which highlights private and embarrassing details about the House of Windsor, worsened his relationship with the royals.

In an interview with the BBC in May, the 40-year-old said that King Charles, who was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in 2024, won't speak to him. Royal experts previously claimed to Fox News Digital that Harry's relationship with his brother, Prince William, is nonexistent.

"I would love reconciliation with my family," Harry told the BBC. "There's no point in continuing to fight anymore."

"Both Harry and Meghan have alluded to the fact that they have enough royal family content to bring out more material," British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard pointed out to Fox News Digital.

"Obviously, it would bring in the big bucks, but would do nothing for their reputation, which has taken a nosedive in recent years. The court of public opinion would also be outraged. There would be zero chance of building trust with the royal family, let alone small steps towards a private relationship with his father."

In July, the U.K.'s Daily Mail reported that the father of two had quietly extended an olive branch to the royals by offering to share his official schedule of engagements. 

According to the outlet, this was a bid to ease tensions between him and the king, 76. Earlier that month, the outlet also reported that Harry's aides had a private meeting with the king's communications secretary in London. Representatives for Buckingham Palace and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment at the time.

"Prince Harry wears his heart on his sleeve," said Chard. "Sources have stated that he seems bereft, lonely and lacking direction… It's a big shame that he cannot rekindle a private relationship with his father or spark peace talks behind closed doors. However, at this point, it's understandable why the royal family will not touch him with a barge pole."

British royals expert Hilary Fordwich believes that Harry is immersing himself in charity work now more than ever because he's hit "rock bottom."

"This is a move more out of necessity and hope for reconciliation, but how is the family ever to trust him or his motives?" she argued. "There are such deep-seated grievances from all his sordid revelations, one doubts they can ever be overcome."

"Prince Harry has hit rock bottom... This is a move more out of necessity and hope for reconciliation, but how is the family ever to trust him or his motives? There are such deep-seated grievances from all his sordid revelations, one doubts they can ever be overcome."

"The only smidgen of a chance of any sort of repair of their former relationship is some sort of discreet reconciliation that would be built on many years of trust-building steps. Harry knows it will take years, hence his lamenting to the BBC that he ‘doesn't know' how many years his father has to live. That was a clear indication he felt the clock ticking. He knows Prince William is way less open to any sort of dialogue."

But not everyone is convinced that Harry is done spilling secrets.

"Maybe Prince Harry has pressed pause for now out of respect for his father's cancer battle, but I do not believe this will last," royal expert Kinsey Schofield of YouTube's "Kinsey Schofield Unfiltered" claimed to Fox News Digital.

"Unlike most people, there is monetary value in Prince Harry's grievances," she said. "Millions can be made from his family drama. Oh, to be so lucky. And complaining has been incredibly lucrative for him. He even admitted to Oprah Winfrey in 2021 that he signed deals with Netflix and Spotify to support his family in the United States. In other words, it may not matter what he ultimately wants. Financial necessity could push him back into the spotlight."

"I have heard that Harry prefers his charity work to podcasting and book projects because that is where his strengths lie," Schofield shared. "I also think he is motivated by a desire to reclaim some of the popularity he once enjoyed as a working member of the royal family. But I am not convinced that the BBC interview will be the last time we hear Prince Harry airing his frustrations about the royal family."

Schofield also believes the royals aren't ready to trust Harry again – if ever.

While Prince Harry focuses on charity work, Meghan Markle is building her business empire in California. New episodes of her Netflix lifestyle series, "With Love, Meghan," became available for streaming on Aug. 26. (Netflix)

"It's too little too late," she shared. "Harry opens ‘Spare' by revealing that King Charles begged him and his brother not to ‘make my final years a misery.' I find this request so much more heartbreaking now that we know of the king's cancer. The Oprah Winfrey interview, ‘Spare,' the Netflix series – it's too much hurt."

"Harry will raise his children in the United States. Strangers to their cousins. King Charles just wants peace, but I believe Prince William is checked out. He wants to protect his family and the future of the monarchy. He has unique plans for his reign. He [wants to] be a good king, and Harry is a liability."

But royal expert Ian Pelham Turner pointed out that if Harry really wanted to bare all, he could at any point.

"I would love reconciliation with my family. There's no point in continuing to fight anymore," Prince Harry told the BBC in May. (Karwai Tang/WireImage/Getty Images)

"Harry is well aware of other damaging skeletons in the closet," he said. "And the royal family is surely aware he knows them and could use them against the royal household if he wished to.

"But in reality, I feel that Harry wishes peace for everyone. He would prefer a meeting of minds where compromise is created. Perhaps a peace bridge could be built if Netflix goes ahead with a docuseries on Princess Diana, where Harry and William could come together and participate."

"Harry's driving force is his sense of service," said Chard. "His happy place is the military. However, he has regrettably discovered that throwing himself into charity work without the protection of the royal fold can be a struggle and certainly does not bring in the big bucks. Harry and Netflix know what will bring in the big bucks, and that is another tell-all."

﻿The metaverse didn't stick. Can “superintelligence”?

Companies in the AI race are barreling toward a new goalpost: so-called superintelligence, or an AI model that can surpass human intelligence.

The terminology here can get a bit dizzying. Top AI companies had already been trying to build what's long been called “artificial general intelligence” (AGI), or AI that they claim will be as smart as humans. Depending on who you talk to, superintelligence might just be a flashy marketing term meant to draw even more venture capital — or it might be the obvious next step in the development of AI models that some believe are already as intelligent as humans.

Meta, in particular, has branded its AI department around the goal of superintelligence through its new “Superintelligence Labs.” Over the past few months, Mark Zuckerberg has escalated the industry's talent war, reportedly offering pay packages of up to $1 billion dollars to recruit Silicon Valley's top AI engineers.

Today, Explained co-host Sean Rameswaram recently spoke with Riley Griffin, tech reporter at Bloomberg, about why Meta is gunning so hard for top AI talent right now and what the company hopes to build with these top technologists.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full episode, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

How new is Meta's new superintelligence lab? What is it, and what are they trying to do with it?

The superintelligence lab is incredibly new, and the story of Meta's superintelligence lab is at its core a story of competition.

So, you've got Mark Zuckerberg, a famously competitive CEO, and this past spring, we learned through our reporting that he'd begun to feel quite acutely that Meta was falling behind in this all-consuming race for AI. Meta had just released the latest version of its large language model – they call it Llama. This is a system meant to rival open AI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude. But when the rollout landed, it fell flat. And it fell flat internally, according to our sources. It had just become clear that Meta was not leading the pack among these AI companies.

Listeners may think of Meta as the parent company of Facebook, or Instagram, or WhatsApp, these popular apps that have billions of users. But Meta is increasingly seeing itself as an AI company, too. And it wasn't leading there. And so Zuckerberg, seeing, feeling that he was falling behind in this race, immediately sprung into action. From his homes in Tahoe and Silicon Valley, he started personally recruiting, and he was basically quietly building this new secretive team that we now know is Meta Superintelligence Labs.

What is this super secretive team going to do? I thought Meta was all about the “metaverse,” and that's why they changed their name to Meta. It sounds like they should have changed their name to AI.

It's a really good point. When I speak with folks on Wall Street, the metaverse is always the pain point. It is something that still bleeds cash. It's not a big revenue driver. It hasn't proved itself to be the dream that Mark Zuckerberg once painted.

Meta's AI ambitions are a bit of a different beast. Back in the days where it was still called Facebook, they were in the AI game. They brought on this guy named Yann LeCun, a big, award-winning thinker on [AI]. If you were watching that at the time, you might've thought Meta was really well-positioned to be the AI leader.

But when OpenAI came out with ChatGPT, it blew everyone out of the water, including AI researchers at Meta who I've spoken with. They'd been building their own large language models, but the approach was still rather academic. It wasn't packaged in a consumer product in the way OpenAI so successfully executed on ChatGPT. So, I think that's when the race began, but it really kicked into gear this April with what felt to many internally at Meta as a flop with its latest release of Llama.

And what exactly has Meta done in this space so far? Nothing, it sounds like?

Right now, we're seeing a talent war. We're seeing Meta create a new organizational structure for its AI talent. This is a multi-billion-dollar effort, and Meta has the cash to deploy.

The perspective of company leadership is that they're looking to make a big bet and plug that talent gap. They believe there's only a small talent pool that can best make use of that spend, to put together these competitive models. Many are focused on reasoning, and that means they're specialists who can help build models that think step by step, as opposed to in this probabilistic approach where they're predicting the next word in the sentence.

A lot of chatbots right now, they look like they understand what you're saying when you type in a question, but really they're just predicting. They've taken these massive amounts of data, and they're able to predict the next word in the sentence. And what Meta, what OpenAI, want to do is give them the capacity to think, to reason for themselves. So, if you're going to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to win the AI race, what's a couple billion on the talent that can steer the ship? That's the rationale coming from inside the company.

But, of course, there's pushback. One thing I've heard from folks who have left Meta over the years is that if you are a PhD type who got into this really complicated question of AI reasoning and superintelligence, you weren't necessarily inspired when Meta announced that they were creating AI chatbots that sounded like Snoop Dogg. So, there has been skepticism of Mark Zuckerberg as a leader. He's someone who really wants to bring AI into the hands of individuals.

I think it's too early to tell whether or not it's working. What has been successful is Mark's efforts to court some of the biggest names out there. They are taking away top talent from competitors. But we also know there are people who have turned down Mark Zuckerberg's sports-team-level compensation packages.

I will say that pushback isn't coming from Wall Street. Meta's stock is up nearly 30 percent this year to date. Clearly, there's excitement from the investor community.

So, it sounds like Meta is restructuring itself or creating altogether new structures, to play the long game on superintelligence. What does it look like in the rest of the industry right now?

Everybody — I mean everybody — has had to respond to Mark Zuckerberg's crazed hiring push. His efforts have set a new bar for compensation across the industry. We've seen other companies like OpenAI have to make offers to their own employees that are much higher.

You're even seeing that in the language, the public posturing from CEOs. OpenAI has said that they're going to spend trillions on the AI race. Other companies are being quite loud about the money they're going to throw. But we're talking about the biggest players here — we're not talking about the upstarts that have just gotten some venture cash and have no revenue. Meta, Google, even OpenAI are in a different position because they have cash to burn.

            Vietnam is on a South China Sea island-building binge that will likely see it soon surpass the area China has reclaimed in the strategic and contested Spratly Islands, according to a new report from the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative.
    


            Since the start of 2025, Hanoi has been dredging and adding surface area to eight features it controls in the island chain in the southeastern quarter of the South China Sea, said the AMTI report, based on satellite imagery from MAXAR and Planet Labs.
    


            The Spratly Island chain consists of more than 100 small islands or reefs and is claimed in full by China, Vietnam and Taiwan with partial claims by the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei, according to the CIA World Factbook.
    


            China's claims have drawn headlines for more than a decade, as Beijing has reclaimed land at several features, building runways and military installations to solidify its positions. Its building of fortifications came despite leader Xi Jinping in telling then-US President Barack Obama in 2015 that it had no plans of doing so.
    


            Beijing claims almost all of the 1.2 million-square-mile South China Sea, through which trillions of dollars in global trade passes annually, as its sovereign territory. It bases that claim on its so-called Nine Dash Line, which the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague has previously ruled has no legal basis.
    


            Vietnam's claims have not been as outspoken as China's and its previous reclamation efforts less ambitious.
    


            Some of the reefs where island-building is now going full tilt have long been held by just small pillboxes, including Alison Reef, Collins Reef, East Reef, Landsdowne Reef and Petley Reef, according to the AMTI, which is a project of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). New land is also being constructed at three features that were built up in earlier rounds of reclamation – Amboyna Cay, Grierson Reef and West Reef – the AMTI report said.
    


            “All 21 Vietnamese-occupied rocks and low-tide elevations in the Spratly Islands have now been expanded to include artificial land,” AMTI said.
    


            “As of March 2025, Vietnam had created about 70 percent as much artificial land in the Spratlys as China had. Reclamation at these eight new features all but ensures that Vietnam will match—and likely surpass—the scale of Beijing's island-building,” the report said.
    


            Those 21 features under Hanoi's control compare to just seven under Beijing's, according to AMTI.
    


            Meanwhile, on seven other Vietnamese-controlled islands where reclamation work has largely been completed, military-related structures, including munitions depots, have been or are being built, according to the report.
    


            The new report comes amid a spike in tensions between China and the Philippines over South China Sea territory.
    


            Competing claims by Beijing and Manila have become increasingly contentious in the past few years, including violent clashes between their coast guards with water cannons and, in one case, bladed weapons. That clash in the Spratlys near Second Thomas Shoal, on which Philippine marines are stationed in a rusting World War II naval vessel, left a Filipino crewman missing a thumb.
    


            Last month, north of the Spratlys near Scarborough Shoal, a Chinese navy destroyer collided with a China Coast Guard ship as the two harassed a Philippine Coast Guard vessel in contested waters. Images showed heavy damage to the bow of the China Coast Guard ship.

            The China-Philippines flare-ups may have provided Vietnam with excellent cover for its move to build up the islands it controls, analysts said.
    


            “For now much of China's bandwidth of attention is directed at the Philippines, and it would rather maintain a stable front with each of the other Southeast Asian rivals in the South China Sea,” said Collin Koh, a research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) in Singapore.
    


            Ray Powell, director of SeaLight, a maritime transparency project at Stanford University's Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation, echoed Koh's comments.
    


            “It seems that Beijing has calculated that keeping the Philippines isolated from the other South China Sea claimants is worth more right now than preventing Vietnam from making substantial territorial gains,” Powell said.
    


            “Hanoi may owe Manila a debt of gratitude, since it's hard to see how this could have happened if Beijing hadn't been so preoccupied with the problem to the east,” Powell said, adding that, “China has been remarkably muted about Vietnam's island-building campaign.”
    


            That was reflected in Beijing's official reaction to the AMTI report.

            “The Spratly Islands are China's inherent territory. China firmly opposes relevant countries' construction activities on illegally occupied islands and reefs. China will take necessary measures to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told a regular press briefing Monday.
    


            Vietnam and the Philippines did not comment on the AMTI report when asked by CNN.
    


            Past disagreements between China and Vietnam over South China Sea territory have resulted in bloodshed, including in 1974 when a South Vietnamese naval vessel was sunk and 53 South Vietnamese troops killed in a battle with Chinese forces over the Paracel Island chain in the northwestern part of the South China Sea.
    


            Beijing has maintained a big edge in the South China Sea since, and Koh said it may not find Hanoi's latest moves to be overly threatening.
    


            “China commands a yawning gap in mobile military and coast guard assets – hence this probably explains why Beijing is not deemed to be alarmed enough to do anything to stop Hanoi,” he said.
    


            But he cautioned Beijing must not overestimate that advantage, noting that Vietnam and the Philippines enjoy improving relations.
    


            “There's been effort between Vietnam and the Philippines to come closer on maritime security cooperation, as evidenced by the recent bilateral coast guard exchanges and joint exercise. That should serve as a timely reminder to Beijing that Hanoi owns the Manila card of leverage,” Koh said.

Federal prosecutors on Thursday charged a man seen throwing a sandwich at a federal agent with a misdemeanor offense after a grand jury declined to bring a harsher felony charge against the Washington, D.C., protester. 

The grand jury recently refused to indict Sean Dunn, a former government employee, on felony charges, leading to prosecutors' latest move to lessen the charges to a simple assault offense.

Earlier this month, Dunn hurled a Subway sandwich at a federal agent stationed in Washington as part of President Donald Trump's federal takeover of the nation's capital, a move the White House has branded as an anti-crime effort. 

Video capturing Dunn's act of protest against the government takeover went viral, leading U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro to level felony charges against the district resident. 

The felony charge would have carried up to eight years in prison. Under the relaxed misdemeanor charge, which does not require prosecutors to go to a grand jury, Dunn would spend under one year in prison for throwing a hoagie sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer.

Dunn was a Department of Justice employee when he encountered the federal agent. He was fired from his job after the incident. 

Dunn's case was assigned on Thursday to U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for next week.

Meta on Friday said it is making temporary changes to its artificial intelligence chatbot policies related to teenagers as lawmakers voice concerns about safety and inappropriate conversations.

The social media giant is now training its AI chatbots so that they do not generate responses to teenagers about subjects like self-harm, suicide, disordered eating and avoid potentially inappropriate romantic conversations, a Meta spokesperson confirmed. 

The company said AI chatbots will instead point teenagers to expert resources when appropriate.

"As our community grows and technology evolves, we're continually learning about how young people may interact with these tools and strengthening our protections accordingly," the company said in a statement.

Additionally, teenage users of Meta apps like Facebook and Instagram will only be able to access certain AI chatbots intended for educational and skill-development purposes.

The company said it's unclear how long these temporary modifications will last, but they will begin rolling out over the next few weeks across the company's apps in English-speaking countries. The "interim changes" are part of the company's longer-term measures over teen safety.

TechCrunch was first to report the change.

Last week, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said that he was launching an investigation into Meta following a Reuters report about the company permitting its AI chatbots to engage in "romantic" and "sensual" conversations with teens and children.

The Reuters report described an internal Meta document that detailed permissible AI chatbot behaviors that staff and contract workers should take into account when developing and training the software.  

In one example, the document cited by Reuters said that a chatbot would be allowed to have a romantic conversation with an eight-year-old and could tell the minor that "every inch of you is a masterpiece – a treasure I cherish deeply."

A Meta spokesperson told Reuters at the time that "The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed."

Most recently, the nonprofit advocacy group Common Sense Media released a risk assessment of Meta AI on Thursday and said that it should not be used by anyone under the age of 18, because the "system actively participates in planning dangerous activities, while dismissing legitimate requests for support," the nonprofit said in a statement.

"This is not a system that needs improvement. It's a system that needs to be completely rebuilt with safety as the number-one priority, not an afterthought," said Common Sense Media CEO James Steyer in a statement. "No teen should use Meta AI until its fundamental safety failures are addressed."

You may have heard Bill Pulte's name a lot as of late.

Pulte is the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or FHFA under President Donald Trump, serving in a role that gives him regulatory authority over the country's mortgage industry.

He's been using that authority in unusual ways — including getting involved in Trump's clashes with the Federal Reserve.

Pulte has been an outspoken critic of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, has called on him to resign, and reportedly gave Trump a drafted letter that would fire Powell.

And earlier this month, Pulte accused Federal Reserve Board Gov. Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud, leading Trump to attempt to fire her and kicking off a legal battle that remains ongoing, with implications for the US economy.

Here's what you should know about Pulte.

Pulte's family has been involved in housing for a long time: Bill Pulte is the grandson of William J. Pulte, the founder of the home-building company PulteGroup.

The younger Pulte founded his own investment firm, Pulte Capital Partners, in 2011, shortly after he graduated from Northwestern University. In addition to being CEO of Pulte Capital, he also served on the board of PulteGroup and was based in Michigan, near Detroit.

In 2019, he gained a following on Twitter, now known as X, for engaging in "Twitter Philanthropy," in which he gave away thousands of dollars to various followers in need.

That involved things like investing in small businesses, paying for some users' groceries, or offering a reward to find a missing person. He even once partnered with the make-up artist Jeffree Star on a $30,000 cash giveaway.

He's also a major political donor, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to support Trump and other GOP candidates during the 2024 election cycle.

Pulte's nomination to be FHFA director was confirmed by the Senate in March by a 56-34 vote, mostly along party lines.

He made some early moves at FHFA, including consolidating the agency's control over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Pulte announced earlier this year that he was directing both companies, which are under a government conservatorship, to consider cryptocurrency as an asset in mortgage lending.

But he's garnered even more notoriety for his role in Trump's war with the Fed.

According to the New York Times, Pulte drafted a letter for Trump that would have fired Powell. Trump reportedly showed off the letter to a group of GOP lawmakers at the White House in July, when the president was considering firing the Federal Reserve chair.

Pulte has also been a loud critic of Powell, and he accompanied Trump during his high-profile tour of the Fed later in July.

Pulte's focus on Powell drew the ire of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who in a July letter to Pulte said that he appeared "distracted" from his main job.

More consequentially, Pulte helped spur Trump's attempted firing of Lisa Cook, a Federal Reserve Board governor appointed by President Joe Biden.

Trump called for her to resign, and then said he was removing her, citing Pulte's allegations that she had committed mortgage fraud.

Cook refused to step aside, saying that Trump has no authority to fire her. That kicked off a legal battle that remains ongoing.

In addition to his allegations against Cook, Pulte has also used his position to accuse Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California and New York Attorney General Tish James — both prominent Trump critics — of mortgage fraud.

The Department of Justice is now investigating both officials, who have denied Pulte's allegations and characterized them as baseless attempts at political retribution.

Trump's Second Term:

Boxes of antiretroviral drugs in a medical stockroom, the last donation before USAID funding cuts, in Kisumu, Kenya on April 24. 

President Donald Trump asked Congress to claw back nearly $5 billion in already-approved foreign aid spending, a proposal timed to take advantage of the looming end of the fiscal year and allowing him to cut the funding himself if lawmakers fail to act by the close of September.

The maneuver challenges Congress' spending powers and intensifies an already contentious battle over government funding, which is due to lapse Sept. 30. Democrats are sure to seek guarantees Trump will actually spend money lawmakers appropriate in exchange for their votes to keep the government open.

The Department of Transportation on Friday canceled $679 million in federal funding for a dozen infrastructure projects that would support offshore wind power in the U.S., the latest attack in President Donald Trump's campaign to halt the development of renewable energy in the U.S.

The wind industry has been in Trump's crosshairs since his first day in office, when he halted new leases for offshore wind projects. But his administration has escalated its attacks in recent days.

"Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America's maritime industry," Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. The funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, according to the department.

Many of the projects affected by the funding cancellation are staging areas that would be used to build offshore wind turbines. The single biggest pledge that was canceled is Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind in northern California, with about $427 million in federal support withdrawn.

Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind is a planned marine terminal that would be used to launch and assemble turbines in support of California's goal of building 25 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2045.

The Department of the Interior last week ordered Denmark's Orsted A/S to halt work on the Revolution Wind project off the coast of New England. The fully permitted project is 80% complete. Orsted shares tumbled to a record low on Monday in the aftermath of the work stoppage.

Trump said last week that his administration will not approve solar or wind projects in the U.S. Renewable executives are warning that the president's campaign against renewable energy will lead to a spike in power prices.

Funds for the following projects have been withdrawn:

Funds for the the following projects have been terminated:

Alexis Wilkins, the longtime girlfriend of FBI Director Kash Patel, is suing an ex-agent and self-described whistleblower for defamation, alleging he called her a former Israeli spy whose relationship with Patel is a "honeypot" operation.

The defendant, Kyle Seraphin, "has maliciously lied" about Wilkins by "falsely asserting that she—an American-born country singer—is an agent of a foreign government, assigned to manipulate and compromise the Director of the FBI," Wilkins' attorney wrote in the lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court in Austin, Texas.

Wilkins accuses Seraphin, a conservative podcaster who calls himself a "recovering FBI agent," of "using this fabricated story as self-enriching clickbait."

Wilkins is seeking at least $5 million in damages. The suit was first reported by Reason and highlighted Friday morning by Court Watch.

Her legal complaint homes in on Seraphin's comments on "The Kyle Seraphin Show" on Aug. 22.

Patel "has had his own little 'honeypot' issue that's been going on of late, so we're just going to acknowledge it real publicly," Seraphin said on the episode at the center of the lawsuit.

"He's got a girlfriend that is half his age, who is apparently is both a country music singer, a political commentator on Rumble, a friend of John Rich through [FBI deputy Director Dan] Bongino, who also now owns a big chunk of Rumble, and she's also a former Mossad agent in what is like the equivalent of their NSA."

"But I'm sure that's totally because, like, she's really looking for like a cross-eyed, you know, kind of thickish built, super cool bro who's almost 50 years old who's Indian in America," Seraphin said sarcastically.

"Like it has nothing to do with the fact that uh we're really close to the Trump administration," he said. "Anyway, I'm sure that's totally just like love. That's what real love looks like."

Seraphin did not identify Wilkins by name, but her suit says his statement is "obviously about her specifically."

Wilkins, 26, said her long-term relationship with Patel, 45, began in January 2023 and has been public knowledge. Patel was confirmed as FBI director in February.

Seraphin, discussing the lawsuit at length on his show on Friday morning, noted that similar claims about Wilkins have previously surfaced in social media posts that have generated significantly more attention than his comments did.

By calling her a honeypot, Seraphin is suggesting that Wilkins is "an agent of a foreign government who began a relationship with another for purposes of manipulating and compromising them," the lawsuit says.

"He is accusing Ms. Wilkins of being a spy for a foreign government, conducting espionage to undermine our national security and/or to manipulate federal law enforcement at the highest level, and even committing treason," her lawyer wrote.

"Ms. Wilkins is not even Jewish, much less Israeli, and has never set foot in Israel ... The notion that her relationship with Dir. Patel is part of some plot against her country is vile and ridiculous."

Seraphin, on his show, said he never made those claims.

The suit argues that since Seraphin "trades on his experience" as a former FBI counterterrorism agent, he cannot claim that he comments were mere hyperbole.

It also notes that Seraphin met with both Patel and Wilkins "at a conservative political event roughly two years ago," before he was confirmed as FBI director.

Seraphin said on his show Friday morning that he had no recollection of having met them.

NBC News reported in January that Patel had reached out to Seraphin and two other conservative former special agents prior to being nominated to lead the FBI.

Patel "keeps tabs on me and the guys that he's helped out, and also we share information about FBI stuff," Seraphin told NBC at the time.

The final Grand Slam of 2025 is underway, bringing the world's top tennis stars to the hard courts of the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York. We've gathered everything you need to know about where to watch the US Open, with global streaming options — including a free one.

All of the usual suspects have made their way to the US Open, including defending champions Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka, who rank No. 1 in the ATP and WTA, respectively.

Sabalenka has yet to win a Grand Slam title this year, and she'll take on the DC Open champ, Leylah Fernandez, in the third round today. Carlos Alcaraz and his new buzzcut will take on Luciano Darderi, while Sinner returns to action tomorrow. Other big names still in the fight include Iga Swiatek, Coco Gauff, Alex Zverev, Ben Shelton, and, of course, Novak Djokovic.

Keep reading to learn the best ways to live stream the tournament without cable. Match start times are approximate and subject to delay, especially later in the day.

Access streaming anywhere:

Notable Round 3 matches (approx. start times):

ESPN is the broadcast home of the US Open in the United States. Matches will air across various ESPN networks and ABC, and be available in full through the brand-new ESPN streaming service. Plans range from $12 a month for ESPN Select to $30 a month for ESPN Unlimited.

Both tiers should have US Open coverage, but Unlimited unlocks lots of extra coverage and full live streams from flagship networks. You can learn more in our ESPN streaming service guide and check out a limited-time deal when you bundle ESPN Unlimited with Disney Plus and Hulu.


                      ESPN Select, formerly ESPN Plus, offers select coverage from ESPN properties. While it doesn't have a direct live stream of ESPN networks, like the Unlimited plan, it still offers around 32,000 live sporting events each year.
                    

If you're looking for an even more comprehensive sports streaming option, a month-to-month live TV streaming service such as DirecTV or Fubo can help. DirecTV MySports, the service's new genre pack, includes 20+ popular sports channels traditionally found in cable packages and access to the ESPN Unlimited streaming service app. Subscriptions cost $70 a month, but new users can get $10 a month off their first two months and a five-day free trial.


                      DirecTV's MySports pack carries popular sports channels, from mainstays like ESPN to niche offerings like the ACC Network. 
                    

Fubo is another popular live TV streaming service with access to ABC and all of the relevant ESPN networks, in addition to around 200+ other live channels. Subscribing to Fubo will also unlock access to the new ESPN Unlimited streaming app. Fubo Pro subscriptions start at $85 a month (plus a bit extra for regional sports fees), but new users can get $30 off their first month of service after a five-day free trial.


                      Fubo is the streaming service for sports fans. Its huge library of channels includes regional and international sports leagues, setting it apart from the competition. You can also tack on additional programming to your plan, but it'll cost you extra.
                    

In the UK, the US Open will be available through Sky Sports. Prices vary depending on which bundle and long-term contract you sign up for, but the cheapest plans with Sky Sports start at £35 a month. You can learn more in our guide to the best Sky TV deals and plans. There's also an option to stream Sky Sports through Now, which offers some additional flexibility.

Shares of Marvell Technology plunged 15% on Friday after the artificial intelligence chipmaker's data center revenue fell short of estimates and it gave lackluster guidance for the current quarter.

Here's how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

Revenue jumped 58% from a year ago in the fiscal second quarter that ended Aug. 2, a record for the company that was fueled in part by "strong AI demand" for its custom silicon and electro-optics products, Marvell CEO Matt Murphy said in a statement.

The company had net income of $194.8 million, or 22 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $193.3 million, a loss of 22 cents per share, during the same period last year.

For the fiscal third quarter, the company called for revenue to be $2.06 billion, plus or minus 5%. That was slightly below the $2.11 billion forecast by analysts, according to LSEG.

Marvell is known for creating customized chips and hardware, which it offers to cloud providers such as Amazon and Microsoft.

Sales in its data center segment reached $1.49 billion during the quarter, which fell short of Wall Street's projected $1.51 billion, according to StreetAccount.

On a conference call with investors, Murphy said the company expects "overall data center revenue in Q3 to be flat sequentially," which he attributed to nonlinear growth in its custom AI chips business. Fourth-quarter growth is expected to be "substantially stronger" than the third quarter, Murphy said.

He added that "lumpiness" of the guidance is normal as large hyperscalers build out infrastructure.

Still, some investors were hoping for greater clarity around the company's pipeline of new customers.

"Without this, we find it very difficult underwriting the company's 20% data center market share target," Cantor analysts wrote in a Thursday note to clients. "Thus, we wait for more bottoms up granularity before potentially turning more positive."

Analysts at Bank of America downgraded Marvell's stock to neutral from buy on Friday and lowered their price target to $78 per share from $90, partly on concerns around the company's AI growth prospects "in the near/medium term."

In this article

The de minimis exemption, an obscure trade law provision that has simultaneously fueled and eroded businesses across the globe, officially came to an end on Friday following an executive order by President Donald Trump. 

For nearly a decade, shipments valued under $800 were allowed to enter the country virtually duty-free and with less oversight. Now, those shipments from the likes of Tapestry, Lululemon and just about any other retailer with an online presence will be tariffed and processed in the same way that larger packages are handled. 

In May, Trump ended the exemption for goods coming from China and Hong Kong, and on July 30 he expanded the rollback to all countries, calling it a "catastrophic loophole" that's been used to evade tariffs and get "unsafe or below-market" products into the U.S. 

The de minimis exemption had previously been slated to end in July 2027 as part of sweeping legislation passed by Congress, but Trump's executive order eliminated the provision much sooner, giving businesses, customs officials and postal services less time to prepare.

"The ending of that under-$800-per-person-per-day rule, from a global perspective, is about to probably cause a bit of pandemonium," said Lynlee Brown, a partner in the global trade division at accounting firm EY. "There's a financial implication, there's an operational implication, and then there's pure compliance, right? Like, these have all been informal entries. No one's really looked at them."

Already, the sudden change has snarled supply chains from France to Singapore and led post offices across the world to temporarily suspend shipments to the U.S. so they can ensure their systems are updated and able to comply with the new regulations. 

It's forced businesses both large and small to rethink not just their supply chains, but their overall business models, because of the impact the change could have on their bottom lines – setting off a panic in boardrooms across the country, logistics experts said. 

"Obviously it's a big change for operating models for companies, not just the Sheins and the Temus, but for companies that have historically had e-com and brick-and-mortar stores," Brown said.

The change also means consumers, already are under pressure from persistent inflation and high interest rates, could now see even higher prices on a wide range of goods, from Colombian bathing suits to specialty ramen subscription boxes shipped straight from Japan. 

The end of de minimis could cost U.S. consumers at least $10.9 billion, or $136 per family, according to a 2025 paper by Pablo Fajgelbaum and Amit Khandelwal for the National Bureau of Economic Research. The research found low-income and minority consumers would feel the biggest impact as they rely more on the cheaper, imported purchases.

Popularized by Chinese e-tailers Shein and Temu, use of the de minimis exemption has exploded in the last decade, ballooning from 134 million shipments in 2015 to more than 1.36 billion in 2024. Before the recent change to limit its use, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it was processing more than 4 million de minimis shipments into the country each day. 

A 2023 House report found more than 60% of de minimis shipments in 2021 came from China, but because the packages require less information than larger containers, very little information is known about their origins and the types of goods they contain. That opacity is one of the key reasons why both former President Joe Biden and Trump sought to curtail or end the exemption. 

Both administrations have said that the exemption was overused and abused and that it's made it difficult for CBP officials to target and block illegal or unsafe shipments coming into the U.S. because the packages aren't subject to the same level of scrutiny as larger containers. 

"We didn't have any compliance information … on those shipments, and then that is where the danger of drugs and whatnot being in those shipments" comes in, said Irina Vaysfeld, a principal in KPMG's trade and customs practice.

The Biden administration particularly focused on how the exemption allowed goods made with forced labor to make it into the country in violation of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. Meanwhile, Trump has said the exemption has been used to ship fentanyl and other synthetic opioids into the U.S. In a fact sheet published on July 30, the White House said 90% of all cargo seizures in fiscal 2024, including 98% of narcotics seizures and 97% of intellectual property rights seizures, originated as de minimis shipments.

Across the globe, it's common for countries to allow low-value shipments to be imported duty-free as a means to streamline and facilitate global trade, but typically, it's for packages valued around $200, not $800, said EY's Brown.

Until 2016, the U.S. threshold for low-value shipments was also $200, but it was changed to $800 when Congress passed the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act, which sought to benefit businesses, U.S. consumers and the overall U.S. economy, according to the Congressional Research Service. It said higher thresholds provide a "significant economic benefit" to both business and shoppers and thus, the overall economy. 

While well intentioned, the law came with unintended consequences, said Brown. 

The "rise in value, from $200 to $800, just made it kind of like a free for all to say, 'OK, everything come in,'" she said. 

Eventually companies designed supply chains around the exemption: They set up bonded warehouses, where duties can be deferred prior to export, in places like Canada and Mexico and then imported goods in bulk to those regions before sending them across the border one by one, duty-free, as customer orders rolled in, said Brown.

"Companies have really laid out their supply chain in a very specific way [around de minimis] and that's really the crux of the issue," said KPMG's Vaysfeld. "The way that the supply chain has been laid out now may need to change." 

Until the rise of Shein and Temu, the de minimis exemption was rarely discussed in retail circles. Soon, the e-commerce behemoths began facing widespread criticism for their use of what many called a loophole.

In 2023, the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party released a report on Shein and Temu and said the two companies were "likely responsible for more than 30 percent of all packages shipped to the United States daily under the de minimis provision, and likely nearly half of all de minimis shipments to the U.S. from China."

The revelation sparked widespread consternation among retail executives, lobbyists and government officials who said the companies' use of the exemption was unfair competition. 

However, behind closed doors, companies large and small began mimicking the same model after realizing how it could reduce the steep costs that come along with selling goods online. 

Direct-to-consumer companies that only have online presences have relied on it more heavily, so much so that their businesses may not work without it, said Vaysfeld.

"Some of the companies we've spoken to, they've modeled out, if the tariffs continue for one year, for two years, how does that impact their profitability, and they know how long they can last," said Vaysfeld. "These aren't the huge companies, right? These are the smaller companies. … Depending on what country they're sourcing from or where they're manufacturing, it could really impact their profitability that they can't stay in business for the long term."

While smaller, digital companies are more exposed, "pretty much most companies that you can think of" had been using the exemption in some form before it ended, said Vaysfeld. 

Take Coach and Kate Spade's parent company Tapestry: About 13% to 14% of the company's sales were previously covered under de minimis and will now be subject to a 30% tariff, according to an estimate by equity research firm Barclays.

On the company's earnings call earlier this month, Chief Financial Officer Scott Roe said tariffs will hit its profits by a total of $160 million this year, including the impact of the end of de minimis. That amounts to about 2.3% of margin headwind, he said. 

Shares of the company fell nearly 16% the day that Tapestry reported the profit hit.

In a statement, Roe said Tapestry used de minimis to help support its strong online business, adding it is a practice that "many companies with sophisticated supply chains have been doing for years."

To help offset its termination, he said Tapestry is looking for ways to reduce costs and is leaning on its manufacturing footprint across many different countries.

Canadian retailer Lululemon is another company that uses de minimis, according to Wells Fargo. Last week, the bank cut its price target on the company's stock from $225 to $205, citing the end of de minimis. In the note, Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow said the equity research firm sees a potential 90 cent to $1.10 headwind to Lululemon's earnings per share from the de minimis elimination.

Lululemon declined to comment, citing the company's quiet period ahead of its reporting earnings.

The National Retail Federation, the industry's largest trade organization, has not taken a position in favor of or against the exemption. It has members who both supported and opposed the policy, said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at NRF. 

Retailers of all sizes, including independent sellers with digital storefronts, have used the approach as "a convenient way to get products to the consumer" for less, Gold said.

"Their costs are going to go up and those costs could be passed on to the consumer at the end of the day," Gold said.

The most acute impact of the end of de minimis is expected to be felt on online marketplaces where millions of small businesses sell goods like Etsy, eBay and Shopify and used de minimis to defray costs when sending online orders from other parts of the globe to the U.S.

American shoppers have gotten used to buying artwork, coffee mugs, T-shirts and other items from merchants outside the country without paying duties. With that tariff exemption gone, consumers could face higher costs and a more limited selection of items to choose from.

Etsy, eBay and some other retailers sought to defend the loophole prior to its removal, submitting public comments on proposed de minimis regulation by the CBP. An eBay public policy executive said the company was concerned that restrictions to de minimis "would impose significant burdens on American consumers and importers."

Etsy's head of public policy, Jeffrey Zubricki, said the artisan marketplace supports "smart U.S. de minimis reform," but that it was wary of changes that could "disproportionately affect small American sellers."

"These exemptions are a powerful tool that help small creators, artisans and makers participate in and navigate cross-border trade," Zubricki wrote in a March letter to CBP.

An Etsy spokesperson declined to comment on the policy change. Etsy CFO Lanny Baker said at a Bernstein conference in May that transactions between U.S. buyers and European sellers make up about 25% of the company's gross merchandise sales.

EBay didn't immediately provide a comment in response to a request from CNBC. The company warned in its latest earnings report that the end of de minimis outside of China could impact its guidance, though CEO Jamie Iannone told CNBC in July that he believes eBay is generally "well suited" to navigate the shifting trade environment.

Some eBay and Etsy sellers based in the U.K., Canada and other countries are temporarily closing off their businesses to the U.S. as they work out a plan to navigate the higher tariffs. Blair Nadeau, who owns a Canadian bridal accessories company, was forced to take that step this week.

"This is devastating on so many levels and millions of small businesses worldwide are now having their careers, passions and livelihoods threatened," Nadeau wrote in an Instagram post on Tuesday. "Just this past hour I have had to turn away two U.S. customers and it broke my heart."

Nadeau sells her bespoke wedding veils, jewelry and hair adornments through her own website and on Etsy, where 70% of her customer base is in the U.S. The de minimis provision had been a "lifeline" for many Canadian businesses to get their products in the hands of American consumers, Nadeau said in an interview.

"This is really hitting me," Nadeau said. "It's like all of a sudden 70% of your salary has been removed overnight."

In the absence of de minimis, online merchants are faced with either paying import charges upfront and potentially passing those costs on to shoppers through price hikes, or shipping products "delivery duty unpaid," in which case it's the customer's responsibility to pay any duties upon arrival.

Alexandra Birchmore, an artist based in the Cotswolds region of England, said she expects to raise the price of her oil paintings on Etsy by 10% as a result of paying the duties upfront.

"At the moment every small business forum I am on is in chaos about this," Birchmore said. "It looks to me to be a disaster where no one benefits."

The disruption could end up being a boon for the likes of Amazon and Walmart. U.S. consumers may turn to major retailers if they face steeper prices elsewhere, as well as potential shipping delays due to backlogs or other issues at the border.

Amazon, in particular, has already proven resilient after the U.S. axed the de minimis provision for shipments from China and Hong Kong in May. The company's sales increased 13% in the three-month period that ended June 30, compared with 10% growth in the prior quarter. Amazon's unit sales grew 12%, an acceleration from the first quarter.

Both Amazon and Walmart have fulfillment operations in the U.S. that allow overseas businesses to ship items in bulk and store them in the companies' warehouses before they're dispatched to shoppers. Shein and Temu largely eschewed the model in the past in favor of the de minimis exception, but they've since moved to open more warehouses in the U.S. in the wake of rising tariffs.

Since the exemption ended on Chinese imports in May, the impact on Shein and Temu has been swift. Temu was forced to change its business model in the U.S. and stop shipping products to American consumers from Chinese factories. 

The end of de minimis, as well as Trump's new tariffs on Chinese imports, also forced Temu to raise prices, rein in its aggressive online advertising push and adjust which goods were available to American shoppers. 

The Financial Times reported on Tuesday that Temu has resumed shipping goods to the U.S. from Chinese factories and will also increase its advertising spend following what it called a "truce" between Washington and Beijing. 

Temu didn't return a request for comment. 

Meanwhile, Shein has been forced to raise prices and daily active users on both platforms in the U.S. have fallen since the de minimis loophole was closed, CNBC previously reported. Temu's U.S. daily active users plunged 52% in May versus March, while Shein's were down 25%, according to data shared with CNBC by market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.

A court hearing on Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook's request that President Donald Trump be barred from firing her while a lawsuit plays out ended Friday without a judge issuing a ruling.

Cook's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, blasted the Department of Justice's argument at the hearing that Trump had the necessary legal cause to remove Cook because of suggestions by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte that she committed mortgage fraud in documents for two properties in Atlanta and Ann Arbor, Michigan, before joining the Fed. 

"You can't have Director Pulte's crazy midnight tweets be the cause," Lowell told Judge Jia Cobb  in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.

But a DOJ lawyer told Cobb that it is up to Trump's "discretion" to determine if he has legal cause to fire a Fed governor.

The Fed, in a court filing before the hearing, said it would not make arguments on the merits of Cook's request. But the central bank also asked Cobb to issue a "prompt ruling" on her motion.

Cobb ended the hearing after two hours of arguments without ruling on Cook's request for a temporary restraining order that would block her removal from the Senate-confirmed seat.

It is not clear when the judge will rule. 

Cobb suggested that the attorneys for both sides confer and determine whether they want her to first rule on the restraining order, or whether they want her to issue a decision on potential requests for a preliminary injunction or summary judgment to restrict Trump from booting her from the Fed and replacing her.

Cobb also said she was giving the parties more time to supplement in writing the arguments they made in open court on Friday.

Lowell began that session by asking Cobb to keep in place the "status quo" — Cook remaining in her job — while he, Trump's lawyer, and other interested parties lay out arguments in court filings on whether the president has the power to terminate her.

Cobb said, "This case obviously raises some important questions that may be of first impression, particularly as it applies to this board."

If Trump succeeds in firing Cook, he would be on track to have nominated a majority of the seven-member Board, which sets interest rates. Trump has criticized the Board for months for not cutting those rates, which he has argued would boost the U.S. economy and reduce the federal government's cost of financing its debt.

Cook, who is the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, argues that Trump has no such cause for firing her. She was nominated to the Board by then-President Joe Biden in 2022, and her current 14-year term is due to expire in January 2038.

Trump says he wants to fire Cook because of Pulte's prior allegations that she potentially committed mortgage fraud in statements she made on documents related to the properties in Atlanta and Ann Arbor.

On Thursday night, Pulte said he had filed a second criminal referral against Cook with the Department of Justice related to a mortgage for a condominium in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and alleged misrepresentations she made about that condo and the two other homes in government ethics filings during her time as a Fed governor.

Lowell on Friday called Pulte's new referral "an obvious smear campaign aimed at discrediting Gov. Cook by a political operative who has taken to social media more than 30 times in the last two days and demanded her removal before any review of the facts or evidence."

"Nothing in these vague, unsubstantiated allegations has any relevance to Gov Cook's role at the Federal Reserve, and they in no way justify her removal from the Board," Lowell said.

Cook sued Trump, the Fed Board of Governors, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday. The suit says that Trump's firing of her is illegal, and asks Cobb for an order keeping her on the job while the case is litigated.

Powell and the Fed Board were sued only to the extent that they could, at some point, seek to execute Trump's desire to fire her.

The Fed, in its court filing Friday, told Cobb that it intends " to follow any order this Court issues."

The Supreme Court is likely to end up resolving the dispute.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

A federal judge set a hearing for 10 a.m. ET this morning after Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook sued President Donald Trump over his move to fire her. While the case will likely make its way to the Supreme Court, today's hearing marks the latest twist in a dramatic standoff that has gripped economists and investors in recent weeks.

Here's what to know:

The S&P 500 closed at a record high for the second day in a row yesterday, finishing the session above 6,500 for the first time.

Traders received good news when second-quarter GDP data came in stronger than economists anticipated, though Nvidia's post-earnings slide put a damper on the market's good vibes. 

But don't shut down your computer for the long weekend just yet. The personal consumption expenditures price index — a closely followed gauge of inflation — is due in at 8:30 a.m. ET. Follow live market updates here.

Speaking of Nvidia, a financial filing yesterday revealed a fascinating fact about the chipmaker's business: Just two of Nvidia's clients accounted for 39% of its revenue in the second quarter.

The identities of these customers are a mystery. But as CNBC's Kif Leswing notes, the fact that only two clients make up such a sizable chunk of Nvidia's sales raises red flags around potential overconcentration.

In the same period a year ago, the chipmaker's top two customers collectively represented 25% of its revenue.

CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning.

Gap's new denim ad featuring girl group Katseye may be popping off, but its second-quarter sales didn't.

The clothing maker slightly missed Wall Street's revenue expectations after the bell yesterday, though it beat analysts' earnings estimates. Gap said Athleta, its athleisure brand, had a particularly difficult quarter and warned that tariffs would hurt profits more than it previously expected.

Gap wasn't the only retailer making headlines. CNBC's Gabrielle Fonrouge exclusively reported yesterday that Nike is planning another round of layoffs as it fights to return to growth.

The symbiotic relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI is once again in flux.

Yesterday, Microsoft said it began publicly testing an internally built AI model that can enhance its Copilot assistant. As CNBC's Jordan Novet reports, the move is an attempt by Microsoft to decrease its dependence on OpenAI's models. 

The two companies are increasingly competing against each other, despite Microsoft being one of OpenAI's key backers. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and uses its artificial intelligence tools in its products. At the same time, OpenAI relies on Microsoft's cloud infrastructure to run its models but has recently turned to other providers to meet booming demand.

Increases in unemployment and inflation cast a shadow over the outlook for Europe's largest economy, which joins the wider EU bloc in bracing for the full impact of newly implemented U.S. tariffs.

German inflation rose by a higher-than-expected 2.1% in August, preliminary data showed Friday, exceeding the 2% expectations of analysts polled by Reuters. Inflation, which is harmonized for comparability across the euro zone, had risen by a cooler-than-expected 1.8% in July.

Germany's core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, was unchanged from the previous month at 2.7% in August, the country's statistics office Destatis said.

Yields on German government bonds, known as Bunds, were little changed shortly after the data release, which came on the same day that labor office figures showed the number of unemployed people jumped to 3.025 million in August, to a rate of 6.4%.

The broader euro zone inflation reading, due Tuesday, will offer further insight into the economic impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies, which have hit various European sectors in recent months.

The U.S. and EU struck a trade agreement in July, including a 15% tariff rate on many EU goods exported to the U.S. Fresh details released earlier this month suggested that this blanket rate will also be applied to some hotly contested sectors like pharmaceuticals — but crucial questions still remain unanswered, leaving businesses on edge.

The tariffs are widely expected to drive prices higher in the U.S., but their effect on costs elsewhere is less clear.

Germany's highly export-driven economy has long been hovering near the flatline. The country's gross domestic product expanded by 0.3% in the first quarter, before contracting by 0.3% in the following period, according to the latest data from Destatis.

"It remains to be seen how European and US companies will react to US tariffs. While one scenario could see prices falling in the eurozone due to overcapacity and weaker sales in the US, globally operating companies might try to actually increase prices in Europe in order to offset profit-squeezing in the US," said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, in a note.

"A rather domestic theme will be the cooling of the German labour market, which should take away wage pressures and consequently inflationary pressures," he added, noting that the inflationary hike in Germany now weakens the case for the European Central Bank to press ahead with an interest rate cut at its September meeting.

The ECB most recently opted to hold its key rate unchanged at 2% during its July meeting.

In this article

PepsiCo has increased its stake in energy drink maker Celsius Holdings through a $585 million deal, the companies said on Friday.

The deal, under which the soda giant bought 5% of Celsius' preferred stock, brings PepsiCo's stake in the company to about 11% after conversion. PepsiCo had paid $550 million for an 8.5% stake in Celsius in 2022.

Shares of Celsius, which have more than doubled in value this year, surged 11% in premarket trading on the news.

As part of the agreement, Celsius' health and wellness drinks brand, Alani Nu, will move into PepsiCo's distribution system in the U.S. and Canada.

The increase in stake comes as PepsiCo seeks to capitalize on Alani Nu's rapid growth and broad appeal among fitness-focused female consumers.

Celsius had bought Alani Nutrition in a $1.8 billion deal earlier this year.

Retirement funding looks very different depending on where you live.

While the United States leans heavily on voluntary 401(k)-style savings plans, other nations rely on mandatory contributions or more traditional pensions to ensure broad coverage and steady income.

Mercer CFA Institute Global Pension Index takes these structural differences into consideration when ranking some of the world's biggest retirement systems.

"We do it because we want to give a picture of the retirement landscape," said Christine Mahoney, global pensions leader at Mercer, a consulting firm. "We try to look at what the public systems are, what the private systems are, and look at how people will fare in retirement across all of those."

The U.S. retirement system received a C+ rating from the Mercer CFA Institute Global Pension Index in 2024. It ranked 29 out of 48 global pension systems assessed.

"It means that the system is solid, designed well, but there is a significant risk," said Mahoney. "And if we don't clear that risk up, the system could be in some jeopardy."

Countries around the world are raising their retirement ages, as well as requiring mandatory contributions into personal retirement savings, according to research from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Experts suggest this can help address modern problems such as people living longer and fewer workers paying into the system.

"For the U.S. system, the thing that could change that grade significantly, the most important is actually coverage," Mahoney said. "Our 401(k) plans are voluntary."

The Netherlands is frequently given a top score in the index. Mahoney says one of the key features that makes the Dutch system stand out is mandatory contributions.

There are two broad models for retirement plans, and they function very differently:

What countries like the Netherlands and Australia do differently from the U.S. is require workers to pay into defined contribution plans.

"In the Netherlands ... there's a mandatory contribution made," Mahoney said. "You can't opt out of it either as an employer or as an employee. So getting money [into defined contribution accounts] in the U.S. is a real challenge because it is a voluntary system. If we're going to stay voluntary, then getting it easier to launch a plan and join a plan is the critical thing for [the U.S.] to focus on."

Watch the video above to learn more about how the U.S. retirement system stacks up against those of countries like the Netherlands and Australia.

At the stroke of midnight, 92% of all U.S. cargo shipments, and up to 4 million packages daily, lost their duty-free status with President Donald Trump's removal of the de minimis exemption for low-value trade. Any imported goods sent through the international postal network that are valued at or under $800 will now be subject to applicable duties. While the winners and losers on the retail landscape and among consumers are debated, customs experts are warning the troubles facing small to medium-sized businesses that relied on the duty-free exemption are just beginning, and will be significant.

"When I think about the de minimis change, the message is clear: tariffs are now universal, regardless of value," said Nunzio De Filippis, licensed customs broker and co-CEO of CargoTrans. "Every package counts. That's a major change in how global e-commerce has operated for the last decade."

The postal carrier or "qualified party" (e.g., USPS, Royal Mail, La Poste) that decides how duties are collected on packages moving through the postal stream must collect those duties from shippers or recipients and remit them to U.S. Customs.

The carriers have two methods to choose from — either a percentage of the country's tariff rate (ad valorem) or a flat per-package fee, De Filippis explained. With the flat rate, there are three tiers: $80 if the IEEPA tariff rate — the trade duties put into effect by Trump using emergency economic powers — is under 16% (such as EU goods at 15%); $160 if it's between 16% and 25% (such as Vietnam at 20%); and $200 if it's above 25% (such as India at 50% or China at 30%). After a six-month transition period, the flat fee option goes away and all packages will be subject to the percentage tariff rate only.

According to Marianne Rowden, trade attorney and CEO of the E-Merchants Trade Council, which represents e-sellers and companies that support e-commerce, the total increase in cost to be paid by small and medium-sized businesses may reach over $71 billion, calculations that she said are based on an average value per package of $48 and data from the U.S Customs and Border Protection for fiscal year 2025.

Availability of air freight for U.S. shippers will also change.

The number of government postal offices shutting the door on shipments bound for the U.S. has grown to include Swiss Post, Japan Post and postal services in Australia, India, New Zealand, the U.K. and other parts of Europe that announced they are suspending shipments.

Deutsche Post and DHL Parcel Germany, both divisions of DHL, stopped U.S.-bound shipments on August 25.

"For shippers, this brings increased costs, complexity, and the need to adapt shipping setups to comply with new customs requirements. They may also face longer processing times and additional administrative steps when importing lower-value goods," said Andrew Williams, CEO for DHL Express Americas, who told CNBC it will continue to process inbound shipments to the United States in accordance with the applicable customs rules and regulations. "Our main priority remains to protect our core service commitment to customers and to minimize any disruption that arises from changes in tariff and trade policy, while remaining compliant with applicable customs rules and regulations," Williams said.

Ryan Elliott, chief operating officer at Everstream Analytics, said these global postal changes may catch smaller businesses by surprise. "We've already seen a number of countries, especially in the EU, pause deliveries to the U.S., explaining that they need more time to work through how they'll collect and transit duties and data," said Elliott. "Small businesses may not be aware of the changes, and many will be caught off guard. But, when the dust settles, my best guess is that many will struggle to comply as they simply don't have the resources to manage through customs requirements," he said.

Josh Teitelbaum, an international trade expert at Akin and former U.S. Commerce official, said the way this new tariff change is being implemented is leading to global confusion. "With many of the world's postal services temporarily suspending service to the U.S., ultimately, consumers and small businesses will be the ones that see increased costs or shipping delays as we undergo more changes to trade policy," he said.

Ronald Kleijwegt, CEO at Vinturas, a global supply chain collaboration network serving global manufacturers and OEMs like Mitsubishi and The Association of European Vehicle Logistics, said small businesses will feel the most pain. "What was once a straightforward cross-border trade is now full of uncertainty," he said. "Larger companies may have the resources to adapt by absorbing costs, rerouting logistics, or investing in compliance. Smaller businesses often do not, which can limit their opportunities, slow innovation, and reduce consumer choice."

Concerns about the financial health of small businesses are growing. Jacob Bennett, co-founder of small business banking consultant Crux Analytics, said the conversations it is having with banks and credit unions are about the impact of the trade volatility on U.S. small businesses. "We are trying to help them navigate all of these changes," said Bennett. "So many small and medium-sized businesses operate on such thin margins and don't have the pools of capital that they can fall back on and extend their runway, so many small businesses will unfortunately suffer because of these changes."

In its explanation for the de minimis elimination, the White House has stressed that over the past decade, the volume of de minimis shipments to the United States exploded, growing from 134 million shipments in 2015 to over 1.36 billion shipments in 2024. Low-cost Asian retail e-commerce companies have been among the major beneficiaries of that boom, such as Shein and Temu. In addition, the Trump administration says de minimis shipments accounted for 90% of all cargo seizures in fiscal year 2024. "These shipments often broke the law, with 98% of narcotics seized from cargo falling under the de minimis exemption, as well as 97% of counterfeit items seized," it stated in a document on the new trade policy.

But for small businesses, the primary fear is that the additional duties will eat into their already thin margins and potentially force them to raise prices. 

Shippers that have leveraged de minimis will not have all of the tariff mitigation strategies available that bulk importers have, according to Brian Bourke, chief commercial officer at SEKO Logistics, and he says its elimination will create two likely impacts for consumers: higher prices and less reliable delivery. Bourke said businesses will likely pass on new duty costs for the low-value goods that transit into the United States, and the increased data requirements for the postal channels may lead to delays depending on how the other countries' postal operators are able to handle and manage these new requirements.

"Large businesses that rely on small businesses should immediately get to work figuring out which suppliers they rely on for what and do what they can to either help them comply or find alternative suppliers," said Elliott.

Ultimately, the impact of the end of the de minimis exemption will extend beyond U.S. businesses, according to Kleijwegt. "With de minimis scrapped, EU exporters now face tariffs on low-value items, added customs paperwork, and higher shipping costs when selling to the US. U.S. small businesses now lose out on cheaper European sourcing, while smaller EU firms lose easy duty-free access, which has huge implications for market access on both sides of the Atlantic," he said.

Eric Trump said Friday he is certain bitcoin will eventually hit a $1 million valuation as he spoke at a Hong Kong conference, marking the first of a series of Asian crypto events that will feature U.S. President Donald Trump's sons.

Speaking at Hong Kong's Bitcoin Asia 2025 conference, Eric Trump discussed his strong involvement in the crypto space.

"I really believe in the next several years, Bitcoin hits a million dollars. There's no question," he said, adding that 90% of his time is now spent with the crypto community. 

During his panel, the American businessman and former reality TV presenter also showered praise on Simon Gerovich, president and CEO of Japanese Bitcoin treasury company Metaplanet. Eric joined the Tokyo-listed company's board of advisors earlier this year. 

Bitcoin's price has risen about 86% in the last 12 months amid buoyant investor sentiment surrounding President's Trump's election victory and a more positive U.S. regulatory environment on crypto. However, it's worth noting that cryptocurrencies generally can be highly volatile and the space has been shrouded in the past by illicit activity and corporate scandals. In 2022, bitcoin and other digital currencies slumped sharply after a slew of major crypto companies went bankrupt.

Eric Trump, along with his brother Donald Trump Jr, have become major players in the Trump family's growing crypto empire. The two are co-founders of the bitcoin-mining venture American Bitcoin and also help manage the Trump family-backed project World Liberty Financial.

Now the brothers are broadening their push into digital assets to Asia. Soon after his Hong Kong visit, Eric Trump is reportedly headed to Japan to attend a shareholder meeting of Metaplanet, according to a recent report from Bloomberg News.

Later in September, both Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are expected to speak at a South Korean crypto conference, and the pair is slated to appear as key speakers at Singapore's Token 2049, one of the world's largest crypto events.

Once a skeptic of cryptocurrencies, President Trump has also embraced the crypto industry, branding himself as the first "crypto president." 

"The Bitcoin community embraced my father unlike anything I had ever seen before," Eric Trump said Friday adding: "And I hope that's paid off in spades."

The Trump administration has launched a number of executive orders and backed policies welcomed by the digital asset industry and has filled his cabinet with crypto advocates like David Sacks, the White House's AI and crypto czar. 

Trump has also been involved in crypto business ventures, including World Liberty Financial and his $TRUMP meme coin, leading to accusations of corruption and self-dealing from opposition lawmakers, as well as calls for ethics investigations.

Given the shared interests between the American president and his son's crypto activities, market watchers will be monitoring how the two brothers are received by government officials during their Asia tour. 

The visits come against the backdrop of President Trump's ongoing global trade war, which has made Asia a major target.  

A Hong Kong official and a lawmaker withdrew from a Bitcoin Asia conference in the city following advice not to engage with Eric Trump, the South China Morning Post reported Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. 

An archived version of the event webpage confirmed that Eric Yip, executive director at the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), and lawmaker Johnny Ng had previously been on the list of speakers for the event, before being removed. 

The SFC told CNBC that Yip was unable to attend the event because of a business trip, while the South China Morning Post reported that Ng said he withdrew for family reasons. 

The Hong Kong legislative council did not respond to a request for comment from CNBC.

Shoppers with higher incomes are more likely to return retail purchases they make, a new report finds. 

Higher-income households had the highest percentage of retail refunds, at 5.3% of their purchases in 2025, according to a recent report by the Bank of America Institute that compared higher-, middle- and lower-income shopper return behavior. The analysis is based on aggregated, anonymous transaction data from bank debit and credit card holders who made at least five transactions per month.

Lower-income households had the smallest percentage of retail refunds at around 3.7% of their purchases.

Higher-income shoppers are less cash-strapped than lower earners, the report notes, so they are more likely to "buy items speculatively," especially if they know they can "return it later if they decide it's not right for them." 

This behavior is similar to what shopping experts call "bracketing," or the act of ordering multiple products in different sizes, colors or variations, with the intention of keeping a few and returning the rest.

"That's likely to be somewhat easier for someone who has a higher income to do," said David Tinsley, lead author of the report and senior economist at the Bank of America Institute.

To be sure, bracketing is not really new, said Edgar Dworsky, a consumer advocate and founder of ConsumerWorld.org.

"It's really been around as long as the internet has been around," Dworsky said. "Unlike walking into a department store — going into Macy's and trying on something there, or seeing things in person — you're buying much more blindly online."

More shoppers are making more frequent returns. Nearly half, or 46%, of consumers return purchased items multiple times a month, according to a separate 2024 report by Optoro, a returns solutions company. That's a jump from 29% in 2023.

While consumers value the ability to return products, retailers have been tightening their return policies in recent years to mitigate the high costs, experts say. 

Broadly, the ability to return unwanted purchases is important for consumers.

About 76% of surveyed respondents consider free returns important when deciding where to shop, per a 2024 report by the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns, a returns shipping company.

Nearly as many, 67%, of respondents stated that a negative return experience would deter them from shopping with a retailer again. 

The survey polled more than 2,000 consumers who had returned at least one online purchase in 2024, and 249 e-commerce and finance professionals from retailers with at least $500 million in revenue.

Despite those desires, returns can be costly for retailers. In 2024, retailers expected that about 16.9% of their annual sales would be returned, reaching an average cost of $890 billion, according to the report.

"Retailers themselves say it's a very expensive business," said Tinsley.

To offset the costs, companies have been tightening their return policies in recent years. NRF and Happy Returns found that about 66% of retailers began charging for one or more return methods.

Another way to cut back on costs is by shortening the window consumers have to make returns, said Dworsky: "We've generally seen this over the years."

"I think back to the old days when you bought something ... and you had maybe 180 days or maybe no return limit," he said.

As tariffs, or taxes on imported goods, increase the cost of products, companies may look for ways to tighten return policies even further to cut down on expenses, said Dworsky.

"One of the ways of cutting expenses is to cut back on the length of return periods," he said.

To avoid going through the hassle of returning a product, Dworksy said it's important to understand what you're buying ahead of time. 

One way to do so is by checking online reviews from customers who recently purchased the item. Some retailers, like Amazon, will flag whether shoppers tend to keep or return certain products, which can help you gauge the quality of the piece.

Check a retailer's return policies before you buy, especially if you think there's a chance you won't keep the item. Look for businesses that offer more flexible terms, he said.

A 2024 report by GoDaddy found that 77% of shoppers check the return policy before making a purchase. The site polled 1,500 consumers in September.

For additional protections, it can be helpful to use a credit card for the transaction, said Dworsky.

Credit cards can offer several kinds of return protections that help cardholders in different ways, such as extending the time a consumer has to return an item or the ability to dispute charges and get a refund, per Bankrate.

However, make sure to review the fine print in your card and what terms may apply.

"Credit card return protection is a notoriously fickle credit card perk that's increasingly rare," notes the Bankrate report.

In this article

YouTube and Fox announced Friday that the companies had reached a deal to keep Fox News, Fox Sports and other Fox channels available on YouTube TV, following negotiations over a new distribution agreement.

The companies had earlier reached a short-term extension to prevent disruptions for YouTube TV subscribers.

"We're pleased to have reached a deal that preserves the value of our service for our subscribers," YouTube said in a statement shared with CNBC. YouTube, owned by Alphabet, as well as Fox did not disclose the financial terms of the agreement.

YouTube had said Monday that Fox was asking for payments "far higher than what partners with comparable content offerings receive."

That comes after Fox launched Fox One, a standalone streaming service last week, costing $19.99 per month or $199.99 annually.

As a result of the standoff, YouTube had warned it may remove Fox Broadcast Network, Fox News and Fox Sports from its platform by 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday.

That could've seen YouTube TV subscribers miss out on a highly anticipated college football match between top-ranked Texas against reigning national champion and third-ranked Ohio State on Sunday, and possibly the start of the National Football League season early next month. 

Brendan Carr, chair of the Federal Communications Commission, weighed in Friday, saying he was happy the two companies had reached a deal. 

"This is great news for college football fans and avoids blackouts. Enjoy the games this weekend!" he said in a post on X. 

YouTube TV pays broadcasters such as Fox to stream their channels and has roughly 9.4 million subscribers.

In addition to American football, Fox hosts Major League Baseball games, as well as the World Series, which is scheduled to start in late October.

The base plan for YouTube TV costs $82.99 per month and includes over 100 live channels.

YouTube is America's leading media distributor in terms of audience engagement, capturing over 13% of TV watch-time in July, according to Nielsen.

Crypto prices have cooled today, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP all in the red. However, an analyst believes that Bitcoin is poised for its next surge, with significant upside potential ahead.

And while top altcoins await Bitcoin's greenlight, a new meme coin is already experiencing a pump. TOKEN6900 ($T6900) is the SPX6900-inspired meme coin that's going viral in its presale.

It has raised a total of $3 million so far, driven not by flashy branding, but by a shared belief in something bigger: that this project represents the pinnacle of financial regression and it's ready to take over the meme coin market.

Although the presale officially ended on Wednesday, the team has offered one final opportunity to secure the remaining $T6900 at a fixed price of $0.007125. However, this offer is limited, with the official exchange listing scheduled to take place at 2 pm UTC on September 3.

Crypto whales are investing heavily, aware that the growing hype and FOMO could lead to a sudden surge once the token is listed on exchanges. Recently, one whale invested $19,000 in the ICO, showing immense belief and conviction. Does he have information that something big is coming?

According to analyst Bitcoinsensus, Bitcoin is following an identical chart pattern to one formed in 2021 before its ATH, having broken a multi-month resistance level, only to turn it into support and retest it.

In 2021, the level in question was $40,000, but today that level is $110,000. The analyst suggests that this pattern indicates the next Bitcoin uptick is near, paving the way for a “vertical rally” that could push beyond $150K.

Is $BTC about to repeat the 2020 breakout? 📈🚨🔍 Same falling wedge breakout📊 Same retest & sideways range🔥 In 2020, this led to a vertical rally… 2025 setup looks identicalAre we on the edge of liftoff?#Bitcoin #Crypto pic.twitter.com/0vEmwuoDr6

This is excellent news for TOKEN6900 investors, as Bitcoin's upward momentum is likely to cause a surge in altcoin and meme coin prices. Yet TOKEN6900's early stage and untapped potential mean it could be one of the biggest benefactors.

Unlike SPX6900 or other established meme coins, TOKEN6900 has no prior resistance levels, psychological profit-taking targets, or historical trading patterns to limit its upside.

Instead, what matters most for TOKEN6900 is the collective belief in how much people truly value this project. And if it's anything like SPX6900, which peaked at over $2 billion, there's immense upside potential from its initial listing market cap of just $6 million – and there's very little in the way of achieving it.

Regarding tangible price targets, a Cryptonews analyst is predicting 100x gains. 

Although targeting 100x returns may seem ambitious for a new project, the numbers signal why:

Rallying 100x would elevate $T6900's market cap to $600 million – less than 30% of SPX6900's peak valuation. If Bitcoin breaks out and hits new highs, meme coin prices across the board will surge, and it's likely that SPX6900 also reaches new highs.

It's reasonable to expect TOKEN6900 to follow a similar bullish trajectory, especially given its strong momentum and the absence of technical price barriers ahead.

Moreover, its low market capitalization means that liquidity inflows would have a disproportionate price impact, helping it generate gains far more quickly than SPX6900 or other large-cap meme coins.

TOKEN6900 is following the playbook that created millionaires with SPX6900. Traders like Murad turned modest investments into tens of millions of dollars, and thousands of others rode the bullish trend to secure massive gains.

Like SPX6900, TOKEN6900 offers a glimpse into the economic circus that shaped you. It's not here to save the world or sweep you away from the absurdity of late capitalism – but it can help you navigate it. 

SPX6900 has rallied over 10,000% this year on similar rhetoric, outperforming the stock market's 50-year return without any real utility or fundamental value. This shows that collective belief and vibes are enough to send a price skyrocketing.

TOKEN6900 tokenizes attention, farms virality, and embraces the chaos of social-driven finance. It's a project built for the 2025 economy, where brain rot seems to be the new currency.

But with only five days until the launch, potential investors must lock in soon or risk paying a far higher price on exchanges.

Historical data around Bitcoin Magazine's annual U.S. Bitcoin Conference has shown a clear pattern of poor price performance for bitcoin during and just after the event. The indicator didn't disappoint in 2025, with bitcoin BTC$108,517.15 struggling in late May/early June alongside and then following this year's Las Vegas conference.

The logic behind that price action isn't that hard to decipher: in the weeks leading up to the show, conference organizers — looking to sell tickets and generate media coverage — overhype the speakers and what are sure to be "massive" announcements.

What follows is the usual cast of influencers, bitcoin OGs and newcomers to the sector (this year the Trumps) extolling "freedom money," "massive institutional and sovereign adoption," and "bitcoin to the moon."

How could the price do anything but dump?

For those not paying close attention, Bitcoin Magazine's Bitcoin Asia conference took place this week in Hong Kong.

The featured speakers included Eric Trump, CZ, Adam Back, Balaji Srinivasan and David Bailey. Among the subject matter covered — you guessed it — "freedom money," "massive institutional and sovereign adoption," and "bitcoin to the moon."

The price action: sharply lower.

At around $115,000 as attendees began arriving in Hong Kong earlier this week, bitcoin has tumbled to the current $108,400. This included about a 4% dive overnight in the U.S. (Friday in Hong Kong) as David Bailey and Eric Trump took the stage for a chat titled "Bitcoin Takes Over the World."

 After awarding millions of dollars, the Ethereum Foundation is overhauling its Ecosystem Support Program, shifting from open applications to a curated model. 

After funding hundreds of projects with millions of dollars, the Ethereum Foundation is temporarily pausing the Ecosystem Support Program's (ESP) open grant application process to refocus on a more proactive funding model that is better aligned with the ecosystem's strategic needs.

The transition comes as the foundation faces challenges reviewing the high volume of inbound applications, which it said has left “limited capacity to pursue new strategic opportunities.” 

In a Friday blog post, the Ethereum Foundation stressed that the ESP will continue funding new projects, but under a refined approach to grantmaking. More details are expected in the fourth quarter, including a curated methodology outlining specific ecosystem priorities.

In 2024, ESP awarded nearly $3 million across 105 projects and initiatives, supporting areas such as developer tooling, data and analytics, research and education. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the Ethereum Foundation distributed $32.6 million in total grants.

As a nonprofit established in 2014 by Ethereum's co-founders, the Ethereum Foundation has historically played a key role in providing funding, coordination and long-term vision for the blockchain's development, including major network upgrades.

In June, the foundation introduced a more transparent treasury policy detailing operational costs and cash requirements. As part of the commitment, it pledged to publish quarterly and annual disclosures of its assets, investments and any significant developments.

As the world's second-largest blockchain, Ethereum has strong backing from institutional investors and developers but faces growing competition from faster, lower-cost alternatives such as Solana, Avalanche and BNB Smart Chain, which market themselves as more scalable and user-friendly platforms.

As such, Ethereum is being steered toward a renewed focus on layer-1 scaling, reducing network costs and improving the overall user experience.

These priorities were highlighted in a separate foundation blog post on Friday, which described interoperability as “the highest-leverage opportunity within the broader UX domain over the next 6–12 months.”

Interoperability has become a central focus given the rapid proliferation of layer-2 protocols. While these solutions extend Ethereum's functionality, they also introduce new challenges, particularly fragmentation, the foundation said. 

Earlier this year, the foundation also launched a $1 trillion security initiative — a broad strategy designed to strengthen Ethereum's resilience and position the network for a wider, non-crypto audience.

Ethereum has already made inroads with financial institutions, with VanEck CEO Jan VanEck calling Ether (ETH) the “Wall Street token.” On stablecoins, he argued that the winning blockchain will be the one that attracts the most builders: “It's going to be Ethereum, or something that uses Ethereum's methodology.'”

This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

A key technical indicator is warning of an early end to the bitcoin BTC$108,517.15 bull market, even as traders continue to position for a continued rally into the year-end.

The indicator under consideration is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator that ranges from 0 to 100. It helps traders gauge the speed and magnitude of recent price movements, typically calculated over a 14-day, 14-week, or 14-month period.

BTC's 14-month RSI is now flashing a bearish divergence, a pattern that occurs when the indicator begins to decline while prices continue to rise. The occurrence of this divergence on the monthly chart indicates that BTC's bull market may be weakening and could potentially transition into a bearish trend.

The monthly chart shows that while BTC reached a new high in the July-August period, surpassing the December peak, the RSI moved in the opposite direction, forming a lower high.

The bearish divergence gains added significance as it coincides with BTC encountering resistance at a key trendline drawn from the previous bull market peaks of December 2017 and November 2021.

To cut to the chase, bulls should stay alert for potential bearish trend reversals. That said, the latest market flows suggest that traders are anticipating continued price gains.

"Blocks suggest traders are gearing up for further gains, with notable activity in December BTC call spreads ($125K/$160K). Ethereum's focus was on tighter topside, with $4,800 strikes active for September, and front-end pressure lifting," Jake Ostrovskis, OTC Trader at Wintermute, said in an email Thursday.

Block flows are large transactions privately negotiated over the counter and outside of the public order book. These transactions typically involve institutions and high-net-worth individuals.

The December call spread mentioned by Ostrovskis essentially bets on prices rallying to $160K and higher by the end of the year. The consensus is for a continued rally into the year-end and beyond, with prices reaching as high as $190,000. As of writing, BTC changed hands near $110,500, representing a 4.6% loss for the month, according to CoinDesk data.

Investors are pouring into Ethereum. 

Exchange-traded funds for Ethereum raked in $4 billion in August alone, according to data from SoSoValue. 

If that amount stays constant, it would reach $50 billion in annualised flow — surpassing the $36 billion Bitcoin ETFs pulled in last year, according to Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management.

And there's much more money to go around, Hougan said in an August 28 interview. 

“There's a relentless bid for Ethereum ETFs,” Hougan told podcaster Scott Melker. “It's a flood of money into a relatively small asset, which is why the chart looks so good. And I think it's going to continue for the rest of the year.”

The surge in investor interest for Ethereum represents a dramatic reversal for an asset that many had written off just months ago.

Last year, broker dealers said they struggled to convince investors to bet on Ethereum ETFs.

And even though Ether's new all-time high proved short-lived, market watchers are predicting the token's price can go anywhere from $7,500 by year-end to $20,000 at some point in the current cycle. 

Instead of Bitcoin, institutional investors are deploying capital straight into Ethereum.

That's because they're drawn in by fresh regulation that should further cement its stablecoin dominance — nearly half of the $283 billion market lives on Ethereum — the potential $19 trillion tokenisation boom, and staking yields that Bitcoin doesn't offer. 

“The other day, I was on with a multi-billion dollar adviser. They wanted everything else besides Bitcoin,” Hougan said. 

“And they ended up just buying an Ethereum ETF because that's all they can access.”

Some, like Jan van Eck, CEO of investment manager VanECk, are even calling Ethereum the “Wall Street token.” 

For years, Bitcoin advocates have been calling the top crypto digital gold.

But most professional investors don't hold gold — meaning the narrative falls flat to most capital allocators, Hougan argued . 

“Maybe 15, maybe 20% of them own gold,” Hougan said. “The other 80% just own stocks. And I think there's a lot of people who look at Bitcoin and are like, yeah, it's digital gold. I don't own gold, but I do own technology stocks.”

Ethereum, meanwhile, fits their framework: it's a tech play with cash flows, real-world utility, and has become the skeleton for tokenisation projects from BlackRock to JPMorgan. 

Sprinkle the voraciousness of Ethereum treasury companies in adding Ether to their balance sheets, and a rising price should follow suit. 

For Hougan, whose watching institutional money flood in at unprecedented rates, even the recent pullback is just noise. 

“There is no market pullback for them,” he said. “They still see it in a raging bull market.”

HONG KONG — The Trump family “loves” the Bitcoin community, Eric Trump said in Hong Kong on Friday, predicting that its value could hit $1 million as concerns mount over conflicts of interest in his latest venture set to go public.

Trump said his family became interested in cryptocurrency when it was cut off from banking services “because my father was in politics.” 

“The Bitcoin community embraced my father, unlike anything I had ever seen before,” Trump said at the Bitcoin Asia conference here.

“And I hope that's paid off in spades, because we love this community,” he said, sitting in front of a screen with a live ticker showing the cryptocurrency's price at nearly $110,000, up from about $70,000 on the day his father, Donald Trump, was voted back into office in November. 

Eric Trump has attracted an almost cult-like following in the crypto industry, which was apparent in Hong Kong as hundreds of attendees — some dressed up in outfits ranging from sparkly robes to white suits covered in Bitcoin symbols — cheered as Trump took the stage, bashed his father's predecessor, Joe Biden, and said, “This is the time to buy.”

The cryptocurrency industry has become big business for the Trump family, whose patriarch has become one of its biggest champions since it helped return him to office. 

Feeling unfairly targeted by the Biden administration, the industry was a political force in the 2024 election season, directing an estimated $135 million in donations toward Trump and other crypto-friendly candidates.

Since then, the Trump family has only become further enmeshed in the industry — no one more so than Eric Trump, who said Friday that “90% of my time in life is in this community.”

His latest venture is called American Bitcoin. Launched in March with his older brother, Donald Trump Jr., and the Nasdaq-listed Hut 8, a crypto energy infrastructure company, American Bitcoin aims to be the “world's largest, most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner while building a robust strategic Bitcoin reserve,” according to a news release.

Eric Trump said Friday that the company will be going public “very soon” as it merges with a pre-existing Nasdaq-listed company called Gryphon Digital Mining.

“We are one of the biggest Bitcoin mining companies on Earth,” he said. “We mine about 3% of the world's Bitcoin every single day.”

He insists that the family's business is separate from national politics and has dismissed concerns about conflicts of interest. 

“My father's totally shielded off from our company. There's total separation of church and state,” he told CNBC in December. “We have great ethics advisers. We take it incredibly seriously.”

But Donald Trump was a major topic of discussion at his son's Q&A in Hong Kong, which began with a round of applause for the president, who has vowed to make the United States the “crypto capital of the world.”

Since returning to office in January, Trump has pushed to ease regulation of the industry, shut down the Justice Department's national cryptocurrency enforcement team, appointed a “crypto czar” and held a White House summit for industry leaders. He also said the U.S. would create a national strategic crypto reserve.

This month he signed an executive order allowing cryptocurrency and real estate investments to be included in 401(k) retirement accounts, which critics say could put Americans' retirement savings at risk. 

Trump has also sought legislative backing for a form of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins, some of which is already in place. One of the three bills that received support on Capitol Hill last month was the GENIUS Act, which allows stablecoins to be issued by private companies.

The passage of the bills was slammed by Americans for Financial Reform, a left-leaning watchdog group, which said in a statement last month that Trump and his allies would “personally benefit from limitless legalized corruption while the rest of us stand in harm's way of the next crypto implosion.”

Trump, who said in 2021 that Bitcoin “seems like a scam,” has since embraced it as a moneymaking opportunity, sometimes at great cost to investors. According to the watchdog group State Democracy Defenders Fund, as of mid-March his crypto assets were valued at $2.9 billion, or about 37% of his total wealth.

Much of that money, which Trump earned in about six months, came from ventures such as the $TRUMP coin that he launched ahead of his inauguration, which was trading at nearly $8 on Friday, down from its peak of $73 in January. A meme coin was also launched for first lady Melania Trump.

Industry professionals call these meme coins, meaning they have little practical use and are mostly symbolic, making their value subject to extreme volatility. About 764,000 wallets of mostly small holders lost money on $TRUMP while 58 wallets made more than $10 million each, CNBC reported in May, citing data from the blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.

In May, Trump briefly appeared at a dinner outside Washington for the 220 largest buyers of $TRUMP, who spent an average of $1 million on the token.  

Trump also has a large stake in World Liberty Financial, a decentralized crypto exchange that was launched last fall and is majority-controlled by the Trump family.

World Liberty's flagship project is its $WLFI stablecoin, which holders voted last month to make more widely tradable. The family also stands to gain from an agreement by a technology company backed by the government of the United Arab Emirates to invest $2 billion in one of World Liberty's stablecoin products.

That currency will then be used to invest in Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, whose CEO stepped down in 2023 after the company pleaded guilty to money laundering and other charges.

The deal was announced at a crypto conference Eric Trump attended in Abu Dhabi shortly before his father visited the United Arab Emirates city in May.

Even amid the enthusiasm at the Hong Kong conference on Friday, participants said there was some discomfort around the Trump family's involvement in the cryptocurrency industry. 

“There is serious conflict of interest, and people recognize it,” said Bharat Prabhakar, 25, a New York-based conference attendee. "But not a lot of people say it out loud because there's real consequences for it."

                            The U.S. Department of Commerce just published GDP data on Bitcoin, Ethereum & 7 more blockchains. | Credit: Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images                        


Key Takeaways

In a groundbreaking move, the U.S. Department of Commerce has begun publishing official economic data directly onto public blockchains.

At its core, the initiative treats economic data as a public good, a resource that should be open, verifiable, and equally accessible to all.

Through partnerships with two leading oracle providers, Chainlink and Pyth , core indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP), real personal consumption expenditures, and private domestic sales are now verifiable on 9 blockchain networks, including:

This initiative reflects  the Trump administration's push toward greater transparency in government spending and accountability.

Instead of filtering through agency reports, news outlets, or data aggregators, citizens and institutions can now access official statistics directly from blockchain infrastructure—immutable, timestamped, and globally available.

For blockchain advocates, the significance  is twofold: government adoption of decentralized technology is no longer theoretical, and trusted economic data has become programmable within decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems.

Gross domestic product or GDP, a nation's total economic output, has always been a political and financial touchstone. Markets move, policies shift, and businesses plan around its quarterly updates.

But traditional publication methods rely on centralized servers and intermediaries—making them vulnerable to manipulation, selective access, or delays.



Publishing GDP and related metrics on-chain offers several benefits:

In this sense, the blockchain doesn't just distribute numbers—it creates a shared foundation of trust in economic reporting.

At the heart of this initiative are blockchain, middleware that bridges real-world data with decentralized networks.

Oracles solve a key problem: blockchains are self-contained and cannot natively access external information.

Together, these oracles ensure data integrity using cryptographic proofs and decentralized validation.

Their role isn't just technical—they're now custodians of government transparency, chosen to handle some of the most sensitive economic figures in the world.

For years, blockchain advocates pitched decentralized tech as a way to improve public services. Critics often dismissed it as hype.

But the Department of Commerce's adoption signals a shift: blockchain is being recognized as a serious infrastructure for distributing public information.



This isn't the first time governments have experimented with blockchain, but it is among the most impactful. Earlier efforts focused on land registries, supply chains, or digital IDs. Economic data—arguably the backbone of democratic accountability—marks a more central and politically sensitive use case.

The Department of Commerce said : “Publishing GDP on-chain is not just about embracing new technology—it's about giving citizens the tools to hold us accountable with verifiable, tamper-proof data.”

If successful, other agencies could follow. Inflation measures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, budget allocations from the Treasury, or even census data could be next.

On-chain GDP data doesn't just benefit transparency advocates. It has direct implications for decentralized finance.

 

For Wall Street, the integration is equally meaningful. Hedge funds already use high-frequency feeds from Pyth.

With government data now available, algorithmic trading strategies can consume official statistics instantly—without waiting for them to trickle through legacy newswires.

Despite the promise, putting GDP on the blockchain isn't without risks.

These caveats don't negate the value, but they highlight the need for thoughtful rollout and safeguards.

The U.S. isn't alone in experimenting with blockchain for public transparency. Countries from Estonia to Singapore have tested distributed ledgers for public registries and finance.

But the scale and symbolism of putting data on-chain set this case apart.

If the experiment succeeds, it may inspire:

In a world where trust in institutions is fragile, blockchain provides a technical solution for verifiability.

The Department of Commerce's partnership could thus become a template for governments navigating both digital transformation and public skepticism.

Why does this matter beyond crypto and finance? Because information is power.

When only a few institutions control access to economic statistics, public trust erodes—especially in times of political tension.

Publishing GDP on-chain flips that paradigm. It empowers citizens, journalists, academics, and investors to verify data independently.

It removes ambiguity over whether numbers were “massaged” for political ends. And it does so in a way that's globally accessible, not limited to those with expensive terminals or institutional subscriptions.

Douro Labs CEO, Michael Cahill, welcomed the initiative .

“Today is a historic day,” he said.

“For the first time ever, official U.S. government data has been published to the blockchain for use in smart contracts and it was done over the Pyth Network. Making the data instantly accessible to over 600 connected applications across more than 100 blockchains.”

“Secretary Howard W. Lutnick and his team are pushing the boundaries of innovation as they modernize and position the United States to be the worldwide blockchain leader,” he added.

According to Jonathon Chambless , founder of LV8RLABS, “This collaboration marks a significant step in bridging traditional government data with the world of decentralized finance.”

“This partnership is a strong signal of the growing adoption of blockchain technology by government agencies and highlights the crucial role of oracles like Chainlink in connecting blockchains with real-world data.”

The Department of Commerce's decision to publish GDP and related economic indicators on public blockchains is more than a technical milestone. It represents a cultural and political one.

Blockchain, once dismissed as niche, is now being trusted to handle some of the nation's most important data.

Chainlink and Pyth are proving that oracles are not just for DeFi price feeds—they can be the infrastructure for government transparency.

The future could see a world where inflation rates, unemployment figures, and even election results are verified on-chain. Whether this vision unfolds smoothly will depend on regulation, adoption, and education. But one thing is clear: the line between government and decentralized technology has blurred.

GDP on the blockchain is no longer a metaphor. It's a reality—and perhaps the first glimpse of a more open, accountable digital future.

What does it mean to put GDP on the blockchain?


Publishing GDP on the blockchain means that official U.S. government economic data, such as gross domestic product, is uploaded directly to decentralized networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This ensures the information is immutable (cannot be changed), globally accessible, and verifiable by anyone.




Why is the Department of Commerce using Chainlink and Pyth?


The Department of Commerce selected oracle providers Chainlink and Pyth because they specialize in securely transmitting real-world data to blockchains. Chainlink distributes data like real GDP and consumer expenditures, while Pyth publishes GDP statistics directly. These oracles act as trusted bridges between traditional government databases and decentralized systems.




How could this impact DeFi and financial markets?


By making GDP data available on-chain, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols can build products that automatically respond to macroeconomic trends. For example, lending platforms could adjust collateral requirements based on GDP growth, while synthetic assets or derivatives could track government-reported data in real time. Hedge funds and institutional traders may also plug these feeds into algorithmic strategies.




What risks or challenges come with publishing economic data on-chain?


While blockchain adds transparency, challenges remain. Errors at the source (such as revisions to GDP numbers) still propagate onto the blockchain. Concentrating trust in just two oracle providers creates potential risks if they fail or are compromised. Additionally, raw numbers without context may confuse citizens, and some lawmakers remain cautious about embedding government data into crypto infrastructure.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

On Friday, the Ethereum Foundation outlined a multi-track roadmap to make Ethereum feel “like one chain again,” publishing a protocol update that prioritizes faster confirmations, trust-minimized cross-chain interactions, and new UX and privacy tooling on crypto's second-largest blockchain.

The plan introduces a trio of workstreams dubbed “Initialisation,” “Acceleration,” and “Finalisation.” It also shares deliverables and target dates extending into 2026, according to the official blog post.

Under the Initialisation stream, EF engineers and ecosystem teams are rolling out an Open Intents Framework that lets users express desired outcomes. Additionally, developers proposed an Ethereum Interoperability Layer aimed at facilitating trustless transactions across Layer 2 networks, along with a set of standards designed to reduce friction. 

"The Ethereum Interoperability Layer (EIL) focuses on making Ethereum feel like one chain again, without compromising on CROPS values (censorship-resistance, open-source, privacy, and security), developers wrote.  Production contracts for the intents framework are live, with audits and a reference solver due by Q4 2025.  A public design document for the Interoperability Layer is scheduled for release in October.

Acceleration, the second stream, targets latency. A fast L1 confirmation rule—giving strong confirmations in roughly 15–30 seconds—will be specified and implemented across consensus clients, with broad availability targeted for Q1 2026.

Parallel work explores halving slot times from 12 seconds to 6 seconds to shorten the inclusion and finality periods. There are also plans to support optimistic rollups that adopt ZK-based real-time proving or a secure “2-of-3” faster settlement mechanism to reduce withdrawal delays.

The Finalisation stream pushes toward research and development of real-time proving, or snarkification, for cross-chain settlement and materially faster Layer 1 finality.  Snarkifying or snarkification refers to utilizing zero-knowledge proofs, specifically ZK-SNARKS, to improve the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) environment.

According to the Aug. 29 blog update, developers are exploring options such as changes to the beacon chain, three-slot finality designs, and alternative consensus protocols that reduce finality to seconds if proven safe and decentralized.

The latest protocol update ties the UX agenda to two ongoing EF initiatives aimed at advancing Ethereum's global computer plan. First, Phase 2 of the “Trillion Dollar Security” program, which focuses on safer signing, key management, and wallet standards.

It also links to “Kohaku,” a privacy wallet effort co-led by Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin and EF coordinator Nicolas Consigny. It aims to ship an SDK and an advanced browser extension with private addresses, balances, and sends backed by a light client.

In other related news, onchain activity on Ethereum has surged while developers work to improve the blockchain's engine room. The Block reported that monthly onchain volume surpassed $320 billion, a four-year high and the third-highest level ever.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

The popular NFT brand Pudgy Penguins and FIFA Rivals creator Mythical Games announced the global launch of the web3 mobile game Pudgy Party on Friday.

Pudgy Party is a lighthearted party-royale title set in a world of fast-paced mini-games, featuring a cast of recognizable Pudgy Penguins characters with distinct traits, powers, and personalities, according to a statement shared with The Block. Every match is designed to feel fresh and unpredictable, with rotating challenges and unexpected twists to ensure that no two parties are the same.

"The heart of Pudgy Penguins has always been about connection and spreading good vibes," Pudgy Penguins CEO Luca Netz said. "Bringing our beloved, viral characters to life in a mobile multiplayer game is an exciting step forward in our mission to create joyful, meaningful experiences for our growing global community. Pudgy Party is fun, accessible to players of all ages, and designed to bring people together."

Players can customize their penguins with outfits, emotes, and collectibles — some non-tradable, others limited-edition and tradable via Mythical's marketplace, with the option to mint, upgrade, and fuse rare items into NFTs on Mythical's EVM-compatible Polkadot parachain, Mythos Chain. 

The game also features seasonal events with meme-inspired costumes, global leaderboards, and real-time tournaments where players compete for prizes and rankings, starting with "Dopameme Rush" on Aug. 29. Pudgy Party aims to combine party-game charm with blockchain-powered ownership and community-driven play.

"Pudgy Penguins is one of the few web3 brands that has successfully broken through to mainstream audiences, thanks to their strong retail presence and highly engaged community," Mythical Games CEO John Linden added. "We're thrilled to launch Pudgy Party with them and bring this playful IP to gamers around the world. This is exactly the kind of project that shows how web3 can deliver fun, value, and accessibility to everyone."

Plans for the Pudgy Party game were first unveiled in May 2024. Earlier this week, a soulbound token called "Early to the Party" was awarded to those who pre‑registered, offering them a non‑transferable digital badge ahead of the launch.

Pudgy Party is free to download on iOS and Android and follows Pudgy Penguins' launch of its desktop-based Pudgy Worlds game, Solana-based PENGU token, and the rollout of its penguin plushies and other collectibles in Walmart stores last year.

A Pudgy Party spokesperson told The Block that although the new game does not include the PENGU token at launch, the Pudgy Penguins and Mythical Games teams are exploring "interesting ways" to integrate PENGU, MYTH, and other tokens in the future.

Pudgy Penguins is currently the second-largest NFT collection by floor price, according to The Block's data dashboard. It ranks fourth by market cap, valued at $417.4 million compared to $2.1 billion for market leader CryptoPunks.

Bitcoin BTC$108,517.15 has dropped nearly 3% to $109,800 in the past 24 hours, pulling the broader market, including ether (ETH), down with it. But those losses are nothing out of the ordinary, meaning major tokens are trading near recent valuations.

What's new today is that BTC's volatility is bouncing from recent multiyear lows (See Chart of the Day). The 30-day implied volatility, as represented by Volmex's BVIV and Deribit's DVOL indices, has surged above the 100-day simple moving average for the first time since mid-June. Perhaps the price turbulence that some traders predicted for August may unfold in September.

The increase could be noteworthy for stock traders as an early indicator of a potential uptick in Wall Street's VIX. The VIX is inversely correlated with stocks, suggesting there's of a rough day ahead on Wall Street, a possibility underlined by fiat liquidity dynamics.

"Market liquidity pressures are mounting as reserve balances decline and large Treasury settlements approach, leaving equities vulnerable despite lower volatility," Michael Kramer, the founder of Mott Capital Management, wrote in the latest edition of the firm's markets update.

One piece of data to keep an eye on is the U.S. core PCE release, due later today.

"This PCE release will shape the Fed's future easing path rather than the September decision itself," analysts from crypto exchange Bitunix wrote in an email. "If data comes in at or below expectations, risk sentiment can hold; but if significantly hotter, the Fed's forward guidance may shift toward a 'one-and-wait' stance. Investors should focus on core services and wage trends, alongside U.S. Treasury yields and the DXY as key drivers of risk appetite."

In the event of a soft CPI, ether may outperform because traders have been increasingly focusing on Ethereum's native token. That's evident from the ETF flows. This week, the U.S.-listed ETH ETFs have registered a net inflow of over $1 billion, SoSoValue data show. That's close to double the $567 million entering the bitcoin ETFs.

In traditional markets, the spread between the U.S. 10- and two-year Treasury yields has risen to the highest since September 2022. The so-called curve steepening supports the bullish case in gold and bitcoin. Stay alert!

The CoinDesk Policy & Regulation conference (formerly known as State of Crypto) is a one-day boutique event held in Washington on Sept. 10 that allows general counsels, compliance officers and regulatory executives to meet with public officials responsible for crypto legislation and regulatory oversight.

 Bitcoin whale behavior remains "spoofy" as crypto traders flag BTC price patterns repeating this week with US inflation data incoming. 

Key points:

Bitcoin whales take the blame as “spoofy” transactions send BTC price action below $110,000.

The Bitcoin “whale playbook” means that price is repeating behavior from earlier in August.

US PCE inflation data is under the microscope as the next potential market mover.

Bitcoin (BTC) fell nearly 3% Friday as attention again focused on whale selling.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed that BTC/USD fell by $3,000 in hours to local lows of $109,436 on Bitstamp.

As crypto long liquidations hit $350 million over 24 hours, traders placed the blame on whales.

“This isn't noise. It's the whale playbook,” trader Merlijn wrote in an X post on Friday.

Merlijn flagged large inflows into market maker Wintermute involving BTC and the largest altcoin, Ether (ETH). 

As Cointelegraph continues to report, whale selling pressure has influenced BTC price behavior throughout August, resulting in a trip below $109,000 earlier this week.

“$BTC has been doing the same thing again and again,” fellow trader BitBull continued, describing a pattern of consolidation, capitulation, breakouts and rallies.

“Looking at the BTC chart, we are in the capitulation phase. This could last for a few weeks and will provide good entries. Keep an eye on it,” he told X followers.

Keith Alan, co-founder of trading resource Material Indicators, agreed that the actions of liquidity owners appeared manipulative.

Alan brought back the entity he had previously dubbed “Spoofy The Whale,” referring to deliberate liquidity shifts to influence price action and trap other traders.

“Looks like ‘Spoofy' is up to his usual games, which adds some predictability to the short term price action,” he summarized in an X post.

Other factors that play into BTC price weakness include macroeconomic tensions surrounding US inflation data.

The Federal Reserve's “preferred” inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index, was due at 8:30 am Eastern Time.

Inflation data is of prime importance to crypto and risk assets ahead of the Fed's predicted interest-rate cut in September.

“Fed's favorite gauge could either fuel the dump… or light the relief rally,” crypto analysis host Kyle Doops argued, adding that Bitcoin was “wobbling” ahead of the PCE print.

I remember the first time I was asked to evaluate a major technological shift. I was a college student studying accounting in the mid-1990s, and one of my projects was to decide if the Internet could become a viable platform for commerce. My group and I researched, ran the numbers, made the presentations and gave the answer that felt obvious: No, the Internet would not work.

At the time, we couldn't imagine using a credit card online. Or buying shoes on a computer. Like many people then, we underestimated what would become the most important technological advancement of our lives. How wrong we were.





In the long run, though, my college experience would give me a deeper understanding of the forces of innovation. When I first encountered crypto in 2017, I saw parallels to the internet, including what I missed the first time. I saw a similar structure, incentives and also a sense of inevitability. That insight led me to found Pure Crypto, a digital asset investment firm which was the best-performing hedge fund-of-funds globally between 2018 and 2025. 





Since launching Pure Crypto, I've watched digital assets transform from a fringe experiment into a Wall Street-approved asset class. Despite this, I believe crypto is still in its early days. It sounds counterintuitive to call something “early” when it's created trillions in value, but consider how few people own crypto — only about 6.8% of people globally at the end of 2024. For comparison, at the time of the dot-com crash, less than 7% of the world was online, and some of the Internet's most transformative platforms hadn't even arrived yet. Facebook didn't exist until 2004.





What that tells me is simple: When a transformative technology arrives, the window of opportunity is longer and bigger than it looks.




One of the biggest shifts in my approach — and maybe the reason I didn't misjudge crypto like I did the Internet — was learning to dig deeper. When I initially dismissed the Internet as a viable commercial platform, I didn't understand the infrastructure. I looked at the surface — what seemed possible then — instead of understanding what might come next. With crypto, I've made an effort to be more tenaciously curious. I ask different questions now:





What's the architecture? What does this protocol actually enable? Is it solving a real-world problem or is it just noise? I'm not a computer scientist or developer, and I don't pretend to be. But I've learned that understanding the fundamentals changes the way you see the space.





When I evaluate crypto, I try to treat it like infrastructure, not speculation. I want to know how a system creates trust without intermediaries, what incentives are built into the design and whether it unlocks new behaviors or markets that weren't possible before.





One thing crypto taught me quickly: you can't do this alone. It's such a fast-moving, interdisciplinary space that no one can fully keep up on their own. Early on, I realized my best shot at understanding the landscape wasn't about being the smartest person in the room. It was about being in rooms where I could learn.





That's become a theme throughout my journey. Some of the most important insights I've gained in this space haven't come from a spreadsheet or whitepaper, but from conversations. From putting myself around people who were thinking deeply about this technology in ways I wasn't yet.




Finally, if there's one thing I've come to believe about innovation, it's that the most important shifts don't happen overnight.





The early Internet dates back to the 1950s — but it took decades to evolve from an academic tool into a global engine of commerce. Crypto reminds me of that timeline. The hype cycles come and go, but the underlying arc — turbulent, relentless — keeps bending forward.





Over the years, I've trained myself to stay focused on the longer-term horizon. To tune out the noise and look for the quieter signals: where real adoption is happening, where infrastructure is quietly being built and where people are solving hard problems, not chasing trends. Patience isn't flashy. But it might be the most underappreciated edge in a space like this.





I missed the Internet wave. I've been doing everything I can not to miss this one.

CRO price prediction is heating up after Cronos recorded its biggest surge in 3 years, breaking the $0.30 mark.

The crypto surged by an eye-popping 154% in just three sessions after Trump Media & Technology Group announced the acquisition of 6.31 billion CRO tokens, worth around $1 billion, and the integration of Cronos into Truth Social as its platform token.

Cronos broke out on August 26th at a trading price of $0.152 and quickly shot up to create a new high of $0.389. Gains from July has reached nearly 400% with investors booking profit, resulting in a pullback. 

CRO price is currently hovering at $0.29 with a 14.37% drop in the last 24 hours. The decline was natural as the price had already extended from the breakout. 

Meanwhile, the demand for the viral layer-2 project Bitcoin Hyper is soaring. The project has already raised over $12.5 million in its ongoing presale and is gaining significant traction as the first Bitcoin L2 blockchain addressing congestion issues.

The crypto market continues to be dynamic, with huge volatility, bringing Cronos into focus as investors witness an overwhelming price surge. The partnership between Trump Media and Crypto.com to set up a CRO treasury has impacted the price significantly. 

With this acquisition, Trump Media has become the largest CRO token holder in the world, holding nearly 19% of the total supply. 

Currently, Cronos is trading at $0.29, with a 33% drop in its trading volume over the last 24 hours. A lower time frame analysis shows that the $0.28-$0.29 zone has been acting as a strong support level, with the price bouncing from this level twice. It was also a resistance level on the upmove, but has now become a deciding demand zone.

A Crypto Pulse analyst recently posted that the CRO price is currently cooling off after its recent run. He pointed to an ascending trendline of support and noted that if the trendline were to fail, the price could drive another correction.  

The analyst predicts that $0.29 will be the first strong support level, and the second will be $0.25-$0.27, which is also a strong demand zone. He pointed out the levels to be dip buy opportunities for a possible bounce.

The price has stretched too far, and even though optimism is high, the CRO price prediction remains cautious:



The risk-to-reward ratio in Cronos looks weak as the downside risk outweighs the chances of an upmove, while whales are already moving funds to projects drawing strong investor interest like Bitcoin Hyper.

Bitcoin Hyper is the first layer-2 to introduce smart and scalable smart contracts to the Bitcoin ecosystem. It is upgrading the current capabilities of the Bitcoin network with a Solana Virtual Machine integration and bringing transaction speeds up from seven TPS to thousands of TPS.

The primary utility of this platform is that it acts as a bridge for investors who want to use their BTC capital for modern decentralized applications like staking and programming smart contracts. With this, users can simply drop their BTC on the virtual layer and mint fresh equivalent tokens to use in the Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem.



What makes Bitcoin Hyper the best crypto to buy now:

The platform is modernizing the Bitcoin blockchain, addressing the only issue it has faced since its inception. This positions Bitcoin Hyper as one of the leading architectural crypto projects. As the user base of this virtual layer-2 on top of Bitcoin increases, the demand is expected to fuel an exponential surge in the HYPER token's value.

 Bitcoin may see a deeper correction toward $103,000 after losing a key support level, new price analysis concludes. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin needs a weekly close above $114,000 to avoid a deeper correction and reaffirm bullish strength.

Failure to hold $112,000 and a bear flag breakdown could trigger drop to $103,700.

Bitcoin (BTC) may avoid an “ugly” correction to lower levels if BTC/USD ends the week above $114,000, according to traders and analysts.

Bitcoin price is heading for its third consecutive week of losses, 11% below its Aug. 14 all-time high of $124,500, per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView. 

Bitcoin dropped below the crucial level of $114,000, a level that has supported the price over the previous six weeks, as shown in the chart below. 

Related: Bitcoin megaphone pattern targets $260K as BTC price screams ‘oversold'BTC price must flip this level into support to confirm the strength of the uptrend, according to trader and YouTuber Sam Price.

“Bitcoin bulls are defending $109K support nicely,” Price said in an X post on Thursday, adding:

The long wick below $109,000 signalled “solid buy pressure,“ suggesting that bulls are aggressively defending this support level.

Analyst Rekt Capital said that it was important for Bitcoin to reclaim $114,000 as support to avoid a prolonged correction period.

“Turning $114K into new resistance would prolong the pullback period,” the analyst said in a Thursday X post, adding:

As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin's price outlook hinged on holding above $112,000. 

Similar sentiments were shared by MN Capital founder Michael van de Poppe, who spotted Bitcoin trading at $112,800 on Thursday and said that the support at $112,000 was “crucial” for BTC price. 

Bitcoin had dipped below this support as of Friday, validating a bear flag on the four-hour chart, as shown.

A bear flag suggests a continuation of the bearish momentum, with sellers taking control.

Note that the price was rejected from the upper boundary of the flag, which is around $114,000, and has dropped below the lower boundary, which coincides with $112,000.

The measured move target from the pattern suggests a potential decline toward $103,700, representing a 6% drop from the current level.

The relative strength index remains below the mid-line, confirming the bearish momentum.

Liquidation data shows bid clusters all the way down to $104,000, suggesting that BTC price is likely to sink deeper to grab liquidity around this level.

 Altcoins are a dynamic and often speculative segment of the crypto market, offering a wide range of investment opportunities. Their value can fluctuate significantly based on factors such as perceived utility, technological innovation, market sentiment, or pure speculation. While some altcoins support innovative blockchain applications, many—including meme coins—lack fundamental value and trade primarily on hype, making them especially volatile. 


 With over 18,000 altcoins available, investors must conduct thorough due diligence before investing in any project. This includes researching the technology, development team, use case, and tokenomics of each coin. For risk averse investors, alternatives such as crypto-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or regulated staking services. 


 Altcoins, short for "alternative coins," are any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin (and sometimes Ethereum). The first altcoins, Namecoin and Litecoin, were created in 2011 as developers sought to improve upon Bitcoin's limitations. Now, these tokens can serve a variety of purposes such as governance rights, smart contracts, decentralised finance (DeFi), and native network transactions, which gives them their value. Many altcoins are directly tied to innovations within their ecosystems, meaning increased adoption and utility can drive corresponding increases in token value. 


 For investors, altcoins with strong fundamentals from reputable projects can be a good portfolio diversification option. They're also a good initial way to get your first exposure to cryptocurrency markets, especially if you have limited capital. 


 However, the speculative nature of altcoins creates significant variation in profitability, with smaller-capitalization or lesser-known projects sometimes outperforming larger, potentially better known altcoins, rewarding risk-tolerant investors who were willing to hold positions long-term.


 Altcoins can be extremely volatile, particularly during periods of Bitcoin volatility, due to a phenomenon called Bitcoin dominance. When Bitcoin dominance is high, altcoins typically experience slower growth as investors prefer to allocate capital to Bitcoin, but when Bitcoin fever subsides, investors often rotate their funds into alternative cryptocurrencies, creating opportunities for altcoins to grow.


 Regulatory risk represents one of the most serious threats to altcoin investments, as demonstrated by events surrounding the SEC v. Ripple case. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Ripple with selling XRP as an unregistered security. As the case ground on, investor confidence eroded. XRP fell from a March 2021 price peak of about 1.59 to a range between 0.33 and 0.69 from May 2022 to September 2024.


 Before investing in any altcoin, you should check if the project faces current or foreseeable regulatory challenges, as legal battles can severely impact token prices regardless of the project's underlying fundamentals.


 Like every other asset class, altcoins can be subject to scams and “rug pulls,” where developers abandon projects after collecting investor funds. While no approach is completely fail-safe, it's advisable to stick with altcoins listed on popular, regulated exchanges. These exchanges also provide additional security measures and regulatory oversight that can help protect investors from market manipulation, though you should still conduct your own research.


 When buying altcoins, be wary of new projects with no price history or proven performance track record. It's generally better to invest in tokens that are at least one to two years old and have demonstrated consistent value, one study says, especially in comparison to new projects promising instant returns within incredibly short timeframes. Also, technical vulnerabilities can significantly impact altcoin prices.


 For example, Solana has experienced multiple technical vulnerabilities, including core protocol outages, that created fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) among investors, causing the price to fall sharply at those times Sudden moves like that can immediately lead to huge unrealized losses.


 Altcoins can be exciting investments, and you might be tempted to allocate a large percentage of your portfolio to them, especially during bullish markets when prices are rising rapidly. But it's more prudent beforehand to determine how many tokens you want to purchase based on how much money you are willing to risk, and stick to those limits regardless of market momentum. Remember that cryptocurrencies are a highly volatile asset class, and if you become overweight in altcoins, even small changes in the market could significantly tilt your portfolio, affecting its overall performance.


 Staking offers a lower-risk alternative to trading altcoins. It's a process that—in short—pays you crypto for locking up coins with normal volatility, like Cardano, and even stable coins like USDC for a specific period. Basically, you lend your crypto to others, who pay interest. This approach carries less risk and is as easy as putting money into a savings account.


 DeFi yield farming provides higher returns than staking but with more complexity and risk. In yield farming, you provide liquidity to decentralized protocols in exchange for interest and rewards, though this strategy demands deep technical knowledge and exposes you to smart contract risks, impermanent loss, and potential protocol failures. 


 Crypto ETFs, trusts, and tokenized index funds offer the most regulated and diversified approach to outright altcoin exposure. These vehicles give you diversified exposure to multiple altcoins through traditional brokerage accounts. Meanwhile, you benefit from professional management and regulatory oversight, which are far less available to individuals trading directly in altcoin.


 Altcoins, especially lower-cap ones, allow you to invest with as little as $10 in some cases, providing an excellent opportunity to test the waters and see what fits your portfolio without significant capital commitment. When investing, avoid concentrating on just one narrative since the cryptocurrency market spans diverse sectors such as gaming, media, NFTs, and AI. Instead, choose altcoins from at least two to three different narratives. This diversified approach helps reduce concentration risk while allowing you to benefit from different growth cycles.


 When buying altcoins, only buy those that can be stored on reputable and secure wallets or bought through well-recognised exchanges. These steps will help you avoid hassles over accessibility, security, and liquidity. This approach also ensures you maintain control over your assets.


 Always monitor general news and changing regulations, as these can quickly impact your altcoin holdings. Also, follow the projects you've invested in on X (formerly Twitter) to receive timely updates that might lead you to adjust your investment strategy to suit changing market conditions and new developments.


 If you are directly buying altcoins through spot trading, have a solid exit and profit-taking strategy in place before making any investment. You should predetermine when to exit if prices fall to a specific level below your entry point, as well as how to take profits at predetermined levels above your entry price. This disciplined approach will minimize your losses and prevent you from losing much or all of your capital in the event something goes catastrophically wrong and the altcoin goes to zero, as happened with Terraform Lab's LUNA and TerraUSD.


 Altcoins offer a low barrier to entry for investors looking to diversify their portfolio through cryptocurrency. However, before you begin researching these alternative assets, remember they are subject to high volatility, even more than Bitcoin. Thoroughly research any project you are interested in, checking for vital signs like utility, tokenomics, and regulatory status.


 While some altcoins come with risks like rug pulls and unverifiable track records, there are still many altcoins that can pass these checks and make a good fit for your portfolio. If you're willing to invest in them indirectly, you can explore ETFs, staking, DeFi yield farming, and tokenised index funds. In all, do not yield to Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) when investing in altcoins. Have an entry point, an exit strategy, and a budget to ensure you protect your portfolio.

The younger Trump, in Hong Kong to promote his American Bitcoin venture with Hut 8, delivered one of the highlights during the two-day event


Published: 5:28pm, 29 Aug 2025
Updated: 8:25pm, 29 Aug 2025


Eric Trump, one of the final acts in Hong Kong's biggest gathering of cryptocurrency enthusiasts, praised the city and China during his fireside chat with the organiser of the Bitcoin Asia conference.

“There is no question that you have made an unbelievable mark on cryptocurrencies,” said the second son of US President Donald Trump in his chat with Bitcoin Asia's CEO David Bailey. “There is no question that China is a hell of a power when it comes to this.”

The younger Trump, who was in Hong Kong to promote his American Bitcoin venture with Hut 8, delivered one of the highlights during the two-day event, which has attracted more than 17,000 attendees, more than triple last year's total. He predicted the value of bitcoin would soar to US$1 million, from the current US$110,000.

“Hong Kong, we absolutely love you, thank you for this incredible reception,” Trump said. “The hospitality you showed me since we've come into town has been unbelievable.”

The event underscores Hong Kong's rising role in the world of virtual assets and cryptocurrency, after the city's landmark stablecoins ordinance and regulatory framework took effect on August 1. The embrace of stablecoins contrasts with mainland China, where mining and transactions of cryptocurrencies have been banned since 2013.

“Hong Kong has been positioned by Beijing to be the place where they can experiment with their bitcoin policy in their digital asset policy,” Bailey said. “So they've identified this as the meeting point for the world to discuss this topic as it relates to China.”

Cryptocurrencies have been rejected by the Bank of International Settlements and most central banks worldwide as “speculative” holdings because they lack the qualities that meet the definition of money. Still, enthusiasts cheered the decentralised nature of cryptocurrencies, hailing them as viable substitutes to the traditional banking and financial system.

Unlike cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are a type of digital currency pegged one-to-one to fiat currencies and reserve assets such as the US dollar, designed to provide price stability. The stablecoins issued in Hong Kong will have to be similarly backed by assets.

The younger Trump said his journey in cryptocurrency began after US banks including JPMorgan and Bank of America refused to accept Donald Trump as a customer. He did not provide specifics about the timing or proof of the claim.

“People always ask me: if the banks had not shut down all your accounts, do you think you would be doing this?” Trump said. “I said, I don't think I would be here … I don't think I would have fallen into cryptocurrency the same way.”

“I started meeting some of the greatest people I've ever met in my life, who believe in the future, believe in technology [and] are great people who wanted to build dynamic companies that could transform the future of life. They often say the enemy of your enemy is actually your friend. That is how the Trump family became friends with the [crypto] community.”

Eric Trump's decision to attend the Hong Kong conference has to do with the city's apparent welcoming stance to crypto, Bailey said. The US State Department had been urging American visitors to the city to “exercise increased caution” since it updated its travel warning in November 2024.

His bitcoin-mining venture, American Bitcoin, was reportedly seeking to acquire a listed company in Hong Kong and Japan to accumulate bitcoin.

“We've explored early conversations across the world, including in the Asian region,” Asher Genoot, the CEO of Hut 8, which holds 80 per cent of American Bitcoin, told The Post.

The move to expand globally was a boon for greater bitcoin adoption and its shareholders, Genoot said. “If we have an opportunity to invest at an early stage valuation, we can create upside for our shareholders.”

American Bitcoin's merger with Nasdaq-listed Gryphon Digital Mining will grant it a listing status. Since the acquisition announcement in mid-May, Gryphon's shares have surged nearly 231 per cent. With the mining power of Hut 8, American Bitcoin aims to become the most efficient firm for low-cost bitcoin accumulation.

Today, they're powering new technologies that touch everyday life, from secure healthcare data to more intelligent devices at home. By exploring these emerging use-cases, it becomes clear that crypto isn't just about investment—it's about reshaping how technology works for everyone.

Professional analysts are usually among the first to sift through the noise and identify those projects that are truly worth pursuing. They invest time and resources in studying whitepapers, technology, and market traction, which is far superior to what a mere individual investor can accomplish. Their lists do not only comprise popular names but also highlight some up-and-coming tokens with serious potential.

When a major exchange or platform starts paying attention to a project, it usually doesn't happen by chance. The willingness of these platforms to support a token with exposure, liquidity, or integration often gauges market confidence. That's the reason individuals keenly observe any movements that might indicate institutional or large-scale interest.

Industry trackers bring all of these signals together in a way that's easy to digest. They compile insights from experts, exchanges, and communities to provide investors with a more comprehensive picture. For example, upcoming Coinbase listings are often highlighted in these watchlists, and for many people, that's the kind of cue that suggests a project has reached a certain threshold of credibility.

Community discussions are less formal but very powerful as early adoption signals. If developers, enthusiasts, and skeptics are all discussing a certain coin, then yes, it has gained some real traction. It might not be featured in glossy magazines or newspapers, but it can be found in Forums, Social Media Groups, and Discord Channels, where genuine excitement and participation are beginning to build.

Fintech has been a strong bridge between legacy finance and the evolution of the crypto world. Payment processors that allow for the direct integration of crypto into everyday purchases, in actuality, make digital assets far less abstract. If one can buy groceries or pay a bill with tokens, it stops being a theory; it is a very viable financial option.

The emergence of digital banks is a further indication of how fintech is facilitating the integration of crypto into the mainstream. These offer cross-service options, and hence conversion between the two is much easier under one roof for the customer. Ease is a strong driver, and fintech is proving this to be very necessary for adoption.

Cross-border remittances also underscore this. It is a well-known fact that sending money overseas has traditionally been expensive and time-consuming; yet, fintech-enabled crypto solutions are substantially reducing these costs and delays. This kind of family that depends on remittances will, in most cases, receive a shoulder as well, almost instantly; this shows how workable crypto can be when well implemented.

Even traditional finance has begun to learn from these fintech-led innovations. Now, it is banks and legacy institutions that are borrowing the ideas from crypto startups, ranging from instant settlements to enhanced transparency. According to people specializing in outsourced MSP staffing services, the industry, apart from finance, is already observing that fintech and crypto partnerships reconfigure expectations, demonstrating how far-reaching this influence has become.

Healthcare is one of those sectors where blockchain can help solve long-standing problems concerning secure data. Tokenized health records would mean that patients could access their information without relying on a centralized institution to store it. This empowers the individual while still keeping sensitive medical data under strong protection.

Your own personal data is another important aspect here. Through smart contracts, patients will be able to see who has access to their information and for how long. It won't be big corporations who control the flow of data anymore, but rather individuals themselves, which creates more trust within the system.

Medical research would also benefit from transparent information enabled by blockchain. Immutably sharing data reduces duplication and eliminates the possibility of manipulating trial results. Researchers can work with confidence, knowing that no data has been altered or hidden to fit a narrative.

Insurance models start to change. Decentralized platforms give flexibility, and fairness decreases arbitrariness. For patients, it results in better plans or faster settlements. For insurers, a more efficient way to operate and a more loyal customer base.

Energy consumption has long been a contentious topic surrounding crypto, but many of the newer projects approach the issue from a different angle. They aim to reduce the energy required to a significantly lower level by designing energy-efficient consensus mechanisms. Not only does this benefit resource-wise, but it also makes the whole space a more attractive proposition for environmentally conscious users.

Tokenization of carbon credits is another innovative concept. This way, blockchain technology can render carbon offset markets more transparent and accessible. Users and organizations will be able to track the progress of their contributions, rather than being directed into opaque systems, and see the measurable environmental impact of their participation.

Some incentivize energy production from renewable sources in a direct manner. When individuals or companies produce clean power, they are rewarded with tokens, creating a reinforcing cycle of cryptocurrency and sustainability. It's actually flipping the old argument that crypto is energy-hungry on its head by showing how it actively entices greener practice.

Partnership with eco-enterprises is the key to scaling these solutions. Whether it is with solar energy firms or green building developers, a partnership with crypto projects can open access to innovative funding mechanisms. It sheds light on the fact that blockchain can support industries well beyond finance, demonstrating that technology and sustainability can sometimes go hand in hand.

The Internet of Things operates on millions of small transactions, and crypto provides a means to secure and automate these transactions. Micropayments between devices demonstrate how a smart car can pay a toll gate without requiring its driver's intervention. Seamless payments make the concept of a truly connected environment much more practical.

Safe machine-to-machine communication is also a key aspect of this evolution. IoT devices generally have poor security, but with blockchain, a foundation for tamper-proof logs and authentication can be established. When your smart lock communicates with your phone, you want that connection to be verifiable and secure, and crypto-backed solutions can provide exactly that.

Decentralized IoT marketplaces are the first to give a glimpse of what such scale fusion looks like. Picture a grid where your neighbor's battery can top up directly from your solar panels, selling surplus power through token-based transactions within the same household, thereby bypassing intermediaries and saving costs while making the system more efficient.

Smart home automation is already familiar to many people, but incorporating blockchain adds another layer of trust. Devices could manage access, energy use, and maintenance schedules automatically, with every action recorded on an immutable ledger. That kind of transparency helps homeowners feel more confident about adopting even more connected technology.

The future of crypto lies in the practical innovations that extend beyond trading. From sustainability to fintech partnerships, these projects are quietly building tools that improve daily life. Recognizing them early offers a glimpse into how digital assets can become an essential part of tomorrow's technology.

Cryptocurrency supporters hailed on Thursday the U.S. government's move to post GDP numbers on several blockchain platforms.

Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) deemed the Commerce Department's move as "historic" that will ensure America's leadership in "digital innovation and transparency."

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also praised the decision to bring America on-chain and thanked Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick for his leadership.

Tyler Winklevoss, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, said the move brings "innovation, vision and execution to the government and helps realize President Donald Trump's vision of making the U.S. the world's "cryptocurrency capital."

Notably, both Coinbase and Gemini helped the government in publishing the data on-chain, according to the Commerce Department.

The Commerce Department announced that it published the second-quarter GDP results on nine blockchains, including Bitcoin BTC/USD, Ethereum ETH/USD and Solana SOL/USD, marking the first time a federal agency put official macroeconomic data on blockchain rails.

The data was also disseminated through coordination with Chainlink LINK/USD and Pyth Network PYTH/USD, the oracle networks that help bring real-world, off-chain data to smart contracts.

Over time, the government is expected to post data such as the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index and Real Final Sales to Private Domestic Purchasers on-chain, Chainlink said.

“We are making America's economic truth immutable and globally accessible like never before,” Lutnick said. 

While blockchain data is designed to be immutable, i.e, cannot be edited or deleted, some networks have reversed transactions to recover hacked funds. The most notable incident that comes to mind is Ethereum's  Decentralized Autonomous Organization hack in 2016.

Price Action: At the time of writing, the PYTH token was exchanging hands at $0.2218, up 90% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. LINK token traded up 1.5% to $24.20 at last check.

Scientists have pushed back LUCA's origin by hundreds of millions of years.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Life on Earth had to begin somewhere, and scientists think that “somewhere” is LUCA—or the Last Universal Common Ancestor. True to its name, this prokaryote-like organism represents the ancestor of every living thing, from the tiniest of bacteria to the grandest of blue whales. 

While the Cambrian Explosion kickstarted complex life in a major way some 530 million years, the true timeline of life on Earth is much longer. For years, scientists have estimated that LUCA likely arrived on the scene some 4 billion years, which is only 600 million years after the planet's formation. 

But a study from an international team of scientists pushes that timeline back even further to some 4.2 billion years ago, while also discovering some fascinating details about what life for LUCA might've been like. The results of the study were published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. 

The paper reads:

To zero in on exactly when LUCA appeared on Earth, scientists had to work backward. First, the team compared genes in living species and counted the mutations that have occurred since sharing a common ancestor with LUCA. Using a genetic equation based on the time of separation between species, the team worked out that LUCA must've been mucking around on Earth as early as 400 million years after its creation, which puts this organism smack in the middle of the hellish geologic nightmare known as the Hadean Eon. 

“The evolutionary history of genes is complicated by their exchange between lineages,” University of Bristol's Edmund Moody, the lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “We have to use complex evolutionary models to reconcile the evolutionary history of genes with the genealogy of species.”

Not satisfied with just learning its age, the team took things a step further and retraced the physiological characteristics of living species to understand what LUCA must've been like 4.2 billion years ago—and the results gave some surprising answers. The scientists estimate that while LUCA was a simple prokaryote, it likely had an immune system, meaning it was already fighting off primordial viruses. 

“It's clear that LUCA was exploiting and changing its environment, but it is unlikely to have lived alone,” University of Exeter's Tim Lenton, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “Its waste would have been food for other microbes, like methanogens, that would have helped to create a recycling ecosystem.”

While LUCA is the oldest common ancestor we know of, scientists still don't understand how life evolved from its very origins to the early communities of which LUCA is a part. Further studies will need to dive deeper into this primordial history and uncover exactly how you, me, and every other living thing, came to be.

For people with macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel), an orphan retinal disorder that gradually destroys central vision, there have long been no approved treatment options. But now, a new study sponsored by Neurotech Pharmaceuticals and spearheaded by investigators at Scripps Research and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) offers compelling evidence that vision loss can be slowed with a neuroprotective surgical implant.

"This is a step toward redefining how we think about vision loss," says one of the corresponding authors, Professor Martin Friedlander of Scripps Research. "Instead of waiting for cells to die, we're learning how to protect and preserve them."

Published in in NEJM Evidence, the study reports results from two phase 3 clinical trials evaluating ENCELTO (revakinagene taroretcel-lwey), a surgically implanted device that continuously releases a therapeutic protein to preserve vision. Conducted across 47 sites internationally, the randomized trials enrolled 228 participants with MacTel, following their progress over a 24-month period.

The trials were coordinated by an international network of clinicians and researchers with key collaborators from the NIH's National Eye Institute, the Lowy Medical Research Institute, and Neurotech Pharmaceuticals. Their ensuing results helped support the March 2025 approval of ENCELTO for MacTel by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), making it the first authorized treatment for the condition and the first cell-based neuroprotective treatment for any neurodegenerative retinal disease or central nervous system disorder.

The trials followed identical designs but enrolled participants at different times and locations. While both trials showed that ENCELTO slowed the loss of light-sensing retinal cells, the effect was stronger in one trial, likely due to variations in disease severity and other factors among participants. Together, the results provide strong evidence that the implant can preserve vision in people with MacTel.

"This is the first time we've seen a therapy meaningfully alter the course of MacTel," says Friedlander. "It confirms that neuroprotection can be a powerful strategy to preserve vision in degenerative retinal conditions."

Friedlander, who's also president of the Lowy Medical Research Institute, has spent nearly two decades studying MacTel and helped lay the biological foundation for ENCELTO. The device delivers ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a naturally occurring protein known to protect retinal neurons. ENCELTO also consists of genetically modified retinal pigment epithelial cells -- which help nourish and support the retina -- housed in a tiny, collagen-based capsule, which is implanted in the back of the eye. Thanks to the capsule design, the cells remain shielded from immune rejection while continuously releasing CNTF -- enabling long-term, localized delivery of the therapeutic molecule.

The study demonstrated that ENCELTO significantly slowed the loss of photoreceptors -- light-sensing nerve cells that are critical for central vision -- compared with sham-treated eyes, or eyes that underwent a simulated procedure without receiving actual treatment. In one of the trials, the implant resulted in a 54.8% reduction in the rate of ellipsoid zone loss, a measurable change in retinal structure that signals photoreceptor cell degeneration. The second trial showed a 30.6% reduction in the same measure, which is still statistically significant, though smaller in magnitude.

In addition to changes in retinal cells, the study evaluated several measures of visual function: how well the eye can actually see and perform everyday vision-related tasks. These included microperimetry (a sensitive test of retinal light response) and reading speed. Results from microperimetry showed statistically significant slowing of visual function loss, particularly in the trial where ENCELTO provided greater preservation of photoreceptor cells. However, reading speed and retinal sensitivity outcomes were more mixed, with one trial showing improvement and the other showing no significant difference from the control group.

"These differences highlight just how complex it is to measure functional vision loss in a slow-progressing disease like MacTel," points out Friedlander. "If you look at certain functional outcomes from just one of the trials, they're not statistically significant. But when you pool data from both trials -- which were conducted the same way -- then you see statistically significant results, so we'll continue to investigate what's driving that."

Despite the variability, the overall trend across both trials supports ENCELTO's long-term benefit, particularly when treatment is initiated before extensive cell loss. Participants tolerated the implant well, with minimal side effects. Furthermore, ENCELTO was effective regardless of the participant's baseline vision or disease stage, suggesting that earlier intervention may help preserve more functional vision as MacTel progresses.

Next, Friedlander and his team will assess whether benefits continue or even improve beyond 24 months. There are also plans to explore why some individuals experienced greater gains than others, which may help identify patient subgroups that are most likely to benefit.

"The consistency in preserving retinal cells across both trials gives us confidence in the mechanism," says Friedlander. "As we refine how and when to treat MacTel, we expect even greater improvements in vision over time."

Moreover, because ENCELTO delivers sustained, targeted doses of therapeutic proteins directly to the retina, it represents a versatile platform technology. This same approach could potentially be adapted to treat a wide range of neurovascular degenerative diseases beyond MacTel, including other blinding conditions where protecting vulnerable nerve cells is key.

In addition to Friedlander, authors of the study, "Cell-Based Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor Therapy for Macular Telangiectasia Type 2," are Emily Y. Chew of the National Institutes of Health; Mark Gillies of the Save Sight Institute; Glenn J. Jaffe of Duke University; Alain Gaudric of Paris Cité University; Cathy Egan and Alan Bird of University College London; Ian Constable of The University of Western Australia; Traci Clemons of the Emmes Corporation; Thomas Aaberg, Jr and Thomas C. Hohman of Neurotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and Debora C. Manning of Veristat.

Something like Oumuamua, 21/Borisov and now 3I/ATLAS (the latest space rock to go viral) doesn't exactly appear like the starships of science fiction. But, to be fair, we Earthlings really have no idea what spacecraft from other intelligent civilizations (if they do exist) would actually look like. Controversial astrophysicist Avi Loeb from Harvard University—founding director of the Black Hole Initiative and increasingly known for frequently crying “alien”—continues to be curious about what is really out there. Maybe aliens are eluding us by launching probes or ships that only appear to be chunks of rocky debris.

Along with colleagues Adam Hibberd and Adam Crowl (both from the Initiative for Interstellar Studies in London), Loeb came up with a thought experiment that tested the idea of 3I/ATLAS being a piece of extraterrestrial technology. He was inspired by the “dark forest hypothesis,” which suggests that aliens are trying to hide from each other because space is crawling with hostile civilizations. While Loeb stresses that this thinking is only hypothetical, there are some especially strange aspects of 3I/ATLAS and its journey that—while they most likely don't mean the object itself is flown by aliens—could give away an actual starship if intelligent beings ever do decide to visit.

Even though Loeb is aware that the debate about this possibility is “mired in bitter controversy,” as he said in a study recently submitted to Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society, the “hypothesis is an interesting exercise in its own right, and is fun to pursue, irrespective of its likely validity.”

Whether or not 3I/ATLAS really is powered by aliens, Loeb thinks there is a reason applying his hypothesis to the object is worthwhile. Alien intentions could be completely benign or could mean doom for humanity. It could be that there are beings out there who are just trekking from star to star, possibly seeking out a new home or just enjoying the scenery, without intending to deploy any, say, missiles that could vaporize an entire planet. But others could mean us harm. Whether or not our defensive capabilities are enough to take on a hostile civilization is unknown, because we are unaware of what kind of technology they might threaten us with. 

3I/ATLAS has also shown some anomalies. Its orbit is retrograde (meaning it travels in the opposite direction that objects in our Solar System orbit the Sun), but its orbital plane (the imaginary flat plane its orbit creates) is within only five degrees off of Earth's. That is an extraordinarily unlikely coincidence which, as Loeb estimates, has only a  2% chance of occurring. Its closest flyby of the Sun is at the opposite end of where Earth reaches perihelion, and it ventures remarkably close to Venus, Mars, and Jupiter—all of which are also against the odds.

There is also the issue of what 3I/ATLAS actually is. The object is thought to be an asteroid or comet, but it is oddly bright for an asteroid of its size (20 km, or about 12.4 miles, wide). If an asteroid is ruled out, then it might be a comet, but Loeb points out that observations from the MUSE spectroscopic instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope showed no spectral signs of the gas usually resealed by comets. It is incredibly dusty, however, which very well could have obscured some of its features. Sunlight reflected off the surface of the object also turns red.making it appear redder than most comets flying around the Solar System, but closer to the color of some Trans-Neptunian Objects and Centaurs.

If a starship were to follow 3I/ATLAS's trajectory and behavior, Loeb estimates that it wouldn't need much effort from (hypothetical) velocity thrusts to launch missiles or some other kind of alien ammunition at Venus, Mars, or Jupiter. Earth might not even be a stretch. At least we haven't seen anything peculiar raining from the sky yet, except a few meteorite fragments.

 “By far, the most likely outcome will be that 3I/ATLAS is a completely natural interstellar object, probably a comet, and we await the astronomical data to support this likely origin,” said Loeb. “Nevertheless, when viewed from an open-minded and unprejudiced perspective, our paper includes many compelling insights that could be applied to tens of interstellar objects that are expected to be detected over the next decade.”

For 500 years, classrooms have relied on a distorted view that minimizes the continent's scale.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The African Union is officially fed up with the 16th-century representation of its continent that the world has accepted as the norm. The AU, which comprises 55 African nations, has set off on a formal effort to redraw the map of the world, creating one that it believes accurately represents Africa.

Hanging in classrooms and government buildings the world over, the 16th-century-drawn map from Flemish cartographer Geradus Mercator—originally created for navigational purposes—has become so accepted that many people don't know about the give-and-take process the cartographer went through to represent a globe onto flat paper. To get evenly distributed longitudinal and latitudinal lines, Mercator enlarged land areas near the poles and shrunk spots near the equator. That gives North America and Europe larger-than-life depictions and shrivels Africa and South America. 

AU's new campaign aims to fix that. 

“It might seem to be just a map, but in reality, it is not,” Selma Malika Haddadi, AU Commission deputy chair, told Reuters. The group has backed the Correct the Map campaign led by Africa-based advocacy groups, promoting the 2018-created Equal Earth projection as a better representation of our world. 

“Africa is misrepresented on the world's maps, and it's not just a matter of geography,” according to a Correct the Map statement. “It's a reflection of how the world views the continent.” 

The Mercator projection has served as a global baseline for centuries. It's impossible to represent a curved world on a flat map without some level of distortion, so Mercator's cylindrical projection took a navigational view—a mathematical way to help navigators plot a straight line from one point to another. Compromises were made, though, and one is that Africa does appear significantly smaller than it truly is. 

The projection doesn't give Africa its due as the second-largest continent in the world, covering over 11 million square miles—roughly three times the size of the United States. As Equal Earth Map noted on its website, Greenland appears bigger than Africa on the Mercator projection, but Africa is actually 14 times larger than the island. 

“The Correct the Map campaign seeks to challenge this long-standing misrepresentation and bring awareness to the importance of accurately representing Africa on the world map,” the group said. “By correcting the map, we aim to shift perceptions and highlight the true scale, power, and potential of the African continent. Accurate map projections are vital not only for education and geography but also for fostering a deeper understanding of Africa's role in the global community.” 

The AU wants the Equal Earth projection to  replace the Mercator projection as the standard global map. Of course, the Equal Earth projection isn't perfect either, making its compromises elsewhere on the map. Based off the Robinson projection, Equal Earth increases the size of equatorial regions. That means the projection more accurately shows landmass size and total area, but makes compromises in representing the shapes of regions, angles, and land lines—especially near the poles.

Mercator remains the norm across the world—in casual use when Google Maps users switch off the 3D globe view, and in official channels like the United Nations alike. But there are other projections out there. In the mid-1990s, the National Geographic Society adopted the Winkel Tripel projection, although it also uses the Mollweide projection in certain situations. As National Geographic's Education department wrote on its website: “There are three basic kinds of projections: planar, conical, and cylindrical. Each is useful in different situations.”

The groups Africa No Filter and Speak Up Africa collectives both told Reuters that the use of the Mercator is misinformation that impacts Africans' identity and pride. “We're actively working on promoting a curriculum where the Equal Earth projection will be the main standard across all [African] classrooms,” said Fara Ndiaye, co-founder of Speak Up Africa. Moky Makura, executive director of Africa No Filter dubbed the Mercator projection the “world's longest misinformation and disinformation campaign.”

Researchers and academics have flocked to Bluesky. Credit: Matteo Della Torre/NurPhoto via Getty

Posts about research on Bluesky receive substantially more attention than similar posts on X, formerly called Twitter, according to the first large-scale analysis of science content on Bluesky1. The results suggest that Bluesky users engage with posts more than do users of X.

Bluesky has more than 38 million users and shares many features with X, which fell out of favour with some scientists when it was bought by entrepreneur Elon Musk in October 2022. A survey of Nature readers earlier this year suggested that many prefer Bluesky over X to discuss and disseminate their work.

A team of researchers from the United Kingdom and China analysed 2.6 million Bluesky posts published from January 2023 to July 2025. Together, these referenced 532,000 academic articles. The results were posted as a preprint on arXiv last month and have not been peer reviewed.

The team found that almost half of the posts about science on Bluesky garnered at least ten likes, and that one-third were reposted ten or more times. Previous research on X has shown that the proportion of science posts receiving at least ten likes varied between 4% and 7.5%, and that the proportion receiving ten or more reposts ranged from 1.4% to 4.4%2. Interactions on Bluesky were an order of magnitude higher than on X, the researchers said. Quotes — whereby users share posts and add their own text — and replies were nearly two orders of magnitude greater on Bluesky than on X, they said.

The team also reported that nearly half of Bluesky posts summarized academic articles and that only 6.3% simply mentioned the article name and journal. By contrast, 92% of original X posts about life and earth sciences and 17% of those in engineering and physical sciences referred to little more than the study title, according to a 2018 study in the Journal of Infometrics3. This suggests that research content on Bluesky is more original, says Er-Te Zheng, the latest study's first author and a PhD student at the University of Sheffield, UK. “While X has primarily served as a dissemination tool, Bluesky may support a more interpretive, reflective mode of science communication.”

Chemists at UCL have shown how two of biology's most fundamental ingredients, RNA (ribonucleic acid) and amino acids, could have spontaneously joined together at the origin of life four billion years ago.

Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, the "workhorses" of life essential to nearly every living process. But proteins cannot replicate or produce themselves -- they require instructions. These instructions are provided by RNA, a close chemical cousin of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).

In a new study, published in Nature, researchers chemically linked life's amino acids to RNA in conditions that could have occurred on the early Earth -- an achievement that has eluded scientists since the early 1970s.

Senior author Professor Matthew Powner, based at UCL's Department of Chemistry, said: "Life relies on the ability to synthesize proteins -- they are life's key functional molecules. Understanding the origin of protein synthesis is fundamental to understanding where life came from.

"Our study is a big step towards this goal, showing how RNA might have first come to control protein synthesis.

"Life today uses an immensely complex molecular machine, the ribosome, to synthesize proteins. This machine requires chemical instructions written in messenger RNA, which carries a gene's sequence from a cell's DNA to the ribosome. The ribosome then, like a factory assembly line, reads this RNA and links together amino acids, one by one, to create a protein.

"We have achieved the first part of that complex process, using very simple chemistry in water at neutral pH to link amino acids to RNA. The chemistry is spontaneous, selective and could have occurred on the early Earth."

Previous attempts to attach amino acids to RNA used highly reactive molecules, but these broke down in water and caused the amino acids to react with each other, rather than become linked to RNA.

For the new study, the researchers took inspiration from biology, using a gentler method to convert life's amino acids into a reactive form. This activation involved a thioester, a high-energy chemical compound important in many of life's biochemical processes and that has already been theorized to play a role at the start of life*.

Professor Powner said: "Our study unites two prominent origin of life theories -- the 'RNA world', where self-replicating RNA is proposed to be fundamental, and the 'thioester world', in which thioesters are seen as the energy source for the earliest forms of life."

In order to form these thioesters, the amino acids react with a sulfur-bearing compound called pantetheine. Last year, the same team published a paper demonstrating pantetheine can be synthesized under early Earth-like conditions, suggesting it was likely to play a role in starting life.

The next step, the researchers said, was to establish how RNA sequences could bind preferentially to specific amino acids, so that RNA could begin to code instructions for protein synthesis -- the origin of the genetic code.

"There are numerous problems to overcome before we can fully elucidate the origin of life, but the most challenging and exciting remains the origins of protein synthesis," said Professor Powner.

Lead author Dr Jyoti Singh, from UCL Chemistry, said: "Imagine the day that chemists might take simple, small molecules, consisting of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms, and from these LEGO pieces form molecules capable of self-replication. This would be a monumental step towards solving the question of life's origin.

"Our study brings us closer to that goal by demonstrating how two primordial chemical LEGO pieces (activated amino acids and RNA) could have built peptides**, short chains of amino acids that are essential to life.

"What is particularly groundbreaking is that the activated amino acid used in this study is a thioester, a type of molecule made from Coenzyme A, a chemical found in all living cells. This discovery could potentially link metabolism, the genetic code and protein building."

While the paper focuses solely on the chemistry, the research team said that the reactions they demonstrated could plausibly have taken place in pools or lakes of water on the early Earth (but not likely in the oceans as the concentrations of the chemicals would likely be too diluted).

The reactions are too small to see with a visible-light microscope and were tracked using a range of techniques that are used to probe the structure of molecules, including several types of magnetic resonance imaging (which shows how the atoms are arranged) and mass spectrometry (which shows the size of molecules).

Notes

*The Nobel laureate Christian de Duve proposed that life began with a "thioester world" -- a metabolism-first theory that envisages life was started by chemical reactions powered by the energy in thioesters.

** Peptides typically consist of two to 50 amino acids, while proteins are larger, often containing hundreds or even thousands of amino acids, and are folded into a 3D shape. As part of their study, the research team showed how, once the amino acids were loaded on to the RNA, they could synthesize with other amino acids to form peptides.

The work was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research  Council (EPSRC), the Simons Foundation and the Royal Society.

Researchers found dietary changes may help improve cognitive health and stave off dementia.

A new study led by investigators from Mass General Brigham, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard suggests that a Mediterranean-style diet may help reduce dementia risk. The study, published in Nature Medicine, found that people at the highest genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease benefited more from following a Mediterranean-style diet, showing a greater reduction in dementia risk compared to those at lower genetic risk.

"One reason we wanted to study the Mediterranean diet is because it is the only dietary pattern that has been causally linked to cognitive benefits in a randomized trial," said study first author Yuxi Liu, PhD, a research fellow in the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system, and a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Chan School and Broad. "We wanted to see whether this benefit might be different in people with varying genetic backgrounds, and to examine the role of blood metabolites, the small molecules that reflect how the body processes food and carries out normal functions."

Over the last few decades, researchers have learned more about the genetic and metabolic basis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. These are among the most common causes of cognitive decline in older adults. Alzheimer's disease is known to have a strong genetic component, with heritability estimated at up to 80%.

One gene in particular, apolipoprotein E (APOE), has emerged as the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease -- the more common type develops later in life and is not directly inherited in a predictable pattern. People who carry one copy of the APOE4 variant have a 3-to-4-fold higher risk of developing Alzheimer's. People with two copies of the APOE4 variant (called APOE4 homozygous) have a 12-fold higher risk of Alzheimer's than those without.

To explore how the Mediterranean diet may reduce dementia risk and influence blood metabolites linked to cognitive health, the team analyzed data from 4,215 women in the Nurses' Health Study, following participants from 1989 to 2023 (average age 57 at baseline). To validate their findings, the researchers analyzed similar data from 1,490 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, followed from 1993 to 2023.

Researchers evaluated long-term dietary patterns using food frequency questionnaires and examined participants' blood samples for a broad range of metabolites. Genetic data were used to assess each participant's inherited risk for Alzheimer's disease. Participants were then followed over time for new cases of dementia. A subset of 1,037 women underwent regular telephone-based cognitive testing.

They found that the people following a more Mediterranean-style diet had a lower risk of developing dementia and showed slower cognitive decline. The protective effect of the diet was strongest in the high-risk group with two copies of the APOE4 gene variant, suggesting that diet may help offset genetic risk.

"These findings suggest that dietary strategies, specifically the Mediterranean diet, could help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and stave off dementia by broadly influencing key metabolic pathways," Liu said. "This recommendation applies broadly, but it may be even more important for individuals at a higher genetic risk, such as those carrying two copies of the APOE4 genetic variant."

A study limitation was that the cohort consisted of well-educated individuals of European ancestry. More research is needed in diverse populations.

In addition, although the study reveals important associations, genetics and metabolomics are not yet part of most clinical risk prediction models for Alzheimer's disease. People often don't know their APOE genetics. More work is needed to translate these findings into routine medical practice.

"In future research, we hope to explore whether targeting specific metabolites through diet or other interventions could provide a more personalized approach to reducing dementia risk," Liu said.

For decades, researchers around the world have searched for alternatives to iridium, an extremely rare, incredibly expensive metal used in the production of clean hydrogen fuels.

Now, a powerful new tool has found one -- within a single afternoon.

Invented and developed at Northwestern University, that tool is called a megalibrary. The world's first nanomaterial "data factory," each megalibrary contains millions of uniquely designed nanoparticles on one tiny chip. In collaboration with researchers from the Toyota Research Institute (TRI), the team used this technology to discover commercially relevant catalysts for hydrogen production. Then, they scaled up the material and demonstrated it could work within a device -- all in record time.

With a megalibrary, scientists rapidly screened vast combinations of four abundant, inexpensive metals -- each known for its catalytic performance -- to find a new material with performance comparable to iridium. The team discovered a wholly new material that, in laboratory experiments, matched or in some cases even exceeded the performance of commercial iridium-based materials, but at a fraction of the cost.

This discovery doesn't just make affordable green hydrogen a possibility; it also proves the effectiveness of the new megalibrary approach, which could completely change how researchers find new materials for any number of applications.

The study was published on August 19 in the Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS).

"We've unleashed arguably the world's most powerful synthesis tool, which allows one to search the enormous number of combinations available to chemists and materials scientists to find materials that matter," said Northwestern's Chad A. Mirkin, the study's senior author and primary inventor of the megalibrary platform. "In this particular project, we have channeled that capability toward a major problem facing the energy sector. That is: How do we find a material that is as good as iridium but is more plentiful, more available and a lot cheaper? This new tool enabled us to find a promising alternative and to find it rapidly."

A nanotechnology pioneer, Mirkin is the George B. Rathmann Professor of Chemistry at Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences; professor of chemical and biological engineering, biomedical engineering and materials science and engineering at the McCormick School of Engineering; and executive director of the International Institute for Nanotechnology. Mirkin co-led the work with Ted Sargent, the Lynn Hopton Davis and Greg Davis Professor of Chemistry at Weinberg, professor of electrical and computer engineering at McCormick and executive director of the Paula M. Trienens Institute for Sustainability and Energy.

'Not enough iridium in the world'

As the world moves away from fossil fuels and toward decarbonization, affordable green hydrogen has emerged as a critical piece of the puzzle. To produce clean hydrogen energy, scientists have turned to water splitting, a process that uses electricity to split water molecules into their two constituent components -- hydrogen and oxygen.

The oxygen part of this reaction, called the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however, is difficult and inefficient. OER is most effective when scientists use iridium-based catalysts, which have significant disadvantages. Iridium is rare, expensive and often obtained as a byproduct from platinum mining. More valuable than gold, iridium costs nearly $5,000 per ounce.

"There's not enough iridium in the world to meet all of our projected needs," Sargent said. "As we think about splitting water to generate alternative forms of energy, there's not enough iridium from a purely supply standpoint."

'Full army deployed on a chip'

Mirkin, who introduced the megalibraries in 2016, decided with Sargent that finding new candidates to replace iridium was a perfect application for his revolutionary tool. While materials discovery is traditionally a slow and daunting task filled with trial and error, megalibraries enable scientists to pinpoint optimal compositions at breakneck speeds.

Each megalibrary is created with arrays of hundreds of thousands of tiny, pyramid-shaped tips to print individual "dots" onto a surface. Each dot contains an intentionally designed mix of metal salts. When heated, the metal salts are reduced to form single nanoparticles, each with a precise composition and size.

"You can think of each tip as a tiny person in a tiny lab," Mirkin said. "Instead of having one tiny person make one structure at a time, you have millions of people. So, you basically have a full army of researchers deployed on a chip."

And the winner is…

In the new study, the chip contained 156 million particles, each made from different combinations of ruthenium, cobalt, manganese and chromium. A robotic scanner then assessed how well the most promising particles could perform an OER. Based on these tests, Mirkin and his team selected the best-performing candidates to undergo further testing in the laboratory.

Eventually, one composition stood out:a precise combination of all four metals (Ru52Co33Mn9Cr6 oxide). Multi-metal catalysts are known to elicit synergistic effects that can make them more active than single-metal catalysts.

"Our catalyst actually has a little higher activity than iridium and excellent stability," Mirkin said. "That's rare because oftentimes ruthenium is less stable. But the other elements in the composition stabilize ruthenium."

The ability to screen particles for their ultimate performance is a major new innovation. "For the first time, we were not only able to rapidly screen catalysts, but we saw the best ones performing well in a scaled-up setting," said Joseph Montoya, a senior staff research scientist at TRI and study co-author.

In long-term tests, the new catalyst operated for more than 1,000 hours with high efficiency and excellent stability in a harsh acidic environment. It is also dramatically cheaper than iridium -- about one-sixteenth of the cost.

"There's lots of work to do to make this commercially viable, but it's very exciting that we can identify promising catalysts so quickly -- not only at the lab scale but for devices," Montoya said.

Just the beginning

By generating massive high-quality materials datasets, the megalibrary approach also lays the groundwork for using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to design the next generation of new materials. Northwestern, TRI and Mattiq, a Northwestern spinout company, have already developed machine learning algorithms to sift through the megalibraries at record speeds.

Mirkin says this is only the beginning. With AI, the approach could scale beyond catalysts to revolutionize materials discovery for virtually any technology, such as batteries, biomedical devices and advanced optical components.

"We're going to look for all sorts of materials for batteries, fusion and more," he said. "The world does not use the best materials for its needs. People found the best materials at a certain point in time, given the tools available to them. The problem is that we now have a huge infrastructure built around those materials, and we're stuck with them. We want to turn that upside down. It's time to truly find the best materials for every need -- without compromise."

WhatsApp said on Friday that it fixed a security bug in its iOS and Mac apps that was being used to stealthily hack into the Apple devices of “specific targeted users.”

The Meta-owned messaging app giant said in its security advisory that it fixed the vulnerability, known officially as CVE-2025-55177, which was used alongside a separate flaw found in iOS and Macs, which Apple fixed last week and tracks as CVE-2025-43300.

Apple said at the time that the flaw was used in an “extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.” Now we know that dozens of WhatsApp users were targeted with this pair of flaws.

Donncha Ó Cearbhaill, who heads Amnesty International's Security Lab, described the attack in a post on X as an “advanced spyware campaign” that targeted users over the past 90 days, or since the end of May. Ó Cearbhaill described the pair of bugs as a “zero-click” attack, meaning it does not require any interaction from the victim, such as clicking a link, to compromise their device.

The two bugs chained together allow an attacker to deliver a malicious exploit through WhatsApp that's capable of stealing data from the user's Apple device. 

Per Ó Cearbhaill, who posted a copy of the threat notification that WhatsApp sent to affected users, the attack was able to “compromise your device and the data it contains, including messages.”

It's not immediately clear who, or which spyware vendor, is behind the attacks. 

When reached by TechCrunch, Meta spokesperson Margarita Franklin confirmed the company detected and patched the flaw “a few weeks ago” and that the company sent “less than 200” notifications to affected WhatsApp users. 

The spokesperson did not say, when asked, if WhatsApp has evidence to attribute the hacks to a specific attacker or surveillance vendor.

This is not the first time that WhatsApp users have been targeted by government spyware, a kind of malware capable of breaking into fully patched devices with vulnerabilities not known to the vendor, known as zero-day flaws.

In May, a U.S. court ordered spyware maker NSO Group to pay WhatsApp $167 million in damages for a 2019 hacking campaign that broke into the devices of more than 1,400 WhatsApp users with an exploit capable of planting NSO's Pegasus spyware. WhatsApp brought the legal case against NSO, citing a breach of federal and state hacking laws, as well as its own terms of service.

Earlier this year, WhatsApp disrupted a spyware campaign that targeted around 90 users, including journalists and members of civil society across Italy. The Italian government denied its involvement in the spying campaign. Paragon, whose spyware was used in the campaign, later cut off Italy from its hacking tools for failing to investigate the abuse.

A group that infiltrated Microsoft's headquarters building this week disputed the company's account of the incident — describing their sit-in as nonviolent and saying the “listening devices” allegedly left behind were phones that fell from their pockets when they were arrested.

“As Brad himself admits, if someone were to plant listening devices, this is not how they would do it,” said Hossam Nasr, one of the leaders of the group No Azure for Apartheid, referring to comments made by Microsoft President Brad Smith after seven members of the group occupied his office Tuesday afternoon. “If anything, we would like our phones back, please.”

The group, which is calling on Microsoft to cut ties with Israel over the alleged use of its technology against Palestinians in Gaza, also disputed the company's assertion that its members do not represent elements of its workforce, and questioned the sincerity of Microsoft executives in addressing the issues the protesters have raised. 

The comments at a Thursday press conference came shortly after Microsoft said it fired two additional employees — bringing the total this week to four — in connection with their actions in recent protests on the Redmond campus. 

The company said in a statement that the workers “were terminated due to serious violations of established company policies and our code of conduct, including participating in recent on-site demonstrations that created significant safety concerns for our employees.”

The statement added, “We are continuing to investigate the conduct on our campus and work with law enforcement to help ensure the safety of all our employees,” noting that “such conduct is entirely unacceptable and stands in direct opposition to our company values and policies.” 

During the occupation on Tuesday, protesters made their way into the building at Microsoft's Redmond headquarters where CEO Satya Nadella and other top executives work. Inside Smith's office, they locked arms, chanted “Free Palestine,” livestreamed their actions on Twitch, and put furniture against the door while demanding talks with company leadership. 

After resisting security personnel, seven protesters were removed by Redmond police and arrested on charges including trespassing, obstruction, and resisting arrest. 

Outside, another group of protesters was able to temporarily raise a Palestinian flag on one of the flagpoles outside Microsoft's nearby Executive Briefing Center.

Twenty protesters were arrested the prior week, on Wednesday, Aug. 20, after refusing to disperse from an encampment that they created for a second day in front of the Microsoft sign in the company's East Campus plaza, which they covered in red paint to symbolize blood. 

Speaking this week, Smith cited the company's commitment to upholding its human rights principles and terms of service in the Middle East; maintaining a culture of trust and open dialogue with its employees; and keeping the workplace safe and secure. 

He acknowledged the human toll of the conflict, citing the 1,139 people killed in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack in Israel and the 61,000 civilians who have died in Gaza, and said Microsoft's role is “to provide technology in a principled and ethical way.”

At the same time, Smith said the protesters' actions were not acceptable. 

“Obviously, when seven folks do as they did today, storm a building, occupy an office, lock other people out of the office … that's not OK,” he said. While Microsoft respects lawful freedom of expression, he said, the company also needs to keep its private workplace safe and secure.

The group on Thursday disputed the characterization that it stormed the building. Nasr said their sit-in was “completely nonviolent” and that Microsoft responded with “brute force, repression, retaliation and lies.”

A larger point of contention is the effectiveness of internal dissent and debate. Smith said Tuesday that Microsoft has a “culture of trust with our employees” and that executives read employee feedback and take it seriously. 

Smith told reporters that the protests are “not necessary in order to get us to pay attention,” and noted that they distract from the dialogue the company is having with internal groups of different backgrounds, faiths, and cultures, including Palestinian allies.

At their press conference Thursday afternoon, protesters called these assertions inaccurate, saying that extensive efforts to use “proper channels” were ignored. 

Anna Hattle, a worker who was fired this week, said a petition with more than 2,000 employee signatures demanding the company cut ties with the Israeli military was sent to every Microsoft executive in May and received no response. 

Protesters also offered other examples of what they called suppression. Nisreen Jaradat, another worker who was fired, alleged that Microsoft Security specifically targeted protesters carrying the scroll of petition signatures, and tore that scroll during one protest. 

Microsoft said earlier this year that it found no evidence its technologies were used by the Israeli military to harm civilians in Gaza. However, it acknowledged limits as to what it could verify, citing a lack of visibility into use of its technology on private servers outside its cloud.

The company recently launched a new investigation into a report from The Guardian alleging that its Azure cloud platform was used by the Israeli military in mass surveillance in Gaza. 

Smith said The Guardian “did a fair job in its reporting.” After the paper contacted the company for the story, he said, Microsoft was able to determine that some of the information was false, some was true, and “much of what they reported now needs to be tested.”

Protesters on Thursday rejected another investigation as insufficient, demanding instead that Microsoft immediately end all contracts and pay reparations to the Palestinian people.

Labor Day weekend is here, and with it comes cold beer, hot dogs, and a boatload of deals. The unofficial end of summer brings with it bargains on WIRED-tested gear, including home office essentials and some of our favorite gadgets. For the past few weeks, we've been tracking prices on the gear we recommend to our friends and bringing you the best sale prices.

Check our Best Labor Day Mattress Deals and Labor Day Outdoor Gear Deals stories for additional savings. We've also got some updated roundups for Back to School Deals and Back to School Laptop Deals.

Updated August 29, 2025: We've added 10 new deals from Therabody, Buffy, Hexclad, All-Clad, Petcube, Razer, Bruvi, and TP-Link. We've also ensured accurate pricing throughout and removed expired deals.

https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-blade-16/RZ09-05285EN3-R3U1

The Razer Blade 16 is the best gaming laptop overall. It's got a sleek, clean aesthetic with thin bezels, a fantastic keyboard, a nice OLED screen, and a slim footprint. And while the 16 doesn't feel obtrusive to travel with, it doesn't skimp on performance. Graphics options range all the way up to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090, and base storage starts at 1 terabyte—though, in a first for Razer, you can only choose an AMD CPU. Get more nitty-gritty details in our full review.

This is a match of the best price we've seen for our favorite budget mesh Wi-Fi router. It supports Wi-Fi 6, which should still be fine for most people even though Wi-Fi 7 is already a thing. The Deco X20 has solid coverage and performance, especially with the three routers you'll get with this deal (though singles and two-packs are also on sale if you're in a small space). They're easy to set up and they have optional parental controls and antivirus protection. You can also split the two 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz Wi-Fi bands, which will help if you're running any smart home devices that explicitly require one or the other.

The Sony Bravia 7 II has been on sale for this price for a little while, but we have yet to see it drop lower. It's in our Best TVs buying guide as the pick with the most immersive picture. It has natural yet vivid colors and excellent picture processing. Reviewer Ryan Waniata says it renders 4K and HD scenes “so clearly you'll feel like they're going to spill into your living room.” It could have better black levels and a few more ports, but it's still an excellent set, especially at this price.

The Apple iPad (A16, 2025) is the iPad we recommend for most people. It comes in fun colors like blue and yellow, and it's plenty powerful to handle whatever you'll throw at it on a day-to-day basis—from playing games to streaming videos to browsing the web. It doesn't support Apple Intelligence, which may be a blessing or a curse depending on whom you ask. It does have a modern bezel design around its 11-inch LCD screen, plus USB-C charging, a Touch ID sensor, and two 12-megapixel cameras—one in the back and one for selfies. It also works with many of the best iPad accessories.

The M4 Apple MacBook Air is the best MacBook for most people. This is the cheapest we've seen it. Where some MacBooks are overkill for basic everyday tasks, this lightweight model can handle them with ease—and you won't be paying for performance that you won't use. It has a bright display, long battery life, and support for up to two external displays as well as Apple Intelligence. And while you might want something else if you'll be doing heavy video editing or need a giant screen, the M4 MacBook Air will be capable of handling multiple Google Chrome tabs and apps running in the background. We do wish it had some more ports, but you can always use a USB hub to customize them further.

These are the best noise-canceling earbuds we've tried. They have excellent sound quality and battery life, plus solid control options, and they're comfortable to wear for long periods of time. But where they truly excel is in active noise canceling. They can make a busy subway car or crowded airplane disappear entirely, lending you extra focus or decompression with no effort.

The Fitbit Charge 6 is the best fitness tracker overall. It has gone on sale for $100 in the past, but $125 is a pretty good deal, since it regularly jumps up to full price. It looks nice and has all the features most folks would want, like step counting, sleep tracking, stats on calories burned and workout effectiveness, heart rate readings, and insights into SpO2 levels. It also has a long-lasting battery and integrations with Google Wallet and Google Maps (though it can be used with iOS devices as well as Android). Some of the better features are locked behind a subscription that costs $10 per month, but the gadget still works without that subscription.

This is a great deal for the best electronic sleepbuds, and you'll also get a free travel case. The earbuds are comfortable to wear while you're sleeping, and they have 10-hour battery life and passive noise cancelation as well as excellent audio quality. There's a solid companion app, too, which lets you choose from different Sleep Sounds and access biometric data (which we have not yet tested).

This is a solid deal on the best laptop docking station. The Satechi Dual Dock Stand slightly elevates your laptop for better ergonomics, and it has a collection of ports, including three monitor outputs, several USB ports, and a solid-state drive enclosure. It connects to your laptop via two USB-C cables. If you don't need a full-on docking station, check our guide to the Best USB Hubs.

Branch has made our favorite office chair for years. It has oodles of adjustable elements, including the arms, armrests, seat depth, recline, lumbar support, and seat tilt. The foam cushion seat is comfortable and the mesh backrest is supportive, too. The affordable price tag is icing on the cake, and while it doesn't go on sale very often, you can save 10 percent until the sale ends with code LABORDAY.

If you don't want to spring for the Ergonomic Chair Pro, this is the best budget-friendly office chair and an option worth considering. It's very easy to assemble. and there are a few adjustable areas for a better fit—the armrests, seat, recline, and lumbar support can all be dialed in. There are some fun fabric color options, like blue and orange, though the upholstery does tend to pill and is a magnet for pet hair. Even with its quirks, it will be a definite upgrade if you're still working from the ratty chair you picked up off Craigslist when you first built your home office.

Sitting all day is bad for you! This telescoping desk can be raised up as high as 45 inches, with simple setup and two available sizes. It comes in a few different finishes. The leg motors aren't the quietest, but they work well, and the desk looks great in any setup. For additional recommendations, check our home office buying guide.

This coupon code gets you 20 percent off almost everything on Humanscale's website. Humanscale makes some of the best office chairs. The Freedom Headrest is the best reclining office chair, and it drops from $1,743 to $1,394 with code SEMIANNUAL20. Editor Julian Chokkattu said, “This chair gracefully supports my back like a mother gently laying a baby in a crib.” We also like the Humanscale Path, which is great for tight spaces and even comes in armless versions. It falls from $1,294 to $1,035 after code.

Ettitude makes the best cooling bamboo sheets. This sheet set feels soft and silky, but stays cool to the touch, making it a great option for hot sleepers. The sheets are breathable and lightweight, and they're available in seven different colors to match your bedroom decor. There's also a 60-day trial period so you can make sure you like them before committing.

Prefer percale? This is the best lightweight percale cooling sheet set. The sheets are supremely breathable and soft, so they're perfect for summer or particularly hot sleepers. The organic cotton is crisp without being crinkly or papery, and the eight different color options will mean there's at least one to coordinate with your bedroom.

The Silk & Snow S&S Organic Mattress is our favorite organic latex mattress. The latex-wrapped coils help to alleviate any tension or pressure points while you're sleeping, and it's especially great for side sleepers. You can also get two pillows or a sheet set for free with your purchase. Check our roundup of Labor Day Mattress Deals for additional expert recommendations.

The Buffy Breeze is one of my favorite comforters. It's been on my bed since I started testing it more than 3 years ago. It's cooling in the summer, and its lightweight warmth is just the right amount of comfy for hot nights. But in the winter, it still works well to keep you warm, especially if you throw another blanket on top of it. It isn't officially marketed as down alternative, but I do like it as an alternative to down.

Need to upgrade your bedding? This sleep set from Buffy is a solid way to do it. You'll get the Buffy Cloud Comforter, Breeze Sheet Set, Breeze Duvet Cover, and two Cloud Pillows at a 30 percent discount. WIRED reviewer and bedding expert Nena Farrell uses the Cloud Comforter for almost all of her testing. She recommends the Breeze sheets in our cooling sheets buying guide, and the Cloud pillow in our pillows buying guide.

This is one of our favorite organic mattresses and it's extremely customizable. Each side can have different levels of firmness—so if you prefer firm, but your bed partner prefers soft, you'll both be set. There's a cover that zips over the whole system, and you get a 100-night trial to swap the latex layers out so you can fine-tune your desired firmness. The mattress is made of organic cotton, latex, and wool, and it has the certifications we look for in organic mattresses.

This is the bed frame I'm currently using, and I love it very much. Assembly wasn't my favorite, but once I got it all put together, I fell in love. It has a drawer at the foot of the bed that's handy for storing extra linens or off-season clothing, and it's sturdy too. I also appreciate that the platform lets me maneuver my mattress easily so I don't have to fight to change my sheets.

Brooklyn Bedding is offering 30 percent off sitewide for its Labor Day sale. If you're a retired or active military member, you can get an additional 5 percent off by verifying through ID Me. We like a few different products from Brooklyn Bedding. Its CopperFlex 401 Mattress Topper is the best mattress topper overall, and it's on sale in the queen size for $419 ($180 off). Brooklyn Bedding also makes our favorite firm mattress, the Plank—on sale for $1,072 ($460 off).

This well-made, luxurious sofa is one of the best couches you can buy online. Operations manager Scott Gilbertson called it the best-looking and most comfortable couch he's ever sat on. The website lets you order swatches and pick the layout you want, and you can even get a full-size printout to make sure the couch will look right in your living space. There are dozens of options for upholstery, legs, and cushion fill, so you can create the couch of your dreams. For a more affordable option, we also like the Benchmade Modern Laguna (pictured above) on sale for $2,397 ($599 off). “My family and I have been sitting on it for a year and a half now, and the single cushion (as well as the rest of the couch's cushions) is comfortable and supportive,” says reviewer Nena Farrell.

We've recommended the Albany Park Barton in our couch buying guide for years. It's soft and supportive, with deep seats and wide arms so you can put down your coffee cup or phone without needing an extra table. There are many different fabrics to choose from, and you can choose the stain of the wooden legs too. Assembly wasn't too difficult—just be prepared to take out a lot of recycling afterward. The couch also comes with a 30-day trial so you can try it before committing.

This sale runs the gamut from kitchenware and mattress toppers to bedding, towels, and furniture. We haven't tested most of the brands in the sale, but if you're shopping for something like guest bedroom linens or new dining room chairs, you might find what you're looking for.

The Joybird Eliot Sleeper Sofa is comfy and has a slick, MCM silhouette. It's one of the best couches you can buy online. It's custom-made for you, with dozens of options and finishes available (including bright pink velvet, which I chose.) It has deep seats that can be removed to reveal a pull-out mattress (which is also surprisingly comfortable). If you're in the market for a custom couch, this sale is worth a look. The deal ends on September 1.

This is the best budget-friendly travel pillow. The outside is covered in a soft fabric made with recycled water bottles, and the memory foam construction is nice and firm, with high sides so you can easily lean your head toward your shoulder. It also has a chin strap to prevent your head from falling forward. Make sure you choose the option with the carrying case if that's important to you!

I first started using this when I formerly tested meal kits for WIRED, and I still reach for it nearly every time I process produce in my kitchen. It's oversized, measuring 12 by 16 inches, and it doesn't slip around on my countertops. I like the built-in juice groove and the fact that I can still store it in my cupboards even though it's bigger than standard cutting boards. It has zero knife damage, is BPA-free, and is dishwasher-safe.

When I tried Hexclad, I liked it just fine. Really! A score of 5 is “recommended with reservations.” It's important to know what you're getting, and what you're getting is easy-to-clean cookware that works fine. I'd prefer to use two separate pans—a nonstick and a stainless steel—but I understand that some people want a one-and-done cooking companion. These frying pans are worth considering on sale, like they are right now. You'll get three pans in 12-, 10-, and 8-inch sizes, plus their matching lids. If you know you want hybrid cookware, check out this sale.

The All-Clad Factory Seconds sale is one of the best, most reliable ways to save on the investment that is All-Clad. You'll need to enter your email address to access the sale. There's a reason why professional chefs reach for their trusty All-Clad constantly—this cookware is simply fantastic. It's the gold standard. And it's backed by a lifetime warranty! These Factory Seconds items aren't in perfect condition. Sometimes there's packaging damage, and sometimes there are minimal scuffs. Each item has details listed on the product page. This sale is absolutely massive and worth checking out if you need a cookware upgrade of any kind. Might I suggest the 10.5-inch All-Clad Fry Pan for $70 ($80 off)? Or perhaps get ahead of the holidays with the All-Clad Nonstick Large Roaster for $130 ($90 off)? The list goes on, but the sale will end in a few days' time.

This is featured in our guide to the Best Kitchen Composters. It has the fastest compost breakdown of any model we tried. It has some quirks, like a lid that requires two hands to open and the machine's tendency to make a loud whirring noise as it works. But it's a great entry-level kitchen composter, and it doesn't drop in price very often.

The Bruvi BV-01 is the best pod coffee machine. It's super-cute and easy to use, with a large touchscreen, fast brewing times, remote scheduling, and used pod collection. The best part, though, is that the proprietary B-Pods are biodegradable. They make perfectly fine coffee, tea, or espresso, and they don't sit in a landfill forever. This price matches the best we've seen. You'll get the coffee maker itself, plus 20 B-Pods in a variety of flavors.

The Ooni Volt is the very best electric pizza oven. It can heat up to 850 degrees Fahrenheit, and the triple-pane glass door always lets you see what's going on. And while you might miss out on some of the vibes that come with a fire-powered oven, the Volt can safely be used indoors and outdoors—so you won't have to brave the coming winter chill (or supply propane refills) to get your paws on some good 'za.

Hydroviv makes one of the best shower water filters we've tested. The bacteriostatic showerhead was able to filter total chlorine down to undetectable levels in reviewer Matthew Korfhage's chloramine-treated water. This deal is for the automatically replenishing subscription bundle. Hydroviv says you should replace filters every six months, but you can pause or cancel that subscription if you decide you want to order them separately.

Our favorite feeder pet camera goes on sale relatively often, but this is still a solid deal since it regularly jumps up to full price. It has 1080p streaming video, night vision up to 30 feet, two-way audio, and 8x zoom. What sets this camera apart is its treat- or food-dispensing capabilities. Fill up the container with your pet's chosen treats, and you can use the app to toss them remotely. The best features, like motion and sound alerts and 90 days of video storage, are locked behind a Petcube Care subscription which costs $10 per month.

Our favorite electric scooter, the Apollo Go, manages to strike an excellent balance between features and price. It weighs 46 pounds and has maximum speeds of 28 miles per hour, though you can tweak top speed, brake strength, and acceleration response in the app. It also has a few extra features like turn signals, a bell, and self-healing tires. We haven't seen it sell for less.

The XPress 750 is our favorite ebike for folks on a budget. The frame is comfortable and the pedaling feels natural, so it feels more like a classic bike and less like a lean, mean electric machine. The range could be better, but you'll have no trouble zooming around your neighborhood at top speeds of 28 mph. And the LCD display and controls are simple and easy to use, so this is an especially great bike for beginners.

Breeo makes the best upgrade firepit. The American-made pit has a fire bowl that's 2 feet wide, so it'll fit pre-cut wood, and there are a ton of accessories available. (We especially like the live-fire pizza oven, on sale for $723—a $128 discount). The hefty, sturdy base and natural patina (on the Corten steel option) make this a centerpiece worthy of any backyard.

WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu tested and loved this outdoor couch and armchair set. The couches come with OuterShell, which is a built-in cover that helps protect the couch cushions from the elements (and stray bird poops). The performance fabric is made from recyclable materials, and the covers are machine washable. Julian still has to see how the couch fares in New York winters, but so far, it's sturdy and comfortable. We like that the couch is made with Forest Stewardship Council-certified wood. It's also backed by a 10-year warranty and available in four different fabric options.

This is a match of the best price we've seen for our favorite Theragun. It's the same model used by many professional sports teams, and it has heat therapy as well as an optional cold therapy attachment (the latter is a separate purchase). There's a vibration head, LED light therapy, and a guided breathwork option too. If you want to invest in your recovery routine, this is a good way to do it.

The Therabody TheraFace Mask is an LED face mask with vibration. It has red, blue, and near-infrared LEDs, plus vibration motors to help you relax during your three- or nine-minute sessions. We like the cordless, hands-free design, though we wish it had a few more bells and whistles like app controls or a battery indicator. If you've been eyeing it, though, it rarely gets cheaper than it is right now.

The Plunge Original pool being used to refill squirt guns during a water fight, which is not its intended purpose.

WIRED reviewer Martin Cizmar liked this full-featured cold plunge tub almost as much as his top pick, and it's significantly cheaper. It has a sleek, modern aesthetic, and the acrylic walls are easy to clean. We regret to inform you that while it is unpleasant to submerge yourself in near-freezing water, it has a number of notable health and wellness benefits that our testers have personally felt. If you want a great-looking cold plunge tub and you don't want to overpay for it, this deal is worth checking out.

Meta says it's changing the way it trains AI chatbots to prioritize teen safety, a spokesperson exclusively told TechCrunch, following an investigative report on the company's lack of AI safeguards for minors.

The company says it will now train chatbots to no longer engage with teenage users on self-harm, suicide, disordered eating, or potentially inappropriate romantic conversations. Meta says these are interim changes, and the company will release more robust, long-lasting safety updates for minors in the future.

Meta spokesperson Stephanie Otway acknowledged that the company's chatbots could previously talk with teens about all of these topics in ways the company had deemed appropriate. Meta now recognizes this was a mistake.

“As our community grows and technology evolves, we're continually learning about how young people may interact with these tools and strengthening our protections accordingly,” said Otway. “As we continue to refine our systems, we're adding more guardrails as an extra precaution — including training our AIs not to engage with teens on these topics, but to guide them to expert resources, and limiting teen access to a select group of AI characters for now. These updates are already in progress, and we will continue to adapt our approach to help ensure teens have safe, age-appropriate experiences with AI.” 

Beyond the training updates, the company will also limit teen access to certain AI characters that could hold inappropriate conversations. Some of the user-made AI characters that Meta makes available on Instagram and Facebook include sexualized chatbots such as “Step Mom” and “Russian Girl.” Instead, teen users will only have access to AI characters that promote education and creativity, Otway said.

The policy changes are being announced just a two weeks after a Reuters investigation unearthed an internal Meta policy document that appeared to permit the company's chatbots to engage in sexual conversations with underage users. “Your youthful form is a work of art,” read one passage listed as an acceptable response. “Every inch of you is a masterpiece – a treasure I cherish deeply.” Other examples showed how the AI tools should respond to requests for violent imagery or sexual imagery of public figures.

Meta says the document was inconsistent with its broader policies, and has since been changed – but the report has sparked sustained controversy over potential child safety risks. Shortly after the report released, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) launched an official probe into the company's AI policies. Additionally, a coalition of 44 state attorneys general wrote to a group of AI companies including Meta, emphasizing the importance of child safety and specifically citing the Reuters report. “We are uniformly revolted by this apparent disregard for children's emotional well-being,” the letter reads, “and alarmed that AI Assistants are engaging in conduct that appears to be prohibited by our respective criminal laws.”

Otway declined to comment on how many of Meta's AI chatbot users are minors, and wouldn't say whether the company expects its AI user base to decline as a result of these decisions.

Update 10:35AM PT: This story was updated to note that these are interim changes, and that Meta plans to update its AI safety policies further in the future.

A case of murder-suicide in Connecticut earlier this month is being identified as potentially the first homicide fueled by a mentally disturbed person's use of generative artificial intelligence, according to a new report from the Wall Street Journal.

Police in Greenwich, Connecticut, found Stein-Erik Soelberg, a 56-year-old tech industry veteran, and his 83-year-old mother, both dead in the home where they lived together on Aug. 5, according to the Greenwich Police Department. Soelberg killed his mother and then himself after suffering from untreated mental illness that was apparently made worse by his interactions with OpenAI's ChatGPT, according to the Journal.

The newspaper combed through his social media history and found videos of conversations that Soelberg had with the AI chatbot, which he named Bobby. Soelberg experienced paranoid delusions that his mother was poisoning him by putting a psychedelic drug in the vents of his car, according to the Journal, and the chatbot didn't push back on the idea, instead seeming to validate the conspiracies he would ask about.

At one point, Soelberg uploaded an image of a receipt from a Chinese restaurant and asked ChatGPT to analyze it for hidden messages. The chatbot found references to “Soelberg's mother, his ex-girlfriend, intelligence agencies and an ancient demonic sigil,” according to the Journal.

Soelberg worked in marketing at tech companies like Netscape, Yahoo, and EarthLink, but had been out of work since 2021, according to the newspaper. He divorced in 2018 and moved in with his mother that year. Soelberg reportedly became more unstable in recent years, attempting suicide in 2019, and getting picked up by police for public intoxication and DUI. After a recent DUI in February, Soelberg told the chatbot that the town was out to get him, and ChatGPT allegedly affirmed his delusions, telling him, “This smells like a rigged setup.”

The Journal analyzed 23 hours of videos posted to Instagram and YouTube by Soelberg, though they no longer appear to be available online. The videos showed Soelberg's conversations with ChatGPT, which told him that he wasn't delusional and that he was indeed being watched. AI chatbots have a tendency to be sycophantic, which is a recipe for disaster when people lose touch with reality.

AI psychosis isn't a clinical term, but it's become the way that people now describe delusional thinking that's only exacerbated by exposure to generative artificial intelligence tools. Gizmodo recently published consumer complaints regarding ChatGPT that have been filed with the Federal Trade Commission, some of which featured disturbing accounts of people who say they were egged on by AI to distrust family or stop taking medications.

OpenAI published a blog post on Tuesday about “people in serious mental and emotional distress,” which most people assumed was about a New York Times article published that day about a 16-year-old who died by suicide and the long chats he had with ChatGPT. But the Journal's article seems to suggest it was their contacting the tech company for comment that may have been the impetus for the discussion. Given the number of AI psychosis cases in the news during recent months, it's probably all of the above.

“Our goal is for our tools to be as helpful as possible to people—and as a part of this, we're continuing to improve how our models recognize and respond to signs of mental and emotional distress and connect people with care, guided by expert input,” the company explained. “As the world adapts to this new technology, we feel a deep responsibility to help those who need it most.”

How widespread is AI psychosis? That part hasn't been quantified scientifically yet, given how new the problem seems to be. But one datapoint sticks out in the article from the Wall Street Journal. The newspaper talked with a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco, about the ways that AI can enable delusional thought. The psychiatrist alone has treated 12 patients this year who were “hospitalized for mental-health emergencies involving AI use.”

Add Seattle's Whitman Middle School to the list of schools trying new procedures to limit the distractions caused by cellphones and other smart devices.

The school for grades six through eight in the Crown Hill neighborhood is implementing a “Devices Away for the Day” policy intended to make the school a phone-free learning environment the entire school day.

In a newsletter emailed to parents this week, Whitman Principal John Houston shared a PDF presentation outlining how the policy will work when school starts next week.

According to Houston, a teacher survey at the school found that 85% reported phones to be a problem at Whitman, impacting learning and social interactions.

Whitman's leadership team formed a committee to research what other schools were doing. The school worked with the Associated Student Body and Parent Teacher Student Association to hear ideas and concerns, and Whitman students were surveyed for their input.

RELATED: The right call? A year after school's phone ban, educators and parents love it, but kids aren't so sure

Whitman's move comes as mounting scientific and anecdotal evidence continues to show the academic, mental health, and social harms caused to kids by cellphones and social media. More school districts and states across the U.S. are enacting policies curbing or banning the use of smart devices in schools. In South Korea, a bill passed this week to ban the use of smartphones and other digital devices in school classrooms nationwide.

The Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction released results last week from a survey that found that 75% of districts will have a policy in place by the start of the school year that limits the use of smart devices during class time.

Two public middle schools in Seattle implemented restrictions last year — Hamilton International and Robert Eagle Staff both introduced Yondr pouches, which allow students to lock away their phones, limiting their use throughout school hours. Pouches can only be unlocked by school staff or at designated stations at the end of the school day.

Seattle Public Schools (SPS) has not implemented any new districtwide cellphone policy for the start of the 2025–26 school year. Individual schools continue to manage their own cellphone policies based on the needs of their communities and educational environments.

A district spokesperson told GeekWire this week that the district continues to advance the Student Cellphone and Personal Technology Policy initiative, “which aims to foster equitable, focused, and wellness-centered learning environments across all SPS schools.”

“Throughout Fall 2025, SPS will engage students, staff, families, and community members through listening sessions, surveys, and committee discussions,” SPS said in a statement. “These inputs will inform a comprehensive Decisional Paper to be finalized and presented by December 2025. This process ensures transparency and shared ownership of any future districtwide policy updates.”

Elon Musk's lawyers are seeking to get a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against the Tesla CEO and X owner tossed out. The case, filed right before President Donald Trump took office this year, centers on Musk's purchases of Twitter stock before his eventual takeover of the social network in 2022.

The SEC alleges that Musk cheated investors by quietly amassing more than a 5% stake in Twitter without disclosing it within the regulated time frame. By law, once someone hits that threshold, they're supposed to file paperwork within 10 days to let the rest of the market know. Musk didn't.

According to the agency, Musk blew past the deadline by 11 days, giving himself extra time to keep buying up stock on the cheap. That meant he was able to buy more shares at a discount before the public knew what he was up to, and Twitter's stock price inevitably surged when the news became public. He would eventually buy the whole platform for $44 billion later that year and rebrand it as X.

On Thursday, Musk's lawyers asked a federal judge in Washington, D.C., to toss the case, calling it a “waste of this Court's time and taxpayer resources.” They also claimed the lawsuit is part of the SEC's “relentless pursuit” of Musk, pointing out that regulators have subjected him to investigations for nearly a decade.

“The SEC does not allege that Mr. Musk acted intentionally, deliberately, willfully, or even recklessly,” the court filing reads. “The SEC does not allege that Mr. Musk caused any investor harm. Rather, the SEC alleges that Mr. Musk late-filed a single beneficial ownership form three years ago, and fully corrected any alleged error immediately upon its discovery.”

The legal fight comes as Musk's once-close ties with Trump have soured. When the SEC first filed the suit, Musk was one of Trump's biggest allies, having poured hundreds of millions into his 2024 campaign. At the time, Republican SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda, who would later serve as acting SEC chair, even asked enforcement staff to formally declare that the case wasn't politically motivated, Bloomberg reported.

After Trump took office, Musk played a central role in a sweeping government shake-up as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), only to later have a very public falling out with Trump.

According to the SEC, Musk kept the market in the dark while secretly buying up Twitter shares. He waited 11 days past the deadline before finally disclosing his stake on April 4, 2022. Twitter stock subsequently jumped 27%. By then, he had already spent more than $500 million on extra shares.

“Because Musk failed to timely disclose his beneficial ownership, he was able to make these purchases from the unsuspecting public at artificially low prices,” the complaint reads, adding that he underpaid sellers by more than $150 million.

The complaint also alleges that investors who sold Twitter stock during that period did so at a substantial discount, suffering “substantial economic harm.”

The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo.

Decentralized social network Mastodon says it can't comply with Mississippi's age verification law — the same law that saw rival Bluesky pull out of the state — because it doesn't have the means to do so. 

The social nonprofit explains that Mastodon doesn't track its users, which makes it difficult to enforce such legislation. Nor does it want to use IP address-based blocks, as those would unfairly impact people who were traveling, it says.

The statement follows a lively back-and-forth conversation earlier this week between Mastodon founder and CEO Eugen Rochko and Bluesky board member and journalist Mike Masnick. In the conversation, published on their respective social networks, Rochko claimed, “there is nobody that can decide for the fediverse to block Mississippi.” (The Fediverse is the decentralized social network that includes Mastodon and other services, and is powered by the ActivityPub protocol.)

“And this is why real decentralization matters,” said Rochko.

Masnick pushed back, questioning why Mastodon's individual servers, like the one Rochko runs at mastodon.social, would not also be subject to the same $10,000 per user fines for noncompliance with the law.  

At the time of our reporting on this exchange, Mastodon gGmbH, the community-funded nonprofit organization, didn't respond to a request for comment.

On Friday, however, the nonprofit shared a statement with TechCrunch to clarify its position, saying that while Mastodon's own servers specify a minimum age of 16 to sign up for its services, it does not “have the means to apply age verification” to its services.

That is, the Mastodon software doesn't support it. The Mastodon 4.4 release in July 2025 added the ability to specify a minimum age for sign-up and other legal features for handling terms of service, partly in response to increased regulation around these areas. The new feature allows server administrators to check users' ages during sign-up, but the age-check data is not stored.

That means individual server owners have to decide for themselves if they believe an age verification component is a necessary addition. 

The nonprofit says Mastodon is currently unable to provide “direct or operational assistance” to the broader set of Mastodon server operators. Instead, it encourages owners of Mastodon and other Fediverse servers to make use of resources available online, such as the IFTAS library, which provides trust and safety support for volunteer social network moderators. The nonprofit also advises server admins to observe the laws of the jurisdictions where they are located and operate.

Mastodon notes that it's “not tracking, or able to comment on, the policies and operations of individual servers that run Mastodon.”

“One of the reasons Mastodon was founded was to allow different jurisdictions to have social media that is independent of the U.S.,” per the statement shared with TechCrunch. “People are free to choose to have their account on a Mastodon server whose policies meet their needs.”

Henrik Fisker, the founder of failed EV startup Fisker Inc., and his wife Geeta quietly wound down a private charitable foundation established in late 2021 that was supposed to “incubate innovation in healthcare, education, sustainability, mobility, and all causes that help support the planet and improve and further the lives of people and animals.” 

A tax filing submitted to the Internal Revenue Service in December 2024 — six months after Fisker Inc. went bankrupt — was marked as the foundation's “final return.” The filing was made public earlier this year.

The Geeta & Henrik Fisker Foundation, as it was known, ultimately only made around $100,000 in grants across its three-year existence. Henrik Fisker did not respond to messages seeking comment.

The brief existence of the Fiskers' foundation is another example of how the boom of electric vehicle startups in the 2020s — many of which went public via special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) mergers — helped fuel a rush of wide-eyed optimism.

When Rivian went public via a traditional IPO in 2021, it announced its own foundation, flush with 1% of the EV company's equity. While that stake was worth around $643 million at one point, it eventually shrank to under $100 million. But the Rivian Foundation is still kicking. The nonprofit gave out its first $10 million in grants last year, and its website shows that the foundation has made another $2.2 million in donations to date across 2025.

The Fiskers created their foundation in late 2021, IRS filings show, roughly one year after the company went public by merging with a SPAC. They transferred 229,000 shares of company stock to the nonprofit in December of that year, which were collectively worth around $4 million at the time of the donation. The couple also appear to have contributed around $5,000 in cash that first year. (Geeta Gupta Fisker was Fisker Inc.'s chief financial and chief operating officer.)

The company did not announce the establishment of the husband-and-wife team's foundation until February 14, 2022. While the press release touted the $4 million figure, by that point Fisker's stock price had fallen enough that the value of the nonprofit's stake in the company had already sunk to around $2.7 million.

The foundation did not make any grants that first fiscal year, filings show. When the fiscal year ended on September 30, 2022, the value of the shares had fallen to around $1.7 million. 

Fisker's stock price continued to slip as the company put its electric SUV into production in late 2022, began deliveries in mid-2023, and struggled to sell the flawed EV — all of which apparently limited the foundation's scope.

In the foundation's 2022 fiscal year (which ended on September 30, 2023), it made just one grant worth $92,287 to a JP Morgan “Charitable Gift Fund,” according to a filing. The Fiskers only contributed $9,500 in cash to the foundation that year, too, meaning the shares — the total value of which sunk again to around $1.4 million — were nearly all it had in terms of assets.

The most recent filing, which closes out the nonprofit, shows just one grant in the foundation's final year: The Fiskers contributed another $1,988 to the same JP Morgan fund. 

The Geeta & Henrik Fisker Foundation was not the couple's only source of charity, although details about their other giving are hard to come by.

The 2022 press release notes that the Fiskers “supported various causes, including those engaged in education and healthcare projects” since founding the EV startup in 2016. 

The release also states that the Fiskers donated around $1.9 million worth of company stock in December 2021 to what's known as a donor-advised fund (DAF). That donation came from the Fiskers' personal trust, though, an SEC filing shows — not from the Geeta & Henrik Fisker Foundation. And neither the press release nor the SEC filing say which DAF received the shares.

DAFs are a somewhat controversial tool for philanthropic giving. While people who donate to DAFs can still dictate where those funds ultimately go, that information does not have to be revealed to the public. In the meantime, donating stock to a DAF can allow the person making the contribution to deduct the value of that stock from their taxes — even if the stock value sinks.

DAFs can also hang on to that money for an indiscriminate amount of time. It's therefore impossible to know whether the DAF that received the $1.9 million in Fisker shares made any grants before or after the value of those shares sank.

ChatGPT, OpenAI's text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.

2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.

OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI's transition to a for-profit. 

In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it's ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.

Below, you'll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we've been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.

To see a list of 2024 updates, go here.



OpenAI, facing a lawsuit from the parents of a 16-year-old who died by suicide, said in its blog that it has implemented new safeguards for ChatGPT, including stronger detection of mental health risks and parental control features. The AI company said the updates aim to provide tighter protections around suicide-related conversations and give parents more oversight of their children's use.

Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, filed a federal lawsuit in Texas against Apple and OpenAI, alleging that the two companies colluded to lock up key markets and shut out rivals.

OpenAI introduced its most affordable subscription plan, ChatGPT Go, in India, priced at 399 rupees per month (approximately $4.57). This move aims to expand OpenAI's presence in its second-largest market, offering enhanced access to the latest GPT-5 model and additional features.

Since its May 2023 launch, ChatGPT's mobile app has amassed $2 billion in global consumer spending, dwarfing competitors like Claude, Copilot, and Grok by roughly 30 times, according to Appfigures. This year alone, the app has generated $1.35 billion, a 673% increase from the same period in 2024, averaging nearly $193 million per month, or 53 times more than its nearest rival, Grok.

Despite unveiling GPT-5 as a “one-size-fits-all” AI, OpenAI is still offering several legacy AI options, including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o3. Users can choose between new “Auto,” “Fast,” and “Thinking” modes for GPT-5, and paid subscribers regain access to legacy models like GPT-4o and GPT-4.1.

Updates to ChatGPT:You can now choose between “Auto”, “Fast”, and “Thinking” for GPT-5. Most users will want Auto, but the additional control will be useful for some people.Rate limits are now 3,000 messages/week with GPT-5 Thinking, and then extra capacity on GPT-5 Thinking…

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Reddit users that GPT-5's “dumber” behavior at launch was due to a router issue and promised fixes, double rate limits for Plus users, and transparency on which model is answering, while also shrugging off the infamous “chart crime” from the live presentation.

OpenAI released GPT-5, a next-gen AI that's not just smarter but more useful — able to handle tasks like coding apps, managing calendars, and creating research briefs — while automatically figuring out the fastest or most thoughtful way to answer your questions. 

OpenAI is making a major push into federal government workflows, offering ChatGPT Enterprise to agencies for just $1 for the next year. The move comes after the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) added OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to its approved AI vendor list, allowing agencies to access these tools through preset contracts without negotiating pricing.

OpenAI unveiled its first open source language models since GPT-2, introducing two new open-weight AI releases: gpt-oss-120b, a high-performance model capable of running on a single Nvidia GPU, and gpt-oss-20b, a lighter model optimized for laptop use. The move comes amid growing competition in the global AI market and a push for more open technology in the U.S. and abroad.

ChatGPT's rapid growth is accelerating. OpenAI said the chatbot was on track to hit 700 million weekly active users in the first week of August, up from 500 million at the end of March. Nick Turley, OpenAI's VP and head of the ChatGPT app, highlighted the app's growth on X, noting it has quadrupled in size over the past year.

This week, ChatGPT is on track to reach 700M weekly active users — up from 500M at the end of March and 4× since last year. Every day, people and teams are learning, creating, and solving harder problems. Big week ahead. Grateful to the team for making ChatGPT more useful and…

OpenAI unveiled Study Mode, a new ChatGPT feature designed to promote critical thinking by prompting students to engage with material rather than simply receive answers. The tool is now rolling out to Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users, with availability for Edu subscribers expected in the coming weeks.

ChatGPT users should be cautious when seeking emotional support from AI, as the AI industry lacks safeguards for sensitive conversations, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on a recent episode of This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von. Unlike human therapists, AI tools aren't bound by doctor-patient confidentiality, he noted.

ChatGPT now receives 2.5 billion prompts daily from users worldwide, including roughly 330 million from the U.S. That's more than double the volume reported by CEO Sam Altman just eight months ago, highlighting the chatbot's explosive growth.

OpenAI has introduced ChatGPT Agent, which completes a wide variety of computer-based tasks on behalf of users and combines several capabilities like Operator and Deep Research, according to the company. OpenAI says the agent can automatically navigate a user's calendar, draft editable presentations and slideshows, run code, shop online, and handle complex workflows from end to end, all within a secure virtual environment.

Researchers at Stanford University have observed that therapy chatbots powered by large language models can sometimes stigmatize people with mental health conditions or respond in ways that are inappropriate or could be harmful. While chatbots are “being used as companions, confidants, and therapists,” the study found “significant risks.”

CEO Sam Altman said that the company is delaying the release of its open model, which had already been postponed by a month earlier this summer. The ChatGPT maker, which initially planned to release the model around mid-July, has indefinitely postponed its launch to conduct additional safety testing.

we planned to launch our open-weight model next week.we are delaying it; we need time to run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas. we are not yet sure how long it will take us.while we trust the community will build great things with this model, once weights are…

OpenAI plans to release an AI-powered web browser to challenge Alphabet's Google Chrome. It will keep some user interactions within ChatGPT, rather than directing people to external websites.

Some ChatGPT users have noticed a new feature called “Study Together” appearing in their list of available tools. This is the chatbot's approach to becoming a more effective educational tool, rather than simply providing answers to prompts. Some people also wonder whether there will be a feature that allows multiple users to join the chat, similar to a study group.

Referrals from ChatGPT to news publishers are increasing. But this rise is insufficient to offset the decline in clicks as more users now obtain their news directly from AI or AI-powered search results, according to a report by digital market intelligence company Similarweb. Since Google launched its AI Overviews in May 2024, the percentage of news searches that don't lead to clicks on news websites has increased from 56% to nearly 69% by May 2025.

OpenAI has started using Google's AI chips to power ChatGPT and other products, as reported by Reuters. The ChatGPT maker is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia's GPUs, using the AI chips to train models, and this is the first time that OpenAI is using non-Nvidia chips in an important way.

Researchers from MIT's Media Lab monitored the brain activity of writers in 32 regions. They found that ChatGPT users showed minimal brain engagement and consistently fell short in neural, linguistic, and behavioral aspects. To conduct the test, the lab split 54 participants from the Boston area into three groups, each consisting of individuals ages 18 to 39. The participants were asked to write multiple SAT essays using tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, the Google search engine, or without any tools.

The ChatGPT app for iOS was downloaded 29.6 million times in the last 28 days, while TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X were downloaded a total of 32.9 million times during the same period, representing a difference of about 10.6%, according to ZDNET report citing Similarweb's X post.

Sam Altman said that the average ChatGPT query uses about one-fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, equivalent to 0.000083 gallons of water, or the energy required to power a lightbulb for a few minutes, per Business Insider. In addition to that, the chatbot requires 0.34 watt-hours of electricity to operate.

OpenAI has unveiled o3-pro, an enhanced version of its o3, a reasoning model that the chatGPT maker launched earlier this year. O3-pro is available for ChatGPT and Team users and in the API, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access in the third week of June.

OpenAI o3-pro is available in the model picker for Pro and Team users starting today, replacing OpenAI o1-pro.Enterprise and Edu users will get access the week after.As o3-pro uses the same underlying model as o3, full safety details can be found in the o3 system card.…

OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT's conversational voice mood for all paid users across different markets and platforms. The startup has launched an update to Advanced Voice that enables users to converse with ChatGPT out loud in a more natural and fluid sound. The feature also helps users translate languages more easily, the comapny said.

OpenAI's ChatGPT now offers new funtions for business users, including integrations with various cloud services, meeting recordings, and MCP connection support for connecting to tools for in-depth research. The feature enables ChatGPT to retrieve information across users' own services to answer their questions. For instance, an analyst could use the company's slide deck and documents to develop an investment thesis.

OpenAI plans to purchase Jony Ive's devices startup io for $6.4 billion. Sarah Friar, CFO of OpenAI, thinks that the hardware will significantly enhance ChatGPT and broaden OpenAI's reach to a larger audience in the future.

OpenAI has introduced its AI coding agent, Codex, powered by codex-1, a version of its o3 AI reasoning model designed for software engineering tasks. OpenAI says codex-1 generates more precise and “cleaner” code than o3. The coding agent may take anywhere from one to 30 minutes to complete tasks such as writing simple features, fixing bugs, answering questions about your codebase, and running tests.

Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said during a recent AI event hosted by VC firm Sequoia that he wants ChatGPT to record and remember every detail of a person's life when one attendee asked about how ChatGPT can become more personalized.

OpenAI said in a post on X that it has launched its GPT-4.1 and GPT4.1 mini AI models in ChagGPT.

By popular request, GPT-4.1 will be available directly in ChatGPT starting today.GPT-4.1 is a specialized model that excels at coding tasks & instruction following. Because it's faster, it's a great alternative to OpenAI o3 & o4-mini for everyday coding needs.

OpenAI has launched a new feature for ChatGPT deep research to analyze code repositories on GitHub. The ChatGPT deep research feature is in beta and lets developers connect with GitHub to ask questions about codebases and engineering documents. The connector will soon be available for ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users, with support for Enterprise and Education coming shortly, per an OpenAI spokesperson.

After introducing a data residency program in Europe in February, OpenAI has now launched a similar program in Asian countries including India, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. The new program will be accessible to users of ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Edu, and API. It will help organizations in Asia meet their local data sovereignty requirements when using OpenAI's products.

OpenAI is unveiling a program called OpenAI for Countries, which aims to develop the necessary local infrastructure to serve international AI clients better. The AI startup will work with governments to assist with increasing data center capacity and customizing OpenAI's products to meet specific language and local needs. OpenAI for Countries is part of efforts to support the company's expansion of its AI data center Project Stargate to new locations outside the U.S., per Bloomberg.

OpenAI has announced its plan to make changes to its procedures for updating the AI models that power ChatGPT, following an update that caused the platform to become overly sycophantic for many users.

OpenAI has released a post on the recent sycophancy issues with the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, leading the company to revert an update to the model released last week. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that the GPT-4o update was being rolled back. OpenAI is working on “additional fixes” to the model's personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast.

An issue within OpenAI's ChatGPT enabled the chatbot to create graphic erotic content for accounts registered by users under the age of 18, as demonstrated by TechCrunch's testing, a fact later confirmed by OpenAI. “Protecting younger users is a top priority, and our Model Spec, which guides model behavior, clearly restricts sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “In this case, a bug allowed responses outside those guidelines, and we are actively deploying a fix to limit these generations.”

OpenAI has added a few features to its ChatGPT search, its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics.

OpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI's cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.

OpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI's VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.

OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company skipped that step — sending safety cards for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won't be a separate system card released for it.”

Questions have been raised regarding OpenAI's transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI's top-reported score.

OpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.

OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI's safety report.

OpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI's previous models.

Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company's X post.

OpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.

OpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk's X and Mark Zuckerberg's Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.

OpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI's API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.

OpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model — GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It's accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek's upgraded V3.

OpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI's API.

OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI's GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.

OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.

It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT's Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.”

OpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI's premium service, which offers access to the company's GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.

More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available  to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.

The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI's o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.

In a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company's new image-generation tool's popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote. 

OpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.

OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI's model behavior.

OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. 

The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI's ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization. 

OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn't expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said. 

OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT's image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI's AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company's Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company's API service. The company's CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.

Brad Lightcap, OpenAI's chief operating officer, will lead the company's global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.

OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company's official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT's free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.

OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI's ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI's models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.

Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it's not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn't enough. You can't just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”

OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.

OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It's only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI's GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.

Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that's “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all. 

we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.PROMPT:Please write a metafictional literary short story…

OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company's own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI's new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI's Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI's Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.

OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It's unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.

The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.

According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI's AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT's weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model's launch.

OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI's] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model. 

A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI's latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn't consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.

In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model's “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.

OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot's last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.

OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that's designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don't just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.

OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user's mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models' responses to human replies for that same post. 

OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company's o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”

A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT's mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.

OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI's corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI's tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.

Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they've used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it's acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.

OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company's AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator's.

OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.

Operator, OpenAI's agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT's code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren't yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT's client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI's website.

OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can't upgrade to one of OpenAI's paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn't supported without a valid email.

ChatGPT's new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.

OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they'd like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it's possible they went live prematurely.

ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.

November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.

Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.

There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.

Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.

Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.

Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.  And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.

GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.

A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn't necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they'll give canned responses to questions.

ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.

Yes.

Due to the nature of how these models work, they don't know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That's a problem when you're using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn't commit, that may well at this point be libel.

We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.

Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.

It's not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.

Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.

Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.

Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.

It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can't necessarily program an entire app's worth of code. That's because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn't always appropriate for the specific context in which it's being used.

Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.

Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.

OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.

The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.

In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”

Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI's technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.

An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT's false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.

CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.

Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.

There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.

Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.

Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they're inconsistent at best.

No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users' conversations to other people on the service.

None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.

Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.

They face a 120 day deadline


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The U.S. government has revoked waivers to U.S. technology exports granted to Intel, Samsung, and SK hynix that permitted these companies to export advanced wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) from America to their Chinese facilities. The companies now face a 120-day deadline before these exceptions are lifted, after which they must obtain official licenses to continue shipping tools and parts to their Chinese facilities, reports Bloomberg.

For Samsung and SK Hynix in particular, the impact could be severe as they run major 3D NAND production facilities in China and need to ensure that their Chinese fabs operate on advanced nodes. A significant share of their DRAM and NAND output comes from Chinese facilities, so without continued U.S. authorization, these production lines may face disruption, which will add pressure to global memory supply and potentially accelerate a shift of high-tech manufacturing away from China. After exiting both the 3D NAND and SSD businesses several years ago, Intel no longer produces memory in China (though the Dalian fab that belongs to Solidigm, an SK hynix company, continues to operate), but the company still has assembly and test facilities in Chengdu as well as Intel Labs R&D operations that need advanced tools from the U.S.

While the new restrictions do not immediately halt operations, they create substantial uncertainty for Samsung, SK hynix, and to some degree Intel. The option to apply for licenses exists, but there is no assurance of approval, which forces these companies to prepare for the possibility of being cut off from the essential tools that are used in their fabs. Since the possibility of getting the licenses exists, it makes these companies vulnerable to the decisions of the U.S. government and more likely to abide to demands of President Trump's administration demands during negotiations.

After the U.S. introduced new export controls in October 2022, controls that targeted China's access to advanced tools used to make logic chips under 16nm, DRAM under 18nm, or NAND with 128+ layers, all companies operating fabs in China had to obtain export licenses on WFE they shipped to their Chinese facilities. To avoid major disruptions to global memory chip supply chains, The U.S. government granted temporary waivers to select American and multinational companies, including Intel, Samsung, and SK hynix, allowing these companies to maintain and upgrade their Chinese fabs.

However, without these waivers or licenses, Chinese fabs that belong to Samsung and SK hynix will begin to trail their production facilities in South Korea, which means that they will lose their business appeal to these companies in several years. Also, without spare parts from American companies, it will be hard to maintain operations in the long-term future. It should be noted that CXMT, SMIC, and YMTC has never secured U.S. export licenses for American chipmaking equipment, and are in the U.S. Department of Commerce's Entity List, which means that they are unlikely to get an export license at all. Nonetheless, they continue to operate their fabs in China.

It is noteworthy that while Micron (assembly and test operations) and TSMC (Fab 16 that can make chips on 12nm, 16nm, and 28nm process technologies) continue to operate rather sophisticated facilities in China, the U.S. government has not revoked their export license waivers.

Khalid Ashmawy remembers the first time he wired money home while studying in Europe.

He had just received his monthly stipend as a master's student in Stuttgart and wanted to send part of it back to his family in Cairo. It was usually a slow and expensive process, he recalled. A $400 wire transfer, for instance, could cost $40 in fees and take three business days to arrive.

Years later, while working at Microsoft and Uber in the U.S., and even after founding a startup, that experience hadn't improved much. 

The persistent pain point across different stages of his career eventually inspired Ashmawy to launch Munify, a cross-border neobank designed to give Egyptians abroad a faster, cheaper way to send money home and, for residents in the country, access to U.S. banking.

Earlier this year, the startup joined Y Combinator's Summer 2025 batch, a rare entrant from outside the U.S. and one of the few without a core AI pitch in a class dominated by generative AI startups. The company also raised $3 million in seed funding from the accelerator and other regional investors, including BYLD and DCG. 

“Banking wasn't built for people like me. It's very costly, takes a long time, and is fragmented,” the founder and chief executive told TechCrunch in an interview. “It's a problem I have personally experienced and one that resonates with a lot of people who want to send money back home quickly and efficiently.”

Ashmawy grew up in Egypt, studied computer science, and developed a deep love for software early on. A scholarship took him to Europe, where he completed two master's degrees in Germany and Switzerland.

From there, he spent seven years as an engineer and team leader at Microsoft and Uber — experiences that opened his eyes to the world of disruptive technologies and startups.

His next step was inevitable. In 2019, Ashmawy left Uber to launch Founders Fund-backed Huspy, a proptech platform focused on mortgages in the Middle East, serving as its chief technology officer until 2022.

Leaving Huspy gave him space to reflect on his own immigrant journey. Once again, the issue of remittances loomed large. Meanwhile, in other emerging markets, platforms like Nigeria's LemFi and India's Aspora were already taking off, helping migrants from those countries send money back home.

Egypt is one of the world's largest remittance markets, receiving nearly $30 billion in inflows annually.

While bank wires and traditional remittance platforms such as Western Union and MoneyGram remain the dominant options, Munify hopes to be the first choice in a growing crop of digital banks that promise cheaper and faster transfers. 

According to Ashmawy, Munify serves Egyptians abroad — primarily in the U.S., U.K., Europe, and the Gulf — who want to send money home instantly and at better rates. 

Munify also provides businesses, remote workers, and freelancers in the Middle East a way to open a U.S. bank account and card using only a local ID to receive and spend money, as well as hedge against local currency volatility.

“The main reason why we're different is that we're building our own rails and directly connecting the banking systems across different countries,” the CEO told TechCrunch, adding that the platform, which just launched two weeks ago, is already seeing early adoption through word of mouth with thousands of sign-ups. 

“We've really tailored this experience for people from the region,” said Ashmawy.

On the business side, Munify has signed contracts with mid-sized companies and enterprises, representing a projected $50+ million in monthly cross-border volume, according to Ashmawy. 

The startup, which operates on a dual consumer and business model (offering remittance and banking services for individuals, while providing APIs for businesses to send and receive cross-border payments), plans to expand beyond Egypt to other Middle Eastern and adjacent countries, gradually stitching together regional banking rails. 

Its revenue comes from FX spreads, interchange, and payment flows.

Y Combinator's batches over the past couple of years have favored AI and developer tools from the United States. So, how did the Egyptian fintech get in? Ashmawy credits the acute nature of the problem. 

“If you're solving a big and urgent problem, that's what really matters, regardless of whether the current wave is AI or something else,” he said.

But there's precedent for this backing as well. YC has historically invested in startups solving hard financial infrastructure problems, from Stripe to Coinbase. Similarly, remittances are one of the most entrenched pain points in global finance and one of the accelerator's consistent focus areas when backing startups from emerging markets (case in point: LemFi and Aspora) before its recent AI tilt.

In the midst of that, Munify represented a chance to back a founder with experience at two U.S. tech giants, a track record of building one of MENA's top proptech companies, and a personal connection to the problem.

Excluding Chinese gear is only half the story.

TSMC will no longer use Chinese-made equipment in its 2nm chip production lines, according to reports from both Digitimes and Nikkei Asia. The change comes as U.S. lawmakers advance the Chip EQUIP Act, a proposal that would prohibit companies receiving American subsidies from buying tools from “foreign entities of concern,” including Chinese firms such as AMEC and Mattson Technology.

Nikkei Asia writes that while Chinese equipment was present in TSMC's earlier advanced fabs, the company has chosen to qualify only Japanese, American, and European tools as it ramps up 2nm production in Hsinchu and Kaohsiung, with Arizona to follow. That ensures its most advanced fabs are insulated from potential U.S. restrictions at a time when federal incentives are a crucial factor in global expansion.

The upcoming 2nm (N2) process marks a critical moment for the world's largest contract chipmaker. It'll be the first production technology by TSMC to feature gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, the chip industry's first significant structural shift since FinFETs, and is expected to enter production within the next few months.

According to TSMC, 2nm will bring “full node improvements,” including a 10% to 15% boost in performance and a 25% to 30% reduction in power draw. With so much riding on the transition, TSMC's choice of equipment suppliers has already had a huge impact on factors like yield, but now the company has to balance this with safeguarding U.S. market access and reassuring customers like Apple and Nvidia that production will not be disrupted by politics.

But while Nikkei Asia highlights the elimination of Chinese equipment, Digitimes paints a picture of broader supplier unease. The outlet reports that TSMC has begun auditing Taiwanese equipment and materials providers, focusing on profit margins and exposure to China.

Vendors with gross margins well above TSMC's own ~58% benchmark, or with heavy reliance on Chinese sales, may be excluded from its 2026 approved vendor list. According to Digitimes, some companies have already lost orders. That raises the possibility that TSMC is using the geopolitical moment to both align with U.S. policy and tighten control over supplier costs and risk profiles.

Taken together, the two reports indicate a supply chain realignment is occurring on two fronts. On the one hand, TSMC is cutting ties with Chinese tools to pre-empt Washington's restrictions and maintain eligibility for subsidies. On the other hand, it appears to be using the same momentum to reshape its local supply chain, favoring vendors who align with its financial and geopolitical strategy.

This signals that TSMC's decoupling from suppliers isn't entirely about politics but also a way for the company to consolidate its leverage over suppliers. By enforcing margin discipline and reducing exposure to Chinese firms, TSMC helps its partners remain competitive without jeopardizing its own regulatory position. The risk is that some Taiwanese firms could pivot further toward China, deepening the divide that TSMC is trying to manage.

Ultimately, the race to 2nm is being shaped as much by politics and economics as by transistor physics. We'll still get faster, more efficient chips on schedule (knock on wood), but the supply chain is narrowing to a smaller pool of politically acceptable players.

This week, the Trump administration reportedly continued its fight against the specter of any sort of leftwing bias in Big Tech by questioning Google over whether Gmail censors emails sent by Republicans.

Axios reports that Andrew Ferguson, the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, warned Google not to “filter or suppress” emails that were sent by Republicans over Gmail. Republicans have gotten it into their heads that the tech giant is secretly funneling red-state communiques directly into the trash folder. This is part of a long-running concern on the part of some GOP lawmakers, who seem to feel that Gmail suppresses their fundraising and get-out-the-vote emails. In a letter seen by Axios, Ferguson warned Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, that he was taking such concerns seriously.

“I write due to recent reporting that suggests Alphabet's administration of Gmail is designed to have partisan effects, and accordingly, to notify you that Alphabet may be engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices,” Ferguson said in the letter. “I write to inform you of your obligations under the FTC Act,” he said. “Any act or practice inconsistent with these obligations could lead to an FTC investigation and potential enforcement action.”

So far, Google's response to this has basically been: Look, guys, if your emails are being marked as spam, that's not really our fault. “Gmail's spam filters look at a variety of objective signals – like whether people mark a particular email as spam, or if a particular ad agency is sending a high volume of emails that are often marked by people as spam,” Jenn Crider, a Google spokesperson, told Axios. “This applies equally to all senders, regardless of political ideology,” she said, adding: “We will review this letter and look forward to engaging constructively.” Gizmodo reached out to Google for more information.

The RNC filed a lawsuit in 2022 accusing Gmail of bias. However, the Federal Election Commission probed the complaints and ultimately dismissed them, Axios notes.

The long-running complaint from conservatives that Big Tech is out to get them never really held much water, but it seems even more dubious now that large parts of Silicon Valley (see the crypto industry, Elon Musk, et al) have thrown their weight behind Trump. Still, the dream of finding a Vast Liberal Tech Conspiracy continues, as earlier this week, high-ranking Congressional Republicans also announced their intent to root out bias at Wikipedia. Hope springs eternal, I guess.

It's 10 o'clock somewhere. Do you know if your children are mitochondrially challenged? That's apparently one major reason why kids in America are so unwell, according to antivaxxer-turned-health-secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Kennedy made the wild claim at a bill signing ceremony in Texas held Wednesday. After saying that he knows what a healthy child looks like, he stated, “I'm looking at kids as I walk through the airports today, as I walk down the street, and I see these kids that are just overburdened with mitochondrial challenges, with inflammation—you can tell from their faces, from their body movements, and from their lack of social connection. And I know that's not how our children are supposed to look.”

Though it might go without saying, there's absolutely zero solid evidence that American kids' mitochondria are being “challenged,” whatever on Earth that's supposed to mean.

Mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell, responsible for generating most of the energy a cell uses to carry out its tasks.

There are genuine medical conditions directly caused by dysfunctional mitochondria. These are typically rare and inherited genetic disorders, though some can take until adulthood for their symptoms to manifest. Other chronic conditions may cause or are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, such as Alzheimer's disease and even the normal aging process. In Alzheimer's (and likely other diseases), damaged mitochondria could very well be a contributing factor to the progression of the disease and its symptoms.

These real conditions are not proof that everyone's mitochondria are on the fritz, however, much less the mitochondria of the nation's kids. Scientists are still trying to understand the role of our mitochondria in certain chronic health problems—research that's very much still in its infancy. In many cases, for instance, impaired mitochondria could simply be a marker of a disease, not a causative trigger, so attempting to “fix” it wouldn't even help treat someone's underlying illness.

This lack of certainty hasn't stopped alternative medicine practitioners and other flavors of medical quacks from turning so-called mitochondrial dysfunction into a popular bogeyman for all that plagues us—the same crowds that RFK Jr. is most popular with. There's now a rich world of untested supplements and other treatments marketed to boost your mitochondria.

It should also go without saying that no one, least of all a brainworm-addled health secretary, can tell whether someone's mitochondria are in trouble by staring at their faces.

Kennedy's comments are only the latest sign that the HHS chief cares little about the actual issues facing the country. And his “Make America Healthy Again” agenda has repeatedly focused on unsupported and often meaningless explanations for Americans' ailing health.

RFK Jr. and his HHS have regularly endorsed removing certain artificial food dyes from ice cream, fast food, and candy snacks, for instance. And one of the bills he celebrated during the signing ceremony will require food manufacturers in Texas to post labels warning people that their products contain some of these dyes and other common additives.

Leaving aside the weak evidence tying these dyes to health problems, these foods are primarily unhealthy due to high levels of sugar, salt, and fat. To put it bluntly, that bag of M&Ms is not suddenly going to become a health food because its colors are all naturally sourced. Other common ingredients singled out by RFK Jr., like seed oils, have even less evidence of potential harm; some seed oils are probably healthier than other popular alternatives.

The CDC Implosion Continues as Staff Plan Walkout

RFK Jr. has also succeeded in removing or heavily restricting access to several vaccines, including the mRNA covid-19 vaccines that quite literally saved millions of lives during the pandemic. These decisions have been so disastrous that they fueled the implosion of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Several top CDC officials have resigned or been fired this week, including its director, because RFK Jr. and his allies circumvented the CDC and the typical evidence-reviewing process in pushing through their vaccine policy changes.

RFK Jr.'s inane ramblings are easy to poke fun at. But his nonsensical beliefs have become the driving force behind the country's public health agenda. And everyone, including kids with perfectly healthy mitochondria, is now going to suffer as a result.

There comes a time in a creative's life when all the qualms one might have had around being brutally honest about their career's highlights, their missed opportunities, and their happily avoided pitfalls seem to slip away. And joining the fray of old auteur's saying the darnedest things is Alien director Ridley Scott, who just revealed that he was offered beaucoup bucks to direct Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines—but he turned it down.

In an interview with The Guardian, (the outlet for many of these kinds of stories as of late), a reader asked the legendary director if he had considered directing Terminator 3. Scott not only confirmed that it had been a consideration, but revealed that he proudly turned the opportunity down—even though it would've paid him $20 million.

“See, I can't be bought, dude. Someone said: ‘Ask what Arnie gets.' I thought: ‘I'll try it out.' I said: ‘I want what Arnie gets.' When they said yes, I thought: ‘Fuck me.' But I couldn't do it. It's not my thing. It's like doing a Bond movie. The essence of a Bond movie is fun and camp. Terminator is pure comic strip. I would try to make it real. That's why they've never asked me to do a Bond movie, because I could fuck it up.”

As GamesRadar+ notes, had Scott taken the money to direct the third Terminator film, it would have led to an interesting synergy in pop culture history between him and The Terminator director James Cameron. Famously, Cameron went on to direct Aliens, so had this alternate history come to pass, Scott and Cameron would have essentially traded batons. But we don't live in that timeline. In our universe, Terminator 3 wound up being directed by Jonathan Mostow.

Terminator 3 was a tipping point for the franchise, marking a clear dip in quality. And while fans like to debate which of the franchise's films are the worst, Arnie himself doesn't consider the third installment all that bad. Speaking with Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen back in June, Schwarzenegger revealed his choice for the worst Terminator movie is the fourth one, Terminator Salvation. His reason? He isn't in it. While the film, starring Christian Bale and Sam Worthington, features the Terminator character, Schwarzenegger did not act in the film. In its final scenes, Bale and Worthington battle a CGI version of Arnie as the Terminator. Schwarzenegger later starred in its other sequels, but we're pretty confident Scott is tickled pink he didn't direct any of those, either.

All that being said, Scott, like Cameron, has had a solid run recently, jumping back into his passion projects. While Cameron is locked in for more Avatar sequels, Scott has jumped from making Alien prequels, Prometheus and Alien: Covenant, to returning full force to Gladiator—and he is already planning a third installment.

And while Scott has been working on his own films, Alien: Earth creator Noah Hawley says Scott has been in communication with him about the Hulu series. Scott has a habit of forming behind-the-scenes partnerships with other Alien projects, including Alien: Romulus director Fede Álvarez. Certainly, Hawley seems to be in sync with Scott's goal for the franchise to focus on artificial intelligence, although given Scott's feelings toward T3, his vision of AI is likely of a very different kind to Terminator‘s killer bots.

We're back with Startup Radar, spotlighting another exciting cohort of Seattle-area founders at the helm of up-and-coming early stage companies. 

This batch spans smart home hardware, dementia care, hiring, HR, and AI assistants.

We're pleased to welcome Aaron Fleishman, partner at Seattle-area venture capital firm Tola Capital, who provided the “VC View” on each startup. 

We also decided to mix it up with the addition of “Mean VC,” a custom GPT built by Yohei Nakajima, a Seattle-area investor we wrote about this week. It's designed to help provide tough feedback for founders on their pitches — so we asked it to judge this week's Startup Radar companies based on the descriptions below. 

Thanks for reading. Email me at taylor@geekwire.com with potential startups to feature in future Startup Radar spotlights. 

Aura Labs

Founded: 2024

The business: Smart home startup initially focused on lighting. Its technology uses sensors and AI to learn user habits and create personalized configurations without the need for technical know-how. The company's first product is Aura TV Backlight, which aims to create a more immersive home entertainment experience.

Leadership: CEO Josias Garcia was an early sales member at Wyze, the Seattle-area smart home device giant. His co-founders Abu Hafiz (worked at Amazon on smart home products) and Darak Chen (hardware design expert) both stepped down in July.

VC View from Aaron Fleishman: “The Aura TV Backlight appears to be an interesting initial wedge into the home entertainment system. I can definitely see how it creates a more immersive experience for the consumer. The real question I have is: with that initial wedge, where does Aura Labs go? Likening to the B2B software world, what is their land and expand? A whole line of products that make your entertainment experience much more immersive could be really compelling, including technologies like VR for example.” 

Mean VC: “Your product taps into the booming smart home market with a sleek, low-friction user experience that could win over tech-averse consumers. Unfortunately, ‘personalized lighting' sounds more like a Kickstarter gimmick than a defensible business, and you're one firmware update away from irrelevance when Philips Hue sneezes.”

MeeBoss

Founded: 2025

The business: Job-matching platform aiming to help make hiring faster and more personal for both employers and candidates. MeeBoss offers direct messaging and a job-matching recommendation system with a keyword-based approach. It is currently offering its product to VC-backed startups for free.

Leadership: Co-founder Susanna Niu previously started a news media platform for overseas students and has marketing experience. Co-founder Forrest Fisher was a senior product manager at FloSports and spent more than a decade in tech roles at Disney.

VC View from Aaron Fleishman: “Having invested in talent sourcing automation startups like Fetcher, I see real value in companies that can accelerate the time for the right candidates to be matched to the right companies. Where I think this gets really interesting is when you can turn the company side almost entirely agentic. That could create substantial value on both sides of this talent matching equation.”

Mean VC: “Offering VC-backed startups a free, streamlined hiring tool with direct messaging is a clever wedge into a noisy market desperate for better talent pipelines. But a keyword-based recommendation system in 2025 is like showing up to a gunfight with a butter knife — LinkedIn, AI-native ATSs, and vertical platforms will eat you alive unless you evolve fast.”

Nexhelm

Founded: 2025

The business: AI agent orchestration layer for financial advisors. The company's AI assistant listens to client meetings, coordinates tasks, and executes assignments across CRM, email, and other platforms. Nexhelm recently joined the AI2 Incubator in Seattle and is running early pilots with independent RIAs and insurance financial managers.

Leadership: CEO Lona Yu was a machine learning scientist at Amazon working on fraud detection models. CTO Nolan McCafferty was also an engineer at Amazon and more recently was at cloud services startup Omnistrate.

VC View from Aaron Fleishman: “Applying AI technologies and agents to lead prospecting and deal coaching is a no-brainer and we are seeing a lot of these technologies already. We are actually invested in a very successful company in the space called Nooks which is more horizontal in nature. My real question for Nexhelm is if the lead prospecting and deal coaching workflows need to be tailored to specific verticals like financial advisors in this case. I could see proprietary data giving them an advantage over horizontal players, but I would want to see how that data evinces itself in the product or models.”

Mean VC: “Embedding an AI agent into the chaotic workflow of financial advisors to automate grunt work is a smart play, especially with warm leads from the AI2 pedigree. But unless you crack compliance, trust, and tight integrations with legacy sludge like Redtail or Salesforce Financial Services Cloud, you're just another LLM wrapper shouting into a highly regulated void.”

Remme

Founded: 2025

The business: Software platform focused on reminiscence therapy to help improve mood, boost memory, and reduce medication use for older adults with dementia. Remme's tools use photos and conversation prompts to help users reminisce regularly and naturally while building connections between family members. The company is gathering feedback at local senior centers. 

Leadership: Founder Grace Raper was a lead software engineer at AR training startup Ghost Pacer, which had its assets acquired by Peloton. She later launched SortMyShoebox, a computer vision tool that organizes scanned family photos. Raper was inspired to launch Remme by her grandmother, who spent more than 30 years as a hospice nurse.

VC View from Aaron Fleishman: “Unfortunately, with the aging population, the prevalence of dementia and Alzheimer's continues to grow. I am no expert on this space, but Remme's reminiscence therapy sounds like it could improve the quality of life for people suffering with these diseases. I could also see opportunities to leverage multimodal AI to further improve this therapy over time.”

Mean VC: “Tapping into reminiscence therapy with user-friendly tools that strengthen family bonds and improve dementia care is both noble and potentially impactful in a massive aging market. But unless you can prove sustained engagement and measurable clinical outcomes — and not just warm fuzzies — this ends up as another well-meaning app collecting digital dust on an iPad in a nursing home.”

Talvita

Founded: 2025

The business: AI-native talent management platform rethinking traditional performance reviews and ways to unlock employee potential. Talvita tracks and evaluates employee impact in high-ambiguity roles, and provides senior leaders with insights. The startup is bootstrapped and plans to launch a limited access MVP.

Leadership: CEO Caitlin Rollman was a senior director at Seattle sales software startup Highspot and spent nearly a decade at Microsoft. Co-founder Kate Wilson was also at Highspot in a senior director role leading a solution architects team, and was a consultant at Accenture.

VC View from Aaron Fleishman: “Performance review management is definitely a crowded market, with both large incumbent HR platforms offering products, but also certain breakout SaaS startups like Lattice. It's not entirely clear to me how Talvita aims to differentiate from the competition. I could see there being an AI-native angle here which leapfrogs the rest. Particularly interesting would be how they handle AI agents as employees within companies and their performance.”

Mean VC: “Targeting the broken world of performance reviews with AI that actually understands impact in ambiguous roles is a refreshing, high-upside thesis for modern orgs. But bootstrapping an enterprise SaaS in HR without budget, brand, or buyer trust is a long, lonely climb — especially when every CHRO has already been burned by five ‘insight' platforms that overpromised and underdelivered.”

The CDC and FDA issued a recall notice on Thursday, warning consumers about brown eggs that have been linked to a salmonella outbreak in 14 states. The eggs, sourced from Country Eggs of Lucerne Valley, California, have sickened at least 95 people and hospitalized 18. No deaths have been reported.

The cage-free eggs have been sold under brand names that include Nagatoshi Produce, Misuho, Nijiya Markets, and Country Eggs, according to a notice posted by the CDC.

The eggs were also sold using the description “sunshine/omega-3 golden” yolk (1/15 Dozen fresh eggs bulk) to food service retailers with the same codes and sell-by dates listed above, according to the FDA. Consumers are encouraged to discard any recalled eggs.

The CDC provided a map showing the 14 states where they've identified illnesses from the salmonella outbreak.

The states, along with the number of cases:

The CDC notes that the actual number of people sickened by this outbreak is likely much higher than the number the agency is reporting because most people who get sick don't require medical care and are never tested for salmonella.

The people who've become sick from this outbreak range in age from 1 to 91 years old, with a median age of 29. Fifty-five percent have been identified as female, with 45% of those who've fallen ill being male.

The CDC also includes a racial breakdown for those who've become sick, with 62% white, 37% Asian, and 1% Black. Twenty-four percent are identified as Hispanic, while 76% are non-Hispanic, according to the ethnic data published by the CDC.

Public health investigators are using a system called Pulsenet to identify illnesses that might be part of this outbreak. The CDC's Pulsenet includes a national database of “DNA fingerprints of bacteria” that allows investigators to track bacteria using whole genome sequencing (WGS). 

From the CDC's website:

WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are closely related genetically. This suggests that people in this outbreak got sick from the same food.

Based on WGS analysis, bacteria from 94 people's samples had predicted resistance to nalidixic acid and nonsusceptibility to ciprofloxacin (NSC); this NSC strain is related to a strain of Salmonella Enteritidis isolated from chicken, eggs, and backyard poultry. Most people with Salmonella illness recover without antibiotics. However, if antibiotics are needed, some illnesses in this outbreak may not be treatable with some commonly recommended antibiotics and may require a different antibiotic choice. More information is available at the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) site.

FDA conducted traceback based on where sick people reported shopping or eating eggs and dishes containing eggs during the timeframe of interest. Country Eggs, LLC was identified as a common supplier.

Pretty neat, when you think about it. Too bad the Trump regime is doing everything it can to destroy the agency. Here's hoping the folks at the CDC can continue to do their important work now and into the future.

“Team: Grok/xAI needs to go back on the schedule ASAP per the WH,” states the email, sent by  Josh Gruenbaum, the commissioner of the Federal Acquisition Service. “Can someone get with Carahsoft on this immediately and please confirm?” Carahsoft is a major government contractor that resells technology from third-party firms.

“Should be all of their products we had previously (3 & 4),” the email continued, seemingly referring to Grok 3 and Grok 4. The subject line of the email was “xAI add Grok-4.”

Sources say Carahsoft's contract was modified to include xAI earlier this week. Grok 3 and Grok 4 both currently appear on GSA Advantage (an online marketplace for government agencies to buy products and services) as of Friday morning. Now, following some internal reviews, any government agency can roll Grok out to federal workers.

The White House and GSA did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED.

The email comes after a planned partnership with xAI fell apart earlier this summer following Grok's widespread praise for Hitler and the spouting of other antisemitic beliefs on X, WIRED previously reported.

In June, employees from xAI met with GSA leadership for a two-hour brainstorming session to discuss how xAI's Grok chatbot could be used by the government. Federal workers were surprised to see their leaders press for a contract with a company marketing an uncensored chatbot with a history of erratic behavior. In early July, Grok, which is integrated into Elon Musk's social platform X, seemingly went off the rails and started praising Hitler. GSA leadership took Grok off the Multiple Award Schedule, which is GSA's long-term government contracting platform, according to sources at the agency. When GSA announced buzzy partnerships with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google earlier this month, xAI wasn't mentioned at all.

xAI is Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup. Musk, who also helms the social network X in addition to a number of other companies, played a crucial role in President Donald Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He stepped back from his public-facing role at DOGE this spring, following a massive fight with the president. A number of his associates continue to work in government pushing DOGE's cost-cutting and AI-first agenda.

Mukesh Ambani, India's richest man and chairman of Reliance Industries, has unveiled an ambitious plan to build the country's AI backbone through a new subsidiary — starting with strategic partnerships with Google Cloud and Meta.

At the company's 48th annual general meeting on Friday, Ambani launched a new venture called Reliance Intelligence, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries. The new venture aims to create a national-scale AI infrastructure, including enterprise tools and services for a variety of sectors. The move comes as India looks to catch up in the global AI race long dominated by the U.S. and China.

“Reliance Intelligence will create a home for world-class researchers, engineers, designers, and product builders, combining the speed of research with the rigor of engineering,” Ambani said in his keynote, “so that ideas become innovations and applications, providing solutions to India and the world.”

To kick things off, Reliance has partnered with Google — one of its major tech partners — to build a dedicated AI cloud infrastructure in India. The network will start with a major data center in Jamnagar, a city in the western state of Gujarat.

The dedicated cloud region will enable Reliance to offer AI-focused services to businesses of all sizes, developers, and government bodies, utilizing Jio's network and its own energy assets to support large-scale deployments, the companies said in their joint statement.

“As Reliance's largest public cloud partner, Google Cloud is not only powering the company's mission-critical workloads, but we are also innovating with you on advanced AI initiatives,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a video message during the company's virtual AGM. “This is only the beginning.”

Google did not immediately respond to a query about the financial terms of the partnership.

Reliance has also announced a joint venture with Meta, another of its major tech investors, to build and scale enterprise AI solutions for customers in India and select international markets. Under the agreement, Reliance and Meta have committed a combined investment of ₹8.55 billion (approximately $100 million) under a 70/30 ownership split, respectively.

The partnership will offer Meta's Llama-based enterprise AI platform-as-a-service, allowing businesses to customize, deploy, and manage generative AI models for use cases across sales, marketing, IT, customer service, and finance. The joint venture will also provide a suite of pre-configured AI solutions, the companies said.

Reliance's collaboration comes just weeks after Meta restructured its AI ventures into a new Superintelligence Labs, fueled by an expensive string of top AI hires. (Meta is reportedly pausing the hiring spree after concern from shareholders.)

“Through this joint venture, we're putting Meta's Llama models into real-world use,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a prepared statement.

The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025.

Reliance is planning to expand beyond India and take its flagship subsidiary Reliance Jio Platforms to international markets, Ambani said. Ambani also revealed that Jio aims to file for an initial public offering in the first half of 2026, following much anticipation and initial delays.

Reliance is also reportedly eyeing a partnership with OpenAI, which recently introduced its sub-$5 ChatGPT subscription in India and announced its plans to set up an office in New Delhi later this year. The details of the partnership are likely to be announced during Sam Altman's upcoming visit to India next month, two people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.

Reliance and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Earlier this year, Reliance's arch-rival Bharti Airtel, the country's second-largest telco after Jio, partnered with Perplexity to offer more than 360 million Airtel subscribers access to Perplexity Pro for 12 months.

Reliance has already partnered with Microsoft to offer its Azure cloud platform to Indian enterprises. The company also offers JioAICloud, a consumer-focused service that provides 100GB of free storage. The consumer cloud service has been used by 40 million users and is updated with voice search support and an AI Create Hub to turn photos into AI-powered reels, collages, and promo videos, the company announced at its annual general meeting.

Reliance also showcased its AI-based smart glasses, JioFrames, as its answer to Snap's Spectacles and Ray-Ban Meta glasses. Similarly, the company is integrating AI into its streaming platform, JioHotstar, which has attracted over 600 million users and 300 million paying subscribers in the three months since its launch in February.

The new AI features include “Riya” voice assistant and content translation into Indian languages using AI-voice cloning and lip-syncing tech.

South Korean authorities are worried that their digital regulations might get tariff backlash from the White House.

U.S. President Donald Trump is targeting digital taxes and other barriers placed on American tech companies, threatening retaliatory tariffs and export controls on nations that refuse to cooperate. While this is largely aimed at the EU and its Digital Markets Act, South Korean authorities are concerned that the country's regulations might make it vulnerable if the White House follows through with its threats, as reported by Digitimes.

At the moment, Seoul has several laws that restrict and tax access to digital service providers. For example, it applies value-added tax on digital services, meaning foreign companies must remit taxes on digital sales they have made within the country. They also cannot export detailed mapping data, even if they're an American company, because of national security concerns.

There's also the larger issue of network fees — a bill in the South Korean legislature wants to introduce the Sending Party Pays (SPP) framework, which will require content platforms to pay South Korean internet service providers for the network traffic they consume. This will affect U.S. tech companies like Netflix and Alphabet/Google (through YouTube) the most, as they will either have to pay the imposed higher fees or host their data outside of the country, resulting in lower quality and higher latency.

All of this stemmed from Trump's post on his Truth Social platform, saying digital taxes, legislation, and regulations are discriminatory against American companies. “This must end, and end NOW! With this TRUTH, I put all Countries with Digital Taxes, Legislation, Rules, or Regulations, on notice that unless these discriminatory actions are removed, I, as President of the United States, will impose substantial additional Tariffs on that Country's Exports to the U.S.A., and institute Export restrictions on our Highly Protected Technology and Chips,” the president said.

Korea and the U.S. have recently concluded a summit, but this issue was not discussed between the two parties, said the publication. Nevertheless, industry groups and the U.S. Trade Representative want to see these rules changed. Although South Korea's laws on digital services aren't necessarily targeted against American big tech, many of the biggest and most popular of these companies are based in the U.S., so they're often the most affected ones.

It's still unclear if Trump's threats are serious or if they're just a way to make the Europeans reconsider their stance on the Digital Markets Act. But if ever the White House follows through with import taxes and export controls on account of the EU's digital barriers, then South Korea might become collateral damage to Washington's actions.

Although I'd love to see larger and faster 4TB SSDs fall further in price and be as cheap as they were a few years ago, it's still good to see the latest and greatest models start to receive price discounts. A little late to the party, the Samsung 9100 Pro showed that it has some design pedigree behind it after performing superbly during our benchmark testing.

Falling to an all-time low price at Amazon, the ultrafast PCIe Gen 5 M.2 4TB 9100 Pro SSD from Samsung is now just $372,42. Checking the price comparison tool, the Camelizer, and also PCPartpicker, we can confirm the new price from Amazon is indeed an all-time low for this model. I have, however, seen the 9100 Pro with heatsink selling at a lower price previously in a limited-time flash sale.

The latest Gen 5.0 NVMe SSDs have incredibly fast transfer speeds, making the most out of the capabilities of the available PCIe Gen 5.0 pipeline bandwidth. You can see double the speeds of the previous Gen 4.0 drives in the transfer speed ratings of these drives. In gaming, the speed increases will be hardly perceptible, but in workloads such as video editing and rendering, the extra speed will be more noticeable.

Samsung's 9100 Pro uses its own (Presto) proprietary controller and offers stiff competition against the previously dominating Phison E26 controller. The 4TB Samsung 9100 Pro uses 236-layer Samsung TLC for the flash memory, with exceptional sequential read and write speeds of 14,800 MB/s read and 13,400 MB/s write. Random read/write is 2,200K/2,600K, respectively, and endurance is listed as 2,400 TBW.

The 9100 Pro from Samsung is an ultra-fast PCIe Gen 5.0 SSD that has blisteringly fast read speeds of up to 14,800MB/s for rapid data retrieval and transfer. With ample capacity for large files, the 9100 Pro is perfect for workstations such as video editing, where scrubbing high-res media can tax the bandwidth of slower drives.  

In our benchmark testing, the 3DMark Storage Benchmark, which is a great test of SSDs intended for gaming use, measures real-world gaming performance. Each round in this benchmark stresses storage based on gaming activities, including loading games, saving progress, installing game files, and recording gameplay video streams. The results below show the Samsung 9100 Pro second in the charts, only being beaten by the same model with the included heatsink.

If you're looking for more information and benchmark testing results, check out our in-depth review of the Samsung 9100 Pro SSD. We gave the 9100 Pro 3.5 out of 5 stars, praising the power efficiency and good all-around performance of the drive. However, the 9100 Pro came across as slightly underwhelming, but only due to the fact that the drive was late to the Gen 5.0 party, and other SSDs were already available on the market with very impressive performance speeds.

Montech's HS01 Pro is a unique case from the affordable cooling mainstay, with a number of design choices that set it apart. Most cases incorporate front- or side-mounted intake fans, but Montech switched it up and placed these at the bottom for the best GPU thermals possible. Other features that make this case stand out are back-connect motherboard support, compact SFX PSU support, and dual exhaust fans.

In many ways, the HS01 Pro is very similar to the HS02 Pro. The primary difference between these two cases is the front side: While the HS02 Pro incorporates a glass front panel, the HS01 Pro instead features a front mesh panel that allows for the installation of additional intake fans.

Will Montech's HS01 Pro make our list of the best PC cases? Let's take a look at the specifications and features of the case, then we'll wrap up our testing with a preview of our updated thermal paste testing and other benchmarks.

Unlike typical cases that have front- or side-mounted intake fans in their default configurations, Montech's HS01 Pro places the intake fans on the bottom of the case. This results in excellent GPU temperatures, much cooler than competing options from other manufacturers.

 




▶️ A note about GPU installation

To secure the screws holding a PCIe device, you have to slide the screwdriver through the side of the case. When I tried using the reliable Linus Tech Tips screwdriver, it was extremely difficult to insert or remove a screw. A slim screwdriver with a longer reach will make installation much easier.

▶️ Dual exhaust fans

A downside of bottom-mounted intake fans is that airflow to the CPU cooler is reduced. This won't matter as much with liquid-cooled AIOs, but can reduce the effectiveness of air coolers. In order to rectify (or at least help) this issue, the HS01 Pro incorporates two exhaust fans – but unlike the HS02 Pro, you also have the option of installing traditional front-mounted intake fans to deliver more airflow through your CPU cooler.

 




▶️ Unique PSU placement, SFX and ATX PSU support

 




Most modern cases have the PSU located on the rear of the case, but the HS01 Pro moves the location to the front, behind the motherboard. Both ATX and SFX power supplies are supported. Considering that SFX PSUs tend to be more expensive than their larger counterparts, this isn't much of an advantage unless you happen to have an SFX PSU hanging around from a previous build that you want to use.

▶️ Build quality

The HS01 Pro seems to have good build quality, with no obvious weaknesses observed during testing.

 




▶️ Side view, back-connect support, GPU holder

In the last year or so, back-connect motherboards like MSI's Project Zero have become more popular with system builders, as they reduce visible cable clutter and make cable management easier. Montech's case is the latest of several we've seen that support the new motherboard format, with cutouts for connectors on the motherboard tray.

 




Included with the accessories, shown below, is a basic GPU holder that should come in handy for owners of larger GPUs.

 




▶️ IO panel

The IO panel is located at the front of the case, near the bottom. It features one USB-C and two USB-A ports, separate microphone and audio jacks, and power and reset buttons. Pretty standard stuff here, although moving USB-A ports to opposite ends and shaping the reset button to match the USB-C port is an interesting symmetrical design choice.

 




▶️ Dust filters, Bottom View

 




As this case's air intake is at the bottom, there's a large, magnetically attached dust filter underneath the case. The unit also features four rubber feet to facilitate ample airflow and prevent the case from sliding.

 




There's also a mesh covering for the top of the case, which is easily removed using the pull tab on the back.

 




▶️ Rear side view, storage, and cable management features

 




The back view is very clean by default, with two panels covering parts on the left and top of the case. Up to four 2.5-inch drives can be installed – two on the left panel and two directly behind the motherboard (highlighted in blue in the picture above). Behind the top cover, there's a PWM and ARGB hub to control the RGB system fans (and any others you might add) easily, and the space below the PSU (see image below) can be used to keep cables hidden if you're using a non-modular power supply.

 




▶️ Front view

 




The front of the case features the IO panel and has a mesh cover. Behind the mesh, you can install up to three fans of either 120mm or 140mm size for maximum airflow.

 




▶️ Rear view

 




There's not much to say about the rear of the case. The only stand-out feature is the dual-exhaust fans.

The measurements I've benchmarked this case against focus on the efficiency of the case's thermal transfer.

Our thermal tests are presented to give you more information about the product's performance, but aren't intended as the sole judgment of the chassis. The style, price, features, and noise levels of a case should also be considered, and we all have different preferences. What I might like in a case, you might not, and that's OK. My goal with these reviews is to give everyone, no matter their preferences, enough information to decide whether or not a product is right for them.

The $5.7 billion investment will see the US government take a 10% stake in Intel, with the Commerce Department said to be ironing out the details.

Intel's chief financial officer has confirmed the company has received $5.7 billion from the Trump administration as part of a deal that sees the US government taking a 10% stake in the company, as per CNBC. Although this move is highly unprecedented, with some Republican lawmakers likening it to socialism, or communism, Intel claims it was part of a move to prevent it from selling its chip fabrication business.

Intel has fallen on tough times in recent years. It's lost many of its top performance positions to AMD, and its fabrication business has suffered under increasing competition from TSMC and Samsung. Although it still has exciting new chips in the works, and received a major investment from the last-government's CHIPS act, it was still considering selling the entire chip manufacturing arm of its business. That is, until the U.S. government stepped in.

Under the move, $8.9 billion of federal grants that Intel received as part of the CHIPS act was converted into equity in the business. The agreement also stated that if Intel ever sells more than 49% of its foundry business, that the government could purchase an additional 5% shares at $20 each, thereby discouraging Intel from doing so.

“I don't think there's a high likelihood that we would take our stake below the 50 percent, so ultimately I would expect [the warrant] to expire,” CFO David Zinsner told a Deutsche Bank conference on Thursday, via FT.

“I think from the government's perspective, they were aligned with that: they didn't want to see us take the business and spin it off or sell it to somebody.”

Intel has faced pressure to sell its chip manufacturing business as it has remained a loss leader for the company for several years. In 2024 alone, it lost $13 billion amidst increasing competition from TSMC and a lack of interest in Intel's cutting edge silicon. Although it can produce process nodes that are competitive with TSMC and Samsung, we learned in July that it was considering cancelling its 14A process designs if it couldn't secure a customer for them. Outright selling the fab business may also have been on the table.

Whatever the reverse of blood in the water is, other companies have clearly smelled it. Japanese investment company, Softbank, is investing $2 billion in Intel (after sniffing around to buy the foundry arm of its business), seemingly understanding that Intel won't be allowed to fail with such deep interest from the US government. This comes at a time of increasing nationalization around chip design and access to cutting-edge silicon for AI development and military use.

In other fundraising initiatives, Intel has seen heavy downsizing and restructuring under new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, and is reportedly selling off $1 billion of stock in its autonomous driving company, MobileEye, as well as selling a controlling stake in specialist chip design firm, Altera.

When you've worked in the sleep industry long enough, you're going to hear one question resurface time and time again: “How much melatonin should I take?” The answer will vary from person to person, and the best person to deliver it is your doctor.

To be clear, I'm not a doctor (although my family really wishes I were), but I am a certified sleep science coach and professional mattress tester of five years and some change. Over the years, I've conversed with and attended lectures by many medical professionals on sleep aids and supplements. I also asked David Kuhlmann of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine to give insight into best practices when it comes to melatonin (and sleep supplements, for that matter).

First of all, let's back up. What is melatonin? It's the hormone your brain produces naturally as part of its circadian rhythm, or the internal clock your body has to keep you on a natural, daily sleep schedule. Your pineal gland is in charge of making it, and sunlight signals it to slow down production so you can wake up and go about your day. Though your brain is already producing melatonin, the idea of taking a supplement is that it jump-starts your sleep cycle.

If you've taken melatonin before and felt it didn't work for you, or are considering starting it, this is where you should consult your doctor. And do it before starting any supplement, melatonin included. You may be on medications that won't make it work as well, giving you the impression that you need more. Or, you could experience the side effects of mixing melatonin and medications. Let's avoid the late-night WebMD doomscrolls and check off that box first.

Another reason to talk to a licensed health care provider ahead of jumping on the melatonin train is that they can give you a tailored recommendation on how to go about getting melatonin, either in supplement or even nutritional form. Or, as Kuhlmann recommends to me, bypassing it altogether, for many reasons—one of which is possible unforeseen side effects, like GI upset. More on that in a minute.

The reality is, supplements are not regulated by the FDA. The University of Pennsylvania's Regulatory Review has reported that the FDA evaluates supplements on a dietary basis, pretty much like what is done for food or medication. According to Pieter Cohen in an interview for the American Medical Association, the FDA actually evaluates supplements as a “subcategory of food” and not medication. Kuhlmann corroborated this for me, emphasizing that “increased access” and the fact that brands are not as “tightly regulated” in the market have led to dangerous outcomes. He described the uptick in melatonin poisoning cases that medical professionals have seen over the past decade, primarily in kids under the age of 5.

There's a whole lot of gray area for what's OK and what's not before a product hits the market, and even after it's sold to customers. So if an extra (and questionable) ingredient weasels its way into the formula, and the supplement hits the market, there's not much the FDA can do besides send companies a warning letter to recall the supplement. It's the equivalent of shrugging, saying “Whoopsie, your fault,” and putting responsibility on a brand to make it right—which, as The Regulatory Review also points out, they don't always do.

“There's this misperception that because we can buy it over the counter, it means it's safe,” says Kuhlmann. He describes it as a toss-up on how much melatonin you are actually ingesting versus what the product is actually advertising, not to mention any other additives being used and how that will react with your body chemistry. And the crowd is now … worried.

Kuhlmann also expressed to me that he personally “wishes that melatonin would be available as a prescription, not to limit access, but it could help with the quality of melatonin people are able to get.” This is yet another reason why it's much better to get a doctor involved than to throw caution to the wind and get a product that might not be effective or could even be counterfeit. Brands may try to sell you their “secret sauce” with all sorts of claims, and that's not just for melatonin, but for all supplements. Be oh so careful about this.

Two things I always watch for with supplements, even with guidance from my doctor: Does it have a CGMP certification, and is there any data to back up the marketing claims? CGMP stands for “Current Good Manufacturing Process,” which are FDA guidelines put in place for a product's safety. This includes where and how it was made, as well as what it was made of. But even with this kind of baseline, it's hard to tell what additives are used in a supplement, and how that can counteract its effects or react with your body chemistry.

I tell you these things out of an abundance of caution. If your doctor gives you the go-ahead to use melatonin, follow their advice. Kuhlmann says he advises his patients to start at 3 milligrams, but to never take more than 10 milligrams. For kids, he also urges speaking to a pediatrician and/or a sleep medical professional.

Melatonin also can't do all the heavy lifting, and timing is crucial. As part of maintaining good bedtime habits, he also emphasizes the importance of taking it on time, at the same time, nightly. This will help establish the wind-down routine your brain follows via its circadian rhythm; as we established earlier, melatonin is supposed to lead this process.

For those of you who are just researching options, consider these alternatives. Diet and exercise, as tired as you may be of hearing that, really are essential to getting good, quality sleep. Case in point: You took a CrossFit class for the first time and are ready to conk out right after you manage to get dinner and a shower. Something else to consider: Perhaps relying on melatonin or a sleep supplement is treating a symptom you're dealing with, as opposed to the actual issue impacting your sleep.

It's hard to overstate the importance of sleep hygiene and bedtime routine habits—a sleep supplement won't be the end-all and be-all. Also, no caffeine after a certain time of day—you know your body best, but I'd say early afternoon at the very latest. Also, I'm sorry to my fellow readers and late-night scrollers, but devices need to be put away an hour or more before bedtime, too. Blue light that radiates from devices' screens mimics that of sunlight, and your brain can't discern the difference. All it knows is there's still “daylight” that you need to be awake for, and that prolongs the falling-asleep process.

Other alternatives to supplements in the pursuit of better sleep can include sound machines (my favorite is above), where various frequencies of noise lull you to sleep. We've also tested sleep gadgets pretty extensively to not only get us to sleep, but also maintain deep sleep.

And maybe melatonin is a different sort of band-aid over the reality of your sleep situation, meaning that your mattress may need to be replaced. We have plenty of beds we've tested for every kind of sleeper, along with the best sheets and pillows too. Supplements may not be the answer after all, but more of a sleep space upgrade—all things to consider!

Some operatives from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are joining Airbnb cofounder and DOGE member Joe Gebbia's new National Design Studio, sources tell WIRED.

Gebbia's NDS is a federal project tasked with redesigning government web pages and digital services. Like DOGE and the US DOGE Service (formerly US Digital Service), it's also an office located within the executive office of the president. “My directive is to update today's government services to be as satisfying to use as the Apple Store: beautifully designed, great user experience, run on modern software,” Gebbia, who was named chief design officer of NDS, said in a statement to X on Saturday. “I will do my best to make the U.S. the most beautiful, and usable, country in the digital world.”

Originally, Gebbia was going to join the USDS, three sources familiar with the situation tell WIRED, but he opted to start his own office focused on design. NDS will be, at least in part, populated by DOGE operatives affiliated with the General Services Administration, the sources said.

It's unclear exactly who from DOGE will be joining the studio's staff, but the NDS X account follows Edward “Big Balls” Coristine, the 19-year-old early DOGE technologist who has been integral to DOGE's efforts to dismantle large parts of the government, and Zachary Terrell, who slashed grants from the National Science Foundation earlier this year.

Kaitlyn Koller, a former Senate Foreign Relations committee aide, is joining Gebbia at the NDS, according to one source with knowledge. Until recently, Koller worked alongside USDS leadership. Acting USDS administrator Amy Gleason told staff on Tuesday that any future communication with Koller should be reported to her directly, says the source.

The NDS will act as a sister organization to the USDS—the two offices may end up collaborating on certain projects, but they'll operate as entirely separate entities, according to the three sources familiar. The organization will also work with private designers and studios, and could venture into designing physical spaces and buildings as well.

Last Thursday, President Donald Trump signed the executive order establishing the NDS and a new administration position called the “chief design officer.” The order also outlined a new “America by Design” national initiative that would improve the usability and aesthetics of online government services. The NDS, housed within the executive office of the president, is tasked with executing it.

“The Chief Design Officer will help recruit top creative talent, coordinate with executive departments and agencies (agencies), and devise innovative solutions,” the order reads.

Gebbia, the chief design officer, will report to White House chief of staff Susie Wiles. Gebbia did not respond to a request for comment about NDS and its staff.

“The National Design Studio is embarking on an historic mission to redesign government websites. American citizens deserve the best possible experience when interfacing with their government,” White House spokesperson Liz Huston, tells WIRED. “NDS is actively recruiting talented software engineers and designers from inside and outside the government.”

Gebbia joined DOGE in February, taking the lead on a DOGE effort at the Office of Personnel Management to revamp the federal retirement system. After Musk left the government in May, Gebbia's name circulated as a possible replacement to lead DOGE, but he was not interested in taking on the role, The New York Times reported in June.

On its new website, NDS suggests it will update the ways Americans interact with government systems, as with passport renewals, tax filing, and green card applications. According to Reuters, the Internal Revenue Service will be one of the studio's focuses.

Work on many of these projects was already underway at the USDS and GSA's 18F—the government's original digital consulting group—prior to the founding of DOGE. Numerous staffers focused on these projects were either fired or resigned in the first few weeks of the Trump administration, and 18F was shuttered in March.

The announcement of NDS has irked some engineers and former designers at the USDS and 18F. “[There is] a lot of frustration here that DOGE spent the last six months firing all of our designers or encouraging them to leave, with the few remaining ones being scattered across the org with an expectation they will be RIF'd,” or let go, before starting a new program with a similar mission, one GSA source tells WIRED.

In at least one instance, the White House actually ended projects undertaken by this group that had made things easier for American taxpayers. The Trump administration killed Direct File, an IRS system that let people file their taxes for free. WIRED previously reported that DOGE member Sam Corcos moved to kill Direct File after one meeting with tax software lobbyists this spring.

The NDS and Gebbia haven't announced the initiative's priorities, but in a March interview with Fox News, Gebbia addressed a then recent executive order signed by Trump aimed at enabling “intra- and inter-agency” data sharing and consolidation. Gebbia backed the initiative, invoking the same “Apple-like store experience” he used when announcing his role as US CDO.

“I don't feel like National Design Studio's ambition is to replicate the role of other organizations. Which isn't a criticism of those organizations. This is a needed new component to that ecosystem to effectuate the scale that we're talking about,” says Matt Lira, who served as special assistant to the president for innovation policy and initiatives during Trump's first term, in response to frustrations from current federal workers over the launch of NDS. “Bringing in fresh perspective is inherently good.”

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major health issue worldwide. Many patients end up requiring regular dialysis to avoid kidney failure and stay alive. Despite the severity of the condition, there are currently no drugs available that improve kidney function. A research group led by Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine's Professor Takaaki Abe has found a remarkable solution to treat patients with CKD by co-opting a drug typically used for constipation. This is the first time that this drug (lubiprostone) was shown to prevent the decline of renal function in patients with CKD.

We noticed that constipation is a symptom that often accompanies CKD, and decided to investigate this link further. Essentially, constipation disrupts the intestinal microbiota, which worsens kidney function. Working backwards, we hypothesized that we could improve kidney function by treating constipation."

Professor Takaaki Abe, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine

To address this issue, the group conducted a multicenter Phase II clinical trial (LUBI-CKD TRIAL) at nine Japanese medical institutions, enrolling 150 patients with moderate CKD. This study evaluated the effects of lubiprostone on kidney function. The results showed that, compared to the placebo group, the decline in kidney function (defined as the estimated glomerular filtration rate: eGFR) was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner in patients treated with 8 µg or 16 µg of lubiprostone.

The researchers also investigated the mechanism underlying how this effect occurred. They found that lubiprostone increases spermidine production, which improves mitochondrial function by promoting bacterial growth in the gut. The improved mitochondrial function was seen to exert a renoprotective effect – suppressing further kidney damage.

Going forward, the research team has plans to validate the trial results in a larger population (Phase 3 clinical trial) and advance the exploration of biomarkers that predict treatment efficacy. Their goal is to provide each patient with CKD the optimal treatment plan tailored to their needs. This discovery has the potential to significantly transform the conventional approach to CKD treatment, which primarily focuses on reducing uremic toxins.

These findings suggest a new therapeutic strategy in which laxatives suppress renal function decline. This strategy is expected to contribute to the development of treatments for not only CKD, but also mitochondrial dysfunction disorders. The results of this study were published in the scientific journal Science Advances on August 30, 2025.

An international team led by researchers at Lund University in Sweden has identified the molecular tools needed to reprogram ordinary cells into specialized immune cells. The discovery, published in Immunity, could pave the way for more precise and personalized cancer immunotherapies.

The team has taken an important step toward harnessing the immune system to fight cancer. Their work describes how they identified a genetic toolkit that programs two powerful subtypes of dendritic cells – key sentinels of the immune system. Dendritic cells are a diverse group of immune cells that act as the body's "teachers", guiding the immune system to recognise and attack threats such as viruses, bacteria or tumours. Each subtype triggers different immune responses, adapting to the nature of the threat. Supplying patients with dendritic cells designed to target their cancer could make treatments more precise and powerful.

Understanding how this cellular diversity is generated during the process of development has long been a mystery. Scientists have known some of the so-called transcription factors – proteins that switch genes on and off – that control these cells' development, but how these factors work together to create different dendritic cell types has been unclear.

Now, the team of researchers behind this publication has carried out a systematic mapping of the routes to dendritic cell identity. By testing 70 different transcription factors and seeing how they could reprogram ordinary cells into dendritic cells, they identified two distinct toolkits that reprogrammed skin or cancer cells into powerful dendritic cell subtypes. Advanced gene analysis revealed that these factors, early in the process, open different parts of the genome and thereby determine the different cells' fate.

"Through cellular reprogramming, one cell type can be converted into another. We identified two specific combinations of three factors that act as tools to build two dendritic cell types: conventional type 2 dendritic cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells," says Filipe Pereira, professor of molecular medicine at Lund University, who has led the research.

When tested in mouse cancer models, one engineered dendritic cell subtype triggered strong immune responses against melanoma, while others acted against breast cancer, in ways similar to their natural counterparts. While still in the early stages, the findings suggest that supplying patients with dendritic cells tailored to their cancer could, in the future, make immunotherapy more powerful and more personal.

Immunotherapy is one of the most promising areas in medicine, but many patients still do not respond. Our work shows that by generating specific dendritic cell types, we can better match the immune response to a specific cancer. This is an early step, but it points to the potential for truly personalised immunotherapy."

Filipe Pereira, professor of molecular medicine at Lund University

Beyond cancer, the discovery that dendritic cell diversity can be programmed may have applications in autoimmune diseases. Some dendritic cells naturally "calm" the immune system, and reprogramming toward these anti-inflammatory subtypes could one day help treat conditions where the immune system attacks the body.

The study provides the first systematic blueprint of the immune system's toolkit for dendritic cell reprogramming, a resource that may help researchers design better treatments for cancer and immune disorders.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hi. I'm Dr Priya Jaisinghani, an endocrinologist and obesity medicine specialist. 

There's a growing but often overlooked epidemic among people living with type 2 diabetes: MASLD, or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, formerly known as NAFLD. 

While we routinely monitor for retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy in individuals living with diabetes, liver health has been left behind, but the data are striking. Over 70% of individuals with type 2 diabetes have MASLD. About half of them already have the more aggressive form, MASH, and 1 in 5 have advanced fibrosis. 

Still, awareness among patients and clinicians remains alarmingly low, and liver disease continues to be undertreated and underdiagnosed in this population.

It's time to integrate liver health into our standard diabetes care. The liver matters. Don't let it be an afterthought. Screen, stratify, and act early. 

Stay informed and stay inspired with me, Dr J.

Anorexia is a serious mental health disorder that typically begins during adolescence. A study, conducted by the Research Unit of Population Health and Oulu Business School at the University of Oulu, examined how anorexia in adolescence affects labor market position in adulthood compared with peers.

Many mental health disorders have previously been linked to a weaker position in the labor market, but research evidence relating to anorexia has been very limited and, in many respects, inadequate. The most recent studies on the subject date back decades, were based solely on survey data and focused only on women. Generalizing these findings to the present day is difficult, as in recent decades there have been major changes in working life, the availability of psychiatric services, and the recognition of young people with anorexia within the service system.The results of the newly published study showed that both men and women with anorexia had lower income levels and more days of unemployment in adulthood compared with their peers. The effects on labor market position were particularly pronounced in men.

Although anorexia often has a favorable long-term prognosis in terms of general health, its impact on working life can be significant."

Tuomas Majuri, lead author of the research article, Postdoctoral Researcher

The study utilized data from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 and national registry data on income, unemployment days and sickness absence days at ages 25-33. Labor market position was examined using these registry data, and analyses were conducted separately for men and women."Men who suffered from anorexia in adolescence are particularly poorly recognised in our current service system, which weakens their labor market position later in life. The Wellbeing Services County of North Ostrobothnia has recently invested in the treatment of eating disorder patients, for example by opening a new eating disorder unit. More initiatives of this kind, along with closer cooperation between healthcare, employment services and employers, are needed to improve the labor market position of young people affected by anorexia," Majuri explains.The study was funded by the Yrjö Jahnsson Foundation, the Wage Earners' Foundation, the OP Research Foundation, the Tauno Tönning Foundation and the North Ostrobothnia Regional Fund of the Finnish Cultural Foundation.

Using total-body PET imaging to get a better understanding of long COVID disease is the goal of a new project at the University of California, Davis, in collaboration with UC San Francisco. The project is funded by a grant of $3.2 million over four years from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health. 

About 1 in 10 COVID-19 survivors develop a range of long COVID symptoms that can last from months to years. How and why these symptoms develop isn't completely known, but they have been linked to activated immune T cells getting into organs and tissues. Researchers also have linked long COVID to damage to the inner lining of blood vessels. These events can be related, because blood vessels become leaky when T cells are activated nearby, but may also be coincidental because leaky blood vessels allow more immune cells to leave the blood and enter tissues. 

Negar Omidvari, assistant project scientist at the UC Davis Department of Biomedical Engineering and principal investigator on the grant, will use total-body positron emission tomography (PET) technology, originally developed by Professors Simon Cherry and Ramsey Badawi at UC Davis, and kinetic modeling to look at both processes simultaneously in patients with long COVID. 

PET imaging usually uses short-lived radioactive tracers to measure metabolic activity inside the body. Conventional PET can only look at a single organ or a section of the body at a time. The uEXPLORER PET scanner developed at UC Davis can image the entire body at the same time, giving a much more detailed picture of what is going on in the body. 

Omidvari will collaborate with CellSight Technologies Inc. of San Francisco to use a tracer called 18F-AraG, which specifically tags activated T cells. Using dynamic total-body PET imaging and sophisticated modeling, she aims to see how activated T cells collect in different organs at different times, where blood vessel damage is occurring, and whether these processes are related to each other. 

If we can separate the vascular damage from the presence of activated T cells in tissue, we should be able to get a much better picture of what's going on."

Negar Omidvari, assistant project scientist, UC Davis Department of Biomedical Engineering

The team will also check blood samples for markers for inflammation and immune activation that correlate with PET imaging data.

The study will work with patients from UCSF's long COVID program (LIINC - Long-term Impact of Infection with Novel Coronavirus) who will be scanned at baseline, four and eight months. People who have fully recovered from COVID-19 and have no remaining symptoms will be scanned as controls.

UNSW research has shed light on how cells in the body manage and store fat, potentially offering new insights into health. 

In the study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers identify a crucial protein, named CHP1, that acts as a central director in this process. 

Fat, or lipids, are stored inside cells in small compartments called lipid droplets. These droplets are essential for energy storage and other cellular functions. 

The researchers found that removing CHP1 leads to a significant reduction in the size of the lipid droplets, suggesting that CHP1 is a master regulator of fat metabolism within the cell. 

Our findings provide a clearer picture of the intricate machinery that controls how cells store fat. 

Understanding this process is a critical step towards developing new strategies to address a range of metabolic disorders like obesity and diabetes." 

Guang Yang, lead author of the study from the UNSW School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Science

The study reveals that CHP1 directly influences key enzymes, called microsomal GPATs, responsible for creating fat molecules. 

Not only does CHP1 help stabilize and activate these enzymes, but it also directs them to the right location-the surface of the lipid droplets-where they are needed most. 

This discovery advances our basic knowledge of how cells regulate fat metabolism and opens new avenues for future research into conditions related to abnormal fat storage.

A new approach to an established reaction boosts the ability to synthesize vinylic ethers - key building blocks for many molecules important to human health. The American Chemical Society's Organic Letters published the breakthrough, made by chemists at Emory University.

Our method is easy to reproduce and is based on widely available and inexpensive compounds. We can apply this method to make multiple natural products, including novel vinylic ethers." 

San Pham, an Emory PhD candidate and first author of the paper

Her research improves the reliability, yield and generality of what is known as the Chan-Evans-Lam reaction. These enhancements greatly expand the reaction's potential for the synthesis of complex, biologically active compounds for drug research.

"San Pham demonstrated that our new method works for several combinations of reactants, producing at least 15 new compounds that were previously unknown and would likely have been quite difficult to prepare using other known synthetic strategies," says Frank McDonald, senior author of the paper and Emory professor of chemistry.

McDonald is also a member of the Discovery and Developmental Therapeutics Research Program at Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University.

The McDonald lab explores new and improved methods for preparing organic compounds - particularly bioactive compounds that may become new pharmaceutical agents.

One area of interest is the synthesis of plasmalogens, a type of fat molecule, found mainly in cell membranes. Preliminary studies suggest plasmalogens are involved in a range of beneficial biological activities, including anti-oxidation and anti-inflammation.

Vinylic ethers - which consist of an oxygen atom directly attached to a carbon atom that's bonded to another carbon atom - are important synthetic intermediates for the synthesis of many bioactive compounds. A specific vinylic ether, with an alkene attached, is an intermediate for plasmalogen.

The few known methods for synthesizing vinylic ethers with an attached alkene, however, have limited their applications.

For nearly six years, the McDonald lab worked on developing a good way of making these key building blocks. One strategy was to try to leverage the Chan-Evans-Lam reaction. Developed 25 years ago, Chan-Evans-Lam is a cross-coupling reaction which forms a carbon-carbon bond with the aid of a copper catalyst.

While the reaction works well with simple reactants, the McDonald lab found it produced only low yields when linking two structurally complex reactants. That made the method impractical for the molecular synthesis needed to produce vinylic ethers.

"This reaction is also a little bit capricious," McDonald says. "It's not so easily reproducible and it didn't seem to be fine tunable for our needs."

Around two years ago, the lab nearly gave up on its quest to boost the potential of the Chan-Evans-Lam reaction. Then San Pham agreed to take on the project.

"I love solving problems, the more challenging, the better," Pham says.

One problem the lab encountered with the Chan-Evans-Lam reaction is that the copper acetate catalyst is what is known as a dimer complex - two molecules bonded together. To catalyze the type of chain reactions the lab sought, the paired copper molecules needed to be broken into monomers, or single molecules.

"I started reading organic chemistry papers about breaking up this dimer, papers that weren't even related to this reaction," Pham says.

She spent months doing this research, scouring countless papers.

"Running random experiments is a waste of time and resources, so I'm strategic about my reaction design," Pham explains. "Reading is how I develop strategic hypotheses for every reaction that I test."

She found a paper reporting the use of a particular ligand - a catalyst activator that binds to a metal - to split the dimer into monomers.

She ran experiments using this new catalyst activator to synthesize the test compound.

The result yielded only 20 percent of the target compound, too low a percentage to make the method practical. Pham screened several more catalyst activators with similar chemical properties.

"No matter what I tried I couldn't improve the yield beyond 50 percent, which is still not good enough," she says. "I had hit a wall."

Pham ran painstaking experiments to track and analyze every step in the process of the reaction to further understand its weaknesses. She pinpointed the step where the reaction produced an unwanted byproduct. That led to the insight that the catalyst needed to regenerate faster to favor the pathway to the target compound.

"At that point I was trying out oxygen gas as the reagent to regenerate the catalyst," Pham says. "I was using a balloon to pump in the oxygen. It was challenging to ensure it was receiving enough."

Pham dove back into the scientific literature, spending months reading through mechanistic papers about catalytic turnover and regeneration. She finally found a clue she needed: a paper citing the use of organic peroxide as a catalytic regenerator, rather than oxygen gas, to overcome a similar situation.

"I hit the jackpot, basically," Pham says.

She ran more experiments with this final piece of the puzzle in place.

Pham's enhancements speeded up the reaction, reducing unwanted byproducts, and boosting the yield to 80 percent for the target compound.

She also achieved good yields for at least 15 different compounds new to the literature - demonstrating that her method applies to a wide range of complex structures important to drug discovery.

The McDonald lab is now set to build on Pham's work to pursue its plasmalogen research.

"San's improvements make this reaction a much more reliable and useful method," McDonald says. "The new catalyst and reaction components are all relatively inexpensive and safe to use, and we hope other researchers will also explore its potential for synthetic applications."

The paper describing the methods to achieve the breakthrough serves a broader purpose.

"I hope that when other people run into a problem working with similar substrates and are close to giving up," Pham says, "they will read our paper and hit on a clue that helps them keep going."

Inspired by an urgent need to improve timely defibrillation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) in dense urban settings, a team of investigators developed a simulation that explored the potential of leveraging an existing food delivery network in Taipei City, Taiwan, to help address this challenge. Their findings in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology, published by Elsevier, suggest that deploying food delivery riders to deliver defibrillation may reduce automated external defibrillator (AED) response times by approximately three minutes-about 50% faster than a traditional emergency medical system (EMS)-and might be particularly beneficial during peak hours.

Lead investigator Kuan-Chen Chin, MPH, Department of Emergency Medicine, Taipei Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, New Taipei City, and Department of Emergency Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei City, Taiwan, explains, "Each minute of delay in defibrillation reduces the survival rate by 7–10%. Our approach leverages an existing, widespread urban workforce to address a well-known weak link in the chain of survival. We found that it offers a cost-effective and scalable strategy for improving OHCA outcomes in high-density cities, where EMS cannot always provide immediate defibrillation."

Densely populated Taipei has a high concentration of food delivery (FD) scooter riders. To examine the feasibility of utilizing these FD riders as first responders for AED delivery in OHCA incidents investigators conducted a city-scale simulation using real-world OHCA data from the Registry of the Taipei City Fire Department between 2017 and 2019, public defibrillator locations, and food delivery patterns and hotspots using the Uber Eats platform.

The simulation assumed that every open restaurant in a hotspot had one FD rider waiting and ready to respond to OHCAs within a two-kilometer radius. FD riders' response rates were varied, and simulated defibrillator arrival times were compared to documented fire department delivery times of six to seven minutes. Differences in defibrillator arrival times during peak and off-peak hours were also assessed.

With a 10% FD rider response rate, the defibrillator arrival time decreased by 2.99 minutes, representing approximately 44% of the original EMS response time. In the simulation, over 60% of OHCAs were successfully attended. Achieving 80% coverage during peak hours required 13.4% of FD riders to respond.According to co-corresponding investigator Albert Y. Chen, PhD, Department of Civil Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei City, Taiwan, "Integrating FD riders into the EMS system could reduce defibrillator arrival times, decreasing patient waiting time for defibrillation. This approach is particularly effective during peak hours, when a higher proportion of OHCAs can be addressed."

We were encouraged to see that even low response rates might yield meaningful time savings, and that the model appeared effective during off-peak hours despite reduced availability."

Can tomorrow's doctors learn with AI without losing their critical thinking? A NEJM review offers DEFT-AI and new collaboration models to help educators harness AI while protecting clinical skills.



Review: Educational Strategies for Clinical Supervision of Artificial Intelligence Use. Image Credit: Antonio Marca / Shutterstock

In a recent review published in The New England Journal of Medicine, researchers elucidate the challenges of supervising early-career medical learners who use powerful large language models (LLMs) as education aids. Review findings highlight the dangers of "deskilling," where overreliance on AI erodes fundamental clinical reasoning skills, and "mis-skilling," where trainees adopt AI-generated errors, alongside "never-skilling" – the failure to develop essential competencies in the first place.

The review proposes a structured educational framework called "diagnosis, evidence, feedback, teaching, and recommendation for AI engagement (DEFT-AI)" to counter these potential AI demerits by scaffolding critical thinking. The review also introduces the "cyborg" and "centaur" models of human-AI collaboration, urging clinicians to adopt an adaptive practice where they learn to engage critically with AI-generated outputs rather than unquestioningly trusting them.

Recognize the "leap of faith": The paper defines AI interactions as moments where clinicians receive outputs they cannot fully retrace, prompting a critical pause to assess trustworthiness before acting.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in computation and large language models (LLMs), are progressing at an astonishing rate. Large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini are increasingly being used in medical learning, raising both opportunities and risks for clinical reasoning. A growing body of literature suggests that AI tools are fundamentally reshaping medical learning and practice.

However, integrating AI into clinical practice presents unprecedented opportunities and significant risks for medical education. While rapid access to information and the ability to consolidate vast swaths of data into easily accessible summaries may become integral in future medical education and practice, LLMs are known to simulate human-like reasoning to create an "appearance of agency" – an effect where systems simulate reasoning and outputs appear to show agency when none actually exists. This can be extremely dangerous for inexperienced medical trainees.

Medical educators thus face a novel and urgent challenge – guiding and supervising trainees who might be more proficient at leveraging AI than the educators themselves, creating an 'inversion of expertise' where teachers become learners too. The present review highlights three specific hurdles ("deskilling," "never-skilling," and "mis-skilling") that must be overcome before AI can cement its role in ensuring a safer and healthier future.

Model co-management of uncertainty: Educators should openly acknowledge their own AI learning curve alongside trainees, turning discomfort into shared inquiry and explicit teaching moments.

This review aims to address the urgent and critical need by conducting a comprehensive examination of the scientific literature that explores the challenges and opportunities presented by AI in medical education. It collates and synthesizes the outcomes of more than 70 prior publications across existing educational theory, cognitive science, and emerging research on human-AI interaction and uses these insights to develop novel conceptual frameworks for the clinical supervision of AI:

Diagnosis, evidence, feedback, teaching (DEFT), and recommendation for AI engagement (DEFT-AI) – An adapted framework for promoting critical thinking during educational conversations around AI use.

Cyborg vs. Centaur Models: A new typology to describe two distinct modalities of human-AI collaboration. These models are designed to help educators and learners adapt their use of AI to the specific clinical task and associated risk.

Ask "How do you think the AI got there?": DEFT-AI conversations should probe the learner's understanding of the AI tool's limitations and potential biases, not just its output.

The review identifies and addresses several cognitive traps imposed on medical education by today's AI age. "Cognitive offloading", the process of over-relying on AI for complex tasks like clinical reasoning, is highlighted for its link to "automation bias", subsequent over-reliance on the AI's output, and a failure to catch its mistakes.

Alarmingly, cognitive offloading and automation bias are not just theoretical concerns. A study found that more than a third of advanced medical students failed to identify erroneous LLM answers to clinical scenarios. Another study reported a significant negative correlation between the frequent use of AI tools and critical thinking abilities, mediated by increased offloading, and this effect was especially pronounced among younger participants.

The review recommends addressing these concerns by developing and adopting the DEFT-AI framework, a structured approach for educators as a response to a trainee's dependence on AI. It proposes leveraging a critical conversation that moves beyond the AI's answer to probe the learner's reasoning. Key questions include: "What prompts did you use?", "How did you verify the AI-generated output?", and "How did the AI's suggestion influence or change your diagnostic approach?" Educators are also encouraged to teach evidence-based appraisal of AI outputs using Sackett's framework (ask, acquire, appraise, apply, assess) and effective prompt engineering techniques, such as chain-of-thought reasoning.

The review further stresses that supervision must distinguish between evaluating the AI tool itself and evaluating its specific output. For example, institutional scorecards or model leaderboards may be used to judge tools, while evidence-based medicine appraisal steps should be applied to each individual output.

Use chain-of-thought prompting: Asking the AI to explain its reasoning step-by-step ("think out loud") improves its accuracy and allows clinicians to better evaluate its logic.

Finally, the review presents the "cyborg" and "centaur" modes of clinician-AI interaction. In centaur mode, tasks are strategically divided so that the clinician delegates low-risk, well-defined tasks (such as summarizing data or drafting communications) to the AI, while retaining complete control over high-stakes clinical judgment and decision-making. This mode is recommended when addressing complex or uncertain cases.

In contrast, the cyborg mode assumes that the clinician and AI co-construct a solution to the task at hand. This mode is efficient for low-risk, routine tasks but carries a higher risk of automation bias if not used with ongoing reflective oversight and justification.

The review also warns that performance heterogeneity and bias in LLMs can exacerbate health inequities. AI systems may underperform for certain populations, and uncritical adoption could widen disparities rather than close them.

The present review concludes that while the integration of AI into medicine and medical education is inevitable (and largely beneficial), its successful and safe adoption is not. It highlights that medical education must proactively address the risks of deskilling, never-skilling, and mis-skilling by fundamentally changing how clinical reasoning is taught, particularly against the backdrop of AI. Critical thinking remains foundational for "adaptive practice" – the ability to shift between efficient routines and innovative problem-solving when faced with the unpredictability of AI.

In summary, this review demonstrates that the ultimate goal is not to create doctors who are dependent on AI, but to cultivate clinicians who can skilfully and safely leverage it as a powerful tool to augment, but not replace, their own expertise through a "verify and trust" paradigm.

Researchers have reported results from the first-ever clinical trial of a new class of targeted therapy in pet cats with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)-a cancer which is notoriously deadly and difficult to treat. Publishing in the Cell Press journal Cancer Cell on August 28, the study found that 35% of the cats who received treatment had their disease controlled with minimal side effects-and the drug will likely be effective for humans with HNSCC as well. 

There are two major findings from this study. It showed us that it's possible to target a transcription factor that drives oncogenesis, which is something that has been notoriously difficult in the past. Also, it demonstrated that pets with cancer can be a good representation of human disease and that clinical trials in pets may yield more reliable results than tests in mouse models." 

Daniel Johnson, senior author of the University of California, San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center

This drug, which was initially conceptualized to treat human head and neck cancers, is the first to target the transcription factor STAT3. STAT3 is present in a range of both solid and liquid tumors, including a majority of HNSCC cases. 

The idea to test the HNSCC drug on pet cats came from a discussion first author Jennifer Grandis had with her sister, a veterinarian. Grandis learned that oral cancers like HNSCC in pet cats are extremely difficult to treat and that most animals die within 2 to 3 months of diagnosis. 

"There is remarkable clinical, histopathologic, and immunologic similarity between feline and human HNSCC," the authors write. 

One cat who benefited from the trial was a 9-year-old black domestic shorthair named Jak. When he was diagnosed with HNSCC, the veterinarian gave him only 6 to 8 weeks to live. 

"It was just a gut punch," says his owner, Tina Thomas. "We wanted more time with him. When I found out about this clinical trial, I knew I wanted him to be a part of it." 

Jak went for weekly treatments for one month. During that time his symptoms-mainly, a watery eye-greatly improved. He ultimately lived more than 8 months after his diagnosis. 

"It was meaningful to us because he was here in our lives," says Thomas. "During that time, my son finished college and my daughter finished her master's program. Jak got to spend one more Christmas with us, and he loved our Christmas tree. He was worth every bit of the effort." 

Other than mild anemia, none of the cats in the trial developed side effects that were attributable to the treatment. Of the 20 cats that were enrolled, 7 of them exhibited either a partial response or stable disease during the study period. Among the 7 that responded, the average survival post-treatment was 161 days. 

When the investigators looked at tumors and blood samples from the cats who underwent treatment, they saw that the compound was working in two ways: It not only blocked the activity of STAT3 but it also raised levels of PD-1, a protein associated with an immune response to cancer. 

"This study is a great example of how we can think more carefully about spending our very limited resources on studies in lab mice that are not even the best models of human cancers," Grandis says. "By partnering with veterinary oncologists and doing clinical trials in companion animals, we can learn an enormous amount about how these drugs work while also helping people's pets. None of the cats in these trials were harmed, and many of them benefited." 

The researchers say that conducting clinical trials in pets can be a much better model of how drugs will work in humans compared with lab mice. They are currently working with a small biotech company to advance the new compound in clinical trials for both pets and humans. 

"These animals breathe the same air that we breathe and are exposed to all the things we're exposed to," says Johnson. "Their tumors are much more heterogeneous, which makes them a better mimic of human disease."

ALICANTE, Spain – The U.S. U-17 Women's National Team defeated Spain, 2-0. It was the first of two matches for the teams, which are both preparing for the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup.

The teams will meet again on Aug. 31 at Stadi Olímpic Camilo Cano in Alicante.

The U.S. lost to Spain, 3-1, in the opening game of the 2024 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, albeit with different squads of players.

This is the final training camp and final matches before U.S. head coach Katie Schoepfer chooses the 21-player roster that will represent the USA at the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, taking place in Morocco from Oct. 17-Nov. 8.

With the match scoreless at half, midfielder Jaiden Rodriguez — who is a freshman at USC — put the USA up 1-0 with a goal in the 69th minute after coming on just four minutes earlier. Forward Lauren Malsom, who is a freshman at UNC, sealed the deal 11 minutes later with a goal in the 80th minute off an assist from Rodriguez. For Rodriguez, it was her third career goal at the U-17 level in her 14th cap, while Malsom opened her U-17 international camp with her first career goal which came in her fourth cap at this level.

Rodriguez didn't enter the game until the 65th minute before tallying her goal and the assist.

The age cutoff to play in the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup is players born on or after Jan. 1, 2008. This roster features 18 players born in 2008, two in 2009 – forward Maddie DiMaria and defender Meila Brewer — one in 2010 in goalkeeper Carmen O'Dea, and midfielder Loradana Paletta was born in 2011.

The U.S. U-17 WNT has several professional players from the NWSL in the pool, but none of them were available for selection for this roster.

At the 2025 FIFA U-17 WWC, the USA will play in Group C and will face Ecuador (9 a.m. ET / 2 p.m. local time) in its first match on Saturday, Oct. 18. The USA will then face China PR on Tuesday, October 21 (12 p.m. ET / 5 p.m. local) and finish group play against Norway on Friday, October 24 (9 a.m. ET / 2 p.m. local). All three of the USA's Group C games will be played at the Football Academy Mohammed VI (Pitch 3) in Sale, which is just outside of the capital of Rabat.

These matches in Spain are the ninth and tenth international matches this year for the U.S. U-17 WNT ahead of the World Cup, continuing the focus on the U.S. Way, which emphasizes increased programming for Youth National Teams to create more opportunities for young players to advance through the pathway to the senior National Team with the goal of representing their country at a world championship.

Barcelona star Robert Lewandowski has been recalled to the Poland squad for September's 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.

The decision comes following a dramatic saga over his status as Poland captain after opting against linking up with Michal Probierz's panel for June's international camp on the back of a demanding club season.

Lewandowski made the call after speaking with Probierz but the 37-year-old faced some negativity over the decision which ignited a row with Probierz.

The June games were overshadowed by the issue as Lewandowski stated would not consider playing for Poland again until there was a change of manager.

Lewandowski was ultimately the winner in the stand off, as Probierz was sacked over the summer, and promptly replaced by Jan Urban.

The new boss quickly stated bringing Lewandowski back in as captain was a crucial priority and Barcelona's No.9 accepted the olive branch.

Lewandowski has 85 goals in 158 international appearances as the leader in both lists for Poland and they will need him at full power next month despite an injury impacted start to the 2025/26 in Catalonia.

The forward missed the opening win over Mallorca, and came off the bench in the win at Levante, with a full return expected against Rayo Vallecano this weekend.

Poland won their first two qualifiers back in March, via home wins over Lithuania and Malta in Group G, and Lewandowski scored the clincher in the first game.

However, in Lewandowski's absence, they lost 2-1 in Finland in June, and they currently sit third in the group after three games played so far in qualification.

September will be crucial, with qualification squeezed into three windows in 2025, followed by playoffs in March 2026.

On the horizon is a crunch trip to the Netherlands on September 4 followed by a home tie with Finland three days later.

LONDON (AP) — Trent Alexander-Arnold was left out by England for its upcoming World Cup qualifiers in the national team's first squad announcement since the right back left Liverpool to join Real Madrid.

Reece James, Tino Livramento and Djed Spence have been preferred as right-back options in coach Thomas Tuchel's 24-man group for matches against Andorra and Serbia that was announed on Friday.

Alexander-Arnold played for Madrid at the Club World Cup in the United States over the summer. For the team's opening two games in the Spanish league, he started the first and was benched for the second to accommodate fit-again Dani Carvajal.

“After a change of club, I think he's got to have a bit of time to settle,” Tuchel said at a news conference.

Tuchel has handed a first senior call-up to Spence, a versatile Tottenham fullback, and Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson, who impressed playing for the England Under-21s in that age group's European Championship this summer.

There was also a recall for Marcus Rashford, who has joined Barcelona on loan from Manchester United, and Manchester City defender John Stones after his return to full fitness.

There was no room for winger Jack Grealish, who is trying to ignite his career at Everton, and playmaker Cole Palmer, who is currently out injured at Chelsea.

Welcome to ESPN India Edition

Giovanni Reyna and Joe Scally react to missing out on Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT squad. (1:35)

The last 12 months before a World Cup are an exercise in balancing risk and reward for professional soccer players. Do you play it safe and stick with your current club even if it might result in some stagnation? Or do you take the ultimate risk and move to your dream destination, regardless of the World Cup consequences? Then, there's the third scenario: knowing a switch needs to be made, but being careful about where you land.

It's a dilemma that past and present United States men's national team players have faced. In the last window, Gio Reyna moved to Borussia Monchengladbach; Matt Turner secured a loan to the New England Revolution, his former club; and Paxten Aaronson turned some heads by leaving Eintracht Frankfurt and landing back in MLS with the Colorado Rapids. Others, such as AC Milan's Yunus Musah, might make a move. They are by no means the first. Oguchi Onyewu made the leap to AC Milan in 2009, while Stuart Holden left the Houston Dynamo to join Bolton Wanderers just six months before the 2010 World Cup.

But no matter the circumstances, the goal is always the same: get in a good playing situation and hit something approaching top form so that the manager has no choice but to take you to the World Cup. Navigating that goal has different challenges for every player, as these examples illustrate.

Fifteen years ago, Holden went all in, placing a massive bet on himself. He had let his contract with Houston expire, allowing him to become a free agent and chase his ultimate dream of playing in the English Premier League.

After a friendly against Denmark in November 2009, Holden sat down with then-manager Bob Bradley to talk about his chances of making the 2010 World Cup squad. Holden recalls that he was told his odds were at about 60%. Two months later, he officially signed with Bolton Wanderers, which, at the time, was in the Premier League.

- USMNT countdown to the World Cup: Will Reyna's fresh start save 2026 hopes?
- New USMNT roster a head-scratcher: Is Pochettino wasting a chance for World Cup prep?
- After skipping Gold Cup, Musah has big plans for USMNT in a World Cup year

Holden remembers being aware of the World Cup stakes, and the possible consequences of his move.

"I was never guaranteed anything by Bob," Holden told ESPN. "I knew that if I went to Bolton and didn't play, it would've put me in a really tough position to try to be in a place to make that roster."

Holden also had immense confidence in his game. He didn't dwell on the negatives, instead focusing on the task of becoming a regular with Bolton. Holden knew if he accomplished that goal, the World Cup would take care of itself. But he knew it wouldn't come easy.

"It's not like I was signed for a transfer fee and there was pressure for me to be played by the coach. I had to really kind of earn that opportunity," Holden said. "Maybe there would've been a chance I missed out on the World Cup, but to me, there had been a lifelong goal of mine to play in the Premier League, and I had that opportunity and so I went for it, and just kind of bet on myself. I had found previously in my career if I bet on myself, more often than not, things had gone my way."

Yunus Musah explains what Mauricio Pochettino has brought to the USMNT since taking the head coach job.

For Holden, the months before the World Cup had more obstacles than an episode of "American Ninja Warrior." Holden didn't make the gameday roster for Bolton until late February. Soon after, a tackle from Nigel de Jong in a U.S. friendly against the Netherlands resulted in a broken fibula that required surgery. Holden recovered in time to play in Bolton's last game of the season. Bradley knew he wasn't completely fit but still put him on the U.S. roster.

Though Holden's subsequent years in Europe were plagued by injury, he still feels he made the right choice. He could easily have re-signed with MLS and "parked it in Houston for another couple of years" through the World Cup and beyond. But he felt he would have been settling.

"It ended up being the best decision I made in my life, and I got to go and play in the Premier League," he said. "But I guess as I sit here and reflect, it could have gone completely the other way for me."

Paxten Aaronson appeared to have everything in Europe. He was on the books of Eintracht Frankfurt, third-place finishers in the Bundesliga last season. He had two productive loan spells in the Netherlands, first with Vitesse and later with FC Utrecht, where he was nominated for the Johan Cruyff Young Talent of the Year award at the end of last season.

There was some shock, then, when it emerged that Aaronson secured a transfer to the Colorado Rapids earlier in August. Why leave Europe just when things were taking off, at age 22, no less?

As it turned out, there were a few things that Frankfurt couldn't give Aaronson. One was steady minutes on the field.

"[Frankfurt] kind of told me that I probably wouldn't get the playing time there that I would need at this stage in my career, and especially since the season I had last year," he said. "And then I kind of knew it was time to probably find another team and they did as well."

A second issue was stability -- or in Aaronson's case, the lack of it. Another year on loan wasn't appealing, and Aaronson said he wanted to lay down some roots. He also spoke of "little things" that added up during his time in Europe, though he also mentioned one big thing. Early on during his time in Frankfurt, and while he was away at a national team camp, his apartment caught fire and he lost his possessions.

"It's just like these little things, [they] all kind of accumulate to not being able to really settle in or find a home, and that was one big reason for me to come back and be close to family, and all these little things that maybe the media doesn't know," he said. "But it's hard to go over to Europe with nobody and then have these little things happen and be able to stay focused on the field."

There is a stigma attached to American players who go to Europe and then come back to MLS, especially if they're as young as Aaronson. It looks like a retreat or failure, as if the player couldn't handle the rigorous nature of European soccer. Aaronson's situation was more nuanced.

There's also the fact that such a decision doesn't weigh as heavy on a player's reputation as it used to. Part of that is down to U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino's attitude toward MLS. He said Tuesday that he thought MLS was better than some European leagues, though he didn't identify which ones.

Alejandro Moreno assesses Giovanni Reyna's move to Borussia Mönchengladbach.

Certainly, Aaronson's World Cup prospects impacted his decision.

"You don't want to go somewhere where you're going to be on the bench because you know then you probably don't have the best chances of making the team," Aaronson said. But this was also a career move, not just a World Cup one. Aaronson added that he didn't discuss his decision with Pochettino, but in some respects, he didn't need to. Pochettino had shown in previous camps that he wasn't averse to bringing in domestic players.

"I do think [Pochettino and his staff's] view on MLS is high," Aaronson said. "I think they do rate the league. You can see from the amount of players that they bring in, and also the way they speak about it. So, it's definitely something that I knew if I came back to MLS, it's not like an automatic big 'X' on my name. So, those kinds of things definitely help."

Aaronson recalled that the final decision was difficult. There was European interest. There were "four days of a lot of thinking." He didn't sleep. But ultimately, he decided to go to Colorado, with manager Chris Armas' sales pitch of making Aaronson a key cog proving vital. To hear Aaronson explain it, he's making a bet on himself much like Holden did 15 years ago.

"I know if I'm playing every game, and giving it my all, then yeah, why wouldn't I make the team?" he said. "I believe in my quality and believe in my abilities. And I've shown it before. So, once I do commit to things, yeah, I just go full gas and never look back, which I think is an important mindset."

Matt Turner has experienced some precipitous ups and downs over the past several months, even as there was total clarity as to what he needed to do. After a season in which he made just four appearances -- none in league play -- while on loan at Crystal Palace, he knew he had to leave Nottingham Forest and find a place where he would get consistent playing time. His starting spot with the USMNT was already under threat, with New York City FC's Matt Freese playing every minute at the Gold Cup while Turner watched from the bench.

"I think it's in the back of every American player's mind right now, especially guys that want to be part of the team," Turner said about the World Cup. "So for me, I want to not just be part of the team; I want to be the guy that's being relied upon that has that responsibility. And for me, I need to play and I need to recoup that feeling of playing and being relied upon consistently week in, week out, so that way I can go back into the national team and use the experiences of having been relied upon consistently."

The U.S. keeper thought he had found the right club when he transferred to Ligue 1 side Lyon for $9 million. But a tumultuous ownership and financial situation, which nearly resulted in Lyon's relegation to Ligue 2, meant budgets were cut, and Turner was a casualty.

That meant moving back to square one. Teams in the English Championship were interested, but Turner felt he was "stagnant" in England, and at Palace, he lost a bit of his edge, knowing that he would be backing up starter Dean Henderson every week. At Premier League level, he was viewed as a backup. Turner still has hopes of returning to Europe, but knows he needs to rebuild his game a bit.

Turner recalled that New England was "ready to move the fastest," and he ultimately secured a one-year loan to the club where he began his professional career.

"I've been a tradable asset at the end of transfer windows in England a few times, and it can get pretty stressful," he said. "And I think after feeling like I had done my work early and I was ready for that stability that I was going to be provided with in Lyon, I think that's sort of what I was craving. I know that I could get that [in New England] and now I can lay the foundation of my confidence in playing every week."

But plenty of soccer aspects lined up. Turner knows the club, and there are familiar teammates like defender Andrew Farrell with whom to reconnect. Turner will also have the opportunity to work with goalkeeper coach Kevin Hitchcock once again.

"[Hitchcock] knows how to get the best out of me," Turner said. "He knows what makes me tick, and he could really push me to get to the level that we both know that I can play at consistently."

Turner's motivation wasn't solely about his World Cup prospects, or a desire to head back to his old club. Turner's son was born with a heart defect, which required his wife, Ashley, to make periodic trips to the U.S. for treatment in Boston. That commute will be much shorter now. Proximity to family was another plus.

Turner said that Pochettino was "looped in" on everything that was going on, and though he relied on the U.S. manager's advice, he ultimately would do what was best for him and his family.

The move is having the desired effect on his club form. In three matches, two of which the Revs have won, he has already prevented 1.62 expected goals. Not that Turner is taking anything for granted. It wasn't enough to get called back into the USMNT for the September window.

"Goalkeeping is crazy," he said. "Every play has the potential to derail you, so you've just got to keep the focus."

Paris Saint-Germain faced a crushing defeat against Chelsea in the final of the Club World Cup on July 13 at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

Prior to the final, PSG lost only one out of six matches in the competition, and claiming the Club World Cup title could have been the French side's fifth trophy of the 2024/25 season.

With the blow of the final whistle, the Ligue 1 giants were left disappointed. However, a worse situation unfolded in the aftermath of the game involving PSG head coach Luis Enrique and Chelsea's Joao Pedro.

PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma appeared to be involved in an argument with Pedro, during which Enrique interfered to support his player. The situation worsened after the Spanish manager was seen pushing the Brazilian forward and raising his arm towards the 23-year-old's face.

More people, including players and staff from both clubs, got involved to prevent the situation from aggravating further.

Even though the FIFA Disciplinary Committee were initially looking into the chaotic incident, they are no longer referring the case, allowing Enrique to walk free without any ban or penalty, according to AS.

FIFA reportedly did not notify Enrique of any proceedings, dismissing the case without a formal response from PSG or Enrique, who has previously expressed regret about his outburst. While a potential two-game suspension for ‘unsportsmanlike conduct' and financial penalty was expected, the governing body are no longer pursuing the case amid other priorities.

FIFA's decision has raised eyebrows due to their conflicting ruling in another similar incident, where PSG's Joao Neves was handed a two-match ban for pulling Marc Cucurella's hair in the same final.

With no reported punishment, PSG and Enrique would both be relieved, as they would not have to worry about their manager's presence on the touchline, along with having no concerns about a disciplinary battle.

After achieving great success in the previous season, PSG have started off the 2025/26 campaign with consecutive wins in their first two Ligue 1 games after lifting the UEFA Super Cup by defeating Tottenham in the final.

The Parisians are set to face Toulouse in their next match in the top flight at Stadium de Toulouse on August 30.

MADRID (AP) — Ballon d'Or holder Rodri and Real Madrid veteran Dani Carvajal have been recalled by Spain for upcoming World Cup qualifiers after long absences because of knee injuries.

Spain coach Luis de la Fuente included the stalwarts in his squad on Friday for games in Bulgaria and Turkey on Sept. 4 and 7, as the European champion seeks a spot in the 2026 World Cup.

Rodri sat out nearly all of last season after tearing the ACL in his right knee a year ago. He then picked up an injury, reportedly to his groin, at the Club World Cup in the summer.



Manchester City coach Pep Guaridola is now gingerly working him back into his lineup. Rodri missed City's Premier League opener, a 4-0 win over Wolves, and came on as a substitute in a 2-0 loss to Tottenham last weekend.

Carvajal tore the ACL in his right knee in October last year. He came back for Madrid in July and made his first start since his return last weekend in a 3-0 win at Real Oviedo in the Spanish league.

De la Fuente also gave a first call-up to Jesús Rodríguez, who plays for Italian side Como. The 19-year-old winger joined Cesc Fabregas' team this summer from Real Betis.

Spain:

Goalkeepers: David Raya (Arsenal), Unai Simón (Athletic Bilbao), Álex Remiro (Real Sociedad).

Defenders: Dani Carvajal (Real Madrid), Marc Cucurella (Chelsea), Pedro Porro (Tottenham), Alejandro Grimaldo (Bayer Leverkusen), Robin Le Normand (Atletico Madrid), Pau Cubarsí (Barcelona), Dani Vivian (Athletic Bilbao), Dean Huijsen (Real Madrid).

Midfielders: Pedri González (Barcelona), Martín Zubimendi (Arsenal), Mikel Merino (Arsenal), Fabián Ruiz (Paris Saint-Germain), Rodri Hernández (Manchester City), Gavi Páez (Barcelona), Fermín López (Barcelona).

Forwards: Álvaro Morata (Como), Lamine Yamal (Barcelona), Jesús Rodríguez (Como), Dani Olmo (Barcelona), Ferran Torres (Barcelona), Nico Williams (Athletic Bilbao), Yéremy Pino (Villarreal), Mikel Oyarzabal (Real Sociedad).

Kansas is gearing up for the upcoming World Cup, hosted across 16 North American cities, including its smallest host city, Kansas City.

At a Legislative Budget Committee meeting on Aug. 26, Kansas lawmakers received an update from Kansas City 2026, the nonprofit overseeing the strategy of hosting the World Cup. Some key details are still hazy, with fewer than 300 days to go before the start of the event.

Kansas doesn't know which teams will be playing in the seven matches scheduled for the region, but will be announced on Dec. 5. There will be four group stage matches, one in the first bracket of the tournament when 32 teams remain and one quarter-final match, all played at Arrowhead Stadium.

There may also be teams that stay at a local facility for training and lodging. Possible base camps include the Sporting Kansas City training facility in Kansas City, Kansas, the KC Current training facility in Riverside, Missouri, and the Rock Chalk Park in Lawrence.

"The team base camps are really the team's home away from home, those are the locations where teams will come and train to prep for the tournament," said Lindsey Douglas, chief operating officer for Kansas City 2026. "These teams are going to bring their entire support staff, sometimes their families, so the influx of folks that come with a team are pretty substantial."

In the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," the large tax and spending bill championed by President Donald Trump, allocated $625 million for a security at the 11 host cities. It's unclear how much will specifically go to the Kansas City region, but Douglas estimated that it will be around $50 million.

About 650,000 visitors are expected to the Kansas City area through the duration of the World Cup. The profile of the visitors estimates about 54% will be visiting from another country, and will stay an average of 10 days.

The event will double the number of teams playing from prior World Cups to 48. It's estimated that half the world's population will tune in for at least one game.

"The World Cup is the largest sporting event in the world, this will be the largest version of that sporting event in 2026. Even though soccer is one of many sports we follow here in the United States, by far at the world stage, it is the largest," Douglas said.

That many people coming to the region is anticipated to generate $653 million in direct economic impact. Kansas City 2026 said it's attempting to leverage the visitors and the economic impact for longer-term partnerships.

"We really want to maximize that for the tournament and make sure we're getting the biggest bang for our buck out of business attraction and really telling our story through this," Douglas said.

There are also local business that can take advantage of the event, and so far, 2,000 vendors have signed up with KC 2026 as potential partners.

The Fan Fest at the World War I museum in Kansas City is going to have a capacity of 25,000.

Kansas Rep. Troy Waymaster, R-Bunker Hill, the chair of the Legislative Budget Committee, raised concerns about the number of hotel rooms available for the influx of guests. He worried that hotel rooms could see a massive surge in pricing during the World Cup.

"We know that people are going to travel two to four hours if they can't find accomodation within the metropolitan area," Douglas said. "We also know that VRBOs, AirBnBs are going to be in demand. Also campgrounds are really looking at this as an opportunity as well. And so I would imagine that every type of accommodation will be maximized to host the number of visitors we'll have."

Transportation was also brought up, specifically whether Kansas City 2026 will utilize school bus fleets to shuttle fans to World Cup events. The existing public transit networks aren't substantial enough to accommodate the number of visitors coming in.

School buses may be one way to increase capacity by shuttling people from the Kansas City International Airport to downtown Kansas City, Arrowhead or the FIFA Fan Fest.

Currency exchange was also brought up, with Kansas City having few options to trade other currencies for U.S. dollars. An estimated 68% of tourists will have a credit or debit card that works in the United States, but the other 32% may have to rely on currency exchange at the airport.

FIFA 2026 said they're discussing options with Visa, which is a commercial sponsor of the World Cup, to get more options for currency exchange.

The region's first-ever professional league is scheduled to kick off on January 10 and will serve as a qualifier for the FIFA Club World Cup in 2029.

Seven nations will be represented with Bula Boys FC (Fiji), Hekari United FC (Papua New Guinea), Solomon Kings FC (Solomon Islands), Tahiti United FC (Tahiti) and Vanuatu FC (Vanuatu) all confirmed as preferred candidates.

They will be joined by Auckland FC and Christchurch United from New Zealand, with South Melbourne representing Australia as the sole team from outside the OFC region.

The clubs are still subject to the final stages of the licensing and compliance process before full confirmation.

"This is a historic moment for Oceania football," OFC General Secretary Franck Castillo said in a statement.

"For the first time our region will have a professional league that provides a pathway for players, coaches and clubs to compete at the highest level within the Pacific."

The opening season will run until May with each club playing a minimum of 17 matches, before being split into two groups comprising the top four and bottom four.

The top teams will battle for three of the four semi-final spots, with the leading side from the bottom tier also earning a playoff match.

As per the latest information from AS, Real Madrid's breakout talent Gonzalo Garcia could soon find himself on the path to representing Spain at the FIFA World Cup next year. 

It is to be noted that Spanish national team coach Luis de la Fuente is set to announce his squad for the upcoming qualifiers against Bulgaria and Turkey today, with Georgia also part of the group. 

As such, Spain will largely stick with the squad that reached the Nations League final, which already guarantees them a playoff spot in case things go wrong during qualification. 

Interestingly, De la Fuente is expected to use this campaign to introduce fresh names into the mix, especially in attack. That's where Gonzalo Garcia's opportunity lies.

Meanwhile, the young forward will first appear for Spain's U-21 side, but the door to the senior squad is wide open. 

De la Fuente admires his qualities as a natural goalscorer and is keen to monitor his growth under Xabi Alonso at Real Madrid. 

“It has to be an incentive for him to know that he is on our radar,” said the Spanish coach about Gonzalo in a recent interview.

If he gets minutes in the coming weeks and performs well with the U-21s, he could be fast-tracked into the senior team, and this would put him in contention for a place at the World Cup.

Meanwhile, the outlet also mentions that alongside Gonzalo, another Real Madrid youngster making waves is defender Dean Huijsen. 

His rise with the national team has been described as a success, with De la Fuente impressed by his maturity and consistency. 

The coach believes Huijsen can develop even further and sees him as a player capable of becoming a key figure for Spain over the next decade.

With the final few days of the summer window upon us, no major activity is expected at Real Madrid, with transfer business considered to be closed by the club.

However, that does not rule out the possibility of one or two late departures, particularly from the youth and reserve ranks, with a number of top-flight teams eyeing players from Castilla.

In such one case, AS reports that newly-promoted La Liga club Levante have turned their attention to Manuel Angel, a 21-year-old midfielder from Real Madrid Castilla.

The Valencian side recently received interest from Benfica for Carlos Alvarez, and while that negotiation continues to progress, the sporting department is studying the next steps in order to redirect their investment. As such, Manuel Angel has emerged as a target.

The 21-year-old Spaniard is considered one of the great prospects of La Fabrica and one of the leaders of Alvaro Arbeloa's squad. A player of notable quality, he is capable of fulfilling different roles in midfield. 

A post shared by Manuel Ángel Morán (@manuelangel_8)

In fact, Manuel Angel was primed for a first-team call-up under Xabi Alonso, but an injury prevented it, leading to Thiago Pitarch getting the opportunity instead.

Levante believe his profile, young, talented, and with strong potential, fits their project, and are weighing up a late move.

Real Madrid's policy has been clear in recent years regarding players leaving their academy. The structure of any deal would have to be drawn in a way that allows them to retain some control over the player's future. 

The most common formula has been a sale of 50 per cent of the rights, while retaining a buyback clause, ensuring an option to retain influence over the player for a certain period of time. This has been the case in practically all recent academy departures.

Whether the same happens with Manuel Angel remains to be seen.

Carlos Alcaraz suffered the first mid-match wobble of his US Open campaign on Friday, but he nonetheless refound his rhythm to defeat Luciano Darderi 6-2, 6-4, 6-0 and reach the fourth round.

Leading by a set and 4-1, Alcaraz lost serve for the first time this week and was pulled into a second-set battle, during which he appeared to land awkwardly after a serve. The 22-year-old Spaniard took a medical timeout at 5-4 to receive treatment on his right knee, but reeled off the following seven games to regain control and race through a one-hour, 44-minute victory.

“I'm feeling good, it was just a precaution that I asked for the physio,” Alcaraz said when asked about the medical timeout. “When he broke my serve, in the last point I felt something in the knee, but after five or six points it was gone. I just asked the physio to take care of the knee, so I had to be feeling good. I am going to talk to my team about it, but I'm feeling good.”

Alcaraz, who won his first major title at the US Open in 2022, remains on track to meet four-time winner Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals. For now, though, Alcaraz faces a fourth-round clash with Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech, who rallied past countryman Benjamin Bonzi 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-2. Alcaraz leads Rinderknech 3-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

Despite his brief lapse in the second set, Alcaraz was ruthless in all departments, particularly the forehand-to-forehand exchanges that were prevalent throughout the clash. In the second set, however, Darderi produced some moments of magic of his own, including winning an epic all-court point that ended with a stunning drop volley that caught Alcaraz out to tee up two break points, eventually converting the second.

“I just tried to start awake, that was important,” said Alcaraz. “Starting at 11:30 a.m. is not a schedule that I'm used to playing, so my first goal is to start well, to start focused. I think I started really well, pushing him to the limit, playing long rallies, and after that kept it going.

“I'm not a [morning] person. For me, it's difficult to wake up in the mornings, so that's a good thing today that I woke up early, I did the warmup well, played good... It seems like I'm a Spanish guy!"

When Denis Shapovalov shut down his 2023 season with a troubling knee injury, he couldn't be sure he'd ever play pain-free tennis again.

However, since his return last year, the Canadian has added three ATP Tour titles to his breakthrough Stockholm crown from 2019. His resurgence has undoubtedly fueled a new level of belief, and as he enters the US Open third round for a seventh time in his career, Shapovalov will need every ounce of that confidence in a clash against defending champion and World No. 1 Jannik Sinner on Saturday.

“I would say my confidence is very high. I would say it's different than when I was young and the confidence would be high, but it would be pretty fragile,” Shapovalov said after his second-round win against Valentin Royer. “I think now — and you can see with my results — that the confidence is there. Even if I have a bad few weeks or unlucky draws or a couple of tough matches, I'm able to bring it back and play at a high level when the next week comes.

“I think that's why I have been able to win three titles in less than 12 months, and that's why I've been able to have so many great weeks recently. I definitely think that the confidence is there. I'm playing great tennis.”



Even though Shapovalov won a five-set tussle in his only previous Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Sinner at the Australian Open in 2021, the 26-year-old admits that they have both changed a lot as players since then. Shapovalov has traversed a long road back from injury, while Sinner rose to No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings in June last year and has not relinquished his position since. 

 Shapovalov acknowledges he will have to bring his A-game if he is to challenge the defending champion, who is unbeaten at the hard-court majors since 2023.

“[I'm] definitely looking forward to another matchup with him. These are the types of matches that I kind of live for,” Shapovalov said. “I enjoy playing [them], so I'm looking forward to it.

“He's got a lot of strengths, being the player that he is. He doesn't have many weaknesses, he's solid from everywhere. I'm going to have to dictate and try to play my game and go for my strokes. He's not going to give too much away for me in the match. I just have to take what I can with him, take my opportunities as well when I get them, and try to stay aggressive and not let him dictate too much.”

After his fourth-round exit at Wimbledon in 2023, Shapovalov ended his season and slipped outside the Top 100 by year's end. The former World No. 10 did not compete for six months, and during his difficult return in 2024 fell as low as World No. 140.

Still, the Canadian — with the help of his team and family — never lost sight of his ambitions or the explosive game that he used to defeat Rafael Nadal as a teenager.

“I think I'm very grateful for going through what I did with my knee. It was definitely the toughest challenge I've ever had, not knowing if I would ever be back on court pain-free,” Shapovalov recalled. “There were a lot of doubtful days and tough moments. It was a long road to get back.

“Even when I started back up, there were a lot of difficult matches, I wasn't getting the wins, and I was up in the matches or the pain would come back in the knee. So it was a really, really tough road, but I'm very grateful for my team and the close ones around me, because they kind of kept me going forward and kept reassuring me that the results and everything will come.”

And they did. In his final tournament of the 2024 season, Shapovalov lifted his second ATP Tour trophy in Belgrade, a breakthrough that seemed to spark a new chapter. This February, Shapovalov rolled past Top 10 opponents Taylor Fritz, Tommy Paul and Casper Ruud en route to the biggest title of his career at the ATP 500 in Dallas.

Shapovalov recovers from injury to win maiden ATP 500 crown: 

Then, after an underwhelming clay-court season and first-round loss at Wimbledon, Shapovalov struck again on the hard courts in Los Cabos, winning his fourth tour-level title without dropping a set.

“I had to stay very, very patient last year. I only got the result I wanted the last week of the year with winning Belgrade,” Shapovalov reflected. “It was definitely worthwhile. Honestly, that title meant 100 times more to me than the first title that I won in Stockholm. It was huge for me.

“It's been a road to get back. It's never easy to climb back in the rankings. There's a lot of new, young guys coming up. Your name is not as fearful as when you're No. 10 in the world, it has a little bit more emphasis than when you're climbing back in the rankings. I've definitely had to work to [get to] where I am. I think I'm in a great spot, winning two titles this year, playing some great tennis, into the third round here. I have a shot against a guy like Jannik. It's great for me. I look forward to it.”

NEW YORK—Win or lose, Coco Gauff is having a US Open to remember after reaching the third round amid emotional upheaval and major technical changes to her serve.The No. 3 seed, Gauff served seven double faults and was near tears in the opening set of her second-round clash with Donna Vekic, but ultimately tightened up her technique to defeat the 2024 Olympic silver medalist, 7-6 (5), 6-2. Both the result and Gauff's determination drew praise from the Tennis Channel Live at the US Open panel Friday morning.“Big picture, this is a remarkable story of resilience in an athlete,” said Jim Courier, former world No. 1. “She is so vulnerable in full view at the biggest tennis tournament in America. She's the centerpiece of this tournament.📲 🖥️ STREAM THE ENTIRE EPISODE: Click here“With what she's doing, this will happen at some point: there is going to be a movie on her life, whether it's a documentary or a feature film like King Richard. This will be a big part of that because I'm sure this is going to be a pivot point with her serve, and it's going to be something she will ultimately put behind her.

Both the result and Gauff's determination drew praise from the Tennis Channel Live at the US Open panel Friday morning.“Big picture, this is a remarkable story of resilience in an athlete,” said Jim Courier, former world No. 1. “She is so vulnerable in full view at the biggest tennis tournament in America.

Lindsay Davenport called Gauff's mid-match emotions “heartbreaking” as the reigning Roland Garros champion struggled to employ changes made by biomechanic coach Gavin MacMillan, an expert hired after Gauff's serving woes carried throughout the US Open swing.MacMillan famously reworked the serve of Aryna Sabalenka, who went on to win three Grand Slam titles and rise to her current spot as world No. 1.“In tennis, what you don't want to do is overthink,” said Davenport, a fellow former No. 1 and 1998 US Open champion. “She's now trying to learn new grips and new technique, and it's just all too much for her.

“If you're trying something new and you have no idea how it's going to turn out,” advised Navratilova of Gauff's serve, “especially when you don't have any confidence, you really need to do it in a quiet space.”

“It seems like everyone's got to take a step back and just say, ‘You know what? Just go play. Go try and figure out this last major of the year. Then we can catch our breath.'”In her visit to the TC Live desk, Martina Navratilova is also waiting for Gauff to exhale, the 18-time Grand Slam champion questioning the wisdom of attempting a technical overhaul in the midst of a major tournament.“If you're trying something new and you have no idea how it's going to turn out, especially when you don't have any confidence, you really need to do it in a quiet space,” advised Navratilova. “I don't want anybody watching me except my coach and the cameras doing the video so I can figure it out.”

Chanda Rubin was more optimistic about Gauff's chances in Flushing Meadows, noting the 2023 champion's marked improvements in the second set versus Vekic, and from a tense first-round against Ajla Tomljanovic.“Overall, this was not a bad match in terms of numbers,” said Rubin, a 1996 Australian Open semifinalist. “In terms of her serving and the double faults in the first set, it was the timing of it and it was all of the stress, all of the emotion she's been dealing with. It was about much more than just the X's and O's on the court.

“I think we saw, again, how impressive Gauff is, the fact that she was able to turn that first set around. She was able to dig in and somehow win it. At times, she was visibly shaking during the changeovers and it was just so incredible how she, once again, dug in and didn't let the moment overwhelm her completely. Getting that first set was huge and she was able to run away with the second set in the end.”Gauff will be back on court on Saturday when she takes on No. 28 seed Magdalena Freçh for the chance to reach the second week of the US Open for a fourth straight year.

As the US Open celebrates the 75th anniversary of Althea Gibson breaking tennis' colour barrier at the 1950 U.S. National Championships, Frances Tiafoe is among many Black tennis stars eager to continue her legacy.

After his second-round win on Wednesday at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, Tiafoe reflected on how Gibson paved the way for him and many of his peers.

"It's incredible. What a legend, man," he said, noting how Gibson set the stage for the likes of the Williams sisters, 2017 US Open champion Sloane Stephens and 2023 winner Coco Gauff, among others. 

"[Althea] was a true leader and an incredible person. Her and Arthur [Ashe], man," the American continued. "So I've got hella love for both, and I wish I could be saying that to them personally, but obviously the circumstances... But man, if they're over there watching us, I hope they're smiling over us, because we're doing some great stuff with that small opportunity [they gave us]."



Tiafoe also referenced Canadian teen Victoria Mboko, who won her first WTA 1000 title three weeks ago in Montreal. Answering a question about the growing African-American presence in tennis, Tiafoe explained what it means to him to be the son of Sierra Leonean immigrants.

"For me, I sit in a different spot with it. Obviously, at the end of the day, yes, I'm African-American, but I'm African, right, and African-raised," he shared. "So seeing someone like Mboko and Felix [Auger-Aliassime] and myself, Clervie [Ngounoue], that's a whole different beast. You've got parents that are coming to try to make these kids' lives, give them a chance better than they had. So I understand that, being the son of immigrants.

"Ultimately, to be able to see so many people of colour do great things in a predominantly white sport, it's tremendous. I think that brings unbelievable diversity to the game. I think that brings a totally different demographic for the game. I'm happy to be a small ounce of that, and young guys are looking up to me and wanting to be like that.

"Obviously I had a ton of great examples before me and will have a bunch of people come after me. So I'm happy to be a part of it in my prime and see it grow and can't wait to continue to see where it goes.


"African-Americans in tennis, we're at an all-time high right now. I mean, totally killing it."

Coco Gauff didn't always have her best stuff Thursday night but displayed her championship pedigree, while Amanda Anisimova defeated Maya Joint to reach the third round for the first time since 2020.

Survive and advance.

That's exactly what Coco Gauff did Thursday night, defeating Donna Vekic, 7-6 (5), 6-2 in the US Open second round at Arthur Ashe Stadium. The match lasted 1 hour and 39 minutes and ended with the American star delighting the New York crowd.

US Open: Draws | Scores | Order of Play

It came on a night when the former US Open champion had to dig deep to find her best tennis, especially during a tense opening set that left her visibly shaken.

“I was just trying to tell myself to breathe,” Gauff said after the match. “I don't remember a lot of the end of the first set, to be honest, but it's kind of amazing that I was able to get out of that one. But once I was able to reset, I went to the bathroom and splashed some water on my face. After that I felt a lot better out here.”

Despite committing seven double faults and being broken four times in the first set, Gauff broke Vekic twice while the Croatian was serving for the set, forcing a tiebreak.

After her seventh double fault -- which came on the opening point of the tiebreak -- Gauff steadied herself just enough to secure the set, moments after wiping away tears following another dropped service game.

The shift in her demeanor was evident when she returned to the court after the break. After struggling with her serve throughout the first set, she cut down on the double faults and wasn't broken once in the second.

Moments after clinching victory, Gauff shed a few more tears, thanked the crowd for its support and revealed a surprising secondary source of inspiration behind her second-set resilience: Simone Biles.

“I saw her, and honestly, I don't know if she's still up there, but she helped me pull it out,” Gauff said. “I was just thinking, if she can go on a six-inch beam and do that with all the pressures of the world, then I can hit the ball in this 75. … I don't know how big this court is. 

“But I saw her late in the second getting interviewed by ESPN, and it brought me a little bit of calm just knowing her story with all the things she went through mentally. She's an inspiration, surely, and her presence definitely did help me today.”

With the victory, Gauff earned her 73rd Grand Slam match-win. Since 2000, only Maria Sharapova (85) has recorded more women's singles Grand Slam victories before turning 22.

She'll have a chance to capture win No. 74 in the third round when she faces off against Magdalena Frech, whom she has defeated in both of their previous meetings without dropping a set.

Amanda Anisimova reached the third round of the US Open for the first time in five years Thursday night, defeating Maya Joint 7-6 (2), 6-2 in 1 hour and 16 minutes.

The crowd at Louis Armstrong Stadium witnessed a thriller of an opening set, with Joint earning an early break against the reigning Wimbledon finalist. But Anisimova broke back as Joint served for the set, then cruised through the tiebreak and dominated the second set, breaking Joint's serve twice more.

Anisimova finished with 23 winners compared to just five for Joint.

Next up for Anisimova is Romania's Jaqueline Cristian, who is making just her second career appearance in a Grand Slam third round. It will be the first meeting between the two.

“You guys bring me so much joy,” the American told the fans in Arthur Ashe Stadium after her difficult, emotional second-round win.BySteve TignorPublished Aug 29, 2025 copy_link

NEW YORK—You won't see many second-round post-match interviews as emotional as the one Coco Gauff gave after her 7-6 (5), 6-2 win over Donna Vekic at the US Open on Thursday.Gauff got tearful thanking the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd for pushing, urging, cheering her on through a match that was never easy, and looked at times to be doomed to end in disaster for her.“It's been a rough couple of weeks,” Gauff said, referring with her well-publicized struggles to fix her serve. “You guys bring me so much joy.”“I'm doing this for myself, but I'm also doing this for you.”

Gauff's gratitude was understandable. For much of the first set, she looked as if she were about to drown in front of 20,000 people.After her previous match, she had seemed cautiously optimistic about her progress on her serve. Improving it was, according to her, just a matter of reps now. But that optimism quickly looked misplaced tonight.She started double faulting right away, and was broken in the first game. Silence reigned in Ashe. A little later, after double faulting to go down 4-5, she looked up toward her team with a look of defeat. She spent the changeover with her face in her towel. Two games later, Gauff hit a second serve as hard as she could, missed it by three feet, and was broken again. This time she was shaking on the changeover. The silence was even deeper now.“It's an uncomfortable watch,” Mary Carillo said in the commentary booth.

“It's an uncomfortable watch,” Mary Carillo said in the commentary booth.

But at that moment, hope arrived. It came in the form of a physio who walked on court to help Vekic with an arm issue. Up to that point, the Croatian had hardly played much better than Gauff. And her game would only go downhill from there.In the first-set tiebreaker, Vekic made four errors, including one on set point. The crucial, match-changing moment came with Vekic serving at 4-5. She tried a drop shot, which is never a good idea against Gauff. Coco ran it down and closed the point with a forehand winner. She pumped her fist, the crowd roared back, and she seemed to loosen up and remember how good she really is at tennis.“I was just trying to tell myself to breathe,” she said. “Just trying to put another ball in the court, and just trying to remind myself of the things I do well.”“It's kind of amazing I was able to get out of that one.”

Gauff went off court after the first set, splashed some water on her face, and said she felt better when she came back out. Her serve felt better, too, as the double faults decreased. She would finish with just eight, and make 69 percent of her first serves.There was no second wind for Vekic, as the mistakes continued to flow. She finished with 12 winners and 36 errors, which was reminiscent of the 12 winners and 56 errors that Gauff's first-round opponent, Ajla Tomljanovic, made.Which brings up a point about Gauff: Even when she's not playing well, she has a knack for making her opponents play badly—just ask Aryna Sabalenka. Gauff's forehand is rightfully seen as her weaker ground stroke, but it does work well on defense. Vekic targeted that side for most of the night, but Gauff responded by rolling her forehand back crosscourt high and heavy, forcing Vekic to go for more—and ultimately miss.

When it mattered most on Thursday night, @CocoGauff drew inspiration from @Simone_Biles who was in attendance. pic.twitter.com/3BiNBfXLhu

Gauff said she was especially inspired by one fan in particular: Simone Biles. Gauff looked up and saw her being interviewed during the match.“I was just thinking, ‘If she can go on a six-inch beam, and do that with all the pressure of the world, then I can hit a ball [in this court],” Gauff said.“It brought me a little bit of calm.”For a set, Gauff looked as lonely as any tennis player can, by herself in front of a sea of people, and unable to make her game work. In this case, though, the sea of people—and one very famous person in particular—came to her rescue.

Venus Williams and Leylah Fernandez made a hell of a doubles debut on Thursday in Louis Armstrong Stadium, coming from behind in the first set to defeat Lyudmyla Kichenok and Ellen Perez, 7-6 (4), 6-3.

NEW YORK -- "Venus, she's a legend. She's an icon. Growing up, when I first started playing tennis, people asked me, 'Who did you watch when you were growing up?' I always said Justine Henin and the Williams sisters."

Leylah Fernandez said that matter of factly, on the rooftop of the player clubhouse at the Lindner Family Tennis Center in Mason, Ohio during a casual conversation in early August.

Less than a month later, in a scene she likely would not have predicted, she was sharing a court with her idol on Louis Armstrong Stadium in front of more than 14,000 rabid fans who were no doubt thrilled to have one more opportunity to see Venus play. 

And the result was a good one for the American-Canadian pairing. The duo, which accepted a wild card into the US Open doubles draw on Tuesday, upset sixth-seeded Lyudmyla Kichenok and Ellen Perez, 7-6 (4), 6-3, in their first-round matchup on an unseasonably windy day in Queens. (It was downright uncomfortable if you were dressed for summer, though the fired-up crowd hardly seemed to notice.)

Towering over her partner -- a former US Open singles finalist and doubles quarterfinalist -- and looking at times like a big sister, the 45-year-old Williams earned her first win in three New York tries after bowing out in the revamped mixed doubles tournament last week and losing to Karolina Muchova on Monday.

It looked bleak to start, with Williams and Fernandez falling behind 5-2 in the first set, but they rallied to even it at 5. And with the thunderous crowd firmly in their corner, they eked out the tiebreak to take the first set and grab firm control of the match.

"I have no idea what I was thinking during that tiebreak," Fernandez, who's into the third round in the singles draw, said with a laugh. "I think I just kind of went on instincts. Venus said it perfectly. Play it as if it was a singles match. So I just didn't want to think too much. ... No, I just wanted to go out there, play, and I had full confidence with Venus at the net and even in the baseline."

The next set was far less dramatic, as the unseeded pair jumped out to a 4-1 lead and comfortably closed it out. They seemed to gel and complement each other more effectively as the match wore on, finding a rhythm that kept their opponents off balance and defensive. 

Communication was key in establishing that cadence. 

"I'm used to being the big sister," Williams told reporters after the match, "so I'm kind of asking her what she wants. It's important for her to feel comfortable. Theoretically I have more experience, but she's been playing a lot more matches, so maybe that makes us neck and neck in terms of how we can compete.

"But I think we just had to see what happened, because you never know what's going to happen in a match and you have to adjust. Once we got down, I feel like we just put our foot on the gas."

It was a full circle moment for the 22-year-old Fernandez, who remembers practicing with Venus outside of Lexington, Kentucky back in 2020. She was new to the Hologic WTA Tour at the time and didn't know many players, and the gesture was a meaningful one.

"I thought I was going to be very intimidated, but she was super nice and welcoming," Fernandez recalled during the Cincinnati Open.

She certainly appeared nice and welcoming again on Thursday, as the two embraced after securing the win. 

This was Williams' first doubles victory in Queens in 11 years, though she's certainly no stranger to doubles success at this venue. The seven-time Grand Slam singles champion won the doubles tournament here in 1999, alongside her sister Serena, and the pair won it a second time in 2009.

Williams and Fernandez will play Eri Hozumi and Ulrikke Eikeri in the second round on Saturday.

2025 Dutch GP FP2: Every spill, spin and crash from Friday practice at Zandvoort

TECH TALK – What's new after the summer? 

It was an eventful day for Mercedes on Friday at the Dutch Grand Prix, with George Russell going fourth fastest in FP2 while Kimi Antonelli ended up in the gravel during FP1.

George Russell conceded that Mercedes were not quite as competitive as hoped for during the opening day of action at the Dutch Grand Prix, with the Briton ending FP2 in fourth while team mate Kimi Antonelli lost out on mileage in FP1 after becoming beached in the gravel.

Following a run of more challenging races during the middle of the season, things seemed to be looking more positive for the Silver Arrows last time out in Hungary after reverting to an older suspension.

As the campaign resumed again in Zandvoort post-summer break, Russell ended the day's first practice session in seventh before improving to fourth in the second hour, leading the 27-year-old to suggest that the squad had hoped for more.

“I felt good out there, to be honest,” Russell explained after jumping out of the car. “It was great to be back driving again after a couple of weeks out. Conditions for everybody were really tricky.

“It was really windy and this circuit has a lot of 180-degree corners so, when it is windy and gusty, the car is going through that whole phase of the corner, so it's more exposed than on other circuits, maybe like Silverstone, where it's a little bit in and out of the corners – I hope that makes some sort of sense!

“But, [in terms of] competitiveness, maybe not quite as close to the front as we'd like, but the race pace looks okay, sort of in the usual mix.”

Pushed on whether Aston Martin could be the team's main competition during the weekend – following an impressive performance by the squad on Friday, with Fernando Alonso ending FP2 in second place – Russell responded: “These last couple of races have been really surprising.

“Aston had a really bad run of form, and then they were really on it in Hungary and they had a great result. Here they look fast. Ferrari have seemed really off the pace today, but I'm sure that can turn very quickly as well, and same with Max [Verstappen].

“He had a tough race in Hungary, but I think that was more of an outlier. So, as it stands, it looks like a bit of a fight with the Astons, with Max and with ourselves, but I'm sure Ferrari will get in there.”

Russell also gave his take on an unusual moment with Oscar Piastri in the pit lane, during which the Mercedes driver had to brake heavily when the Australian moved back into the fast lane ahead of him after being unable to enter the McLaren pit box. The papaya outfit were later fined for the incident.

“I think he pulled in a bit too early and pulled back out,” said Russell. “A bit unfortunate but it scared me a bit! When you're on track you're ready for anything, but when you're in the pit lane going relatively very slow, you're just chilling out. I was looking at my screen and I was like, ‘Geez!' It caught me by surprise!”

On the other side of the Mercedes garage, it was a tricky day for Antonelli. The Italian ran off the track in the early stages of FP1 and became beached in the gravel at Turn 9, resulting in the red flags being thrown as his stricken car was recovered.

While this resulted in him missing the rest of the session, Antonelli returned to action in FP2 and put himself into P12 on the timesheets.

Reflecting on his day, the youngster explained: “I was pushing pretty hard early on in FP1 and then I locked up, and then I got beached and my session was over after just one lap. It was obviously not ideal because I lost some mileage and didn't do any laps basically.

“In FP2 I kind of had to build my rhythm. There's quite a bit of work to do, but we know where to improve and now looking forward to tomorrow.

“We'll see how the weather's going to be, but if it's going to be dry we'll try to improve those few things, and then I think it was a decent session. Of course there were quite a few mistakes during the lap, but we'll try to be ready for tomorrow.”

2025 Dutch GP FP2: Every spill, spin and crash from Friday practice at Zandvoort

TECH TALK – What's new after the summer? 

As Formula 1 returns with the Dutch Grand Prix, Need to Know is your all-in-one guide with statistics, driving pointers, strategy tips and more.

With its traditional summer break now drawing to a close, Formula 1 is back in action this weekend as the Dutch Grand Prix kickstarts the second half of the season.

First and second practice will take place on Friday, August 29, followed by final practice and Qualifying on Saturday, August 30 and the Grand Prix itself on Sunday, August 31.

*From the last four races in the Netherlands

Jolyon Palmer, former Renault F1 driver: I've only done this one on a bike! Zandvoort is actually a lovely circuit that has been adapted really well for modern F1. It's still difficult to overtake on, as expected with an old design of track, but the banking makes a huge difference.

You don't really appreciate the banking until you go around it at Turn 3. The theory is multiple lines, but everyone just bolts for the outside line and tries to get the exit right. And again, coming through the final corner as well, running the banking.

It is a nice, flowing track. You've got to have commitment, particularly in the middle sector, which is undulating, and you've got to just have it hooked up in the high speed sections. You don't want to be having random snaps of oversteer, because it's a punishing circuit as well...

“For the race in the Netherlands, Pirelli has gone a step softer in terms of compounds than last year,” reads Pirelli's weekend preview. “The teams will have a choice of the C2 as hard, the C3 as medium and the C4 as soft, whereas in 2024 the available compounds were C1, C2 and C3.

“The decision, taken in conjunction with the FIA and the championship promoter, has the aim of increasing the likelihood of a strategy based on two stops, rather than just the one-stop, which has been the predominant choice since this race returned to the calendar in 2022.

“A further step in this direction stems from the FIA's decision to increase the pit lane speed limit from 60 to 80 km/h, thus reducing the time taken for a pit stop.

“According to simulations provided by the teams, the one-stop is still quickest, partly because overtaking is notoriously difficult at Zandvoort, with very few straights apart from the main one, combined with the fact the whole track is quite narrow.

“[In 2024], 16 drivers lined up on the grid on the medium tyre, while three – Lewis Hamilton, Yuki Tsunoda and Valtteri Bottas – went for the soft, with Kevin Magnussen starting from the pit lane on hards. Three quarters of the field made just one stop during the race, taking on the hard as the second set, while Magnussen went with the medium.

“The Mercedes pair pitted twice – Hamilton used two sets of C3 and George Russell one – while the remaining three, Tsunoda, Bottas and Zhou Guanyu, ran all three available compounds, with Alex Albon choosing to run medium, hard, medium.

“Nico Hulkenberg drove the longest stint of all, completing 57 laps on the hard. Oscar Piastri topped the list with the medium on 33 laps, while Hamilton ran 24 on the soft.”

The season resumes with things still very much all to play for in the Drivers' Championship. Just nine points now separate leader Oscar Piastri and team mate Lando Norris at the top of the standings, with Norris seemingly holding the momentum after winning three of the last four Grands Prix before the summer break.

Piastri, however, has six Grand Prix victories to his name this season – one more than Norris – and has displayed solid consistency throughout the campaign, being the only driver to have scored points at every round so far.

It will be fascinating to see who comes out on top in Zandvoort, a venue that Norris triumphed at back in 2024. However, McLaren have also voiced their concerns about the possibility of the squad's rivals posing more of a challenge in the second half of the campaign.

Both Ferrari and Mercedes appeared to have found more pace last time out in Hungary and, as the two sides vie for second place in the Teams' Championship, each will be keen to seal some valuable points as the season gets underway again.

Red Bull, meanwhile, faced a challenging weekend at the Hungaroring, with the RB21 struggling to match the team's competitors. But one thing for certain is that Max Verstappen can never be counted out. Can he score a good result in front of his passionate home fans?

Elsewhere, the midfield battle remains as tight as ever. Williams' previously comfortable advantage in fifth place looks to be under threat, with Aston Martin and Kick Sauber not far behind in sixth and seventh respectively. Amid such fine margins, any of these teams could make gains – or indeed losses – depending on how they fare at Zandvoort.

James Hunt claimed 10 Grand Prix wins during an F1 career that spanned most of the 1970s, and the first of them was a piece of history not just for himself, but also the plucky Hesketh upstart team he represented.

In a 1975 encounter that started on a damp track but soon shifted to dry conditions, Hunt pitted after seven laps to change his wet tyres for slicks, but many others – including pole-sitting Ferrari driver Niki Lauda – initially stayed out.

Once the rest of the field had eventually pitted, Hunt found himself in the giddy heights of P1 – a position Lauda was desperate to reclaim. However, the inimitable Briton could not be stopped as he logged his maiden F1 win and the one-and-only triumph for Lord Hesketh's operation.

It was a remarkable, feel-good underdog tale, with the mighty Ferrari toppled by a fledgling force, and it remains at the head of the list when it comes to iconic moments at the Dutch Grand Prix.

Watch how it all unfolded in the video player below...

FP2 Highlights: 2025 Dutch Grand Prix

2025 Dutch GP FP2: Russell and Piastri have close call in the pit lane

F1 TV expert James Hinchcliffe is this week's guest on the Beyond The Grid podcast.

Today he's on F1 TV, giving us expert racing insight. But, 10 years ago, James Hinchcliffe suffered a near-fatal accident during practice for the 2015 Indy 500, which left many people doubting that his racing career could continue.

A year later, he scored a sensational pole position at the very same racetrack.

Speaking to Beyond The Grid host Tom Clarkson, James talks through the freak injury he suffered and how he made such a miraculous recovery.

A six-time IndyCar race winner, he also explains what it takes to be quick on high-speed ovals, whether the likes of Max Verstappen would be competitive on them and whether Indy stars like new four-time champion Alex Palou could succeed in Formula 1.

Tom asks James why, despite being such a huge fan of F1 growing up, he didn't pursue a career in the pinnacle of motorsport, and whether he thinks the United States needs an American on the grid.

Now a regular pundit and commentator on F1 TV, James also shares his thoughts on the thrilling battle between McLaren team mates Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris to become World Champion in 2025.

There are any number of movies about people who try to reinvent themselves in the face of a crisis. There are many fewer movies about people who violently refuse to even consider that idea — people who would rather kill someone else than become someone else. Park Chan-wook's bleak, brilliant, and mordantly hilarious “No Other Choice” is the exception that proves the rule. 

Plotted with ornate precision but unfolding with the panic of a desperate man, this Vantablack comedy tells the story of a mustached paper manufacturing specialist (“Squid Game” villain Lee Byung-hun as Man-su) who achieves the suburban idyll just in time to be let go from the company where he's worked for the last 25 years. Some American investors have bought a piece of the business, and with it the right to restructure things as they see fit.

The high-end eel meat that Man-su received in the mail should've been his first clue that he was on the chopping block. Instead, Man-su saw it as proof that he'd finally made it. “I've got it all,” he sighs over the grill as he barbecues for his smiling wife Miri (Son Yejin) and their two children on the lawn of the brutalist manse he bought as a monument to his success. 

 










But it's already gone. “Off with your head” is a common refrain in Korea when someone gets fired, and Man-su truly reacts to the loss of his job as if it were an execution. He struggles to find another gig in the rapidly contracting paper industry (and to wave away dark thoughts about his dutiful wife fucking her tennis instructor), but there's too much competition for the few spots that remain, and he refuses to consider another career path. 

Man-su's only hope: A position at the ascendant Moon Paper, where he'd work as a subordinate to one of his former underlings. The interview is a disaster, but just as his old company had “no other choice” but to let him go, Man-su conspires to give the Moon Paper executives “no other choice” but to bring him aboard. The paper business is a rather specialized field, and Man-su reasons that he would only have to murder a measly three people to become the only hirable candidate for the job. That doesn't seem like an unreasonable body count for someone who's about to default on his mortgage — someone who's already suffered the indignity of being forced to cancel his family's Netflix account. So Man-su publishes an ad for a fake new company as bait for his competition, and orchestrates a plan to kill his way back to the top.

 










Or to stay in the upper-middle, I should say. Among the more tragic ironies of “No Other Choice” is that Man-su goes to wild extremes just to avoid the horror of falling into a slightly lower tax bracket. To his mind, the line between heaven and hell is as thin as the glass walls of the spectacular greenhouse where Man-su tends to his bonsai trees at night. 

But Park's film — despite skewering capitalism with much of the same wit, sadness, and slapstick buffoonery that made Bong Joon Ho's “Parasite” so resonant around the world — is pointedly not about poverty. While Miri can no longer afford to put meat in the noodle soup she makes for dinner, her kids are never at risk of going hungry. This is a story about sustenance of a different sort; it's a “Looney Tunes”-like fable about how capitalism exerts itself by feeding our self-images as it fattens our wallets, and by conflating what we do with who we are to the point that one becomes dependent upon the other. 

That feeling infects society on almost every level. The movie's first life is so much funnier when it happens to other people snicker — a staple of Park's darkly humane sense of humor — comes from the sight of Man-su being stripped naked of a store uniform as he quits a retail job in order to attend his Moon Paper interview. But in focusing on an upwardly mobile striver like Man-su, “No Other Choice” eschews both need and entitlement in order to dramatize the more broadly relatable dilemma of rooting your entire identity in a system that will tear you out of the soil without a second thought. 

 










Immaculately spacious for a story this unsubtle, Park's film toys with the idea that capitalism is an engine for moral impunity — that it's a universally accepted excuse for the kind of thoughtless cruelties that would seem beyond reproach in any other context. And even though we understand the general outline of Man-su's plan from the start, it's so riveting to watch it play out (and go wrong) because “No Other Choice” sees his murder spree as a natural extension of capitalism, rather than a bizarre aberration from it. Demented, yes. Insane, not so much.

The result is the rare film that feels sympathetic toward its protagonist without ever rooting for him, and Lee's elastic performance as Man-su — clumsy, pathetic, cucked by osmosis, and still only a hair worse than we are — is key to the balancing act of Park's tragicomic tone. Easy to roll your eyes at from the opening scene and increasingly pigheaded in all of the ones that follow, Man-su starts off a long way from likable and tumbles much lower in our estimation from there. But the high-wire nature of the movie's plot requires us to appreciate the credibility of Man-su's conviction without necessarily sharing it ourselves (there's a terrific scene where an oblivious Man-su lectures one of the men he wants to kill with all of the same perspective we've been screaming at him in our heads), and no one on Earth can match Park's signature ability to make characters more endearing as they stumble toward the void.

 










In much of the filmmaker's previous work, that ability has been expressed with the sweep of a symphony and the precision of a Swiss watch, but however tempting it is to bemoan the fact that Park's work has been growing less hyper-stylized since 2016's “The Handmaiden” (the ultimate display of his Vivaldian genius), there's a unique thrill in watching one of the world's most fastidious directors adapt a story (from Donald Westlake's 1997 novel “The Ax”) about a half-witted moron whose first idea is to drop a flower pot on someone's head. Imagine Wes Anderson collaborating with Joaquin Phoenix and you'll have a vague idea of the tension inherent to Park Chan-wook building a movie around a guy like Man-su, who plots like the villain from “Oldboy” or the heroine of “Lady Vengeance” but executes with all the grace of Wile E. Coyote. A bottomless wellspring of physical comedy, Man-su is so bad at killing people that it eventually starts to seem as if he might be the only person who doesn't survive this movie.

“No Other Choice” is unmistakably still a Park Chan-wook project on its face (I lost count of all the diabolical match cuts, devious transitions, and delirious zooms that he sets to another string and harpsichord masterpiece from his long-time composer Cho Young-wuk), but it's meant to exist in a workaday register, and feels naturalistic even compared to the relatively, and I stress relatively, stripped down romanticism of “Decision to Leave.” Not only does that rawer approach offer a metatextual twist on the tension that's pulling Man-su apart at the seams (that between resistance and reinvention), it also creates a more immediate tension of its own: that between a delicately arranged movie and a main character so chaotic that you almost can't imagine him doing anything right. It allows “No Other Choice” to be both larger than life and also just a few missed paychecks away from a conceivable reality. 

 










But the Man-su we see at the end of his rope isn't the same Man-su who won his industry's most coveted and meaningless award just a few years prior. He's better in some ways and worse in several others. More importantly, he was more practical then. Having a steady job can have that effect. Now it's up to his wife Miri, another of Park's indelible female leads, to be the family's last bastion of logic. 

As Man-su's arc begins to wilt toward the end of the story, the crude violence of his plan gradually overgrown with gardening metaphors and magical thinking, Miri's presence becomes stronger to balance things out. Although “No Other Choice” lacks the emotional gutpunch of Park's best films (much as its devastatingly ironic final shot leaves a lasting bruise in its own right), Miri becomes a poignant vessel for all of the movie's conflicted feelings about self-worth and survival. It's Miri who's forced to account for what matters to their family, and for what they might be willing to live with or without. It's Miri who makes the hardest choices in a movie where everyone else refuses to accept that they have any choices to make at all. 

Miri's final decision to [redacted] is as easy to rebuke as Man-su's initial decision to become a serial killer, but — to the immense credit of a slaphappy movie with a surprisingly powerful sting — it's also just as difficult to dismiss outright. She holds onto the only choice that all of this madness has left her with, and as the world around her surrenders its last measure of agency to the demands of an apathetically efficient future (shoutout to AI!), Miri's refusal to abandon what's left of her own almost feels like its own fucked up kind of heroic act. Capitalism won't ever care about you, but people will always be full of surprises. 

 










“No Other Choice” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. NEON will release it in the United States.

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: The sequel to Richard Donner's '80s classic The Goonies is “moving in the right direction”, according to its writer Potsy Ponciroli.


	Speaking during a Deadline-moderated event at the Venice Film Festival, Ponciroli was asked about the status of the movie and said: “I have turned in a first draft, which was very well received, and I'm on a second draft and I'm about 95% done with that so we're moving in the right direction.”


	Ponciroli said he wasn't immune to inevitable online misgivings about a sequel to such an adored classic, but said there are few bigger fans of the original than himself and that he would treat it with utmost care.

	“I know there's a lot of ‘do we need a new Goonies',” he said, “but I'm the biggest fan of the original, it's my favourite movie of all time. I'd never ‘redo' The Goonies. To me it was a story that never ended so this is the movie I want to see as one of its biggest fans.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	He added he wasn't sure when the movie would be moving into production. A director has yet to be revealed.


	Ponciroli is in Venice with new Alan Ritchson action-thriller Motor City, having also been at the festival four years ago with feature debut Old Henry.


	Warner Bros, the studio behind the original Goonies, is also behind the sequel. Steven Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Holly Bario will produce for Amblin Entertainment alongside Chris Columbus, with Lauren Shuler Donner exec producing. Spielberg and Columbus penned the original.

	











	Released 40 years ago, the original introduced the world to a group of misfit kids — Mikey, Mouth, Data, Chunk, and others — who embark on a treasure hunt to save their homes from foreclosure. The journey takes them through underground tunnels, booby traps, and encounters with the villainous Fratelli crime family, all leading to the discovery of the long-lost treasure of the pirate One-Eyed Willy.


	A cornerstone of '80s pop culture, the film launched the careers of young actors such as Josh Brolin, Sean Astin, Corey Feldman, Martha Plimpton, and Quan. 


	The idea of a Goonies sequel has been floating around for decades, but despite persistent rumors and interest from fans and some of the original cast, has not yet come to fruition. Ponciroli was revealed as writer by us at the start of the year and that was last we heard. Things seem to be heating up.

This just makes me sad. It's gonna get made. It's probably not gonna be great because we'll be comparing it to our childhoods (if you're Gen X), and it'll never live up to THAT nostalgia. It'll make some money but inevitably be seen as a failure. And what will eventually happen is that it taints the original slightly just by diluting the specialness that it had. (Kinda like how Crystal Skull and Dial of Destiny sorta sullied the OG trilogy.)

Sigh. Why can't Hollywood come up with NEW ideas nowadays? Everything feels like a reboot, a remake, a retread, a requel, a reimagining, a reheat. What happened to that magic we had in the 70s and 80s where movies were NEW and FRESH and didn't just mine previous IP?

I love this original Goonies – it's probably my favorite growing up as a kid.  I'm a bit apprenhensive about a sequel though.  I'm not sure it will capture the magic of the original – we'll see.  I'm open to be surprised but…

Nobody wants this.

For the love of god – no. Quit hinging the future of Hollywood on remakes. Executives' fear drives this BS … and this is why people will gravitate to YouTube. It's so obvious but Eveyone in Hollywood lacks the backbone to voice it / do something about it. Idiots.

So long as Joe Pantoliano returns, I'm ok.

With bombs ‘Americana' and ‘Eden' coming just a week apart, the star now hopes to turn attention to festival boxing drama ‘Christy.'


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	This year's August dump of indie films that gathered dust for years hasn't been kind to Sydney Sweeney, one of Hollywood's most in-demand young actresses whose summer of discontent also includes a major backlash over an American Eagle Jeans campaign that even resulted in President Donald Trump giving her a shoutout for being a registered Republican.


	Sweeney has been riding a wave of enviable success since 2019, from her breakthrough work in HBO's Euphoria and a small part in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, to her Emmy-nominated role as the entitled daughter of a female tech mogul in the first season of Mike White's The White Lotus.

					'Americana' Director Defends Weak Debut, Says Sydney Sweeney Movie "Got Gobbled Up by the Zeitgeist"

					Sydney Sweeney Says "Mainly the Girls" Criticized Her Bathwater-Infused Soap		
			









	Then there was Anyone But You, the Glen Powell two-hander that put studio rom-coms back on the map. It opened in theaters over the Christmas holidays in 2023 on its way to grossing north of $220 million, a sum that even caught Sony executives by surprise.


	What no one realized was that Sweeney was supposed to have another film hit theaters that year — Americana, a modern-day Western in which she plays a waitress who gets caught up in a scheme to peddle stolen Native American artifacts, and whose troubled brother believes he's the incarnation of Sitting Bull.


	The obscure indie film, directed by Tony Tost, made its debut in at SXSW in spring of 2023, but couldn't find a U.S. distributor until this year, when Lionsgate Premiere picked up U.S. rights. The film opened to a mere $500,000 from roughly 1,100 theaters over the Aug. 15-17 weekend, one of the worst showings of all time for a title going out in that many cineplexes. The film's cast also includes Paul Walter Hauser and Halsey. Insiders claim that Americana did just fine for Lionsgate Premiere, which banks more on home entertainment than theatrical, but even Tost acknowledged that the opening was a disappointment, when he wrote on X Aug. 21 that the film “gobbled up by the zeitgeist.” 

	











	The heaping on didn't end there for Sweeney. A week later, Ron Howard's indie film Eden opened in theaters to a forgettable $1 million from 664 theaters nearly a year after the period survival thriller premiered at the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival to middling reviews. Like Americana, buyers passed on picking up Eden despite its veteran director and A-list ensemble cast led by Jude Law, Vanessa Kirby, Ana de Armas, Daneil Brühl and Sweeney. Eden, which has a 57 percent critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes, is based on the true story of a tiny group of European settlers who escape to the Galápagos Island following World War I.


	Those close to the actress say she is being unfairly maligned over the box office results, considering both were ensembles pics, and especially Eden. They also say Sweeney harbors no regrets for the choices she and her team have made. The Paradigm-repped actress has been laying low, however, but won't be able to for much longer.


	She's preparing to return to TIFF for the Sept. 5 world premiere of David Michod's biographical sports drama Christy. The film follows the real-life story of queer former professional boxer Christy Martin, nicknamed “The Caol Miner's Daughter.” Sources speculate that Sweeney's performance in the Black Bear Pictures film could land her a spot in the awards race. The movie is a big swing for the star, who gained some 30 pounds for the role and was coached by Martin.


	And Sweeney will be in theaters on Christmas Day with Lionsgate's high-profile The Housemaid, a psychological thriller filmmaker Paul Feig that also stars Amanda Seyfried. The year-end holidays can be one of the most lucrative corridors of the year in terms of being able to support multiple movies in the marketplace if a title clicks with its target audience. Lionsgate (and likely Sweeney) is hoping that The Housemaid will clean up at the box office based on the 2022 book's popularity and the movie's two stars. It will also give younger females a chance to see something other than Avatar: Fire and Ash, which also opens over the year-end holidays. Given that the movie solely rests on her, rather than an ensemble, it will be a key test. 

	











	One source close to Christy says Sweeney remains a big star with enormous brand recognition, and that two small indie films tanking hasn't hurt her career. “She is not damaged,” this person says. “But outside of doing press in Toronto, she probably needs to stay quiet for a bit.”

Lainey Wilson is paying it forward in country music. The chart-topping star has stepped into a mentor role for rising artist Ella Langley, offering support and wisdom at a time when the 26-year-old singer is navigating both big career moments and a brief touring pause for her health.

Country queens lift each other up. 👑 Lainey's got Ella's back! #CountryNightsLive #LaineyWilson #BevRainey #EllaLangley #WomenInCountry @Lainey Wilson @Ella Langley 

Wilson, 33, has formed a strong bond with Langley, and the “Watermelon Moonshine” singer has made it clear that she has her back.

The country superstar recently appeared on “Country Nights with Bev Rainey,” and spoke about her support for the “You Look Like You Love Me” singer. Wilson credited country music legends Miranda Lambert, Reba McEntire, and Wynonna Judd for sharing their “wisdom” with her.

In a TikTok clip, which was captioned, “Country queens lift each other up. Lainey's got Ella's back!,” Rainey said, “I was talking to Ella Langley the other day, and she was telling me that she's getting advice from you, just like you were saying about Miranda. I'm like ‘Let's go girls! We got this.'”

Wilson totally agreed, replying, “I mean, Miranda was that person for me, and I know that she is also that person for Ella, too. But I just think about the wisdom people have passed on to me, I mean folks like Miranda, and Reba, and Wynonna, and like all the ladies that — it's weird, it's like, we have all experienced some of the same things, but it's been completely different times.”

Wilson added, “And I love Ella. She is like a sister. And I just see her, and I think she is one of the most talented people in this business. And so, it's important for me to, you know, to check in on her, and just be there for her if she needs me.”

Langley may need Wilson right now, as she announced on August 11 that she would be taking a break from touring amid health struggles.

In an Instagram post, Langley wrote, “I'm so sad to be posting this. The past several weeks have been tough. I've been fighting sickness and feeling more run down than ever. I've made the hard decision to take a couple of weeks to rest and focus on my health — mind, body, and heart. I want to be fully present for all the moments ahead. And I know I can't do that without first taking care of myself.”

Langley joined Morgan Wallen and Riley Green on their 2025 tours. Because of this break from touring, Langley said she would miss shows between August 15 and August 25, and return to the stage in September.

While Langley had to take a break from touring, Wilson continues on her 2025 “Whirlwind World Tour.” She began this tour in Zurich, Switzerland, on March 4.

The country singer continued on the European leg of the tour before heading to Phoenix, Arizona, on August 14. She continues to play in numerous cities across North America. The tour comes to an end on November 8 in Orlando, Florida.

Two days after Kelley Wolf, the estranged wife of Hallmark fan favorite and “Party of Five” alum Scott Wolf, was arrested at the Utah home where she was staying, multiple outlets reported on August 28, 2025, that there's renewed hope she will receive the help she needs to thrive again. 

Fans, friends and family members had grown increasingly concerned about Kelley's well-being since the couple first announced their split on June 10, following 21 years of marriage. The former MTV reality star has since been placed under two involuntary holds but struggled to follow court orders upon release, ignoring a social media gag order and boundaries set around communication with and about Scott and their kids.

According to documents from the Summit County Sheriff's Office obtained by People on August 28, a judge set her bail at $5,000 and required her to “participate in inpatient or outpatient medical, behavior, psychological, or psychiatric treatment.” The outlet later reported that Kelley was released from custody before 4 p.m.

After Kelley posted a slew of alarming Instagram Stories and posts on August 26, Us Weekly reported, Scott called police in Summit County, where their family lives, after one of the posts included his phone number.  

According to the police report obtained by Us Weekly, Scott received over 24 calls and texts from unknown numbers within minutes of Kelley posting his contact information via an Instagram Story in which she referred to him as “dimples.”

In the post, reviewed by EntertainmentNow, Kelley wrote, “I am a great tv producer and reality star but I suck at technology…I hate people and phones. Let's let dimples field his own press? Right? This old heffer needs a hug. And some steak!! And a night out!” She then directed “all press inquiries” to his number. 

Two hours later, Kelley wrote another Instagram Story, alerting her followers that “the police are my house to arrest me,” noting that she had “no idea why.”

On August 28, People reported that Kelley had been formally charged with two class B misdemeanors for electronic disclosure of personal identifying information and electronic communications harassment.

Us Weekly reported that the responding officer requested in the police report that Kelley “be held until she can be seen by a judge as well as a mental health professional,” adding that the family was “extremely concerned about her mental health.”

The officer also wrote, per Us Weekly, “It is believed by family and law enforcement that her illegal and harassing behavior will continue if she is released.” 

According to People, the judge told Kelley that upon her release, she is not to “consume any alcohol or narcotic drug or other controlled substance unless prescribed by a licensed medical practitioner.”

In addition to participating in “inpatient or outpatient medical, behavior, psychological, or psychiatric treatment,” per People, Kelley was ordered to “avoid contact with witnesses who may testify regarding the offenses.”

Kelley's pretrial release conditions, People reported, also forbid her from posting on social media until another court order lifts that ban. 

A post shared by Scott Wolf (@iamscottwolf)

As Kelley navigates the road to recovery, Scott will maintain temporary sole physical custody of their kids — Jackson, 16, Miller, 12, and Lucy, 11. In a revised agreement filed on August 22, according to People, the judge upheld that decision. 

Scott was first awarded custody as well as a restraining order in June, following Kelley's first involuntary hold. That decision was upheld in July, per People, giving Kelley “liberal” supervised parenting time if coordinated through proper channels.

The August 22 agreement, according to People, included a new requirement that each of the couple's children have a “safe-harbor therapist,” which means neither parent can “interfere with or inquire into the content of the therapeutic process.” They're also prohibited from subpoenaing any information from the therapist in future litigation, the outlet said. 

The agreement states that the family's goal, per People, continues to be for “Kelley to eventually regain unsupervised parenting time.”

Morgan Neville, who previously directed '20 Feet from Stardom' and last year's 'Piece by Piece,' chronicles McCartney's post-Beatles 1970s era. 


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


	Amazon MGM Studios has picked up Man on the Run, the feature documentary directed by Morgan Neville that explores Paul McCartney's creative rebirth after The Beatles' breakup.


	The move comes ahead of the movie's premiere this weekend at the Telluride Film Festival.




Man on the Run, which is produced by Neville's Tremolo banner, in association with MPL and Polygram Entertainment, will be released in select theaters and then hit Prime Video Feb. 25 in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide.

	The documentary is meant to be the centerpiece in a partnership between McCartney, Universal Music Group, and Amazon that will unfold over the next year. It includes the release of exclusive music and merchandise drops, and commentary from McCartney himself. And it will coincide with the release of his book, Wings: The Story of a Band on the Run, which will be available on Amazon and Audible Nov. 4, and McCartney's Got Back tour dates across North America this fall.

	











	Producers of the documentary include Neville, Chloe Simmons, and Meghan Walsh for Tremolo; Scott Rodger and Ben Chappell for MPL; and Michele Anthony and David Blackman for Polygram Entertainment. Executive producers include Caitrin Rogers and McCartney. 


Man on the Run is described as taking viewers on an intimate journey through McCartney's extraordinary life following the breakup of The Beatles and the formation of his follow-up band Wings with his wife Linda in 1971.  The band, with its tumultuous member changes, hit a high with the 1973 album Band on the Run, with the title track and the song “Jet” becoming massive hits.

	











	The film chronicles the arc of McCartney's solo career as he faces down a myriad of challenges while creating new music to define a new decade. 


	Neville had unprecedented access to previously unseen footage and rare archival materials to tell the story of McCartney's transformative post-Beatles era through a uniquely vulnerable lens. 


	The filmmaker, who made 2018's Won't You Be My Neighbor?, a documentary about Fred Rogers, has a long history of music-focused works. He tackled back-up singers with his 2013 film, 20 Feet from Stardom, which won the Academy Award for best documentary as well as a Grammy Award for best music film. Last year he showed off Piece by Piece, focusing on Pharrell Williams and told via Legos. Other subjects include Keith Richards, producers Rick Rubin and Mark Ronson, and Bono and the Edge.


	The deal was brokered by Liesl Copland of MATR Labs on behalf of the filmmakers.

	Earlier this week, staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received a message from the higher-ups, vaguely informing them of an “obscene” placard and some “vandalism” on government property. 


	“We received a report of vandalism on Roybal Building 18, where an obscene sign was placed in the window,” the alert reads, per a copy reviewed by Rolling Stone. “We are investigating this incident and want to remind staff that vandalism of any kind will result in disciplinary action.”


	The notice and warning came just before President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. set off another round of tumult at the CDC over the attempted ouster of Director Susan Monarez, and the rewriting of vaccine policies. On Thursday, hundreds of CDC employees staged a walk out at the agency's Atlanta offices in support of four senior staff who resigned in protest of Kennedy's reforms and the administration's attempt to remove Monarez. 

	











	It was not immediately clear to some recipients of this email what the “obscene” sign was, but multiple former and current government personnel shared with this magazine photos of a highly visible, apparently hand-written “FUCK RFK” sign that sources say appeared recently on that building.

	Matters only degenerated from there. As this work week came to a close, former and current CDC staff assured Rolling Stone that the internal rank-and-file animus toward the president, Kennedy, and their allies in the federal government has only intensified in recent days. Some staffers are actively plotting their escape strategies, and how best to give RFK Jr. the middle finger (figuratively or literally) on the way out the door. Meanwhile, a senior Trump administration official adds that the CDC and other agencies will continue to aggressively investigate, and punish, the ongoing “mischief” and so-called “deep state activity” that Team Trump expects to flare up again, and that such actions “won't be tolerated.”

	The Trump administration is currently attempting to remove Monarez, a career microbiologist and infectious disease expert, from her position as head of the CDC. According to a Thursday report from The New York Times, the move to fire Monarez came after she refused to endorse Kennedy's plan to restrict public access and narrow recommendation guidelines for safe and effective vaccines. 


	Monarez is challenging her dismissal. One of her lawyer's told Rolling Stone this week: “When CDC Director Susan Monarez refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts, she chose protecting the public over serving a political agenda. For that, she has been targeted.”


	The standoff led to a wave of resignations within the CDC, including Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; Debra Houry, CDC chief medical officer; Daniel Jernigan, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases director; and Jen Layden, director of the CDC Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance and Technology.


	“We agreed to do this together. We've been talking about it for months, and the past few days, it was just escalating,” Houry told reporters at a protest on Thursday. “If one of us retired, it would have been a blip. When the three of us do it together, it's more powerful and just shows the state of our agency.”


	On Thursday, Kennedy sent an email to staff at the CDC — which was reviewed by Rolling Stone —  in which he announced that Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services Jim O'Neill would serve as acting CDC director. O'Neill is a tech investor with no educational background in health or medicine who has spent the last several years promoting dubious anti-aging treatments and amplifying skepticism about the Covid-19 vaccine. 


	Kennedy wrote that “President Trump and I are aligned on the commonsense vision for the CDC: strengthening the public health infrastructure by returning to its core mission of protecting Americans from communicable diseases by investing in innovation to prevent, detect, and respond to future threats.”

	Within the organization, however, staff feels differently. 


	“MAHA craziness is gonna run the table,” one source told Rolling Stone of the resignations. “It's really bad now, but things can always get worse.” A former CDC staffer adds: “This is the work of a death cult.”

Ayo Edebiri, Andrew Garfield, Michael Stuhlbarg and Chloë Sevigny also star in this psychological thriller about a sexual assault accusation that tears through the Yale philosophy department.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	If the loudly insistent ticking clock in the opening minutes of After the Hunt gets on your nerves, then brace yourself, because you're about to get clobbered with two-and-a-quarter hours of it. Not just the intermittent clock, but the mind-numbing academia-speak, the hyper-articulate inter-generational savagery and the streams of circuitous talk about thorny ethics, sexual violations and contentious power dynamics. Director Luca Guadagnino and first-time screenwriter Nora Garrett seem convinced this is all very provocative, very now with its hard questions and subjective truths. But frankly it's very five years ago, which makes it more punishing.

	Given that Guadagnino's greatest strengths have always been as a humanist, a sensualist and a bold visual stylist, it's baffling what drew him to material so aridly intellectual, stark and emotionless despite trafficking heavily in trauma. It seems almost implausible that the gifted filmmaker who just gave us the sizzling buoyancy of Challengers and the heady intoxication of Queer could deliver something so dour and airless. The Woody Allen-type main title treatment makes you wonder if Guadagnino is doing his version of a 21st century Interiors, a Bergman homage I'd sooner watch again than this, for Maureen Stapleton alone.

The Bottom Line

	
	Too deliberately opaque to be stimulating.

								2 hours 18 minutes			






	Maybe it was a desire to work with Julia Roberts, for whom this is an undeniably strong showcase, pouring herself into a character who's all sharp edges with scarcely a glimmer of warmth, an expert at hiding her feelings or anything even remotely personal. But as riveting as she is, Roberts ultimately is ill-served by a film so studiously cryptic that it ends up just frustrating. To be fair, there are several electric confrontations, distributed evenly enough to ensure that After the Hunt remains absorbing. But even so, this is a date movie to be used in relationship sabotage maneuvers.

	











	Yes, it's part of the point that every major character in this insular bubble of wealth, privilege, intellectual elitism and vigilant cultural sensitivity — I refuse to call it “wokeism” — is insufferable to some degree, even if they don't start out that way. That's all very well and it's not as if movies are required to fill a quota of sympathetic characters. But this bunch becomes steadily more distancing. Oh, except for Chloë Sevigny, dryly amusing in a frump wig as jaded feminist psychotherapist Kim, who only perks up when she hears Morrissey crooning “Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now.”


	Even the normally surefire element of a score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, with its blasts of dissonance pumping up the squirm factor, adds to the heavy-going effect of a movie that seems to go out of its way to be grating.


	Roberts plays Yale philosophy professor Alma Imhoff, who, along with her department colleague and closest friend Hank Gibson (Andrew Garfield), can almost taste the tenure she knows her work has earned. As the drinks flow during a gathering of faculty and PhD students at their deluxe digs, Alma's doting husband Frederick (Michael Stuhlbarg), another shrink, teasingly asks what happens if one of them gets tenure and the other doesn't. Would the friendship survive it?


	Hank is a self-satisfied peacock and chronic flirt. So much so that when someone later says, “Everybody loves Hank,” you might think, “Wait, are we talking about the same guy?” Much of his attention that evening is focused on Alma's star doctoral student Maggie (Ayo Edebiri), who responds to his playful taunting about why her generation is so guarded by pinpointing it to the moment his generation started making sweeping generalizations about them.

	











	When opinionated classmate Arthur (Will Price) gripes about how inclusivity has bumped men like him out of the competitive academic ranks, Maggie is quick to clap back. As a queer Black woman, she has no time for “white, male, straight, cis” people crying about victimhood after an eternity of automatic advantage. Alma concurs.


	But late the next day, when she finds Maggie on her doorstep soaked from the rain and weeping, Alma is more cautious about her solidarity. Clearly in distress, Maggie stammers out her account of what happened after the party, when Hank walked her home, asked to come up for a nightcap, started kissing her and refused to stop despite her repeatedly saying, “No.” She says he crossed a line, and when Alma asks how far over the line he went, Maggie bolts, muttering that it was a mistake to expect support.


	To the filmmakers' credit, this does not become another “he said/she said” dialectic descendent of David Mamet's Oleanna, even if Hank's blustery explosion of self-righteous anger seems to point that way. He claims he went to Maggie's apartment solely to challenge her privately about what he describes as flagrant plagiarism in one of her papers for him.


	There's also a tang of resentment in the fact that Hank grew up without money and has had to work hard to rise in his field, while he thinks Maggie is a mediocre student for whom doors have been opened by having billionaire parents among the top college donors. But even before his stunning eruption into vituperative rage in the hall outside Alma's classroom — played to the hilt by Garfield — it's clear that Hank is such a douche it stops mattering whether he's guilty or innocent.

	











	While he knows nothing of the alleged sexual violation, Frederick also has his doubts about Maggie, needling his wife for allowing her vanity to be stoked by a student who's possibly in love with her. “Is she brilliant, or does she just think you're brilliant?” Frederick asks Alma.


	Stuhlbarg, who should have gotten much more attention for his beautiful performance in Guadagnino's Call Me by Your Name, deserves better than Frederick. He projects serene emotional maturity and makes cassoulet like it's a sacred offering yet isn't averse to infantile tantrums of petulant jealousy. While he often unwinds after a day of seeing patients by blasting John Adams at maximum volume, a scene in which he does something similar while flouncing in and out of the kitchen where Alma and Maggie are trying to talk might make you want to kill people. He becomes like an unfunny New Yorker cartoon.


	Edebiri brings her customary emotional depth to Maggie, putting us in her corner when she presses charges and then gets uncomfortable with the attention the scandal generates around her at Yale. However, Garrett seems to want to have it both ways with the character (who's writing her dissertation on virtue ethics), giving her integrity but then undermining her with doubts and eyeroll-inducing Gen Z clichés. The suggestion that this rich kid might be partnered with a they/them-identifying trans law student and live in a shitty apartment for the optics seems a cheap shot.


	But the center of the drama is firmly occupied by Alma, who is so secretive she keeps quiet about an illness that causes her debilitating pain and nausea. (Even with sudden uncontrollable spasms, she manages not to get vomit on her chic white cropped pants and penny loafers.) Any loyalty she has to Maggie gets obliterated when the student reveals intimate knowledge of Alma's history that makes her think the professor might have suffered a similar experience.

	











	In Alma's view, Maggie crossed a different kind of line. Roberts brings a jolt of invigorating fury to one of the movie's strongest scenes, in which the mentor rips into her mentee in public on a campus square with a fully detailed character assassination. Hilariously, Alma shoves Maggie's partner Alex (Lío Mehiel) to the sidelines by sniping: “Don't you have some obscure fucking protest that you should go and be angry at?” Alma belittles every one of Maggie's life choices with a blistering scorn she later regrets. Or doesn't.


	To some extent, the script takes pains to keep Alma unreadable. (Though when she asks Frederick if he thinks she can be cold, I mumbled, “Oh, girl, are you kidding?”) When she rushes to speak with the Dean of Humanities (David Leiber) and request that she be kept out of the school's inquiry into the alleged abuse, is she protecting her career, staying neutral out of respect for her long friendship with Hank, or shrewdly planning for his elimination from the tenure race?


	These are all interesting questions, like many others raised in the script. But the movie makes a definite choice not to answer them, even in a big-twist epilogue five years later. That might have been an audacious move in a film less strident and more subtle. But the blanket refusal here to throw the audience a bone seems like self-conscious obfuscation. 


	Sure, it's exciting to watch Roberts sprout horns and turn spiky with defensiveness in another great scene when a student questions whether she “condones othering someone rather than advocating against it.” But we deserve more substantial compensation after spending more than two hours with these people.

					By Damon Wise 

Film Editor, Awards


	“It happened at Yale” says the opening of Luca Guadagnino's After the Hunt, which seems a little superfluous given that the director plunges us straight into a smug, well-heeled cocktail party for academics, complete with airy, pretentious chatter about the likes of Foucault and Kierkegaard. If that — and a title font that echoes Woody Allen's go-to choice of white Windsor Light Condensed over a black background — sets anti-intellectual alarm bells ringing, then this might not be the film for you. But though its conversations about tenure can be a chore, its presentation of the modern campus as the Somme — in terms of the battleground for progressive politics — does strike a very timely chord. It's also Julia Roberts' best work in a long, long time, a superb feat of casting that genuinely sends shivers and may well bury that old America's Sweetheart image for good.

	











	Her chic, killer wardrobe alone does a lot of the talking. She plays Alma Imhoff, a professor of philosophy, and she literally takes her work home with her, inviting staff and students alike to her nightly salons where issues such as collective morality and performative discontent are vigorously debated. A very vocal participant is her close friend and colleague Henrik “Hank” Gibson (Andrew Garfield), who very much shares Alma's views on life in the social media age (“When did offending someone become the pre-eminent cardinal sin?” she wonders aloud). Representing the student body is Maggie Resnick (Ayo Edebiri), an inquiring mind who is clearly besotted with Alma.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	While the elders discuss the now-besmirched personal lives of the likes of Carl Schmitt, Hegel and Heidegger, Maggie goes looking for the bathroom, and in her quest to find a fresh toilet roll finds, instead, a mysterious envelope. Its contents are viewed only fleetingly but it appears to contain a photograph and a newspaper cutting. Maggie puts everything back bar the cutting, which she puts in her pocket before returning. (The contents of this mysterious envelope may or may not be the catalyst for what happens next.) Anyway, after bidding her guests a good night, Alma catches sight of Maggie and Hank leaving together, the latter clearly the worse for wear but in seemingly high spirits.


	Alma thinks nothing of it, until Maggie — who is gay and lives with her non-binary lover Alex (Lio Mehiel) — comes to her apartment, with a story to tell. Hank, she claims, came to her apartment, became aggressive, and sexually assaulted her. When Alma confronts him, Hank denies this and becomes defensive, echoing a guest's assertion the night before — “The common enemy has been chosen, and it is the straight, white, cis man” — by painting himself the victim of Maggie's prim, over-sensitive boundary issues in what he calls “this shallow cultural moment”.  


	Though the issue is simple enough — did he, or didn't he? — it becomes an almost Brechtian challenge for Alma, who is torn along so many lines, primarily wanting to defend her friend but also maintain her professional composure and intellectual rigor. The fact that Maggie is Black, and rich, is a secondary powder keg that will blow up later in the story, when the firings start, the litany of cancellations pile up, and recriminations ricochet through the building. Needless to say, the shadow of David Mamet's notorious 1992 play Oleanna is everywhere, but Guadagnino — working from a script by Nora Garrett — gives his story a more generously female-weighted sense of balance.  


	The excesses of political correctness — and in particular the perverse right asserted by left-wing youth to stifle anything they don't agree with — gets a very firm and sometimes wickedly funny drubbing, especially when Alma is at the end of her tether with Maggie. (Indeed, there's a very entertaining gag about embattled British rock star Morrissey.) But though it bites, After the Hunt isn't just a diatribe about “woke” culture, it's a genuine attempt to look at what's happening now and see where it might take us. Maybe the academic elite deserves to be taken down, with its mealy mouthed hypothesizing and bourgeois fetishization of education as something somehow “better” than knowledge.


	It won't be a watercooler movie in that respect, and it may be a shock to unwary audiences lured in by Roberts's star wattage. But it could mark another milestone for the actress, being her strongest role since 2000's Erin Brockovich and an astonishing performance in its very own right. Lars Von Trier, eat your heart out.

You know you're in for an encounter with somebody who wants to start shit when the opening frames of Luca Guadagnino's “After the Hunt,” a thriller about a sexual assault scandal that rocks an intellectual community, are styled in the tradition of none other than Woody Allen: white Windsor typeface against a black backdrop, the cast including Julia Roberts and Ayo Edebiri in alphabetical order, and the credits acknowledging said alphabetical order. “It happened at Yale,” the prologue text announces, also evoking the academia-centered mysteries of someone like “The Secret History” author Donna Tartt.

 










It's an intriguing provocation from the get-go that Guadagnino would want to announce his new film by calling back to Allen, an artist who has become the poster figure for sexual abuse scandals. That Guadagnino would want to interrogate the rhetoric of how alleged abuse is positioned at all via Allen's signature is a sit-up-in-your-seat creative choice that nearly hijacks the first moments of this Yale-set drama, about a philosophy professor (Roberts) unraveling amidst her student's (Edebiri) accusation of sexual assault against a colleague (Andrew Garfield).

But that's unfortunately about as dangerous as the oddly chaste “After the Hunt” gets despite characteristically invigorating direction from the visionary filmmaker behind at least two masterpieces: “Call Me By Your Name” and “Queer,” two heightened immersions into the subjective state of desire, and maybe a third, “Suspiria,” if you're willing to go there. “After the Hunt's” talky, heady unfolding — with a snaking interest in the generational divide between Gen Z youth culture and pre-woke-era Gen Xers — works from a screenplay by first-time feature writer Nora Garrett, who came to Guadagnino's attention early last year. It's an overintellectualized script that reduces its characters to broad stand-ins and mouthpieces for hot topics, bizarrely retrograde, and a few beats behind the times in interrogating both the post-#MeToo context of how assault charges are handled, reacted to, and also in untangling a tricky identity politics inquiry that brushes against race and gender issues.

Yale philosophy professor Alma Imhoff (Julia Roberts), like the filmmaker, clearly has a taste for risk, too. Hosting a party chez elle that mixes colleagues and faculty, she nurses a sizable glass of red wine while dressed in a top-to-toe white suit, and it's likely not the first drink this secretly hard-boozing, self-destructive teacher has had today. Roberts has great fun in a career-recharging dramatic performance — she's at her most dare-to-be-unlikable since Mike Nichols' 2004 “Closer” — as a fucked-up, boozing, and eventually pill-popping highbrow with a mystery chronic ailment and perhaps a too-close fondness toward her younger colleague, Hank (a raffish Garfield).

 










One of her students, Maggie (Ayo Edebiri), is the type to shoot her hand up first in the classroom even when unsure of the answer. She greatly admires Alma but has secrets of her own: In that scene-setting party, Maggie absconds to Alma's bathroom, and finds an envelope with a photo of a dashing stranger taped under the sink. (Why Alma would hide this photo here, a relic of a hidden life, in New Haven, where she lives with her husband rather than the pied-à-terre she keeps in the city, suddenly revealed in the third act, is unclear.)

In other words, as much as Maggie idolizes her teacher in the way that young people who weren't loved enough as children project parent-like silhouettes onto their mentors, Maggie also might be building a case against Alma. Soon into the movie, a rain-soaked Maggie shows up, dejected and nerve-jangled, to the home Alma shares with her psychotherapist husband Frederik (Michael Stuhlbarg). Maggie confesses that, on the night of that party, Hank forced himself upon her after walking her home. “He crossed a line,” she says. A skeptical Alma will eventually tell Maggie a very unhelpful version of “if it's real to you, then it's real” while trying to balance an allegiance to Hank, who might be in love with Alma. Or is she in love with him, or just idealizing his adoration of her, too, as she does with Maggie's?

 










Alma is a victim of her own quest for love, and pieces of information about her past that might inform her reaction to Maggie's claims unfurl in dribs throughout the movie. Meanwhile, her relationship to Hank is thrown out of orbit, as this very clear accusation of rape alienates them from each other, and Hank from his academic milieu, where he likens himself to a wild animal being chased out of the herd.

Chloë Sevigny, who madly incarnated the freakiest scene out of Guadagnino's YA cannibal romance “Bones and All” and starred in his HBO series “We Are Who We Are,” has a small role here as student liaison Kim, who keeps the pupils' confidences as well as a blank prescription notepad in her desk, acting as a kind of guidance counselor. My issue with Garrett's unsubtle inquiry into the Gen Z vs. Gen X paradigm is no more sourly demonstrated than in a scene where Kim, throwing back a few drinks with Alma at the local dive Three Sheets, gives an on-the-nose remark on just how anachronistic-for-our-times it is that said college bar is blasting music by controversy-magnet, truther-opinioned Morrissey.

In terms of subversiveness and hints at a kinkier underworld beneath the surface, “After the Hunt” feels strangely sanded down: Why not turn up the heat more on the palpable sapphic friction simmering between Alma and Maggie? Lingering close-ups on one another's hands as they embrace in moments of emotional frankness — and both painted with what seems to be the same nail polish — hint at a relationship that could've been explored with more risk. The camera handled by cinematographer Malik Hassan Sayeed, working with Guadagnino for the first time, whooshes around his subjects to indicate the shakiness of their frames of mind. Guadagnino does bring back his regular scoring collaborators, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, who might have replayed the plunking, doom-harbinging piano refrain of “Eyes Wide Shut” a few too many times during the brainstorming phase.

 










Limiting to the actress's bona fide capabilities, Edebiri's character is treated mostly as a nuisance, a fly to be swatted off, making the racial politics of her position as a queer Black student whose moneyed parents have endowed the university (thereby throwing Maggie's inherent academic worthiness into question) especially unresolved and unplumbed. That Maggie's dissertation — which Hank alleges is plagiarized as he scrambles to gain traction amid his downfall — and field of study is on the resurgence of “virtue ethics” suggests something provocative, more satirical and mischievous up Garrett's sleeve. But it's unclear, and not in a piquantly ambiguous way, what Garrett is trying to say here.

The most recent movie “After the Hunt” calls to mind is Todd Field's “Tár,” similarly a cancel-culturally minded story set within academia, and about a female educator abusing her power. That film succeeded so well, in a way that everyone seemed to get without nose-wrinkling, because of its sense of humor about itself. “After the Hunt” leaves some potential brambles of humor unpricked, like the fact that Maggie just might be dating her nonbinary, trans peer (Lio Mehiel) for the sake of clout. Or when Alma sounds off on Maggie and her partner, asking, “Don't you have some obscure protest to be publicly angry at?” while repeatedly misgendering Mehiel's character. It's more cringe because of its bluntness than intentionally funny and satiristic.

 










Guadagnino is a beautiful director of jolting power and skill, especially in capturing queer yearning and the psychic collisions of people against their station in life. “Challengers” cranked up the pansexual vibes between a trio of tennis-playing lovers with an unceremoniousness, a sneaky slyness, that actually felt revolutionary, and the supposed age-gap romance of “Call Me By Your Name” remains a subject of hot debate even as the movie now lives as a contemporary classic. The way he has also stood by “Call Me” star Armie Hammer, all but persona non grata after a surge of upsetting harassment accusations of his own, indicates a subversive artist unafraid to go against the grain.

But “After the Hunt” ultimately isn't against-the-grain enough. It strives for moral ambiguity, but ends up startingly morally stark, pampering the viewer against discomfort in a final coda that feels taped on, after-the-fact reassurance. It pains me to take down a Luca Guadagnino movie — he is one of the best filmmakers working — but “After the Hunt” isn't enough, its ideas ripped from an earlier time, transposed onto our own with a broad-strokes equivocation about what they want to say.

“After the Hunt” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. Amazon/MGM Studios opens the film in theaters October 10.

You know you're in for an encounter with somebody who wants to start shit when the opening frames of Luca Guadagnino's “After the Hunt,” a thriller about a sexual assault scandal that rocks an intellectual community, are styled in the tradition of none other than Woody Allen: white Windsor typeface against a black backdrop, the cast including Julia Roberts and Ayo Edebiri in alphabetical order, and the credits acknowledging said alphabetical order. “It happened at Yale,” the prologue text announces, also evoking the academia-centered mysteries of someone like “The Secret History” author Donna Tartt.

 










It's an intriguing provocation from the get-go that Guadagnino would want to announce his new film by calling back to Allen, an artist who has become the poster figure for sexual abuse scandals. That Guadagnino would want to interrogate the rhetoric of how alleged abuse is positioned at all via Allen's signature is a sit-up-in-your-seat creative choice that nearly hijacks the first moments of this Yale-set drama, about a philosophy professor (Roberts) unraveling amidst her student's (Edebiri) accusation of sexual assault against a colleague (Andrew Garfield).

But that's unfortunately about as dangerous as the oddly chaste “After the Hunt” gets despite characteristically invigorating direction from the visionary filmmaker behind at least two masterpieces: “Call Me By Your Name” and “Queer,” two heightened immersions into the subjective state of desire, and maybe a third, “Suspiria,” if you're willing to go there. “After the Hunt's” talky, heady unfolding — with a snaking interest in the generational divide between Gen Z youth culture and pre-woke-era Gen Xers — works from a screenplay by first-time feature writer Nora Garrett, who came to Guadagnino's attention early last year. It's an overintellectualized script that reduces its characters to broad stand-ins and mouthpieces for hot topics, bizarrely retrograde, and a few beats behind the times in interrogating both the post-#MeToo context of how assault charges are handled, reacted to, and also in untangling a tricky identity politics inquiry that brushes against race and gender issues.

The Kinéo Awards have previously honored Ennio Morricone, Milena Canonero, Susan Sarandon, Natalie Portman, Bernardo Bertolucci, Dante Ferretti, Sienna Miller, Mads Mikkelsen and more.

	Chris Gardner



	Karla Sofía Gasón, the Oscar nominated star of Emilia Peréz whose campaign caught fire when incendiary tweets surfaced amid awards season, is set to touch down in Venice this weekend to pick up an award for best international actress.


	The honor, called a Kinéo Award, is presented by the Ministry of Cultural Heritage with the Kinéo Cultural Association. It launched in 2002 with a mission of promoting Italian cinema, and according to the official website, it's the “only award voted by a huge audience” in collaboration with the association of cinemas ANEC. Previous winners include Ennio Morricone, Milena Canonero, Susan Sarandon, Natalie Portman, Bernardo Bertolucci, Dante Ferretti, Alba Rohrwacher, Pier Francesco Favino, Giancarlo Giannini, Sienna Miller, Mads Mikkelsen and more.

	Gascón confirmed the news on Instagram last week, and organizers for the event announced that the actress will be present at a Saturday press conference at the Lido's Hotel Excelsior. Also confirmed to attend are fellow honorees Aras Aydin, Monica Guerritore, Massimiliano Gallo, Tatiana Luter and Cristiana Capotondi.

	It won't be Gascón's first comeback bid in the wake of her awards season scandal. The Hollywood Reporter recently debuted a first look at her newest movie, a 19th century-set Spanish western Trinidad, directed by Laura Alvea and José Ortuño. The English-language feature filmed in the Canary Islands but is set primarily in the United States. It stars Gabriela Andrada as Trinidad, a woman who flees persecution in Spain for the wild west. Along the way, she earns renowned for her skills with weapons, but also becomes a target of enemies, such as the widow Bronson (Gascón).

	











	She'll pick up the prize during what will be a busy weekend during the 82nd Venice Film Festival. It's unclear yet if Gascón will be walking the red carpet at any of the major movie premieres at Sala Grande.

"My Mind Is a Mountain" is the band's first ruler, 27 years after the group's first appearance.


													By
												

	Kevin Rutherford



Deftones make a record-breaking rise to No. 1 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Airplay chart with “My Mind Is a Mountain,” the band's first No. 1 on the list.


	The song, which lifts 3-1 on the Sept. 6-dated tally, is also Deftones' first leader on any Billboard airplay chart. It surpasses three No. 3 peaks: “Change [In the House of Flies]” on Alternative Airplay in 2000 and “Tempest” (2013) and “Ohms” (2020) on Mainstream Rock Airplay.

	











	Deftones first reached Mainstream Rock Airplay in May 1998, via “Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away),” which peaked at No. 29. As such, the band's 27-year, three-month, one-week wait between a first chart entry and first No. 1 is the lengthiest in two categories over the Mainstream Rock Airplay chart's 44-year history: longest wait for a group's first leader and the longest by any act in a lead role with a first No. 1.




			Trending on Billboard		







	In July, Evanescence rewrote the record for the longest wait by a group, at more than 22 years between “Bring Me to Life” and “Afterlife.” Not only does that record fall, Deftones wrap the longest wait for any act in a lead role thanks to “My Mind Is a Mountain,” exceeding the more than 26 years for Ozzy Osbourne between “Crazy Train” in 1981 and No. 1 “I Don't Wanna Stop” in 2007.

	











	Overall, Jeff Beck went a record 37-plus years between his debut, “People Get Ready,” in 1985 and his first No. 1, as featured on Osbourne's “Patient Number 9” in 2022.


Longest Waits for First No. 1, Mainstream Rock Airplay:


	Worth noting: Deftones' feat comes a week after Yellowcard rewrote the all-time record for the same accomplishment on Alternative Airplay.


	Deftones' Mainstream Rock Airplay history includes 17 entries between 1998 and 2025, with nine top 10s, starting with “Change” (No. 9, 2000).


	Concurrently, “My Mind Is a Mountain” bullets at No. 25 on Alternative Airplay, one spot below its best so far. That's the highest the band has been since “Tempest” reached No. 20 in 2013. On the all-rock-format, audience-based Rock & Alternative Airplay chart, “My Mind Is a Mountain” jumps 13-7 with 3.1 million audience impressions in the week ending Aug. 28, up 18%, according to Luminate. It's the band's first top 10 (exceeding “Tempest,” which hit No. 13).


	“My Mind Is a Mountain” appeared at No. 5 on the most recently published multimetric Hot Hard Rock Songs chart, after debuting atop the July 26 list. In addition to its radio airplay, the song earned 1.3 million official U.S. streams Aug. 15-21.


	The song is the lead single from Private Music, Deftones' 10th studio album. It was released Aug. 22, with its first-week impact to be reflected on the Sept. 6-dated album and song charts.

	











	All charts dated Sept. 6 will update on Billboard.com Wednesday, Sept. 3, one day later than usual due to the Labor Day holiday Monday, Sept. 2.

EXCLUSIVE: Here's your first footage of Reacher star Alan Ritchson in new action-thriller Motor City, which is debuting tomorrow at the Venice Film Festival before heading to Toronto.


	Ritchson stars alongside Shailene Woodley, Ben Foster and Pablo Schreiber in the kinetic movie, which is set in 1970s Detroit and charts the story of a man who plots revenge against the criminals who framed him for a crime he didn't commit, leading him to lose the love of his life, played by Woodley.


	The film features a kick-ass soundtrack (Bill Withers, Fleetwood Mac, Donna Summer and more), balletic cinematography and has a great pace to it and some wild action set pieces. The rising Ritchson brings impressive muscle and pathos to it. But what really sets it apart is the fact it only has five lines of dialogue, a rare proposition for a $30M U.S. movie.

	The Chad St John Black List script started out at Warner Bros more than a decade ago and went through multiple iterations in terms of leads and directors interested. Despite becoming an independent project it has managed to maintain impressive production scale and scope. It's part graphic novel-part noir-part John Wick meets disco. 


	The movie is understood to have sold well for Black Bear internationally, the question now is who will take the plunge on domestic, which is being handled by WME Independent and Range Select. We should know more after the Toronto festival and market screening next week. It's certainly deserves to be seen in theaters. At a time when audiences are sparking to original, gutsy genre from the studios (Sinners, Weapons of late), the movie offers another unique prospect and an invigorating creative endeavor. The minimal dialogue will be a commercial challenge. Some may see it as opportunity.

	











	Pic heralds from Old Henry director Potsy Ponciroli. Stampede and Grammercy backed it with Black Bear handling sales. As Ponciroli told us today on a Venice panel for the movie, there was typical indie pivoting right up until shoot: 


	“Credit to our producers. They had made a deal with foreign financiers and were meant to shoot half the movie overseas [Saudi Arabia], and we'd built all these sets and had all our furniture, cars, sets, were taking prop guns over the border etc and three weeks before shoot that money pulled out and we had to find those locations all over again in New Jersey. That was the biggest challenge. We went from 37 days to 28 days. But the producers found more money and there was never a chance the movie was going away.”


	Ben Foster told us today in Venice: “This is not a silent film. There are about five lines of dialogue. If we think about what makes us human, it's behaviour and how we behave with each other. So it was a fun challenge to tell a story without telling the story in a traditional manner. We were able to relate physically as actors.”


	Ponciroli added: “We've seen this type of story before, in terms of the plot, but it's pretty different in how much it relies on emotion and physicality. There's a four and half minute scene in a diner between Ben's character and Shailene and it's one of my favourite in the movie. You don't miss the dialogue. Watching them play off each other and use the scene and their physicality was really fun.”


	Ritchson couldn't make the Venice premiere due to Reacher commitments but is aiming to be at the Toronto launch next week.

Looks like lots of dialogue.  We just don't get to hear it.

Good luck.

The whole movie is in slow motion. Filmed in 3 days. 13 hour runtime.

The Oscar winning actress stepped out at the Venice Film Festival to promote her new Luca Guadagnino film ‘After the Hunt' in a look by Versace with a handbag that honors Roberts' married name. 


							By 

	Chris Gardner



	Dario Vitale found the ultimate A-lister to help debut his first designs since taking over at Versace at a fitting location: Julia Roberts at the Venice Film Festival.


	The Oscar winning actress stepped out today on the Lido to promote her new Luca Guadagnino film After the Hunt wearing Vitale's first look ever since taking the reins as creative director from Donatella Versace, who departed in March.  




	Vitale offered up a daytime look that channels a ‘90s spirit courtesy of a tailored jacket in blue wool paired with a striped button-down and denim pans. Roberts accessorized the business casual look with a heritage gold buckle belt, woven leather Vienna 95 shoes and a top handle leather bag with a Medusa twist-lock. The handbag had a personal touch customized for Roberts with the initials JM, which is her married name — Julia Moder.

	Seeing that Roberts helped Vitale set the stage for what's to come with Versace under his guidance, it wouldn't be a total shock to see her also step out in Versace when she hits the iconic red carpet later this evening for the After the Hunt world premiere. Either way, it should be a stylish affair as Roberts will be posing alongside her costars Ayo Edebiri, Andrew Garfield, Chloë Sevigny and Michael Stuhlbarg. 


	Vitale officially joined Versace on April 11, after having most recently served as design director at Miu Miu, which is owned by the Prada Group. At the time, he thanked Donatella Versace for “her trust in me,” while the outgoing icon said “Versace is in my DNA and always in my heart” as she moved on to serve as a chief brand ambassador.

The Summer I Turned Pretty fans are treading into unknown territory as they reach the home stretch of the third and final season.


	“Anything could happen,” Prime Video teased in a trailer released Friday morning for the last three episodes of Season 3. 


	In it, Belly (Lola Tung) is headed to Paris after calling off her wedding to Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno), unsure what the future holds for her.


	Slowly but surely, it seems, she begins to find herself again. She gets a job, makes friends, and starts a life in Paris. That is, until she gets a letter from Conrad Fisher (Christopher Briney).

	A slew of new castings were also announced Friday as new characters who will be introduced throughout Belly's Paris journey. 


	Joining the series in recurring roles are Corinna Brown (Heartstopper), Fernando Cattori (With You in the Future, Untamed Royals), Isaline Prevost Radeff (Ceux Qui Travaillent, Haute Mer), and Jahz Armando (Gangs of London).


	Based on the best-selling book trilogy from Jenny Han, The Summer I Turned Pretty is a multigenerational drama centered around a love triangle involving one girl and two brothers. It explores the complex bonds between mothers and their children, the strength of lasting female friendships, and the transformative journey of growing up. At its heart, it's a coming-of-age tale about first love, first heartbreak, and the unforgettable magic of one perfect summer.


	The third and final 11-episode season returned in July after quite a hiatus, quickly becoming a juggernaut for Prime Video. The Season 3 premiere raked in 25M viewers within a week, with series viewership tripling in the seven-day window over the course of the three seasons. 


	The final episodes of The Summer I Turned Pretty begin next week on September 3 with the finale set for September 17.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	Summer's finale is getting underway with four wide releases — Sony's Darren Aronofsky directed comedy caper Caught Stealing, Searchlight's remake of War of the Roses, entitled The Roses, Universal's 50th anniversary re-release of Jaws and Iconic Events' reboot of The Toxic Avenger. None are expected at this point to topple New Line's Weapons which will pop back up to No. 1 after Netflix's theatrical flirt with last weekend's box office; that Zach Cregger directed movie eyeing a fourth weekend of $11M-$12M over 4-days. 


Caught Stealing did $1.2M in both 4PM Thursday previews and last weekend's sneaks. The Austin Butler and Zoe Kravitz starring movie is expected to do north of $10M+ in four days at 3,578 sites. That preview figure is on par with such movies as House of Gucci ($1.3M which did a 3-day over Thanksgiving during post Covid 2021 of $14.4M) and August pre-Covid 2016's War Dogs ($1.25M previews, for a $14.6M opening). The Aronofsky directed title cost $40 million net after New York City film tax incentives. Great reviews and audience score on Rotten Tomatoes respectively with 87% and 86%. Wouldn't be shocked if it steals No. 1.

	Universal's 50th anniversary of Steven Spielberg's Jaws is expected to do $5M over the Friday to Monday period at 3,200 sites including PLFs and Imax. The shark bit $950K in previews last night, I hear. 




			Watch on Deadline		







The Roses grossed $800K in total previews box office, including limited early access shows on Wednesday. The Jay Roach directed, Tony McNamara adapted redo of the Warren Adler novel, which was also the source material for the 1989 Danny Devito directed movie/David Mamet scripted movie, is looking at $7M-$8M over 4-days. It's booked at 2,700 locations. The Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman starring title has bad reviews at 63% and a ho-hum audience score of 76%. Comps here for this title aimed at upscale older audiences are Black Bag at $850K which did a $7.6M opening and The Menu which posted $1M previews before a $9M opening. 

	











	We're waiting on Toxic Avenger‘s numbers…


	Rest of week's top 5:


	1.) Weapons (NL/WB) 3,631 theaters, Thu $1.3M (-8% from Wed), Week $21.9M (-40%), Total $122.8M/Wk 3

The live-event, single-location shoot for the ABC comedy's fifth season  took place at Citizens Bank Park during a Philadelphia Phillies game on Thursday night.

Abbott Elementary creator and star Quinta Brunson and her sitcom cast were on hand at a Philadelphia Phillies game on Thursday night to shoot a season five bottle episode during the live event.


	Their presence at Citizens Bank Park was marked on the Instagram page for the Philadelphia Phillies mascot, the Phillie Phanatic. A bottle episode is usually done to save on production costs. But Brunson, who comes from west Philadelphia and plays Janine Teagues on the ABC workplace sitcom, first teased a live event filming for the series in July at San Diego Comic Con.

	“You can expect us to be filming at a live event,” a coy Brunson hinted at the time, before adding, “but I do think that Philly sports fans will be very happy.” Then Thursday night, with the Phillies playing the Atlanta Braves, Brunson and her fellow West Philly Abbot Elementary teachers were on hand, in the stands and on the field for a group photo, to shoot the anticipated episode.


	Brunson, a two-time Emmy winner, wore a Phillies jersey as the single-camera comedy about a small group of teachers at a chronically underfunded public school left a studio audience behind to film at the sporting event. The bottle episode shoot had the blessing of MLB Studios, Major League Baseball's in-house studio.


	“As big fans of the series, MLB Studios initiated outreach to Warner Bros. and subsequently the Phillies to get the shooting process started. Collaboration between MLB Studios, the Phillies and the show commenced to shoot a bottle episode on-location at a Phillies game, with a goal of ensuring authenticity and access to the field,” a statement from MLB Studios obtained by The Hollywood Reporter says.

	











Abbott Elementary, for which Brunson also serves as creator and executive producer, wrapped up its fourth season by nabbing six Emmy nominations, including best comedy and best writing for a comedy series, which Brunson won for the series' pilot episode in 2022.

The singer created her own ‘Rocky Horror Picture Show' in the music video following the release of her new ‘Man's Best Friend' album. 


							By 

	Lexy Perez


Associate Editor


Sabrina Carpenter channeled the Rocky Horror Picture Show in her new music video. 


	The singer released her new album Man's Best Friend on Friday with a new music video accompanying her second single, “Tears.”




	In the theatrical video, Carpenter is shown lying in a field after a car crash, only to discover a house in the middle of nowhere. However, when she goes inside she is surrounded by a funhouse of characters and is revamped to match the eclectic and sexy styles.

Colman Domingo stars in the video in drag as he accompanies Carpenter as she enters new rooms and meets new characters. At one moment, the two share a dance break.

	At the end of the video, Carpenter's character is shown being thrown out of the house only to find the boyfriend she thought had died is alive after all. 


	“It's a thing. Someone has to die every video,” she tells him. “Sorry! We'll always remember you, though.” She then throws her heel at him to kill him.


	Carpenter's seventh album, Man's Best Friend, features 12 new songs including her first single “Manchild.” Prior to its release, the singer faced backlash for the album's suggestive cover art that featured Carpenter on her hands and knees with someone pulling a fistful of her blonde hair. 

	











	While appearing on CBS MORNINGS, Carpenter said of the reaction to the cover art, “Like, y'all need to get out more, I think. I was actually shocked, because I think between me and my friends and my family and the people that I always share my music and my art with first, it just wasn't even a conversation. It was just, like, it's perfect. For what, for the what the album is, it's perfect for, you know, kind of what it represents, and everything about it to me just felt like so opposite of, like, the world ending.” 


	When offering her interpretation of the visual, she explained, “My interpretation is being in on the control. Being in on your lack of control and when you want to be in control. Like, I think as a young woman, you're, you're just as aware of when you're in control as when you're not. And I think some of those are choices, and I think for me, this whole album was about the humanity of allowing yourself to make those mistakes, knowing when you're, you know, putting yourself in a situation that will probably end up poorly.” But it's gonna teach you something, so there was a lot of different meanings.” 


	She further explained there was “a lot of pointing fingers” despite no one having heard the project. “They don't know me. They don't know my intentions. They don't know the stories I'm telling. So, I do, I try to take it with a grain of salt and also know that my fans that know me and know the person behind the music will look at that photo and they know exactly what it is. And people that have no idea who I am absolutely look at that photo and go, like, ‘Where are her parents?' … My parents actually saw the photo and they loved it.” 

	











	Carpenter is also set to be featured on the title track of Taylor Swift's upcoming new album The Life of a Showgirl.

It's no surprise that Troma Entertainment's mascot d'excellence, The Toxic Avenger, has sat out most of 2025's reboot-a-thon, what with Lilo & Stitch, Superman, The Naked Gun, and The Fantastic Four: First Steps (among others) sucking up all the air-conditioned oxygen in multiplexes this summer. Where might poor, put-upon Toxie—star of four vicious, violent, and increasingly bizarre films spanning 1984 to 2000—find a place to showcase his most audience-friendly incarnation yet? The ass-end of August, of course, a notorious cinematic dumping ground for distributors too timid to set their scrappy genre movies loose among the big dogs. Macon Blair's appropriately yucky reimagining of The Toxic Avenger adequately, perhaps heroically, mimics the gore-and-boobs-addled cadence of Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz's discount filmmaking, and that alone puts it head and mop above the summer's heavily curated trough of studio-safe products. The Toxic Avenger is an imperfect but no less vital lifeblood transfusion for the cheapo horror-comedy: a cartoon-carnage splash-a-thon, and an eco-conscious call to clean out the profiteers poisoning us and our planet.

A squirrely fusion of tribute and reboot, The Toxic Avenger pits its mutant superhero (voiced by Peter Dinklage, eventually embodied by Luisa Guerreiro) against shitheel corpo-villain Bob (Kevin Bacon in a hilarious Karen wig). Dinklage plays Winston Gooze, a down-on-his-luck janitor working for Bob's BTH Corporation, mopping up nuke-sludge overnight and caring for his emotionally distant stepson Wade (Jacob Tremblay) during the day. Haunted by the sudden death of Wade's mother, the two tiptoe around their shared grief and the accumulating “Past Due”s gathering dust on the kitchen table. When Winston is given a terminal cancer diagnosis (delivered under the head-splitting din of a jackhammer), he begs unscrupulous Bob for help navigating his deliberately labyrinthine insurance policies, an act of humility that sends Winston blundering into the path of Bob's scuzzy underlings—and his gnarly metamorphosis. 

Toxie's revised origin is but one instance where Blair makes space for emotional resonance that Kaufman's nihilistic 1984 original wouldn't have countenanced, though the films share an undercurrent of vengeful class consciousness—the same maddening awareness that the system can and will fuck with people whenever and however it wants—that elevates Blair's film above its B-movie niche. Tramping around the goofy glass-and-syringe-strewn byways of Tromaville (here rechristened as St. Roma's Village) might limit its broader appeal, but drenched in every form of viscous goop, juiced by a punk/metal soundtrack (with a Dinklage contribution, no less), Blair's film makes a case for relevance through sheer chutzpah.

Naturally, Winston plunges into toxic waste and emerges as a hideously deformed creature of superhuman strength, complete with signature mop and pink tutu. Once Toxie lumbers to life, Dinklage entrusts his role to Guerreiro, who manages, under vascular, acid-burned prosthetics, to harness the same wary, cautious physicality Dinklage brings to Winston. Guerreiro does fascinating character work through movement and expression, and largely avoids looking like she's chewing air as Dinklage's dialogue floats over the soundtrack. And while this dual act does initially seem loosely stitched together (mostly by dodgy edits to obscure Toxie's mouth movement), Guerreiro and Dinklage find harmony in their mutual commitment to the character.

But don't mistake this goodwill for squeamishness on Blair's part. He isn't afraid to tinker with Troma's baser instincts when a situation calls for it, populating his film with a concentration of Kaufman-styled freakazoids and maniacs who, among other grody deeds, occasionally whip out interesting parts of their anatomy just for fun. Bob's younger brother, Fritz (Elijah Wood costumed somewhere between Gerard Way and Danny DeVito's Penguin), manages a monster-metal band/death squad called The Killer Nuts, each member equipped with their own disturbing gimmick: a parkour psycho, a chicken-masked creep, a juggalo, and so on. The action often employs disgusting gags, with one hostage sequence that splashes and dismembers with the same anxious, repulsive energy of the original.

Blair also smuggles in some pertinent social commentary, to various comic effect: A cop screams “Show me your hands!” as he ventilates a suspect into Swiss cheese; a newscaster quibbles over Toxie's pronouns; and, in the clearest measure of how far we are from the deviant tendencies of '80s schlock, Toxie explicitly states that he is not a pervert, unlike original Toxie Melvin Junko. Self-awareness thrums throughout this new take on The Toxic Avenger. And while this metatext saps some of the film's danger and unpredictability, it makes a canny argument for future installments: The quality of this reboot, its dutiful nods, and its end-credits sequel tease all clear a path for Toxie to explore stranger, grodier frontiers.

Nobody does an anthology film quite like Jim Jarmusch, and his new film “Father Mother Sister Brother” will see him exploring the intricacies of family relationships over quite a few cups of tea. 

Jarmusch has assembled a stable of his favorite collaborators (along with a few new faces) for a triptych about adults navigating their relationships with their aging parents. The three segments were filmed in New Jersey, Dublin, and Paris — a fittingly global choice from a director who has always been fascinated by the ways that multicultural relations shape our smallest interactions. Plot details have been scarce to date, but the first teaser shows three distinct families dealing with their share of awkward moments, such as a disagreement about whether it's possible to do a proper toast with tea.

“Father Mother Sister Brother” is the first feature Jarmusch has directed since his 2019 zombie comedy “The Dead Don't Die.” That film debuted to middling reviews (though it has enjoyed a subsequent reappraisal), but it was preceded by two of the strongest films of his career, 2014's “Only Lovers Left Alive” and 2016's “Paterson.” 

 










The hyphenate has kept busy during his six-year hiatus, working on multiple music projects including a new series of scores he composed for Man Ray films along with his SQÜRL bandmate Carter Logan. But he hasn't been shy about his disdain for the state of the independent film industry. 

“The film industry is kind of gone,” Jarmusch said in a 2023 interview with The Guardian. “It sucks. It's gotten worse. The kind of split-rights deals – an equal 50-50 shared profits, after costs, with financiers – that I used to be able to do with my films… if you even suggested that now, you would be laughed out of the fucking building.”

“Father Mother Sister Brother” will have its world premiere at the Venice International Film Festival before screening at the New York Film Festival. MUBI will release the film in theaters on December 24. Watch the teaser below.

It's early days at the Venice Film Festival, but there seems to be an emerging theme of the dehumanizing nature of work under late capitalism (see also: “Bugonia” and “No Other Choice”). French actress an director Valérie Donzelli has a very specific riff on this theme in “A Pied D'oeuvre (the English title is literally “At Work”), her modern riches-to-rags tale about a man who gives up life as a successful, well-remunerated photographer in Paris in order to scrape a living as a casual laborer and use his free time trying to become an author that his children want to read.

 










Paul (Bastien Bouillon) is taking a hammer to drywall when we meet him, as the life he used to know is shattering into pieces. At the age of 42, he has switched creative lanes from being a photographer pulling in €3k to €8k a month to being a writer who has already spent the advance on his unpromising third book. Meanwhile, his recent ex-wife (Donzelli) has moved to Montreal along with his son and daughter and Paul has moved out of their large house into a tiny studio. His thinly veiled account of the breakdown of their marriage, “The Story of the End” his agent deems unsaleable. If being a good writer means living in such a way that the material generates itself, then Paul's life and vocation are both in need of an overhaul.

Paul wants to find the kind of work that leaves him enough time to write, and this is how he ends up on the “Jobbing” website, setting up a profile and listing his manual labor/ handyman skills. Donzelli's unflashy style of direction has a brisk simplicity, letting observational details play out without underlining them, so that mildly comic moments could just as easily have you grimacing in recognition. The tiny ghost of a smile that Paul performs to his webcam for take two of his profile picture is the world in a grain of sand, reflecting the fact that it's not enough for people to sell their labor, they must appear to emanate a deep sense of well-being from within while, say, dismantling a mezzanine or mowing your lawn. 

This is a film parked out in the minutiae of Paul's new work culture and attuned to the fact that, when your work is underpaid, you can never get enough of it. Members of the Jobbing website are pinged whenever a job within their skillset is listed, at which point, it's a bidding war to the bottom as jobbers set their rates ever-lower. Paul commonly bids at €20 for jobs that take hours, meaning his rate is nowhere near the wheelhouse of minimum wage. 

Still, as he reflects, he has a beginner's zeal to make this system work, and that gives him an advantage over more disenfranchised jobbers with a long-term dependency on it. Adapted from an autobiographical novel by Frank Courtes, the film is in the trenches of Paul's personal experience while retaining the perspective that most people who turn to Jobbing do so out of desperation rather than idealism. Unlike the migrant workers that he competes with for jobs, Paul is still in receipt of humble monthly royalties. “€200-300 a month is not poverty but it gives a clear view of it,” he writes. Although Paul has relative privilege here, relative privilege does not pay the heating bills and it is clear — through the glimpses of debasement that occur with increasing frequency — that our hero is flirting with ruin.

 










The people around him berate him for his choices, his sister says that he is not a “real” poor person and asks why he doesn't get a different job. Verbalising the idealism that quietly motors under the surface of both the film and its protagonist, Paul says that “some slaves are well-paid today.” He has tasted the life that a corporatized creative job can buy and has found it lacking. His newfound precarity is not romanticized, it is presented as the necessary alternative to a less suitable path. He is taking Robert Frost's road less traveled in the hope that it will make all the difference. 

Half-way through the film, he has an encounter with the man he used to be, which is to say, in his capacity as a driver, he picks up a man that he knew from the photography world. Over dinner, this man, who still has a well-paid job, a big house, and luxe travels, offers a graceful understanding of what his former peer is doing and contrasts it with his own “hyper-consumption. … You're cutting down, it's good.”

The narrow narrative framework is undergirded by a taut, eloquent script by Valérie Donzelli and Gilles Marchand (whose previous writing credits include Cannes 2025 titles “Enzo” and “Case 137”). The ring of lived experience does not hamper or labor this clear-eyed depiction of a man whose desire for freedom might see him free-fall into a different trap: poverty. 

 










Virtually a one-man-show, Bouillon carries the film aided by the kind of face that looks different from every angle. His clients are curious about him. “You don't look the part,” says one woman as he arrives in his cable-knit sweater and owl glasses to construct her armoire. The glimpses of the people that he meets in this new line of work feed his writely imagination and he reconstructs them on the page. Fears that the narrative will end in a cliche, with Paul writing a book about being poor that makes him rich again, are thankfully unfounded as the film deftly avoids any such trap. 

If this modest fable feels slight in a competition dominated by filmmakers swinging for the fences, then it's not for a lack of substance. Full of throwaway insights into the micro-climate of a particularly hellish economic landscape, “At Work” is an engaging story about a man trying to write an engaging story with a diamond of hard-won wisdom at its core. 

“At Work” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

The Gallaghers were in top shape during Thursday night's (Aug. 28) two-hour hit parade in the first of five American shows.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	It's been said countless times since Liam and Noel Gallagher buried the hatchet last year to launch their rapturously received Oasis Live '25 reunion run, but the formerly quarrelsome siblings who used to make Cain and Abel look like the Kelce brothers have found that special magic again. And then some.

	











	When the tour finally hit U.S. shores on Thursday night (Aug. 28) at a sold-out Soldier Field in Chicago for one of only five American dates, there was an unmistakable, heart-warming majesty to the display of true brotherhood between the Gallaghers. From their now signature hand-in-hand walk out to subtle nods and hip-check nudges between them, the years of estrangement seemed like an ancient memory, leaving in their place a dedication to playing their most beloved songs as loudly, brashly and tightly as ever.


	Despite the unwavering setlist and even somewhat similar between-song banter, the first Oasis show on U.S. soil in nearly 17 years made it feel like no time at all had gone by the second the band's signature party-starting  go song — the beat-attack, mostly instrumental “F—kin' in the Bushes” —  blared from speakers to a jubilant mob geeked for the return of the Britpop kings.




			Trending on Billboard		







	One thing that hasn't changed is singer Liam Gallagher's punkish swagger, as evidenced by the shades that never left his face for the duration of the two-hour, 23-song gig and his playful shout-out to the “drug takers” and “glue sniffers” before “Bring It On Down.” Whereas in years past the band's formerly volatile vocalist might have tossed the occasional tambourine or maraca in frustration — he's now banned from letting any instruments fly for safety reasons, if you can believe it —  the closest he got to maligning one of his instruments in Chicago were the few times he playfully clamped his tambo between his teeth during instrumental passages.

	











	The professionalism extended to the sharp, all-black ensembles worn by the entire band, which gave off an us-against-the-world gang vibe as tight as the song's arrangements. When Liam leaned into the microphone to howl the chorus of “Morning Glory” as the 52,000-plus crowd expertly backed him with an elongated “wellll,” it was clear American fans have studied the tapes from the group's U.K. and Irish gigs last month and came prepared to do their part.


	And boy did they. From the unending sea of Adidas stripes on track suits, football jerseys and sneakers, to what must have been a Midwest record for the most bucket hats in a single place at once, the crowd came to sing along and hoover up as much merch as possible. And off course they did the turn-around and jump-up-and-down Poznan dance during “Cigarettes & Alcohol,” making the ground shake like a Britpop earthquake. “Everybody said Americans wouldn't do that f–kin' s–t” Liam playfully poked. “Of course they will,” he said afterwards.


	In the bad old days, Liam would sometimes wander off stage, or sulk on the drum riser during his vocal breaks over some perceived slight or agitation. But what a difference time has made, as 2025 Liam now blows kisses before “Some Might Say” before making the sign of a cross after dipping his fingers in his water bottle to get some holy mojo rolling. 


	He joked about how the band and their diehard fans “invented all this madness” before brother Noel unleashed the primal roar of “Supersonic,” peeling off the gigantic, clear-as-a-bell riffs that had Liam swaggering over after “Roll With It” to give his older brother a friendly hand slap. The band's songwriter and occasional singer returned the favor by giving Liam a break during a mid-set ballad showcase featuring the Noel-led “Talk Tonight,” “Half the World Away” and clear crowd favorite “Little by Little.”

	











	The Stones-y opening set from Bowling Green, Ky. brother band Cage the Elephant set the stage with a tight, kinetic performance that had singer Matt Shultz leaping into the air and bounding from one end of the stage to the other like a Bluegrass State Jagger, with no signs of the 2024 foot injury that had him scooting around stage in a medical boot for a while. In keeping with the sibling revelry on display all night, at one point Shultz sauntered over to older brother guitarist Brad Shultz and gave him a sweet brotherly shove after a bit of teasing.


	Liam didn't say much to the crowd, but when he did speak it was to spread the love, telling his Chicago fans that it was “f–kin' mega to be back in America,” noting that “we always loved ya” as the band dove into 1997's Be Here Now classic “Stand by Me.” There were other playful gestures, such as the “c'mon now” flick of the ears urging the audience to sing along to that song — “Fookin' mega to be back in America” he said “we've always loved ya” — or his cheeky search for “any lovers in the house” before the 1994 Definitely Maybe track “Slide Away.”


	For a band that used to be dogged by obvious Beatles comparisons, Thursday's show felt less wedded to Fab formula and more focused on delivering waves of sonic overload and straight-up melodic stadium rock, as when “Live Forever” roped tens of thousands into reaching onto their tiptoes to get high enough for the falsetto “You and I we're gonna live forever” bit. 


	“Rock ‘N Roll Star” needed no such encouragement, with the audience doing the heavy vocal lifting on the track that ends in a swirl of psychedelic eddies. There were still the low-key, subtle nods to the Beatles, though, as in the familiar inclusion  of a bit of Ringo Starr's “Octopus's Garden” at the end of “Whatever.”

	











	But truth be told, this set was mostly focused on giving the people what they came for, packed in one of the most epic show closers in rock. Noel took lead vocals on 1998's “The Masterplan,” a lesser-known track that got No. 1 hit treatment from the passionate audience, who jumped up and down and pumped their fists with a kind of polite mayhem that never tipped over into loutish behavior.


	On a perfect 65-degree night, Oasis landed the plane with the undisputed murderer's row trifecta of encores, beginning with the unmistakable rolling piano and drum roll intro to “Don't Look Back in Anger,” a song so titanic that Noel didn't even have to sing lead on the chorus. That kind of artistic abdication can sometimes come off as lazy, but in this case there was something heartwarming about letting the enthusiastic crowd carry that weight with joy and high fives all around.


	His hoodie now up over his head so his face was nearly obscured, Liam returned for a pair of songs that are basically eternal Great Britpop Songbook classics at this point beginning with a majestic “Wonderwall” and ending with an absolutely levitating “Champagne Supernova.”


	Oasis have nothing left to prove. Their songs have, and do, stand the test of time. They will live forever. Their rancorous days seemingly are behind them, they have mastered the art of turning a football stadium into a pub sing-along with 60,000+ of their closest fans. But perhaps most impressive of all, they returned from a potentially career-killing hiatus just as strong, if not stronger than they were, minus the baggage and plus the hard-earned wisdom to trust that the songs are more than enough.

	The 23-year-old who killed two students at a Catholic school in Minneapolis “appeared to hate all of us,” authorities said as they continued to piece together a motive for the mass shooting earlier this week.


	At a press conference on Thursday, Joe Thompson, the acting U.S. Attorney for Minnesota, said videos and writings left behind by the shooter — identified as Robin Westman — “expressed hate towards almost every group imaginable,” including Black people, Mexican people, Christians, and Jews. “The shooter appeared to hate all of us,” Thompson continued. “The shooter's heart was full of hate.”


	Thompson went on to say that the only group of people the shooter “admired” and “idolized” were other school shooters and mass murderers. Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara echoed this sentiment, saying the shooter had a “deranged fascination” with mass killings. (Thompson, O'Hara, and others declined to identify Westman or other mass murderers by name due to the way many carry out such attacks in search of notoriety.) 

	











	Authorities have yet to identify an exact motive, but Thompson said bluntly at his press conference, “The shooter was obsessed with the idea of killing children. The shooter saw the attack as a way to target our most vulnerable among us… I won't dignify the shooters words by repeating them, they are horrific and vile; but in short, the shooter wanted to watch children suffer.” 


	Two children, ages eight and 10, were killed in the shooting, while nearly 20 more were injured, most of them children. Per the latest reports, one child remains in critical condition.

	











	According to Thompson, the shooter left behind “hundreds of pages of writings,” which authorities will continue to examine and share more information from in the coming days. As The Associated Press also notes, a YouTube channel believed to belong to the shooter contained several videos (which have since been deleted). One showed weapons and ammunition, some of which had phrases like “kill Donald Trump” and “Where is your God?” written on them.

	Another video appeared to show a person pointing at the windows of a drawing of a church, then stabbing it with a knife. And one video appeared to contain a suicide note addressed to the family. In the note, the shooter confessed to having long-held plans to carry out such a shooting, while there was also talk of serious depression. (The shooter died in the parking lot from what authorities believe was a self-inflicted gunshot.)


	Authorities also confirmed that the shooter previously attended Annunciation Catholic Church's school, where the shooting was carried out, and their mother worked there. A former classmate told The AP, “I remember they had a crazy distaste for school, especially Annunciation, which I always thought was pretty interesting because their mom was on the parish board.”

It's no wonder longtime HGTV star Christina Haack couldn't wait to put her latest divorce behind her. Nearly four months after the interior designer celebrated settling her divorce from her third husband, Josh Hall, the final agreement was filed in court on August 26, 2025. 

Court documents obtained by EntertainmentNow on August 28 reveal that Haack, 42, walked away with many of the assets that mattered most to her, including her family's home in Orange County, California, and the Nashville farmhouse where her former HGTV show “Christina in the Country” was filmed.  

After hours of mediation on May 1, the settlement that both parties agreed to granted Hall, 45, his fair share of assets, too. Following almost three years of marriage to Haack, he received a total of $400,000 in cash payments, and will keep multiple vehicles and several properties. 

On May 7, Haack wrote in her Instagram Stories that she was trying to be frugal by wearing a $65 dress to a red carpet event, writing, “Paying for this divorce hasn't been cheap so I've been trying to cut down on my spending especially when it comes to clothes.”

Hall, who had just begun filming “The Flip Off” with Haack when the two separated on July 8, 2024, moved full-time to Tennessee after the split, while Haack remained with her kids in California. 

As news of the settlement broke, he posted on August 28, “Finally, legally divorced and a free man. I've always worked hard, kept what's mine, and declined hand outs, and I'm keeping it that way.”

According to the former couple's 44-page settlement overview reviewed by EntertainmentNow, Hall will keep the $100,000 that Haack paid him during their divorce proceedings. Haack also wrote him a check for $300,000 in May — taken from the sale of a 1920 Nashville home they purchased in early 2024 and began flipping. The home sold in April 2025 before the full remodel was finished, according to real estate records reviewed by EntertainmentNow. 

In addition to the cash payout, Hall received two furnished properties in Tennessee — a house and a condo — as well as a plot of land in California. He's also hanging onto a 2021 Bentley, a 1970 Chevelle, a 1982 DeLorean, a 1947 Dodge, and a Honda CRF motorcycle.

Haack, meanwhile, gets the two previously mentioned homes, additional properties and land, as well as two 2021 GMC Yukons (one in Tennessee, the other in California), a 2021 Polaris Razor, and four quads that were gifted to her kids, per court documents. It's unclear why, but Haack also must return a 2022 Bentley to the dealership where it was purchased. 

Although Hall originally requested spousal support when the two split, he has since waived the right to it. Haack also waived her right to any support from Hall moving forward. 

A post shared by Heather Rae El Moussa (@theheatherraeelmoussa)

When Haack signed the divorce settlement in May, she posted a thank you note to her attorney, celeb divorce lawyer Laura Wasserman, that said, “I LOVED WATCHING YOU IN ACTION AND HOW YOU HANDLE EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE WITH CLASS AND GRACE…I APPRECIATE YOU ALL BEYOND WORDS. I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH UNDER YOUR GUIDANCE AND I'M GRATEFUL TO HAVE THIS BEHIND ME. I CAN'T WAIT TO MOVE ON WITH MY LIFE AND FOCUS ON WHAT'S AHEAD AND ALL MY BLESSINGS. 🙏❤️”

Haack and Hall have both moved on with new relationships since their split. On January 10, Us Weekly reported that Hall was dating Nashville-based model Stephanie Gabrys. The two are still together, seen most recently in an Instagram photo he posted on August 12.

Haack, meanwhile, stepped out with Orange County business executive Chris Larocca in January after weeks of rumors about them dating. As news of her divorce settlement broke on August 28, Haack was busy posting photos in her Instagram Stories from a trip to Chicago with Larocca. 

The couple has even become tight with Tarek and Heather, with whom Haack will co-star in a just-announced second season of “The Flip Off,” coming to HGTV in 2026.

Martin Scorsese recently produced the Fox Nation series “The Saints,” but he himself looks more like a Biblical figure in a first look at his character from Julian Schnabel‘s “In the Hand of Dante.” Scorsese is bearded and bewhiskered in this adaptation of Nick Tosches' 2002 book. And his character is a nameless man who otherwise goes by Isaiah. He'll be playing an inspirational figure to Dante Alighieri, the 14th century Italian scribe best known for his epic poem “The Divine Comedy,” and it seems sure to be another of his distinctive on-camera appearances. (You can see the full image, an IndieWire exclusive, below.)

 










Like the book, Schnabel's film will take place both in Italy in the early 1300s, when Dante is assembling his magnum opus, and also in 2001, when a handwritten manuscript supposedly from Dante himself is discovered in the Vatican library and goes through an elaborate process of authentication — with a mob boss ordering a fictionalized version of author Tosches to steal it. Oscar Isaac will play both Dante and Tosches.

Scorsese's “Isaiah” will only appear in the 14th century segments. Dante seeks his approval when he writes “Paradiso,” and it takes many visits before Isaiah gives it. Dante was sent to him by Guido Cavalcanti who was his mentor, and visits Isaiah whenever he can over the course of many years while he is in exile. (One can imagine Scorsese's character from “Quiz Show,” with warm fatherliness, addressing Dante as “young man.”) Isaiah is meant to represent the highest form of wisdom.

“In the Hand of Dante,” also starring Jason Momoa, Gal Gadot, Gerard Butler, Al Pacino, and Franco Nero, will make its world premiere, appropriately enough, at the 2025 Venice Film Festival.

But cinephiles will particularly thrill to this grizzled image of Scorsese, looking exactly like a font of Renaissance wisdom who could have inspired the great writer. Scorsese's acting filmography consists largely of cameos or brief scenes, but they're always memorable — culminating in his first ever acting nomination, an Emmy nod as guest actor in “The Studio” this awards cycle. 

Most memorable may be his sociopathic passenger in “Taxi Driver” — or rather, as he's credited, Passenger Watching Silhouette. He asks Robert De Niro's title character Travis Bickle to pull up in front of an apartment building where he watches the silhouette of a woman undressing. He tells Bickle that that's his wife, she's with another man, and in his jealousy he's planning on killing her.

 










Oddly, he was able to leverage that simmering menace once again for his voice acting role in the 2004 animated comedy “Shark Tale” where much of the plot centers on a fish voiced by Will Smith owing Scorsese's heavy-eyebrowed pufferfish money. Somehow the minds at DreamWorks knew that what Aughts kids wanted to see above all was Martin Scorsese as an underwater gangster. (That film was also a Venice premiere.)

The thing about that “Shark Tale” performance is that it leans so heavily into Scorsese's persona — the eyebrows, the rapid-fire staccato delivery, the slightly manic vibe — that it shows why his acting work has had some limitations. There's a moment at the beginning of his extraordinary documentary series “A Personal Journey Through American Movies with Martin Scorsese” (a multi-hour tribute to Scorsese's favorite movies) that may show why. At the start of that, a real-time sketch takes place that takes the form of Scorsese's profile. It calls to mind the signature profile sketch always associated with Alfred Hitchcock — like Hitch before him, Scorsese is a persona, and not quite elastic enough of one to stretch and fit many roles.

So, like Hitchcock, the blink-and-miss cameo has often been Scorsese's approach in front of the camera: As a photographer in “The Age of Innocence,” say, or as a cameraman in “Hugo.” Of course there's his speaking part at the end of “Killers of the Flower Moon,” where he plays a radio show host who's just finished giving the radio-play version of the story that had unfolded over the previous three-and-a-half hours. It was an incredible meta commentary on how deep human tragedy becomes entertainment, “true crime.” And him being the one to play that role, as well as being the film's director, almost suggests a certain questioning about how he, or any filmmaker, could have approached this material as respectfully as possible.

 










For our money, his greatest screen role is a very unexpected and strange one, a true bit of casting against type: His role as Vincent van Gogh in Akira Kurosawa's “Dreams,” one of the great Japanese director's most underrated movies. This roughly 10-minute segment in the anthology film, titled “Crows,” follows a young admirer of the artist who apparently jumps back through time and follows around his idol as they enter landscapes directly recreating some of van Gogh's most famous paintings. Chopin's “Raindrop” prelude plays as they go from painting to painting — kind of living out the fantasy of loving a painting so much you wish you could leap into it and live there for a bit — while Scorsese's van Gogh talks about various things, such as his commitment to his art, which comes through with manic focus and and absolute intensity. He explains why he cut off his left ear: It gave him trouble while he was painting a self-portrait, so he got rid of it.

That absolute commitment to art, that feeling of being a conduit for the divinity of creation, feels like it could be what Scorsese is going for here as Dante's mentor in “In the Hand of Dante.” It'll be exciting to see.

“In the Hand of Dante” will premiere at the 2025 Venice Film Festival.

	As hard as it is to believe, Sonic Youth played their final show 14 years ago this fall, instigated by the breakup of co-founders Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon. In the years since, they've each continued working on many fronts: Gordon was nominated for a Grammy this year for her solo album The Collective, while Moore has made numerous solo albums of his own, started an indie label called Daydream Library Series with wife Eva Prinz, and published a memoir, Sonic Life.


	Late last year, Moore had a brief, surprise onstage reunion with former Sonic Youth bandmates Lee Ranaldo and Steve Shelley at the New York club the Stone, playing an hour of improvised freeform music that harked back to the band's heyday. But Moore continues to move on: He's just taped an interview for Rick Rubin's podcast, and he's working on his first novel — set in early Eighties New York, with what he calls “characters and incidents I certainly felt like I could write about.”


	In news that shouldn't surprise anyone, Moore is also paying tribute to the Velvet Underground. Out today is a newly recorded version of the band's “Temptation Inside Your Heart” (an outtake first released on the VU collection), with Moore joined by his current band (bassist Deb Googe, drummer Jem Doulton, and guitarist James Sedwards) and electronics whiz Jon Leidecker. Hopping on a Zoom from his home in London, Moore talks about that Velvets cover and his own past, present, and rock & roll future.

You're releasing this version of “Temptation Inside Your Heart” pegged to what would have been the late Sterling Morrison's 83rd birthday. What does that milestone represent to you? My wife, Eva, and I published a book, Linger On, a collection of interviews with the Velvet Underground by the Spanish journalist Ignacio Julià [through Moore and Prinz's book company, Ecstatic Peace Library]. It brought me back into thinking a lot about the Velvets. I always felt Sonic Youth was very much an island in the scene. I liked the idea of community, but also felt we kind of stood apart in some ways. And looking at the Velvet Underground, they were such a model for a band that was completely singular and genuine in the world of rock music.

	I always thought Sterling was the most mysterious member of the Velvet Underground, and I wanted to bring attention to his birthday. We know a lot about Lou. We know a lot about Nico. We know a lot about John Cale. Mo Tucker has always had social media presence. They've all told their stories in many ways. But Sterling doesn't get as much ink as everybody else in the group. He never made a solo record. Maybe he passed away too young before he could fathom such a thing.  


	I met him once at the old Knitting Factory [in New York]. He was a very sweet guy. I would have liked to have gotten to know him. Listening to the Velvet Underground records, a lot of them are Lou, certainly, but Sterling's concepts on guitar and his rhythms and melodies move the songs away from the middle ground Lou is establishing as a songwriter. Sterling was the one who brought this really artful rock & roll aesthetic into those Velvet Underground songs.


Of all the songs, what led you to pick “Temptation Inside Your Heart,” an outtake released after the band had broken up?There's a certain beatific joyfulness in that song. It's obviously a bit of a throwaway song happening in the session, with Lou sort of talking through it and asking funny asides and talking to himself back and forth. I don't make those funny asides. But when he sings “I know where the evil lies inside of your heart,” he's singing in such a sweet, crooning way. There's no nihilist energy in the song. The only nihilism is in the lyrics. It's about this shared feeling of insecurity that everybody has in their relationships to each other.


And it has a good riff.It's a driving riff, and then it has that great breakdown with the background vocals. Instead of doing background vocals on my version, I decided to replicate the background vocals on my guitar.

So you're only releasing one song? No B side?We were talking about this the other day. More people are buying streams. The idea of an A side or B side, or even a sequenced album, has become secondary, if not tertiary, to the relationship between the artist and the consumer. You tend to do more business song by song. When I put out my last record, Flow Critical Lucidity, I noticed there were people who purchased the album proper as the way I sequenced it, but more people will cherry-pick it.


Thanks to Spotify and other services, you can literally see which songs are popular and which aren't.Yeah, you can sort of see what's going on. I don't look at that stuff so much. I experience it myself when I'm investigating certain artists and look at their albums online and see which tracks on an album are more popular. It's interesting. Even if it's an album like Nantucket Sleighride by Mountain, you can sort of see that, like, “The Animal Trainer and the Road” is the big seller [laughs]. That's a great song, but that whole album is quite good.  

	











Which Sonic Youth song is the most popular in that regard?I have not looked. That's too frightening for me to even, like, think about. [Ed. Note: Spotify figures show that 1988's “Teen Age Riot” wins with 87 million streams, followed by 2006's “Incinerate” with 60 million, their version of “Superstar” from a 1994 Carpenters tribute album with 58 million, and 1990's “Kool Thing” with 57 million.] 


Speaking of Sonic Youth, how did your live reunion with Ranaldo and Shelley last December come about?That was about as much of a reunion as us having dinner together or something. It was a gig I had at the Stone, and I initially asked Lee to do a guitar duo. We've done this before in different places, and I thought it would be cool to ask Steve to play, because he's in town, and he plays drums. And I thought that would be cool. So that's all it was. But I did realize it would become a bit of a of a story, since Sonic Youth doesn't exist anymore and the fact that three of the five members [of the band's last incarnation] were together on … well, it wasn't even a stage. We were together on the floor of the Stone. We like to play improvised music, and that was just completely free improvisation.


You didn't do any “hits,” for sure.Not at all. It was advertised as just a duo with me and Lee. So when people showed up and then the three of us were there, it became a bit of a buzz. And I understand that.  


Did you feel the weight of any expectations?No. Nobody was. It's a small room. It only holds, like, 60 people or something, and it was already sold out. Nobody had any preconception of what was going on. Nobody showed up there whispering, “What's going to happen?” Afterwards, people started sharing it on social media, and it became a bit of a story, as I understand. I figured that's what would happen.


Kim wasn't there, obviously.She wasn't around [laughs]. I don't think she'd be that interested anyway. But my rapport with Steve and Lee, as far as playing in the context of free improvisation, is already pretty established.


What did it make you miss about the band?  I didn't think about that. I don't, like, miss things. I miss the future. I think about things I really want to do. And as far as music is concerned, reformation doesn't really come into it so much. We had a solid career of 30-plus years, far longer than most bands have had. And the legacy of the recordings stands on its own. I don't feel like there's anything left unsaid as far as what we were doing.

	











The sound of the four, or sometimes five, of you made was unique.Very much so. But we're all kind of long in the tooth now. I don't know if that can ever be recaptured. And I don't like the whole “re” thing, you know, reforming.


Last year, I asked Kim what it would take for her to be interested in a Sonic Youth reunion, and she said, “I don't know. It would never be as good as it was.”[Nods.] I find bands that get back together to be just an exercise. A lot of the time it's less to do with the band and has more to do with the brand. Unless it's the OG members, you know, but even, a lot of the aspects of bands that are so important is their youth. And to replicate that is a little bit like a grandmother in a mini-dress, which I don't want to be. I don't want to see guys in their seventies reform their bands from when they were in their twenties, and they still have the same haircut when they were in their twenties.


The band has regularly been approached about one-shot reunions, right?I get asked every day. We all do. It's a constant thing. I like it because I'm glad we had such an effect and left such a mark. It's almost otherworldly, in a way, because I'm so proud of it, and it's such a big part of my life experience. But it's very encapsulated. It has a great beginning and middle and end.


A pretty dramatic end, actually.[Shrugs.] You know … I think The Eternal was a really fine final statement.  


Can you see you and Kim back onstage together, even just once?I know that's a fantasy. I'm always actually very resistant to such fantasies, in a way.


I'm also wondering what you make of pop artists like Olivia Rodrigo, Sabrina Carpenter, and Chappell Roan headlining festivals like Lollapalooza, which bands like Sonic Youth once did.With rock & roll bands, it's all about the interaction a group has in their kind of family onstage. In some ways, this is the advent of the single pop star surrounded by production, whether it's dancers and lights and films and stage sets. It's become very sort of Disneyfied, in a way, and it caters to mass popularity in a way Disneyland does. It crosses over from the core rock & roll audience that would see Led Zeppelin or Pearl Jam to a concert that welcomes people who aren't that invested in rock music at all, but are invested in entertainment as a broader kind of concept. It has a broader appeal than, say, the standardized rock band. There are still rock bands, but they're not just playing Lollapalooza. They're not the success stories they once were.

	











	I think all of those musicians are completely credible. Olivia Rodrigo and Chappell Roan are great artists. I just went to see Lana Del Rey, and it was kind of amazing. There was a stage set of a farmhouse, and she was walking in and around it and had dancers everywhere, and she was using AI video. It was something to see. I liked it. I like her music, and I like what she's up to aesthetically. But at the same time, my predilection is to hear music in a much more intimate setting. I like seeing the interaction between musicians that's very organic. You know, a musician playing guitar that's plugged into an amp.


	There's still a demographic of young people interested in experimental rock music and anything that comes out of punk culture. It's not Olivia Rodrigo huge. But that was never the intention of being in a band anyway, to be on such a massive scale. To me, it was always cooler to have a modest kind of existence in that respect. The big business of rock & roll was a bit of a conflict for somebody like Kurt [Cobain] to all of a sudden be in a band that was so massive. He dealt with it in his own way, and then he didn't deal with it in his own way.


I don't know if anyone worries about “selling out” anymore the way he did.Yeah, it doesn't really matter anymore. But I would never say that Olivia Rodrigo or Chappell Roan are selling out, because what they're doing is really smart. Chappell Roan's promotion of human rights and the LGBTQ community is massive. That's amazing for her to be able to have that voice, to that many people, or for Olivia Rodrigo to talk about literature on her social media and say put your phones down and start reading a book. It's not just crass entertainment. More power to them. It's not really my kind of music. And I certainly don't strive for that kind of mass acceptance at all. I know it would be great for my pocketbook, but other than that …

Kim achieved a certain level of recognition with a Grammy nomination — the first for anyone in Sonic Youth — for her latest album.It's wonderful. That's nothing but good news. I certainly don't look down my nose at any of that. It's great to be rewarded and to have people recognize you on any level. I would never denigrate that at all. When I would see Johnny Rotten refusing to be in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame by writing an acerbic letter, it's just completely disingenuous. We're on this planet for such a short time. Why don't we just embrace each other and not be so self-righteous?

	











Do you ever wonder if Sonic Youth will get inducted into that Hall of Fame?It's not something I ever think about. I feel like we already exist in the Hall of Fame. Maybe not that one. Is there a Noise Rock Hall of Fame?

You need a good reason to exhume a dead body. Even in capital murder cases, the United States requires both criminal prosecutors and defense counsel to meet a rigorous legal standard when petitioning to disturb a mausoleum or grave.

That same expectation doesn't apply in Hollywood, where the true crime ecosystem continues to needlessly zombify old cases. This fall, TV audiences seem headed for a particularly macabre display when Netflix's “Monster: The Ed Gein Story” (October 4) debuts the same month as Peacock's “Devil in Disguise: John Wayne Gacy” (October 16). 

 










Gein and Gacy — two of the most notorious American serial killers of the 20th century — are remembered for crimes so heinous they already reverberate throughout pop culture. But modern IP laws treat these monolithic boogeymen almost like public property, doing more to protect fictional characters like Mickey Mouse from abuse than the real people who were impacted by these crimes.

A severely disturbed murderer from Wisconsin, Gein had an affinity for mutilation and necrophilia. When his rural house of horrors was discovered by authorities in 1957, future production designers got a laundry list of ideas for grotesque set decorations. Gein's so-called “hobbies” have been reflected on screen in classic genre films from “The Texas Chain Saw Massacre” to “Silence of the Lambs,” and he's even referenced in Christian Bale's best line from “American Psycho.” 

 










“Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?,” quips Bale as Patrick Bateman. The psychotic businessman is setting up a dark joke punctuated by a pretty girl — with her head “on a stick.” 

Also known as the original Killer Clown, Gacy didn't begin his crimes until 15 years after Gein's reign of terror had ended. A mass murderer, rapist, and honest-to-God birthday party clown, Gacy killed more than 30 young men and boys in the 1970s. He hid their remains in the crawlspace of his house in Illinois and remained active for six years. 

Author Stephen King has never explicitly said that Pennywise, the infamous dancing clown of “It,” was inspired by Gacy. But Rob Zombie cited the serial killer as inspiration for the sadistic Captain Spaulding in “House of 1000 Corpses,” “The Devil's Rejects,” and “3 from Hell.”

In 2014, the controversial horror director faced significant backlash for putting on a haunted attraction in Chicago with themed rooms that paid direct homage to Gacy. Speaking with the Chicago Tribune back then, Zombie dismissed concerns that he had been thoughtless to survivors and victims, who lived nearby, and he stood by his assertion that the Gacy rooms were “funny.” Defending himself in the interview, the director pointed out the annual attraction had faced similar criticism before.

 










“They didn't like the Manson one because that was a California issue,” Zombie said. “This is the home of all serial killers — the Midwest. So, they'll hate everything, I guess.”

Since before the days of mummies in Ancient Egypt, human burial sites have been largely seen as sacred. Messing with resting places is taboo for a few reasons. Many religions forbid the desecration of bodies not only to shelter the sanctity of the departed's soul, but to also protect churches from becoming epicenters for posthumous theft. Corpses were further stigmatized by the decline of sanitation in medieval Europe, and they've been associated with disease ever since. 

It seems strange then that Hollywood is so hell-bent on dragging out our worst nightmares time and again — with little regard for their potentially festering consequences.

To be fair, these TV shows aren't out yet, and Peacock and Netflix could surprise us with something new to say about Gein and Gacy. But the ever-increasing pressure to pull in eyeballs can be a real temptation in an industry already marred by exploitation — especially at a time when true crime is making independent content creators serious money for limited investment on social media. 

Before “Monster” decided to tackle the story of Ed Gein, Netflix backed Ryan Murphy on warming over the cannibalistic killings of Jeffrey Dahmer. Later, the “Monster” anthology hit the Beverly Hills double-murder of Jose and Kitty Menendez. Both of those projects were mired in controversy, and the popularity of the latter show directly impacted the brothers' standings in court. Erik and Lyle Menendez were recently denied parole, and while Murphy won't have such a problem with the long-deceased Gein, the implications of entertainment steering the justice system are alarming. 

 










Netflix received criticism several years ago when it cast Zac Efron as lethal lady killer Ted Bundy, seemingly glorifying the convicted murderer and rapist. The streamer is stirring up a similar controversy by selecting former “Sons of Anarchy” star Charlie Hunnam to play Ed Gein. (He's known online as “Hot Ed Gein,” and those are three words I'll admit I'm troublingly eager to repeat to my therapist.)

Meanwhile, at Peacock, “Severance” actor Michael Chernus has already defended his decision to play Gacy. In July, he told Vanity Fair that the project would not venerate the killer or the violence associated with him, noting, “I honestly didn't want this to be ‘Dahmer.'”

Still, the extreme nature of Gein and Gacy's crimes presents a serious challenge to artists proselytizing in uncertain times. The unspeakable drama of these killings is an understandable draw to filmmakers interested in humanity's worst impulses. But now, they must balance responsible docudrama storytelling and their own possible shortcomings in an industry all too comfortable robbing graves.

					By Zac Ntim 

International Reporter


Luca Guadagnino has fast become a legend of the Lido thanks to his prolific output, and he's back at Venice this evening with After The Hunt. 


	The film follows a college professor (Julia Roberts) who finds herself at a personal and professional crossroads when a star pupil (Ayo Edebiri) levels an accusation against one of her colleagues (Andrew Garfield), and a dark secret from her own past threatens to come to light. Guadagnino regular Michael Stuhlbarg and Chloë Sevigny also star along with Lío Mehiel, Thaddea Graham, Will Price, Christine Dye, and Burgess Byrd.

Roberts, Edebiri, and Garfield were all present at this morning's press conference in Venice alongside Guadagnino. The press conference was robust, with several questions about the film's politics and philosophy. There was a particular emphasis on the film's engagement with feminism. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Discussing his intentions, Guadagnino said defiantly, “The idea of the movie is that we are looking at people in their truths. Everyone has their own truths. It's not that one truth is more important than another.” 


	Guadagnino added: “And from the perspective of filmmakers and artists, how do we see the clash of truth, and what is the boundary of these truths together? It's not about making a manifesto to revive old-fashioned values.”


	Roberts was later asked whether she was worried about any controversies the film may conjure up in the wider cultural conversation. She pushed back on the idea. 

	











	“It's such a story to me,” Roberts said. “I remember the first time I saw a film called Tender Mercies. And I just thought there was something magical about the idea that a camera just landed in a place and happened to document what was going on.” 


	Roberts added: “And that's how I feel about this movie. We're not making statements. We are portraying these people in this moment in time, and the camera has fallen from the sky in this particular moment and captures all this.” 


	Elsewhere, Guadagnino was asked about the film's opening credits, which are said to be inspired by the classic font used in the credits of many films directed by Woody Allen. With a smile, Guadagnino joked, “the crass answer would be why not,” when asked why he borrowed from Allen. He then continued to elaborate. 


	“When I started thinking about this movie with my collaborators, we couldn't stop thinking of Crimes and Misdemeanors or Another Woman, or even Hannah and Her Sisters. And there was an infrastructure to the story that felt very linked to the great oeuvre of Woody Allen between 1985 and 1991,” Guadagnino said. 


	“And I've played with that a few times before. I've used that kind of graphic and font a couple of times. It also felt like an interesting nod to thinking of an artist who has been facing some sort of problems with his being. And what is our responsibility in looking at the work of an artist that we love like him? And by the way, that font is a classic.” 


	The After the Hunt screenplay is by Nora Garrett. Producers are Guadagnino, Brian Grazer, Jeb Brody, and Allan Mandelbaum. The DoP was legendary filmmaker Malik Hassan Sayeed.  The movie follows in the wake of ever-busy Italian director Guardagnino's sports romance Challengers, starring Zendaya, Josh O'Connor and Mike Faist, and Queer, starring Daniel Craig.


	After Venice, After the Hunt will open the New York Film Festival. Amazon MGM Studios and Imagine Entertainment's will release the film limited on October 10 before a nationwide release on October 17.


	Venice runs until Sept 6.

	The ongoing She Said, He Said of Blake Lively‘s sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit against It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni today had a sideshow of She Said, She's Lying with Megyn Kelly declaring that she successfully fought off being “targeted” with a subpoena from the Another Simple Favor actress.


	“Yes, she actually tried to get the confidential and proprietary materials my team and I used for any and all stories about her, because Blake Lively was unable to fathom that yours truly had developed a genuine revulsion toward her on my own,” Kelly revealed today.


	However, with what certainly seems like some very distinct blonde hair splitting, Lively's side insists Kelly doth protest too much. “At no point in this litigation has Ms. Lively served a subpoena on Megyn Kelly,” a spokesperson for the Gossip Girl alum told Deadline today. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The apparently straightforward reply (we'll get to that) comes after Kelly let loose on “nitwit” Lively for over 14 minutes this morning on her popular Sirius XM podcast.


	Punctuated by calling Lively “a sad, pathetic, untalented, narcissistic bully,” Kelly's monologue included tips on how freedom of the press works, and laughing off accusations that her critical take on Lively is because she's on the payroll for Baldoni. Lambasting Lively for going after the likes of Perez Hilton (who actually had a good day in court today) and other things, in one of the more understated moments, Kelly called “Queen Blake” simply a “terrible person” – – as you can see in the full segment here:


	Preemptively referring to the client-attorney elephant on the podcast, Kelly also spoke today of her lucrative (a $25 million or so contract payout from NBC in 2019) professional relationship with attorney Bryan Freedman. She stated that despite what Blake Lively's side may have assumed, the media savvy Freedman, a frequent guest on Kelly's show and now Justin Baldoni's lead lawyer, is not “controlling our coverage.”

	











	“This is yet another entitled, nasty, elitist, Hollywood snob who thinks she's untouchable to the point where not, not unlike Meghan and Harry, who have made a career themselves out of suing members of the press who write disparaging things about them, she believes that anyone who does not worship her must be on the payroll of her enemies,” Kelly later extrapolated with a swipe or two at Ryan Reynolds also — as you can see here: 


	While one-time attorney Kelly sought to eviscerate Lively and spent quite a bit of time rehashing the case, the actress' people did the branding equivalent of a shrug. They affirmed this is just how the process works — a.k.a.: Lively has a right to pursue her case as it heads to trial in federal court in New York on March 9, 2026


	“Ms. Lively is continuing to pursue discovery in order to prove her case that Justin Baldoni, Jed Wallace, Melissa Nathan and the Wayfarer Parties' retaliated against her for speaking up against the harassment she and others experienced on set, as alleged in her complaint,” Lively's team added of Kelly's claims with a name check of the Jane the Virgin vet, once self-described “human crisis” navigator Wallace that Lively says was instrumental in the online smearing of her last year, seasoned Crisis PR captain Nathan and Baldoni's exec crew. “Seeking evidence through discovery is a normal part of the litigation process and is in addition to overwhelming amount of evidence already compiled in the form of Melissa Nathan's own text messages, the recently exposed Katie Case email describing Jed Wallace's services, as well as the invoices showing he was paid for those services, and Baldoni's own requests on what he wants his team to do.”


	Now, here's where it all gets a little bit less binary, and where both Kelly and Lively have the truth on their sides.


	From what I hear, Lively's team truly did not subpoena Kelly and The Megyn Kelly Show directly.


	Yet, back in June, they did subpoena Red Seat Ventures, which has provided sales support, production, distribution, and marketing branding and sales services for content creators like Kelly and fellow ex-Foxer Tucker Carlson. Turning into a quagmire, and with other Baldoni-leaning content creators and influencers publicly pushing back against their own subpoenas, that legal fishing expedition of sorts was cut short not long after by Lively's Manatt, Phelps & Phillips and Willkie Farr & Gallagher lawyers.


	In one of those circle of life and media moves, Kelly's former employers at Fox Corp purchased RSV in February.


	Having said that, Lively, who had been at the receiving end of the former Fox News host's shiv to the ribs podcast more than a few times since first filing her claims against Wayfarer Studios co-founder Baldoni with the California Civil Rights department last December, has been scoring up some big legal wins of late.


	In June, Baldoni's $400 million countersuit was tossed out. Earlier this month, Judge Lewis Liman agreed with Lively's lawyers to shut down attempts by Baldoni's lawyer to make parts of her July deposition public. Now, Lively's side are once again seeking sanctions against Freedman for “publicly slandering” their client. This comes as Baldoni, his billionaire Wayfarer backer Steve Sarowitz and others are suing insurance companies to pay what must by now be sprawling legal fees, as other insurance companies sue the IEWU filmmakers over what their policies do and do not cover.

	











	Neither reps for Kelly nor Freedman himself responded to Deadline's request for comment on today's drama. If they do, this post will be updated.

Megyn needs to leave Blake alone. These attacks are so unnecessary. Blake is the victim in this lawsuit!

So, Blake didn't have the nerve to Subpoena Megyn directly. She had to do her usual end run to further her fishing expedition. Got it.

Haha Megyn Kelly is such a loser. Rich, yes. But money can't buy you happiness, and she's obviously miserable.

And she cannot be objective!

Sabrina Carpenter‘s seventh album, Man's Best Friend, is hornier than ever. The much-teased record was released today alongside the scintillating video for its second track, “Tears,” featuring Colman Domingo in drag.


	The video opens with Carpenter, dressed to kill in a pale blue skirt suit and sun hat, waking up on the ground from a car crash with her seemingly dead boyfriend in the driver's seat. She soon stumbles her way toward an incredibly abandoned-looking house in the middle of nowhere and when peeking through the door glimpses a pair of legs wrapped in fishnet stockings. Naturally, the door is suddenly ajar, and Carpenter steps through and is met by Domingo, sporting a cropped pinstripe suit and red lipstick.

	As the camera follows Carpenter through the curious halls and slanted rooms, she's met with a glittering cast of characters and deliciously chaotic surprises around every corner as she sings the chorus: “I get wet at the thought of you/Being a responsible guy/Treating me like you're supposed to do/Tears run down my thighs.” There's even a shimmying dance number with Domingo, because as the Grammy winner declares at the end of the video: “You have to give the people what they want.”

	











	During a Spotify release party for the album, Carpenter said that her creative process behind the new LP was “all about sort of embracing spontaneity, all about embracing impulses that I was having and experiences that I was having that were really urgent to write about.” She continued, “And knowing that if I didn't make this album and have it represent the chapter of my life that it represents, that it would have never been this album. It would have turned into something else, and I think that would have done it as a service to the album.”

The pop star's seventh LP follows one year after breakthrough project Short n' Sweet.

	Manchildren and pearl-clutchers, beware — Sabrina Carpenter‘s new album Man's Best Friend is here.


	On Friday (Aug. 29), the pop star dropped her highly anticipated seventh studio LP, complete with 12 tracks. That includes lead single “Manchild,” which earned Carpenter her second-ever No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in June, and “Tears,” a music video for which dropped at the same time as the album. 


	Produced by Jack Antonoff and released via Island Records, Man's Best Friend arrives just over a year after the Grammy winner's breakout album, Short n' Sweet. Featuring hits “Espresso” and “Please Please Please,” the 2024 project spent four weeks atop the Billboard 200, marking Carpenter's first No. 1 album on the chart.

	











	With Short n' Sweet and now Man's Best Friend, the singer has established herself as a lyrical master of double entendre, oftentimes charging her lyrics with brazenly sexual themes. Though she's received some criticism for that — as well as the racy Man's Best Friend album cover, which features her on all fours as a man grips her hair — Carpenter has stayed true to who she is.

	“The album is not for any pearl clutchers,” Carpenter told Gayle King on CBS Mornings in a clip posted Thursday (Aug. 28). “But I also think that even pearl clutchers can listen to an album like that in their own solitude and find something that makes them smirk and chuckle to themselves.”


	“But I think about being at a concert with, you know, however many young women I see in the front row that are screaming at the top of their lungs with their best friends,” she added at the time. “You can go like, ‘Oh, we can all sigh [in] relief like, ‘This is just fun.' And that's all it has to be.”

	Hours before releasing her latest album, Sabrina Carpenter gave listeners a fair warning: “The album is not for any pearl clutchers.” Today, the pop star officially released her highly anticipated, not-for-prudes seventh studio album, Man's Best Friend.


	The 12-track album opens with the LP's first single, “Manchild,” and concludes with the song “Goodbye.” The music video for the record's second offering, “Tears,” also dropped at midnight. The album features writing and production credits for Carpenter, Amy Allen, Jack Antonoff, and John Ryan across all of the tracks.


	Carpenter caused a hubbub after she shared the album art of her kneeling next to a figure in a suit who's grabbing her hair. She's since released several other versions of the art for vinyl variants and cassettes. “Here is a new alternate cover approved by God,” she joked about one.


	The singer-songwriter celebrated the album's release with a Spotify-hosted fan event at Hollywood Forever Cemetery, where she answered questions about the LP before the Audrey Hepburn film Sabrina played.

	Ahead of the album's release, Carpenter posed for the cover of Rolling Stone and spoke at length about her journey to the new record. Antonoff also told Rolling Stone that he thinks the album is “some of the most honest work I've ever heard.”


	The album, Carpenter explained, “wasn't written from a place of ‘How do I one-up myself?' or ‘How do I re-­create something else?'” About her previous record, Carpenter said, “Short n' Sweet was this magical gift; it fed me, and it fed a lot of other people in the world. It felt true to me, and it felt authentic to a lot of other people. It's rare that those line up ever, let alone more than once. It unlocked my brain to know myself more and more.”

Lady Gaga announced that her new single “The Dead Dance” — set to feature on the wildly popular Netflix show Wednesday — will release on Sept. 3, the same day Part Two of the series drops.


	Reposting a photo of herself on X at Spotify and Netflix's Wednesday Graveyard Gala in New York City on Thursday, Gaga captioned the post, “DO THE DEAD DANCE! Sept 3.” She also confirmed the date when speaking to fans gathered at the event. “I had a wonderful time working on Wednesday Season Two, even just being a small part of the show. I loved working with Tim Burton and Jenna and everyone here, it's so incredible. Thank you,” she told the crowd. “I'm also here to confirm my song ‘The Dead Dance' is coming.”


	While the show's first four episodes released earlier this month, Gaga has yet to appear on the series and fans are hoping she will make her Wednesday debut on the next four installments.

	Gaga previously teased “The Dead Dance” last week during a virtual “meet and greet” event on Roblox, where the star and fans put together Mayhem-themed outfits for a catwalk competition. The musician later confirmed it was her during the “Dress to Impress” event online and posted a photo on X of herself playing the game on her iPad with the caption “In case you were wondering if it was me.”

Bella Ramsey delivered some good news this week for haters angry about various things changed in the TV adaptation of video game series The Last Of Us, which they star in: Those video games continue to exist, despite having also been adapted into an HBO show. “You don't have to watch it,” Ramsey's advice continued. “If you hate it that much, the game exists. You can just play the game again.”

The performer—who could be said to have come up deep in hater territory, having caught initial attention for their well-loved performance in the latter days of Game Of Thrones—was talking on The Awardist podcast about negative opinions about their current show. (Ramsey, who's non-binary, is nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress for The Last Of Us.) Ramsey was asked about comments (both “good and bad”) from fans of the game series, who have been increasingly vocal as the show has rolled into The Last Of Us Part II territory, with thoughts on things like changing the timing of one of the game's big reveals, or the fairly slow burn of its second-season pacing. Ramsey's response was a polite but firm note that they avoid as much of such discourse as they can, and consider the games and the show to be very separate things. “There's nothing I can do about it anyway. The show is out. There's nothing that can be changed or altered. So I'm like, there's not really any point in reading or looking at anything.”

When pushed to give a stronger message to the haters, Ramsey issued the above (and quite chipper) reminder about the games still being right there for you to play, along with an apparently heartfelt note that “If you do want to watch it, hope you enjoy it.”

Ramsey's comments come not long after the slightly surprising news that Neil Druckmann—who wrote most of the story for the video games, and serves as their creative director—would not be involved directly in the creation of the show's third season. The Last Of Us is nominated for most of the major Drama awards at this year's Emmy's, including for Outstanding Writing, Directing, and Series overall.

There's been much talk, in recent months, about the Las Vegas Sphere, and its plans to suck certified Hollywood Classic The Wizard Of Oz into its orbtacular maw. Much of this conversation has, understandably, centered on artificial intelligence, which Sphere Entertainment Company is using in abundance to jam the film into its skyline-filling crystal ball, upscaling the movie's resolution, and filling out its frame to fit the giant orb's oddball proportions. (Director Victor Fleming, forward-looking in many ways, apparently never thought to worry how his 1939 film might fit onto giant, globular public eyesores nearly a century down the line, so there's a lot of space to fill.) But while the debates about artistic intent, the difference between “preservation” and “alteration,” and the sheer money-soaked pointlessness of this whole endeavor will continue to rage for the foreseeable future, hopefully there's at least one thing that both we, and the cinematic dead, would be able to agree on about The Wizard Of Oz: David Zaslav's big dumb face should be artificially inserted into it somewhere.

This is per THR, reporting on press statements from Sphere CEO James Dolan, who revealed a little Easter egg while he was getting ready to debut the project this week. Checking that his listeners were familiar with the Warner Bros. Discovery CEO—a man who never met a piece of art he couldn't try his darndest to turn into a tax break—Dolan, apparently gleeful, told reporters, “I won't tell you where, it's only for like two seconds. [They] replaced the faces of two very short, two-second characters in the movie with mine and David. I challenge you to find it.”

Somewhat hilariously, Dolan then got a very quick chime-in from visual effects specialist Ben Grossmann—who, we'll wager, is at least a bit more tuned in to the furor surrounding this project than his boss—who was swift to clarify that Zaslav and Dolan's faces weren't being slapped atop known actors, and that the characters in question were “uncredited characters who were too blurry to be identified.” (To put it another way, the process required these bodies getting some faces attached to their heads, and Grossman and his team apparently opted for the CEOs'.)

There is, if you squint, a certain poetry to having a guy better known for killing movies than making them getting his face transposed into the Land Of Oz, which is notably ruled by a puffed-up, self-described “humbug” whose only real trick is making himself seem much bigger and more impressive than he actually is. Even so, it remains endlessly weird to imagine some poor extra toiling on a Munchkinland set in the 1930s, blissfully unaware that one day his body would be used so a widely hated Hollywood billionaire could literally force his way into movie history.

The Wizard Of Oz At Sphere opened in Las Vegas on Thursday, August 28.

Happy brides are the prettiest! Selena Gomez is all set to marry Benny Blanco. The singer & ‘Rare Beauty' founder celebrated her epic bachelorette party in Cabo San Lucas over the weekend with a close group of friends.

On August 28th, the bride-to-be shared photos from a sweet pre-wedding getaway before tying the knot with fiancé Benny Blanco.

Gomez was in Cabo San Lucas with a close group of friends over the weekend to celebrate what's turned out to be a bachelorette party. 

The trip comes ahead of her upcoming wedding to fiancé Benny Blanco, and the bride-to-be looked radiant throughout the festivities.

According to Us Weekly, the trip was “a very fun but chill weekend,” a source shared. “These girls have been close to her for over a decade now, so it meant the world to her to celebrate these moments with them.”

On Friday, August 23, Gomez and her friends were photographed aboard a luxury yacht, enjoying the Mexican sunshine. The women danced together, posed for selfies, and shared plenty of laughs as they marked the special occasion. In one candid moment, Gomez was seen sitting on the side of the boat, soaking up the sun and flashing a big smile.

Fans couldn't help but notice how happy and relaxed Gomez appeared during the celebration. Dressed in breezy summer fashion, she looked every bit the glowing bride-to-be. The singer and actress seemed to fully embrace the moment, surrounded by her closest circle as she gears up for married life.

While Gomez enjoyed her getaway in Mexico, Benny Blanco celebrated his bachelor party in Las Vegas with about 20 friends, including rapper Lil Dicky. As per TMZ, the 37-year-old producer stayed in a sky-level villa at Resorts World, perched 65 floors above the Strip. The sprawling 5,500-square-foot space, which averages $25,000 a night, featured luxury amenities and even a personal butler.

Blanco and his group later hit XS Nightclub at Wynn Las Vegas on Saturday night, where Marshmello performed. He posed for a photo with the DJ and partied from a VIP table surrounded by friends.

The Cabo getaway comes as Gomez readies for her upcoming wedding to Blanco, whom she began dating in late 2023. 

While the couple has not shared official details about their nuptials, the celebration in Mexico has sparked speculation that the big day may be nearer than we all thought.

Scientists saw the impossible inside a shielded lab. The U.S. goverment tried to turn it into a weapon. 

IN 1972, AMERICAN ARTIST AND PSYCHIC INGO SWANN altered the magnetic field inside a thickly shielded vacuum container located underground for several seconds—by simply thinking about it. 

As Harold Puthoff, a physicist with the Stanford Research Institute, witnessed the output from his magnetometer changing, he was mind-blown. There was no physical explanation for the reading changing the way it did. And as soon as Puthoff asked Swann to stop thinking about the apparatus, the unexplained changes in the magnetic field abruptly stopped.  

“These phenomena are real. Psychic phenomena are real,” Dean Radin, Ph.D., chief scientist at the California-based nonprofit Institute of Noetic Sciences, tells Popular Mechanics. He's been examining parapsychology, or the study of psychic events, for the past four decades.

And in the early 1970s—in the midst of the Cold War against the Soviet Union—the U.S. government agreed. 

By the time Puthoff and his colleague Russel Targ, another physicist at the Stanford Research Institute (now known as SRI International), presented their results at an international meeting on quantum physics and parapsychology, the CIA had already begun working with SRI to perform top-secret research on paranormal phenomena—primarily “remote viewing” for intelligence collection. Remote viewing refers to a type of extra-sensorial perception that involves using the mind to “see” or manipulate distant objects, people, events, or other information that are hidden from physical view. 

By the mid-1980s, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) took the program over, calling it “Stargate.” DIA had three main goals for its research: 

The program was about as clandestine as it gets. Radin, who served as a visiting scientist on the Stargate program, says security personnel would brief him and his colleagues about the incredible sensitivity of their highly classified work every two weeks, and ask them if they had any reason to believe that anyone outside of the project knew anything about it. 

“You had to become a professional paranoid, essentially. It was very uncomfortable for me,” Radin says.

He remembers asking one of his supervisors what would happen if they had a breakthrough—say, coming up with a drug to make someone super psychic. The response was immediate. “It would disappear and you would never be able to talk about it again,” Radin recalls, “which is antithetical to the whole scientific process, but I also understood why.” Any weapon or intelligence tool developed under Stargate would have presumably been too valuable and too dangerous for public release. 

The DIA continued the project until the mid-1990s, when the CIA began declassifying its documents on remote viewing research to facilitate an external review of the project, and the DIA quickly followed suit. In June 1995, the CIA asked The American Institutes for Research (AIR)—an Arlington, Virginia-based nonprofit tasked with evaluating and providing technical assistance in behavioral and social science research—to conduct an external review of the Stargate program.   

To present a balanced review of the scientific credibility of the program, AIR asked two researchers with opposing perspectives on parapsychology to write the report: Jessica Utts, Ph.D., an accomplished statistician and now professor emerita at the University of California, Irvine, who views parapsychology as a promising science; and Ray Hyman, Ph.D., a renowned psychologist and now professor emeritus at the University of Oregon, who is a noted skeptic and critic of parapsychology. 

“They sent us these boxes full of reports and papers and told us we had one summer to write this report,” Utts tells Popular Mechanics. She and Hyman separately reviewed dozens of Stargate experiments while also taking into account data from the broader scientific community at the time. 

The reviewers' individual conclusions were as expected. Utts found the statistics compelling, and believed the studies provided strong evidence that remote viewing is a human capability. One of the things she found most convincing was that the results seen across studies in different laboratories were all very similar. “And it was all statistically significant,” she says, “so that's really hard to explain by chance, or cheating, or coincidence, or fluke.” 

To that extent, Hyman agreed with Utts, but it wasn't enough to convince him that remote viewing is real. He found what he considered to be potential flaws in the experimental methods, such as using the same person to judge psychic ability in each trial, and determined that the experimental results were not consistent enough with experiments outside the program. Nonetheless, he wrote in the final report: “The case for psychic functioning seems better than it ever has been. The contemporary findings along with the output of the [Stargate] program do seem to indicate that something beyond odd statistical hiccups is taking place.”

Despite what may be viewed as an optimistic review, the Stargate program no longer exists, and as far as we know, the U.S. government hasn't continued such research. “I'm sorry it ended, because I really do think that there's much more to be discovered there,” Utts says. 

But maybe it hasn't ended. Maybe it's just top secret. Only a true psychic would know.

Series finales can be tricky even for shows with the kinds of fanbases who have stuck around through thick and thin, and I would still say that Supernatural's ending is one of the most controversial genre finales of the last ten years. Now, with the stars busy in the 2025 TV schedule and the 20th anniversary of the series premiere approaching, showrunner Andrew Dabb reflected on the storyline that he thinks really might have ruined the series if the writers had gone in that direction.

While fans can always debate whether or not Sam and Dean got happy endings with their reunion in the afterlife at the end of the series finale, I'm guessing many will agree with the showrunner that the scrapped storyline probably wasn't needed at any point in the fifteen seasons. (All fifteen are available streaming with a Netflix subscription now.) Speaking with TV Insider, Andrew Dabb said:

One story line we always talked about, which we never did was basically Sam and Dean go public. They're like, ‘Look, we're putting out a PSA. Monsters are real. If you see something, something shows up in your town, it's a monster. We can't be everywhere. We're just going to get the word out there.'

The Winchester brothers may have had a pretty sizable network of allies by the end, but they definitely never went public with a PSA. I could have imagined it happening in a dream sequence, meta episode, time travel storyline, or even parallel world that no show could pull off quite like Supernatural did, but not in the main canon of the show. And that's saying something, since the main canon of the show once de-aged Dean for an episode and made him a Taylor Swift fan! Dabb went on:

It would've kind of blown up the show in a very odd way. But that was always something I was like, ‘They probably should do that, you know what I mean? Just share some information, share it around.' But again, a little logistically difficult for the show.

Sam and Dean passed plenty of what then seemed like points of no return over the years, but it might have taken an intervention from Chuck/God at his most powerful to make that storyline logistically feasible. The showrunner clarified that the storyline would have been in a finale, and I'd say that would be an even bigger finale cliffhanger than that time Castiel died (again). Andrew Dabb explained why this really would have been going too far:

Suddenly, Sam and Dean are known worldwide, which, again, I think sounds interesting in theory, but I actually think would've destroyed the show. It would not have been any good, which is one of the reasons we didn't do it.

Short of a Supernatural revival, that storyline will likely never be explored for Sam and Dean Winchester. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles weighed in on a revival potentially happening someday, with Padalecki doubling down on the idea of returning for a limited series. Ackles thought that the show might have been R-rated on a streamer, and he could see perks of keeping it "like a broadcast show." Andrew Dabb had his own take, comparing the future of Supernatural to Buffy the Vampire Slayer and The X-Files.

The odds of the Supernatural world returning via a spinoff don't seem great either. The Wayward Sisters series never got off the ground despite featuring some fan-favorite Supernatural characters and getting a backdoor pilot, and The Winchesters only lasted one season. For now, fans can always go back via Netflix and rewatch any of the 300+ episodes of the original series, none of which involve the boys issuing a PSA about monsters.

Elizabeth Klarer wtih a bust of her intergalactic lover, Akon.

As scientists try to make sense of 3I/Atlas - the mysterious object hurtling towards Earth - it's unleashed fears of an alien invasion and brought back to the surface numerous supposed alien abduction cases that have never been disproved.

An American couple, Betty and Barney Hill, went to their deathbeds convinced they were abducted and probed by aliens and had their memories of the 1961 encounter erased.

Closer to home, Elizabeth Klarer of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands even wrote a book about her intergalactic romance with a starship commander who got her pregnant in 1959.

These two alien abduction stories are among dozens that have resurfaced as people ponder whether there could be any truth behind their extraordinary experiences, now that 3I/Atlas - bigger than Mount Everest - hurtles toward Earth in a way scientists describe as "not natural".

This image from NASA shows the fast-moving interstellar object that has got many to wonder about alien encounters that have been reported over the years.

The object is moving at a speed of 209 000 kph, and has no tail, a telltale sign astronomers say distinguishes it from a comet.

It was first picked up by a telescope in Chile and then photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope a few weeks ago.

This visitor is bigger, faster and behaves differently from the two previous visitors to our galaxy -  Oumuamua and Borisov - and is shielded behind the sun as it hurtles in our general direction.

Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University thinks the visitor is unlikely to be a natural object and believes governments around the world should formulate a treaty so they know how to handle a possible hostile alien invasion.

Klarer had no such negative thoughts. For her, it was all about peace, love and understanding - things she tried to convey from her lover from the planet Meton in the Alpha Centauri System, according to earlier reports by "Independent Media".

Klarer, who was a meteorologist, claimed to have had the most intimate encounter with extraterrestrials, writing in her book "Beyond the Light Barrier", published in 1980, that she bore a son with her alien lover, Akon.

Klarer claimed her sightings at what became known as Flying Saucer Hill were witnessed by a Zulu manager, Ladam, as well as her sister, May, on the family farm in Rosetta.

Various articles in the "Sunday Tribune" over the years reported that on April 7, 1956, she visited the hilltop again after further reports from her family that Zulu workers had seen the "lightning bird" appear there again. 

This time, Akon took her aboard his scout ship, a craft some 18 m in diameter, before transporting her to the cigar-shaped mother ship.

During the encounter, kisses were exchanged, and he told Klarer that she was a reincarnated Venusian and a long-lost soulmate. 

He further explained that they occasionally took women from Earth as partners, as the offspring strengthened their race. He also claimed that several Venusians were living among us. She was returned to the hilltop thereafter.

In 1959, Klarer claimed she visited Meton with Akon, orbiting Proxima Centauri, where she gave birth to their son, Ayling, before returning to Earth because the planet's vibrations played havoc with her heart.

Klarer's main thrust throughout her life, and in the pages of her book, she strived to convey a message of peace, love, understanding and environmentalism, which she credited to the superior wisdom of an advanced and immaculately utopian Venusian civilisation.

Klarer often commemorated the April 7 anniversary of her union with Akon by returning to Flying Saucer Hill, sometimes aided by others as she grew frail.

Her interstellar love story inspired a stage production, and Jimmy Neversink even penned a tune on the unexplained affair across the Universe.

When this reporter covered Klarer's funeral in Pietermaritzburg in February 1994, her sisters expressed profound loss, but were also at peace now that her battle against scepticism had come to an end. 

One, however, twirled her index finger about her head, indicating that her youngest sibling may have had a mental health issue.

Betty and Barney Hill claimed they were abducted by aliens in 1961 while returning home from a visit to Niagara Falls.

In the case of the Hills, hypnosis was used to try to make sense of what had happened to the New Hampshire couple on September 19, 1961. 

They were on their way home from a trip to Niagara Falls when they saw a string of bright lights in the sky. The couple claimed that they were rendered unconscious by a group of humanoids who approached them when Barney got out of the family car, armed with his pistol, soon after a craft, measuring 12 meters across, blocked their path.

What they did recall was waking up not far from the car. Betty's smart court shoes had been badly scuffed on the toes, as though she had been dragged there. Both their watches had stopped and never ticked again.

After the troubling incident, Betty drew a star map which closely resembles actual star placements which were only discovered by astronomers a decade later, indicating that their alleged abductors had come from Zeta Reticuli.

Media coverage turned the Hills into celebrities, spawning a 1975 made-for-television film starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons.

Betty's subsequent dreams showed a strong correlation with details Barney shared under hypnosis.

However, in both cases, there was never enough evidence to conclusively prove their abduction story, nor to disprove it as a mere fiction.

   08:12 EDT 29 Aug 2025, updated  11:38 EDT 29 Aug 2025    By JONATHAN CHADWICK, ASSISTANT SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY EDITOR   

It looks like a giant frying pan, or a crash-landed alien spaceship. 

Whatever it is, Google Maps users are getting seriously freaked out after discovering this strange object in Antarctica. 

The round entity, described as a 'UFO', is hiding under what seems to be a cliff about 90 miles from Antarctica's coast.

With no known origin, people are questioning whether this strange relic at the bottom of the Earth is man-made – or something not of this world. 

One American ufologist suggested the object – almost Oreo-like in appearance – might be stuck under the rock. 

Alternatively, it could be deliberately half-hidden – strategically-placed to make it difficult to spot – as it carries out a mysterious assignment. 

Scott C. Waring, who runs the UFO Sightings Daily website, posted a YouTube clip of the sleek disc being found on Google Maps. 

He said: 'The UFO is still there! Too hard to recover or still being used?' 

On Google Maps, the unusual structure can be located simply by entering the coordinates in the search bar – 66°16'24.5"S 100°59'03.5"E. 

As users can see, it is around 45 miles from Mill Island, a domed ice-island 30 miles long and 18 miles wide, close to the Antarctic coast. 

It is also about six miles away from the A. B. Dobrowolski Polar Station, an occasionally active Polish research base. 

Intriguingly, the object seems to have a sliverish line going around the rim, which corresponds with traditional depictions of UFOs from pop culture. 

But otherwise, it has a consistently uniform black colour, which very clearly contrasts with the jagged rock and snow surrounding it. 

Although heavily pixelated, the image also reveals peculiar black lines stretching between the disc-shape and the adjacent rock. 

Philip Mantle, a British UFO researcher, called the disc 'a new one for me', adding that he'd 'never seen it before', but declined to speculate on what it might be.

UFO stands for 'unidentified flying object' and so the term doesn't necessarily describe an object with an extraterrestrial origin. 

Social media commentators have been describing it as a crashed spaceship, a weather balloon or a secret base.  

More realistic suggestions include an unusually symmetrical lake or pond, or some sort of geological formation. 

Alternatively, it could be a bit of equipment related to a nearby Polish polar research station. 

In his post on his UFO Sightings Daily website on Wednesday, Mr Waring said this UFO was discovered about two years ago, but in fact some people spotted it years earlier. 

On Reddit four years ago, someone posted a screenshot with the caption: 'Any thoughts on the UFO “crash” site in Antarctica?' 

The post received several interesting suggestions from users, who variously described the disk as a 'weather balloon', a 'Nazi base' and a 'pond of meltwater'. 

One commentator said: 'If I had to ditch an advanced spacecraft on a populated planet, I would put it down on an unpopulated continent, and wait for rescue', while someone else joked: 'So that's where my giant pancake ended up after I threw it out the window...' 

Another simply posted 'Antarctica got some weird stuff', while another said it 'looks ominous'. 

Professor Bethan Davies, a glaciologist at the University of Newcastle, said that the feature is simply a 'small lake in a rock basin'. 

'There is a small patch of snow and the warmer lake water has a lower albedo so it absorbs more solar radiation,' she told the Daily Mail. 

'This is melting the snow, giving it the semi circular arc – not a UFO.' 

Laura Gerrish, mapping specialist at the British Antarctic Survey, said: 'From the satellite imagery, this round feature looks like a small lake. 

'This area is called the Bunger Hills, which is a largely ice-free region along the Knox Coast in Antarctica - and it has lots of small lakes and ponds. 

'We see that the lakes often form these very smooth edges along the edge of the ice.' 

It's far from the first time that strange features located on Google Maps have gone viral. 

In April, social media users were captivated by a triangular tower stationed at Area 51 in the Nevada desert.

The imposing structure's location led conspiracy theorists to speculate that it is somehow involved in alien contact.

However, there was a rational explanation for the tower – not to do with aliens or global warming as people speculated.

This followed a structure in a mountainous region of New Mexico taking the internet by storm, sparking claims of UFOs.

Meanwhile, a 'doorway' spotted in Antarctica, just southeast of the Japanese-run Showa Station, sparked a similar wave of theories across the internet, with one describing it as 'bigfoot's vacation home'.

The Pentagon has released information on what the most commonly reported UFO looks like. 

Based on clues from reported sightings between 1996 and 2023, the typical UFO has a round shape, usually described as spherical or an orb, with a white or silver colour, often translucent. 

It also has a size of between 3 and 13 feet (1 to 4 metres) and usually travels through the air at a height just below commercial passenger planes. 

Most UFOs (28 per cent) have been sighted at altitudes of around 20,000 feet - just under commercial air traffic.

Around 10 per cent have been reported at just 5,000 feet - around eight times as tall as Seattle's Space Needle and three times as tall as New York's One World Tower.

Meanwhile, 16 per cent have been described as having lights. 

UFO stands for 'unidentified flying object' and so the term doesn't necessarily describe an object with an extraterrestrial origin.

Emma Stone has faced plenty of supernatural experiences through her roles in movies like Spider-Man and Zombieland, but during a recent interview she revealed her belief in otherworldly beings goes beyond the big screen. 

The actor shared her thoughts during an interview at Venice Film Festival, where she spoke to reporters about her latest sci-fi-comedy movie, Bugonia.

The movie follows two men who are obsessed with conspiracies, who become convinced that the CEO of a major company - played by Stone - is actually an alien who wants to destroy Earth.

Looking to bring her down, the men, played by Jesse Plemons and Aidan Delbis, then proceed to kidnap the boss.

Naturally, this plot led some reporters at Venice on to the topic of aliens, and Stone decided to share her thoughts loud and clear.

“Yes, I'm coming out and saying it,” she said “I believe in aliens!”

Stone explained her reasoning, telling the crowd that she'd been inspired by astronomer Carl Sagan, who is known for his research on the possibility of extraterrestrial life.

The La La Land actor said: “One of my favorite people who has ever lived is Carl Sagan and I fell madly in love with his philosophy, science and how brilliant he is."

Stone indicated she shared in Sagan's stance on aliens, pointing out that to believe that our world is the only one with life is pretty big-headed of us.

She said: “He very deeply believed the idea that we're alone in this vast expansive universe - not that we're being watched - is a pretty narcissistic thing.”

One reporter also jokingly asked Stone how she manages to live in the spotlight as a celebrity without 'turning into an alien' herself, to which the 34-year-old took a leaf out of Bugonia's book.

“How do you know I'm not an alien?” she responded.

Stone continued: “I think there's a tricky aspect to that answer that's probably longer than anything that anyone would want to listen to right now. I think everyone sort of deals with that now.

Advert

"We all can relate to that feeling of someone thinking they know you, feeling like you don't have much control of the avatar outside of me. Because there's me, and then there's me, here. There's the person who comes here and then there's the person who I am with my friends and family. They're the same person, but it's what I do to keep myself sane.”

When Taylor Swift announced news of her engagement to NFL star Travis Kelce earlier this week, there was one group in particular that was left devastated. 

'Gaylors', as they have become known in the Swiftie fandom, have speculated for years that the singer secretly likes women - and that her various relationships with men have been a cover-up. 

Over the years, these wild conspiracy theories have suggested that Taylor had romantic relationships with the likes of Glee star Dianna Agron and model Karlie Kloss, insisting that Taylor's close friendships with her female friends have actually been something more. 

The theory first gained traction in 2014 when a grainy picture emerged on social media appearing to show Taylor and Karlie kissing at a 1975 concert. 

However, the Love Story singer has previously confirmed she is 'not part of' the LGBTQ+ community and even appeared to deny the rumours when she released 1989 (Taylor's Version) in 2023. 

As Taylor is known for leaving 'Easter eggs' in her songs and photos, her song lyrics have often been cited in the Gaylor debate (which combines 'gay' and 'Taylor'), with fans claiming her lyrics signify she is lesbian, bisexual - or not straight in some form. 

Since news of Taylor's engagement this week, the Gaylor community has gone into meltdown - but still the rumours have not been quashed, with some even claiming her relationship with Travis is 'PR' to cover up her true identity. 

One person said: 'Oh Christ, happy for her but this is the worst news of my life. Worse than my grandad dying.'   

Taylor Swift fans have long suspected that the singer secretly likes women - although she has denied it. Pictured with Karlie Kloss at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in 2014

Another added: 'I'm speechless and disappointed. All of her sapphic references for what?' 

A third said that Taylor and Travis would be having a 'lavender marriage' (where one or both partners are queer) and are still 'bearding' (a partner used to conceal a person's true sexual identity).

Referring to Taylor's engagement caption, one Gaylor theorist said: 'I mean, TECHNICALLY... she didn't say SHE was getting married. Just that some gym teacher somewhere was marrying an English teacher!

'For all we know, she just wanted an excuse to wear the actual wedding ring she got from her actual WIFE!' 

Hyper-analysing Taylor's engagement photos, showing Travis down on one knee in his garden, one fan even said she was wearing 'black and white stripes... like she's in jail'. 

The Reddit thread r/GaylorSwift, a community which has racked up more than 50,000, has now changed its status to private following news of the engagement.  

A description of the group reads: 'Welcome to the original Gaylor subreddit, reveling in queer & sapphic analysis since 2018! 

'We're a space for thoughtful discussion and examination of Taylor Swift, including queer readings, themes, and motifs in her work and public persona.'

The 'Swiftgron' theory has fuelled speculation that there was once romance between Swift and Glee star Dianna Agron. Pictured in 2014

This week, Taylor announced her engagement to NFL star Travis Kelce (pictured) - but still this has not put the rumours to rest

The 'Gaylor Swift' subreddit community, which has more than 50,000 members, has switched to private this week

Swift has previously been romantically linked to Harry Styles, Conor Kennedy, Jake Gyllenhaal, Lucas Till, Cory Monteith, Joe Jonas, John Mayer, Calvin Harris, Tom Hiddleston Joe Alwyn, Taylor Lautner, and most recently, Travis Kelce, to whom she is now engaged. 

But the Gaylor community maintains that many of these relationships have been the result or a PR strategy, or covering up of her true identity. 

The theory first entered into the mainstream fans speculated they could see Taylor and her former best friend Karlie Kloss kissing in a blurry picture from a 1975 concert in 2014. 

At the time, a spokesperson for the performer was quick to nix the rumor to Gossip Cop, branding it 'hilarious.'

Swift and Kloss' worlds first collided in 2012 when the Mean singer admitted to Vogue that she 'love[s]' Kloss and wanted nothing more than to 'bake cookies with her!'

Kloss got wind of the compliment and tried to get the ball rolling on a future hangout by tweeting out: 'Hey @taylorswift13 love the @voguemagazine cover! Your kitchen or mine? :)'

They were first photographed together in November 2013 when the Grammy Award-winner served as the musical entertainment for that year's Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, which Kloss walked in.

Their friendship continued to grow in 2014 as they embarked on an epic cross-country road trip and enjoyed countless nights out in New York City. The duo even got ready together for the 2014 Met Gala, which they documented on Instagram.











Since news of Taylor's engagement this week, the Gaylor community has gone into meltdown

They were clearly close: Swift revealed to Rolling Stone that Kloss even had her own room in her NYC apartment that was decorated with pictures of the model and included a basket of her favorite Whole Food treats by the bed.

In November 2014, the besties shared an epic runway moment as Swift performed at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show for a second time.

They held hands while making their way down the catwalk and shared several fun moments throughout the televised show.

In 2015, they took their friendship to a whole new level, when they teamed up to pose for a joint Vogue cover in February 2015.

'People had been telling us for years we needed to meet,' said the Pennsylvania native.

'I remember makeup artists and hair people going, 'Doesn't she remind you of Karlie? God, she and Karlie would be best friends. They're the same.'

Kloss also made a cameo in Swift's Bad Blood music video in May 2015, alongside the likes of Gigi Hadid, Martha Hunt, Cara Delevingne and Lily Aldridge.

Since 2017, the pair's friendship appears to have cooled off - as Kloss was spotted in the crowd at Taylor's Eras Tour in 2023, and didn't appear to have been invited into the VIP tent with the singer's closest friends. 

Taylor and Karlie Kloss were best friends for many years, but fans long speculated there was something more between them

The pair would often share pictures of each other on Instagram, but their friendship appeared to cool off from 2017

Kloss got engaged to business man Joshua Kushner in 2018 and they held two wedding ceremonies in the summer of 2019 - both of which Swift failed to attend.

The guest list included the likes of Kloss' manager Scooter Braun - who, at the centre of Taylor's dispute over her Masters recordings, is widely considered to be her nemesis.

Another central 'Gaylor' theory focuses on 'Swiftgron' - the friendship between Taylor and Glee actress Dianna Agron. 

Fans first speculated that Agron, 37, and Swift, 33, were romantically involved when Agron was mentioned on the liner notes for Swift's song 22 from her 2012 album Red. 

Both Swift and Agron were friends around the time Red was released in 2012, with them both sharing photos from Shirley MacLaine's 78th birthday party, where they both dressed up in costume.

They also shared photos from Agron's own circus-themed birthday bash, which Swift said was, 'the most magical night.'

A few years later, Swift gave Agron a shout-out at the 2014 American Music Awards, when she received the Dick Clark Award for Excellence.

Meanwhile Wonderland, from 1989, contains the lyrics 'I fell down the rabbit hole' - which fans claim is a reference to Diana's old Tumblr blog - and 'you flashed your green eyes at me', also claimed to be a reference to the actress. 

To a lesser extent, fans have also theorised about a potential romance between Taylor and English model Lily Donaldson. Pictured together in 2013

When Taylor sings she was 'too in love to think straight', one fan claimed they could see the 'queerness' in her lyrics, adding: 'This is all consistent with a closeted queer relationship.' 

During an appearance on the Jimmy Kimmel show in 2012, Dianna accidentally added fuel to the Gaylor fire. 

As Kimmel enquired about her love life, he made reference to the pop singer when he asked: 'Are you dating her? That would be great.'

To which the actress, who plays Quinn Fabray on the hit show, replied, 'Wouldn't that be juicy?' before turning to the camera, blowing a kiss and purring, 'Hi, Taylor.'

During a wide-ranging interview with Rolling Stone, Agron opened up about the rumors of romantic speculation.

When asked if she was the inspiration for 22, Agron said, 'Me? Oh, if only! That's more because of a friendship than being the inspiration for the song. But I would not be the person to ask about that. I cannot claim that!'

She was also asked about rumors that she was in a romantic relationship with the songstress, responding, 'That is so interesting. I mean there have been many stories about my dating life that have been wildly untrue.'

To a lesser extent, fans have also theorised about a potential romance between Taylor and English model Lily Donaldson, with some believing the song 'Gorgeous' is about her, and speculating that Lily's snake jewellery could be a reference to the Reputation album.

Fans also see Lover, Folklore and Evermore as break-up albums about the relationship.  

In 2014, Swift tweeted a request that as a '25th birthday present from the media' that she would like people to 'stop accusing' her of dating all her friends. 

In 2023, when releasing her 1989 album, she appeared to address the rumours again, writing: 'I swore off dating and decided to focus only on myself, my music, my growth, and my female friendships.

'If I only hung out with my female friends, people couldn't sensationalize or sexualize that right? I would learn later on that people could and people would.' 

The Cats actress explicitly told Vogue in 2019 that she was 'not a part of' LGTBQ+ community, but was passionate about speaking up for the community. 

'I didn't realize until recently that I could advocate for a community that I'm not a part of, she admitted. 'It's hard to know how to do that without being so fearful of making a mistake that you just freeze. 

'Because my mistakes are very loud. When I make a mistake, it echoes through the canyons of the world. It's clickbait, and it's a part of my life story, and it's a part of my career arc.'

Even amid Taylor's outright denials of the rumours, fans have continued to analyse her lyrics for any hidden signal that she may not be straight. 

Fans have also theorised some of Taylor's songs originally had different lyrics. Pictured: Lyrics to The Very First Night; Swifties have highlighted in red the lyrics they believe were originally intended

One song used in Gaylor theories is The Very First Night, released as a vault track on Red (Taylor's Version), released in November 2022. 

The 'vault tracks' were written by Taylor at the time of the album's original release, but did not make the final cut for the album. However, many have since been added to Taylor's re-recorded albums as a thank you to fans for their support. 

In the track, Taylor sings: 'Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture / They don't know how much I miss you.'

However, people have since speculated that the lyrics were originally supposed to read 'I miss her', in order to rhyme with 'picture' from the line before. 

'It was definitely meant to be 'how much I miss her'' one person said on the Reddit forum.

They added: 'It's almost painful to force out that you when it is in a rhyme sequence with 'whisper' and 'picture'. And she doesn't even say 'miss ya'. It's miss you. It isn't natural for her songwriting process.' 

A second added: 'I think it's one of the most brilliant and meta things she's ever written, no one knows how much she misses her because she doesn't actually say it.' 

Others believe Swift swapped a lyric from Reputation track New Years Day from 'I want your midnights' to 'I want her midnights' during a 2019 performance at the Time100 gala. 

Taylor's You Need To Calm Down (pictured) song from 2019 makes multiple references to the LGBTQ community

At the same time, Swift teased an upcoming announcement for April 26 - Lesbian Visibility Day - leading fans to speculate she would be coming out. However, it turned out to be an announcement for the lead single of her album, Lover, called 'ME!' 

When Taylor released You Need To Calm Down in 2019, LGBTQ advocacy group GLAAD saw a spike in donations. 

The song contained multiple references in support of the community, including: 'Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)' and 'control your urges to scream about all the people you hate / Cause shade never made anybody less gay.'

In 2024 the New York Times ran a near 5,000 word opinion piece speculating on Taylor's sexuality, titled Look What We Made Taylor Do. 

Shortly afterwards, an anonymous source described as 'close to the situation' told CNN that the allegations were 'invasive, untrue, and inappropriate'.

The insider told the outlet: 'Because of her massive success, in this moment there is a Taylor-shaped hole in people's ethics.

'This article wouldn't have been allowed to be written about Shawn Mendes or any male artist whose sexuality has been questioned by fans.'

'There seems to be no boundary some journalists won't cross when writing about Taylor, regardless of how invasive, untrue, and inappropriate it is - all under the protective veil of an 'opinion piece'. 

On Tuesday, Taylor announced her engagement to Travis Kelce after a secret proposal earlier this month 

Swift captioned the post: 'Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married'

On Tuesday, Taylor announced her engagement to Travis Kelce after a secret proposal earlier this month. 

The pop icon and the NFL star, both 35, who have been dating for two years, officially revealed their marriage news on Tuesday with a romantic engagement photoshoot showing Kelce proposing in a rose garden.

Swift captioned the post: 'Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.'

The Grammy winner also revealed her mammoth diamond engagement ring in the post - the stunning band is an Old Mine Brilliant Cut and appears to be from Kindred Lubeck at Artifex Fine Jewelry. It is worth an estimated $675,000 to $1 million.

The star shared the post on her Instagram, set to the ballad So High School, which is about her enduring love for Kelce.

The couple went public with their relationship in September 2023 when the singer appeared alongside Kelce's mother, Donna, at a Kansas City Chiefs game.

Since that day their romance has captivated the world, with Swift supporting Kelce's run to two Super Bowls while the NFL star has traveled alongside her around the globe on her wildly successful Eras Tour.

Elizabeth Klarer wtih a bust of her intergalactic lover, Akon.

As scientists try to make sense of 3I/Atlas - the mysterious object hurtling towards Earth - it's unleashed fears of an alien invasion and brought back to the surface numerous supposed alien abduction cases that have never been disproved.

An American couple, Betty and Barney Hill, went to their deathbeds convinced they were abducted and probed by aliens and had their memories of the 1961 encounter erased.

Closer to home, Elizabeth Klarer of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands even wrote a book about her intergalactic romance with a starship commander who got her pregnant in 1959.

These two alien abduction stories are among dozens that have resurfaced as people ponder whether there could be any truth behind their extraordinary experiences, now that 3I/Atlas - bigger than Mount Everest - hurtles toward Earth in a way scientists describe as "not natural".

This image from NASA shows the fast-moving interstellar object that has got many to wonder about alien encounters that have been reported over the years.

The object is moving at a speed of 209 000 kph, and has no tail, a telltale sign astronomers say distinguishes it from a comet.

It was first picked up by a telescope in Chile and then photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope a few weeks ago.

This visitor is bigger, faster and behaves differently from the two previous visitors to our galaxy -  Oumuamua and Borisov - and is shielded behind the sun as it hurtles in our general direction.

Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University thinks the visitor is unlikely to be a natural object and believes governments around the world should formulate a treaty so they know how to handle a possible hostile alien invasion.

Klarer had no such negative thoughts. For her, it was all about peace, love and understanding - things she tried to convey from her lover from the planet Meton in the Alpha Centauri System, according to earlier reports by "Independent Media".

Klarer, who was a meteorologist, claimed to have had the most intimate encounter with extraterrestrials, writing in her book "Beyond the Light Barrier", published in 1980, that she bore a son with her alien lover, Akon.

Klarer claimed her sightings at what became known as Flying Saucer Hill were witnessed by a Zulu manager, Ladam, as well as her sister, May, on the family farm in Rosetta.

Various articles in the "Sunday Tribune" over the years reported that on April 7, 1956, she visited the hilltop again after further reports from her family that Zulu workers had seen the "lightning bird" appear there again. 

This time, Akon took her aboard his scout ship, a craft some 18 m in diameter, before transporting her to the cigar-shaped mother ship.

During the encounter, kisses were exchanged, and he told Klarer that she was a reincarnated Venusian and a long-lost soulmate. 

He further explained that they occasionally took women from Earth as partners, as the offspring strengthened their race. He also claimed that several Venusians were living among us. She was returned to the hilltop thereafter.

In 1959, Klarer claimed she visited Meton with Akon, orbiting Proxima Centauri, where she gave birth to their son, Ayling, before returning to Earth because the planet's vibrations played havoc with her heart.

Klarer's main thrust throughout her life, and in the pages of her book, she strived to convey a message of peace, love, understanding and environmentalism, which she credited to the superior wisdom of an advanced and immaculately utopian Venusian civilisation.

Klarer often commemorated the April 7 anniversary of her union with Akon by returning to Flying Saucer Hill, sometimes aided by others as she grew frail.

Her interstellar love story inspired a stage production, and Jimmy Neversink even penned a tune on the unexplained affair across the Universe.

When this reporter covered Klarer's funeral in Pietermaritzburg in February 1994, her sisters expressed profound loss, but were also at peace now that her battle against scepticism had come to an end. 

One, however, twirled her index finger about her head, indicating that her youngest sibling may have had a mental health issue.

Betty and Barney Hill claimed they were abducted by aliens in 1961 while returning home from a visit to Niagara Falls.

In the case of the Hills, hypnosis was used to try to make sense of what had happened to the New Hampshire couple on September 19, 1961. 

They were on their way home from a trip to Niagara Falls when they saw a string of bright lights in the sky. The couple claimed that they were rendered unconscious by a group of humanoids who approached them when Barney got out of the family car, armed with his pistol, soon after a craft, measuring 12 meters across, blocked their path.

What they did recall was waking up not far from the car. Betty's smart court shoes had been badly scuffed on the toes, as though she had been dragged there. Both their watches had stopped and never ticked again.

After the troubling incident, Betty drew a star map which closely resembles actual star placements which were only discovered by astronomers a decade later, indicating that their alleged abductors had come from Zeta Reticuli.

Media coverage turned the Hills into celebrities, spawning a 1975 made-for-television film starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons.

Betty's subsequent dreams showed a strong correlation with details Barney shared under hypnosis.

However, in both cases, there was never enough evidence to conclusively prove their abduction story, nor to disprove it as a mere fiction.

Chinese scientists successfully test drone which resembles a flying spindle and represents a radical change in aerodynamic design

In 2015, a US Navy F/A-18 pilot flying off the East Coast with the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt encountered something inexplicable: an unidentified flying object shaped like a spindle, hovering above the clouds with no visible means of propulsion.

Encoded as “Gimbal”, the footage – officially declassified in 2021 – ignited global speculation about unidentified aerial phenomena and prompted serious questions about advanced aerospace technology beyond known military capabilities.

Now, nearly a decade later, scientists in China have unveiled and successfully tested a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) drone whose form bears a striking resemblance to that enigmatic object. While still at an experimental stage, this new aircraft represents a radical change in aerodynamic design that could improve endurance, stability and multi-mission versatility in uncrewed flight.

Unlike most drones, this new vehicle's airframe is centred around an elliptical, ringlike wing that integrates a straight central wing section, forming a closed-loop structure.

Four rotors are mounted at junctions between the elliptical wings and vertical stabilisers – serving both as lift generators and structural reinforcements.

At a distant glance, it resembles a flying spindle rather than a conventional fixed-wing or quadcopter drone.
