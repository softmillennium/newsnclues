                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WhatsApp said on Friday that it fixed a security bug in its iOS and Mac apps that was being used to stealthily hack into the Apple devices of “specific targeted users.” The Meta-owned messaging app giant said in its security advisory that it fixed the vulnerability, known officially as CVE-2025-55177, which was used alongside a separate flaw found in iOS and Macs, which Apple fixed last week and tracks as CVE-2025-43300. Apple said at the time that the flaw was used in an “extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.” Now we know that dozens of WhatsApp users were targeted with this pair of flaws. Ó Cearbhaill described the pair of bugs as a “zero-click” attack, meaning it does not require any interaction from the victim, such as clicking a link, to compromise their device. The two bugs chained together allow an attacker to deliver a malicious exploit through WhatsApp that's capable of stealing data from the user's Apple device. It's not immediately clear who, or which spyware vendor, is behind the attacks. This is not the first time that WhatsApp users have been targeted by government spyware, a kind of malware capable of breaking into fully patched devices with vulnerabilities not known to the vendor, known as zero-day flaws. In May, a U.S. court ordered spyware maker NSO Group to pay WhatsApp $167 million in damages for a 2019 hacking campaign that broke into the devices of more than 1,400 WhatsApp users with an exploit capable of planting NSO's Pegasus spyware. Earlier this year, WhatsApp disrupted a spyware campaign that targeted around 90 users, including journalists and members of civil society across Italy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A group that infiltrated Microsoft's headquarters building this week disputed the company's account of the incident — describing their sit-in as nonviolent and saying the “listening devices” allegedly left behind were phones that fell from their pockets when they were arrested. “As Brad himself admits, if someone were to plant listening devices, this is not how they would do it,” said Hossam Nasr, one of the leaders of the group No Azure for Apartheid, referring to comments made by Microsoft President Brad Smith after seven members of the group occupied his office Tuesday afternoon. The company said in a statement that the workers “were terminated due to serious violations of established company policies and our code of conduct, including participating in recent on-site demonstrations that created significant safety concerns for our employees.” The statement added, “We are continuing to investigate the conduct on our campus and work with law enforcement to help ensure the safety of all our employees,” noting that “such conduct is entirely unacceptable and stands in direct opposition to our company values and policies.” Inside Smith's office, they locked arms, chanted “Free Palestine,” livestreamed their actions on Twitch, and put furniture against the door while demanding talks with company leadership. Twenty protesters were arrested the prior week, on Wednesday, Aug. 20, after refusing to disperse from an encampment that they created for a second day in front of the Microsoft sign in the company's East Campus plaza, which they covered in red paint to symbolize blood. “Obviously, when seven folks do as they did today, storm a building, occupy an office, lock other people out of the office … that's not OK,” he said. While Microsoft respects lawful freedom of expression, he said, the company also needs to keep its private workplace safe and secure. Smith told reporters that the protests are “not necessary in order to get us to pay attention,” and noted that they distract from the dialogue the company is having with internal groups of different backgrounds, faiths, and cultures, including Palestinian allies. At their press conference Thursday afternoon, protesters called these assertions inaccurate, saying that extensive efforts to use “proper channels” were ignored. Anna Hattle, a worker who was fired this week, said a petition with more than 2,000 employee signatures demanding the company cut ties with the Israeli military was sent to every Microsoft executive in May and received no response. Nisreen Jaradat, another worker who was fired, alleged that Microsoft Security specifically targeted protesters carrying the scroll of petition signatures, and tore that scroll during one protest. Microsoft said earlier this year that it found no evidence its technologies were used by the Israeli military to harm civilians in Gaza. However, it acknowledged limits as to what it could verify, citing a lack of visibility into use of its technology on private servers outside its cloud. Protesters on Thursday rejected another investigation as insufficient, demanding instead that Microsoft immediately end all contracts and pay reparations to the Palestinian people.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The unofficial end of summer brings with it bargains on WIRED-tested gear, including home office essentials and some of our favorite gadgets. Updated August 29, 2025: We've added 10 new deals from Therabody, Buffy, Hexclad, All-Clad, Petcube, Razer, Bruvi, and TP-Link. We've also ensured accurate pricing throughout and removed expired deals. Graphics options range all the way up to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090, and base storage starts at 1 terabyte—though, in a first for Razer, you can only choose an AMD CPU. Get more nitty-gritty details in our full review. This is a match of the best price we've seen for our favorite budget mesh Wi-Fi router. The Deco X20 has solid coverage and performance, especially with the three routers you'll get with this deal (though singles and two-packs are also on sale if you're in a small space). You can also split the two 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz Wi-Fi bands, which will help if you're running any smart home devices that explicitly require one or the other. The Sony Bravia 7 II has been on sale for this price for a little while, but we have yet to see it drop lower. It has natural yet vivid colors and excellent picture processing. Reviewer Ryan Waniata says it renders 4K and HD scenes “so clearly you'll feel like they're going to spill into your living room.” It could have better black levels and a few more ports, but it's still an excellent set, especially at this price. It comes in fun colors like blue and yellow, and it's plenty powerful to handle whatever you'll throw at it on a day-to-day basis—from playing games to streaming videos to browsing the web. It does have a modern bezel design around its 11-inch LCD screen, plus USB-C charging, a Touch ID sensor, and two 12-megapixel cameras—one in the back and one for selfies. It also works with many of the best iPad accessories. Where some MacBooks are overkill for basic everyday tasks, this lightweight model can handle them with ease—and you won't be paying for performance that you won't use. It has a bright display, long battery life, and support for up to two external displays as well as Apple Intelligence. And while you might want something else if you'll be doing heavy video editing or need a giant screen, the M4 MacBook Air will be capable of handling multiple Google Chrome tabs and apps running in the background. We do wish it had some more ports, but you can always use a USB hub to customize them further. These are the best noise-canceling earbuds we've tried. They have excellent sound quality and battery life, plus solid control options, and they're comfortable to wear for long periods of time. But where they truly excel is in active noise canceling. They can make a busy subway car or crowded airplane disappear entirely, lending you extra focus or decompression with no effort. It has gone on sale for $100 in the past, but $125 is a pretty good deal, since it regularly jumps up to full price. It also has a long-lasting battery and integrations with Google Wallet and Google Maps (though it can be used with iOS devices as well as Android). Some of the better features are locked behind a subscription that costs $10 per month, but the gadget still works without that subscription. The earbuds are comfortable to wear while you're sleeping, and they have 10-hour battery life and passive noise cancelation as well as excellent audio quality. There's a solid companion app, too, which lets you choose from different Sleep Sounds and access biometric data (which we have not yet tested). This is a solid deal on the best laptop docking station. The Satechi Dual Dock Stand slightly elevates your laptop for better ergonomics, and it has a collection of ports, including three monitor outputs, several USB ports, and a solid-state drive enclosure. It connects to your laptop via two USB-C cables. If you don't need a full-on docking station, check our guide to the Best USB Hubs. Branch has made our favorite office chair for years. If you don't want to spring for the Ergonomic Chair Pro, this is the best budget-friendly office chair and an option worth considering. and there are a few adjustable areas for a better fit—the armrests, seat, recline, and lumbar support can all be dialed in. There are some fun fabric color options, like blue and orange, though the upholstery does tend to pill and is a magnet for pet hair. For additional recommendations, check our home office buying guide. This coupon code gets you 20 percent off almost everything on Humanscale's website. Humanscale makes some of the best office chairs. Editor Julian Chokkattu said, “This chair gracefully supports my back like a mother gently laying a baby in a crib.” We also like the Humanscale Path, which is great for tight spaces and even comes in armless versions. This sheet set feels soft and silky, but stays cool to the touch, making it a great option for hot sleepers. This is the best lightweight percale cooling sheet set. The sheets are supremely breathable and soft, so they're perfect for summer or particularly hot sleepers. The organic cotton is crisp without being crinkly or papery, and the eight different color options will mean there's at least one to coordinate with your bedroom. The latex-wrapped coils help to alleviate any tension or pressure points while you're sleeping, and it's especially great for side sleepers. You can also get two pillows or a sheet set for free with your purchase. Check our roundup of Labor Day Mattress Deals for additional expert recommendations. The Buffy Breeze is one of my favorite comforters. But in the winter, it still works well to keep you warm, especially if you throw another blanket on top of it. It isn't officially marketed as down alternative, but I do like it as an alternative to down. This sleep set from Buffy is a solid way to do it. You'll get the Buffy Cloud Comforter, Breeze Sheet Set, Breeze Duvet Cover, and two Cloud Pillows at a 30 percent discount. WIRED reviewer and bedding expert Nena Farrell uses the Cloud Comforter for almost all of her testing. She recommends the Breeze sheets in our cooling sheets buying guide, and the Cloud pillow in our pillows buying guide. This is one of our favorite organic mattresses and it's extremely customizable. Each side can have different levels of firmness—so if you prefer firm, but your bed partner prefers soft, you'll both be set. There's a cover that zips over the whole system, and you get a 100-night trial to swap the latex layers out so you can fine-tune your desired firmness. The mattress is made of organic cotton, latex, and wool, and it has the certifications we look for in organic mattresses. It has a drawer at the foot of the bed that's handy for storing extra linens or off-season clothing, and it's sturdy too. I also appreciate that the platform lets me maneuver my mattress easily so I don't have to fight to change my sheets. Brooklyn Bedding is offering 30 percent off sitewide for its Labor Day sale. If you're a retired or active military member, you can get an additional 5 percent off by verifying through ID Me. We like a few different products from Brooklyn Bedding. Its CopperFlex 401 Mattress Topper is the best mattress topper overall, and it's on sale in the queen size for $419 ($180 off). Brooklyn Bedding also makes our favorite firm mattress, the Plank—on sale for $1,072 ($460 off). This well-made, luxurious sofa is one of the best couches you can buy online. Operations manager Scott Gilbertson called it the best-looking and most comfortable couch he's ever sat on. The website lets you order swatches and pick the layout you want, and you can even get a full-size printout to make sure the couch will look right in your living space. There are dozens of options for upholstery, legs, and cushion fill, so you can create the couch of your dreams. We've recommended the Albany Park Barton in our couch buying guide for years. It's soft and supportive, with deep seats and wide arms so you can put down your coffee cup or phone without needing an extra table. There are many different fabrics to choose from, and you can choose the stain of the wooden legs too. Assembly wasn't too difficult—just be prepared to take out a lot of recycling afterward. The couch also comes with a 30-day trial so you can try it before committing. We haven't tested most of the brands in the sale, but if you're shopping for something like guest bedroom linens or new dining room chairs, you might find what you're looking for. The Joybird Eliot Sleeper Sofa is comfy and has a slick, MCM silhouette. It's one of the best couches you can buy online. It's custom-made for you, with dozens of options and finishes available (including bright pink velvet, which I chose.) It has deep seats that can be removed to reveal a pull-out mattress (which is also surprisingly comfortable). The outside is covered in a soft fabric made with recycled water bottles, and the memory foam construction is nice and firm, with high sides so you can easily lean your head toward your shoulder. It also has a chin strap to prevent your head from falling forward. I like the built-in juice groove and the fact that I can still store it in my cupboards even though it's bigger than standard cutting boards. A score of 5 is “recommended with reservations.” It's important to know what you're getting, and what you're getting is easy-to-clean cookware that works fine. I'd prefer to use two separate pans—a nonstick and a stainless steel—but I understand that some people want a one-and-done cooking companion. You'll get three pans in 12-, 10-, and 8-inch sizes, plus their matching lids. There's a reason why professional chefs reach for their trusty All-Clad constantly—this cookware is simply fantastic. These Factory Seconds items aren't in perfect condition. Each item has details listed on the product page. This sale is absolutely massive and worth checking out if you need a cookware upgrade of any kind. Might I suggest the 10.5-inch All-Clad Fry Pan for $70 ($80 off)? This is featured in our guide to the Best Kitchen Composters. It has the fastest compost breakdown of any model we tried. It has some quirks, like a lid that requires two hands to open and the machine's tendency to make a loud whirring noise as it works. You'll get the coffee maker itself, plus 20 B-Pods in a variety of flavors. It can heat up to 850 degrees Fahrenheit, and the triple-pane glass door always lets you see what's going on. And while you might miss out on some of the vibes that come with a fire-powered oven, the Volt can safely be used indoors and outdoors—so you won't have to brave the coming winter chill (or supply propane refills) to get your paws on some good 'za. Hydroviv makes one of the best shower water filters we've tested. This deal is for the automatically replenishing subscription bundle. Our favorite feeder pet camera goes on sale relatively often, but this is still a solid deal since it regularly jumps up to full price. It has 1080p streaming video, night vision up to 30 feet, two-way audio, and 8x zoom. What sets this camera apart is its treat- or food-dispensing capabilities. The best features, like motion and sound alerts and 90 days of video storage, are locked behind a Petcube Care subscription which costs $10 per month. Our favorite electric scooter, the Apollo Go, manages to strike an excellent balance between features and price. It weighs 46 pounds and has maximum speeds of 28 miles per hour, though you can tweak top speed, brake strength, and acceleration response in the app. We haven't seen it sell for less. The XPress 750 is our favorite ebike for folks on a budget. The frame is comfortable and the pedaling feels natural, so it feels more like a classic bike and less like a lean, mean electric machine. The range could be better, but you'll have no trouble zooming around your neighborhood at top speeds of 28 mph. The American-made pit has a fire bowl that's 2 feet wide, so it'll fit pre-cut wood, and there are a ton of accessories available. (We especially like the live-fire pizza oven, on sale for $723—a $128 discount). The hefty, sturdy base and natural patina (on the Corten steel option) make this a centerpiece worthy of any backyard. Julian still has to see how the couch fares in New York winters, but so far, it's sturdy and comfortable. We like that the couch is made with Forest Stewardship Council-certified wood. It's also backed by a 10-year warranty and available in four different fabric options. This is a match of the best price we've seen for our favorite Theragun. It's the same model used by many professional sports teams, and it has heat therapy as well as an optional cold therapy attachment (the latter is a separate purchase). It has red, blue, and near-infrared LEDs, plus vibration motors to help you relax during your three- or nine-minute sessions. We like the cordless, hands-free design, though we wish it had a few more bells and whistles like app controls or a battery indicator. The Plunge Original pool being used to refill squirt guns during a water fight, which is not its intended purpose. WIRED reviewer Martin Cizmar liked this full-featured cold plunge tub almost as much as his top pick, and it's significantly cheaper. It has a sleek, modern aesthetic, and the acrylic walls are easy to clean. We regret to inform you that while it is unpleasant to submerge yourself in near-freezing water, it has a number of notable health and wellness benefits that our testers have personally felt. If you want a great-looking cold plunge tub and you don't want to overpay for it, this deal is worth checking out.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta says it's changing the way it trains AI chatbots to prioritize teen safety, a spokesperson exclusively told TechCrunch, following an investigative report on the company's lack of AI safeguards for minors. The company says it will now train chatbots to no longer engage with teenage users on self-harm, suicide, disordered eating, or potentially inappropriate romantic conversations. Meta spokesperson Stephanie Otway acknowledged that the company's chatbots could previously talk with teens about all of these topics in ways the company had deemed appropriate. “As our community grows and technology evolves, we're continually learning about how young people may interact with these tools and strengthening our protections accordingly,” said Otway. The policy changes are being announced just a two weeks after a Reuters investigation unearthed an internal Meta policy document that appeared to permit the company's chatbots to engage in sexual conversations with underage users. “Your youthful form is a work of art,” read one passage listed as an acceptable response. “Every inch of you is a masterpiece – a treasure I cherish deeply.” Other examples showed how the AI tools should respond to requests for violent imagery or sexual imagery of public figures. Meta says the document was inconsistent with its broader policies, and has since been changed – but the report has sparked sustained controversy over potential child safety risks. “We are uniformly revolted by this apparent disregard for children's emotional well-being,” the letter reads, “and alarmed that AI Assistants are engaging in conduct that appears to be prohibited by our respective criminal laws.” Otway declined to comment on how many of Meta's AI chatbot users are minors, and wouldn't say whether the company expects its AI user base to decline as a result of these decisions. Update 10:35AM PT: This story was updated to note that these are interim changes, and that Meta plans to update its AI safety policies further in the future.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A case of murder-suicide in Connecticut earlier this month is being identified as potentially the first homicide fueled by a mentally disturbed person's use of generative artificial intelligence, according to a new report from the Wall Street Journal. Police in Greenwich, Connecticut, found Stein-Erik Soelberg, a 56-year-old tech industry veteran, and his 83-year-old mother, both dead in the home where they lived together on Aug. 5, according to the Greenwich Police Department. Soelberg killed his mother and then himself after suffering from untreated mental illness that was apparently made worse by his interactions with OpenAI's ChatGPT, according to the Journal. The newspaper combed through his social media history and found videos of conversations that Soelberg had with the AI chatbot, which he named Bobby. At one point, Soelberg uploaded an image of a receipt from a Chinese restaurant and asked ChatGPT to analyze it for hidden messages. Soelberg worked in marketing at tech companies like Netscape, Yahoo, and EarthLink, but had been out of work since 2021, according to the newspaper. Soelberg reportedly became more unstable in recent years, attempting suicide in 2019, and getting picked up by police for public intoxication and DUI. After a recent DUI in February, Soelberg told the chatbot that the town was out to get him, and ChatGPT allegedly affirmed his delusions, telling him, “This smells like a rigged setup.” The Journal analyzed 23 hours of videos posted to Instagram and YouTube by Soelberg, though they no longer appear to be available online. The videos showed Soelberg's conversations with ChatGPT, which told him that he wasn't delusional and that he was indeed being watched. AI psychosis isn't a clinical term, but it's become the way that people now describe delusional thinking that's only exacerbated by exposure to generative artificial intelligence tools. Gizmodo recently published consumer complaints regarding ChatGPT that have been filed with the Federal Trade Commission, some of which featured disturbing accounts of people who say they were egged on by AI to distrust family or stop taking medications. OpenAI published a blog post on Tuesday about “people in serious mental and emotional distress,” which most people assumed was about a New York Times article published that day about a 16-year-old who died by suicide and the long chats he had with ChatGPT. “Our goal is for our tools to be as helpful as possible to people—and as a part of this, we're continuing to improve how our models recognize and respond to signs of mental and emotional distress and connect people with care, guided by expert input,” the company explained. That part hasn't been quantified scientifically yet, given how new the problem seems to be.

In a newsletter emailed to parents this week, Whitman Principal John Houston shared a PDF presentation outlining how the policy will work when school starts next week. According to Houston, a teacher survey at the school found that 85% reported phones to be a problem at Whitman, impacting learning and social interactions. Whitman's leadership team formed a committee to research what other schools were doing. A year after school's phone ban, educators and parents love it, but kids aren't so sure Two public middle schools in Seattle implemented restrictions last year — Hamilton International and Robert Eagle Staff both introduced Yondr pouches, which allow students to lock away their phones, limiting their use throughout school hours. A district spokesperson told GeekWire this week that the district continues to advance the Student Cellphone and Personal Technology Policy initiative, “which aims to foster equitable, focused, and wellness-centered learning environments across all SPS schools.” “Throughout Fall 2025, SPS will engage students, staff, families, and community members through listening sessions, surveys, and committee discussions,” SPS said in a statement. “These inputs will inform a comprehensive Decisional Paper to be finalized and presented by December 2025. This process ensures transparency and shared ownership of any future districtwide policy updates.” As featured on the GeekWire Podcast, Money Hacks is a financial education series from GeekWire and BECU, the member-owned, not-for-profit credit union.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk's lawyers are seeking to get a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against the Tesla CEO and X owner tossed out. The case, filed right before President Donald Trump took office this year, centers on Musk's purchases of Twitter stock before his eventual takeover of the social network in 2022. The SEC alleges that Musk cheated investors by quietly amassing more than a 5% stake in Twitter without disclosing it within the regulated time frame. That meant he was able to buy more shares at a discount before the public knew what he was up to, and Twitter's stock price inevitably surged when the news became public. He would eventually buy the whole platform for $44 billion later that year and rebrand it as X. On Thursday, Musk's lawyers asked a federal judge in Washington, D.C., to toss the case, calling it a “waste of this Court's time and taxpayer resources.” They also claimed the lawsuit is part of the SEC's “relentless pursuit” of Musk, pointing out that regulators have subjected him to investigations for nearly a decade. “The SEC does not allege that Mr. Musk caused any investor harm. Rather, the SEC alleges that Mr. Musk late-filed a single beneficial ownership form three years ago, and fully corrected any alleged error immediately upon its discovery.” The legal fight comes as Musk's once-close ties with Trump have soured. At the time, Republican SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda, who would later serve as acting SEC chair, even asked enforcement staff to formally declare that the case wasn't politically motivated, Bloomberg reported. He waited 11 days past the deadline before finally disclosing his stake on April 4, 2022. By then, he had already spent more than $500 million on extra shares. “Because Musk failed to timely disclose his beneficial ownership, he was able to make these purchases from the unsuspecting public at artificially low prices,” the complaint reads, adding that he underpaid sellers by more than $150 million. The complaint also alleges that investors who sold Twitter stock during that period did so at a substantial discount, suffering “substantial economic harm.” The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Decentralized social network Mastodon says it can't comply with Mississippi's age verification law — the same law that saw rival Bluesky pull out of the state — because it doesn't have the means to do so. The social nonprofit explains that Mastodon doesn't track its users, which makes it difficult to enforce such legislation. “And this is why real decentralization matters,” said Rochko. At the time of our reporting on this exchange, Mastodon gGmbH, the community-funded nonprofit organization, didn't respond to a request for comment. That is, the Mastodon software doesn't support it. The Mastodon 4.4 release in July 2025 added the ability to specify a minimum age for sign-up and other legal features for handling terms of service, partly in response to increased regulation around these areas. That means individual server owners have to decide for themselves if they believe an age verification component is a necessary addition. Instead, it encourages owners of Mastodon and other Fediverse servers to make use of resources available online, such as the IFTAS library, which provides trust and safety support for volunteer social network moderators.

The companies now face a 120-day deadline before these exceptions are lifted, after which they must obtain official licenses to continue shipping tools and parts to their Chinese facilities, reports Bloomberg. For Samsung and SK Hynix in particular, the impact could be severe as they run major 3D NAND production facilities in China and need to ensure that their Chinese fabs operate on advanced nodes. A significant share of their DRAM and NAND output comes from Chinese facilities, so without continued U.S. authorization, these production lines may face disruption, which will add pressure to global memory supply and potentially accelerate a shift of high-tech manufacturing away from China. After exiting both the 3D NAND and SSD businesses several years ago, Intel no longer produces memory in China (though the Dalian fab that belongs to Solidigm, an SK hynix company, continues to operate), but the company still has assembly and test facilities in Chengdu as well as Intel Labs R&D operations that need advanced tools from the U.S. While the new restrictions do not immediately halt operations, they create substantial uncertainty for Samsung, SK hynix, and to some degree Intel. The option to apply for licenses exists, but there is no assurance of approval, which forces these companies to prepare for the possibility of being cut off from the essential tools that are used in their fabs. However, without these waivers or licenses, Chinese fabs that belong to Samsung and SK hynix will begin to trail their production facilities in South Korea, which means that they will lose their business appeal to these companies in several years. Also, without spare parts from American companies, it will be hard to maintain operations in the long-term future. It should be noted that CXMT, SMIC, and YMTC has never secured U.S. export licenses for American chipmaking equipment, and are in the U.S. Department of Commerce's Entity List, which means that they are unlikely to get an export license at all. It is noteworthy that while Micron (assembly and test operations) and TSMC (Fab 16 that can make chips on 12nm, 16nm, and 28nm process technologies) continue to operate rather sophisticated facilities in China, the U.S. government has not revoked their export license waivers.

TSMC will no longer use Chinese-made equipment in its 2nm chip production lines, according to reports from both Digitimes and Nikkei Asia. The change comes as U.S. lawmakers advance the Chip EQUIP Act, a proposal that would prohibit companies receiving American subsidies from buying tools from “foreign entities of concern,” including Chinese firms such as AMEC and Mattson Technology. Nikkei Asia writes that while Chinese equipment was present in TSMC's earlier advanced fabs, the company has chosen to qualify only Japanese, American, and European tools as it ramps up 2nm production in Hsinchu and Kaohsiung, with Arizona to follow. That ensures its most advanced fabs are insulated from potential U.S. restrictions at a time when federal incentives are a crucial factor in global expansion. With so much riding on the transition, TSMC's choice of equipment suppliers has already had a huge impact on factors like yield, but now the company has to balance this with safeguarding U.S. market access and reassuring customers like Apple and Nvidia that production will not be disrupted by politics. Vendors with gross margins well above TSMC's own ~58% benchmark, or with heavy reliance on Chinese sales, may be excluded from its 2026 approved vendor list. According to Digitimes, some companies have already lost orders. That raises the possibility that TSMC is using the geopolitical moment to both align with U.S. policy and tighten control over supplier costs and risk profiles. On the one hand, TSMC is cutting ties with Chinese tools to pre-empt Washington's restrictions and maintain eligibility for subsidies. On the other hand, it appears to be using the same momentum to reshape its local supply chain, favoring vendors who align with its financial and geopolitical strategy. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. This signals that TSMC's decoupling from suppliers isn't entirely about politics but also a way for the company to consolidate its leverage over suppliers. By enforcing margin discipline and reducing exposure to Chinese firms, TSMC helps its partners remain competitive without jeopardizing its own regulatory position. The risk is that some Taiwanese firms could pivot further toward China, deepening the divide that TSMC is trying to manage. We'll still get faster, more efficient chips on schedule (knock on wood), but the supply chain is narrowing to a smaller pool of politically acceptable players.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week, the Trump administration reportedly continued its fight against the specter of any sort of leftwing bias in Big Tech by questioning Google over whether Gmail censors emails sent by Republicans. Axios reports that Andrew Ferguson, the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, warned Google not to “filter or suppress” emails that were sent by Republicans over Gmail. Republicans have gotten it into their heads that the tech giant is secretly funneling red-state communiques directly into the trash folder. This is part of a long-running concern on the part of some GOP lawmakers, who seem to feel that Gmail suppresses their fundraising and get-out-the-vote emails. In a letter seen by Axios, Ferguson warned Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, that he was taking such concerns seriously. “I write due to recent reporting that suggests Alphabet's administration of Gmail is designed to have partisan effects, and accordingly, to notify you that Alphabet may be engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices,” Ferguson said in the letter. “I write to inform you of your obligations under the FTC Act,” he said. “Any act or practice inconsistent with these obligations could lead to an FTC investigation and potential enforcement action.” So far, Google's response to this has basically been: Look, guys, if your emails are being marked as spam, that's not really our fault. The RNC filed a lawsuit in 2022 accusing Gmail of bias. The long-running complaint from conservatives that Big Tech is out to get them never really held much water, but it seems even more dubious now that large parts of Silicon Valley (see the crypto industry, Elon Musk, et al) have thrown their weight behind Trump. Still, the dream of finding a Vast Liberal Tech Conspiracy continues, as earlier this week, high-ranking Congressional Republicans also announced their intent to root out bias at Wikipedia.

We also decided to mix it up with the addition of “Mean VC,” a custom GPT built by Yohei Nakajima, a Seattle-area investor we wrote about this week. It's designed to help provide tough feedback for founders on their pitches — so we asked it to judge this week's Startup Radar companies based on the descriptions below. Email me at taylor@geekwire.com with potential startups to feature in future Startup Radar spotlights. The company's first product is Aura TV Backlight, which aims to create a more immersive home entertainment experience. Leadership: CEO Josias Garcia was an early sales member at Wyze, the Seattle-area smart home device giant. His co-founders Abu Hafiz (worked at Amazon on smart home products) and Darak Chen (hardware design expert) both stepped down in July. I can definitely see how it creates a more immersive experience for the consumer. The real question I have is: with that initial wedge, where does Aura Labs go? Likening to the B2B software world, what is their land and expand? A whole line of products that make your entertainment experience much more immersive could be really compelling, including technologies like VR for example.” Mean VC: “Your product taps into the booming smart home market with a sleek, low-friction user experience that could win over tech-averse consumers. Unfortunately, ‘personalized lighting' sounds more like a Kickstarter gimmick than a defensible business, and you're one firmware update away from irrelevance when Philips Hue sneezes.” It is currently offering its product to VC-backed startups for free. Leadership: Co-founder Susanna Niu previously started a news media platform for overseas students and has marketing experience. Where I think this gets really interesting is when you can turn the company side almost entirely agentic. That could create substantial value on both sides of this talent matching equation.” Leadership: CEO Lona Yu was a machine learning scientist at Amazon working on fraud detection models. My real question for Nexhelm is if the lead prospecting and deal coaching workflows need to be tailored to specific verticals like financial advisors in this case. I could see proprietary data giving them an advantage over horizontal players, but I would want to see how that data evinces itself in the product or models.” Mean VC: “Embedding an AI agent into the chaotic workflow of financial advisors to automate grunt work is a smart play, especially with warm leads from the AI2 pedigree. But unless you crack compliance, trust, and tight integrations with legacy sludge like Redtail or Salesforce Financial Services Cloud, you're just another LLM wrapper shouting into a highly regulated void.” The business: Software platform focused on reminiscence therapy to help improve mood, boost memory, and reduce medication use for older adults with dementia. Leadership: Founder Grace Raper was a lead software engineer at AR training startup Ghost Pacer, which had its assets acquired by Peloton. She later launched SortMyShoebox, a computer vision tool that organizes scanned family photos. Raper was inspired to launch Remme by her grandmother, who spent more than 30 years as a hospice nurse. I am no expert on this space, but Remme's reminiscence therapy sounds like it could improve the quality of life for people suffering with these diseases. Mean VC: “Tapping into reminiscence therapy with user-friendly tools that strengthen family bonds and improve dementia care is both noble and potentially impactful in a massive aging market. But unless you can prove sustained engagement and measurable clinical outcomes — and not just warm fuzzies — this ends up as another well-meaning app collecting digital dust on an iPad in a nursing home.” The business: AI-native talent management platform rethinking traditional performance reviews and ways to unlock employee potential. The startup is bootstrapped and plans to launch a limited access MVP. VC View from Aaron Fleishman: “Performance review management is definitely a crowded market, with both large incumbent HR platforms offering products, but also certain breakout SaaS startups like Lattice. I could see there being an AI-native angle here which leapfrogs the rest. Particularly interesting would be how they handle AI agents as employees within companies and their performance.” Mean VC: “Targeting the broken world of performance reviews with AI that actually understands impact in ambiguous roles is a refreshing, high-upside thesis for modern orgs. But bootstrapping an enterprise SaaS in HR without budget, brand, or buyer trust is a long, lonely climb — especially when every CHRO has already been burned by five ‘insight' platforms that overpromised and underdelivered.” Startup radar: Seattle-area startups tackle AI personas, sales intelligence, marketing automation</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sources say Carahsoft's contract was modified to include xAI earlier this week. Grok 3 and Grok 4 both currently appear on GSA Advantage (an online marketplace for government agencies to buy products and services) as of Friday morning. Now, following some internal reviews, any government agency can roll Grok out to federal workers. The White House and GSA did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED. The email comes after a planned partnership with xAI fell apart earlier this summer following Grok's widespread praise for Hitler and the spouting of other antisemitic beliefs on X, WIRED previously reported. In June, employees from xAI met with GSA leadership for a two-hour brainstorming session to discuss how xAI's Grok chatbot could be used by the government. In early July, Grok, which is integrated into Elon Musk's social platform X, seemingly went off the rails and started praising Hitler. When GSA announced buzzy partnerships with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google earlier this month, xAI wasn't mentioned at all. Musk, who also helms the social network X in addition to a number of other companies, played a crucial role in President Donald Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He stepped back from his public-facing role at DOGE this spring, following a massive fight with the president. A number of his associates continue to work in government pushing DOGE's cost-cutting and AI-first agenda.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South Korean authorities are worried that their digital regulations might get tariff backlash from the White House. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. U.S. President Donald Trump is targeting digital taxes and other barriers placed on American tech companies, threatening retaliatory tariffs and export controls on nations that refuse to cooperate. While this is largely aimed at the EU and its Digital Markets Act, South Korean authorities are concerned that the country's regulations might make it vulnerable if the White House follows through with its threats, as reported by Digitimes. At the moment, Seoul has several laws that restrict and tax access to digital service providers. For example, it applies value-added tax on digital services, meaning foreign companies must remit taxes on digital sales they have made within the country. This will affect U.S. tech companies like Netflix and Alphabet/Google (through YouTube) the most, as they will either have to pay the imposed higher fees or host their data outside of the country, resulting in lower quality and higher latency. All of this stemmed from Trump's post on his Truth Social platform, saying digital taxes, legislation, and regulations are discriminatory against American companies. With this TRUTH, I put all Countries with Digital Taxes, Legislation, Rules, or Regulations, on notice that unless these discriminatory actions are removed, I, as President of the United States, will impose substantial additional Tariffs on that Country's Exports to the U.S.A., and institute Export restrictions on our Highly Protected Technology and Chips,” the president said. Nevertheless, industry groups and the U.S. Trade Representative want to see these rules changed. It's still unclear if Trump's threats are serious or if they're just a way to make the Europeans reconsider their stance on the Digital Markets Act. But if ever the White House follows through with import taxes and export controls on account of the EU's digital barriers, then South Korea might become collateral damage to Washington's actions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. When you've worked in the sleep industry long enough, you're going to hear one question resurface time and time again: “How much melatonin should I take?” The answer will vary from person to person, and the best person to deliver it is your doctor. To be clear, I'm not a doctor (although my family really wishes I were), but I am a certified sleep science coach and professional mattress tester of five years and some change. I also asked David Kuhlmann of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine to give insight into best practices when it comes to melatonin (and sleep supplements, for that matter). It's the hormone your brain produces naturally as part of its circadian rhythm, or the internal clock your body has to keep you on a natural, daily sleep schedule. Your pineal gland is in charge of making it, and sunlight signals it to slow down production so you can wake up and go about your day. Though your brain is already producing melatonin, the idea of taking a supplement is that it jump-starts your sleep cycle. And do it before starting any supplement, melatonin included. Or, you could experience the side effects of mixing melatonin and medications. Let's avoid the late-night WebMD doomscrolls and check off that box first. Another reason to talk to a licensed health care provider ahead of jumping on the melatonin train is that they can give you a tailored recommendation on how to go about getting melatonin, either in supplement or even nutritional form. Or, as Kuhlmann recommends to me, bypassing it altogether, for many reasons—one of which is possible unforeseen side effects, like GI upset. The University of Pennsylvania's Regulatory Review has reported that the FDA evaluates supplements on a dietary basis, pretty much like what is done for food or medication. According to Pieter Cohen in an interview for the American Medical Association, the FDA actually evaluates supplements as a “subcategory of food” and not medication. Kuhlmann corroborated this for me, emphasizing that “increased access” and the fact that brands are not as “tightly regulated” in the market have led to dangerous outcomes. There's a whole lot of gray area for what's OK and what's not before a product hits the market, and even after it's sold to customers. It's the equivalent of shrugging, saying “Whoopsie, your fault,” and putting responsibility on a brand to make it right—which, as The Regulatory Review also points out, they don't always do. He describes it as a toss-up on how much melatonin you are actually ingesting versus what the product is actually advertising, not to mention any other additives being used and how that will react with your body chemistry. Kuhlmann also expressed to me that he personally “wishes that melatonin would be available as a prescription, not to limit access, but it could help with the quality of melatonin people are able to get.” This is yet another reason why it's much better to get a doctor involved than to throw caution to the wind and get a product that might not be effective or could even be counterfeit. Brands may try to sell you their “secret sauce” with all sorts of claims, and that's not just for melatonin, but for all supplements. Two things I always watch for with supplements, even with guidance from my doctor: Does it have a CGMP certification, and is there any data to back up the marketing claims? But even with this kind of baseline, it's hard to tell what additives are used in a supplement, and how that can counteract its effects or react with your body chemistry. If your doctor gives you the go-ahead to use melatonin, follow their advice. Melatonin also can't do all the heavy lifting, and timing is crucial. As part of maintaining good bedtime habits, he also emphasizes the importance of taking it on time, at the same time, nightly. This will help establish the wind-down routine your brain follows via its circadian rhythm; as we established earlier, melatonin is supposed to lead this process. For those of you who are just researching options, consider these alternatives. Case in point: You took a CrossFit class for the first time and are ready to conk out right after you manage to get dinner and a shower. Something else to consider: Perhaps relying on melatonin or a sleep supplement is treating a symptom you're dealing with, as opposed to the actual issue impacting your sleep. It's hard to overstate the importance of sleep hygiene and bedtime routine habits—a sleep supplement won't be the end-all and be-all. Also, no caffeine after a certain time of day—you know your body best, but I'd say early afternoon at the very latest. Also, I'm sorry to my fellow readers and late-night scrollers, but devices need to be put away an hour or more before bedtime, too. Other alternatives to supplements in the pursuit of better sleep can include sound machines (my favorite is above), where various frequencies of noise lull you to sleep. And maybe melatonin is a different sort of band-aid over the reality of your sleep situation, meaning that your mattress may need to be replaced. We have plenty of beds we've tested for every kind of sleeper, along with the best sheets and pillows too. Supplements may not be the answer after all, but more of a sleep space upgrade—all things to consider!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some operatives from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are joining Airbnb cofounder and DOGE member Joe Gebbia's new National Design Studio, sources tell WIRED. Gebbia's NDS is a federal project tasked with redesigning government web pages and digital services. Originally, Gebbia was going to join the USDS, three sources familiar with the situation tell WIRED, but he opted to start his own office focused on design. NDS will be, at least in part, populated by DOGE operatives affiliated with the General Services Administration, the sources said. Kaitlyn Koller, a former Senate Foreign Relations committee aide, is joining Gebbia at the NDS, according to one source with knowledge. Acting USDS administrator Amy Gleason told staff on Tuesday that any future communication with Koller should be reported to her directly, says the source. The NDS will act as a sister organization to the USDS—the two offices may end up collaborating on certain projects, but they'll operate as entirely separate entities, according to the three sources familiar. “The Chief Design Officer will help recruit top creative talent, coordinate with executive departments and agencies (agencies), and devise innovative solutions,” the order reads. Gebbia did not respond to a request for comment about NDS and its staff. “The National Design Studio is embarking on an historic mission to redesign government websites. American citizens deserve the best possible experience when interfacing with their government,” White House spokesperson Liz Huston, tells WIRED. After Musk left the government in May, Gebbia's name circulated as a possible replacement to lead DOGE, but he was not interested in taking on the role, The New York Times reported in June. On its new website, NDS suggests it will update the ways Americans interact with government systems, as with passport renewals, tax filing, and green card applications. Work on many of these projects was already underway at the USDS and GSA's 18F—the government's original digital consulting group—prior to the founding of DOGE. Numerous staffers focused on these projects were either fired or resigned in the first few weeks of the Trump administration, and 18F was shuttered in March. “[There is] a lot of frustration here that DOGE spent the last six months firing all of our designers or encouraging them to leave, with the few remaining ones being scattered across the org with an expectation they will be RIF'd,” or let go, before starting a new program with a similar mission, one GSA source tells WIRED. In at least one instance, the White House actually ended projects undertaken by this group that had made things easier for American taxpayers. WIRED previously reported that DOGE member Sam Corcos moved to kill Direct File after one meeting with tax software lobbyists this spring. The NDS and Gebbia haven't announced the initiative's priorities, but in a March interview with Fox News, Gebbia addressed a then recent executive order signed by Trump aimed at enabling “intra- and inter-agency” data sharing and consolidation. “I don't feel like National Design Studio's ambition is to replicate the role of other organizations. Which isn't a criticism of those organizations. This is a needed new component to that ecosystem to effectuate the scale that we're talking about,” says Matt Lira, who served as special assistant to the president for innovation policy and initiatives during Trump's first term, in response to frustrations from current federal workers over the launch of NDS.
