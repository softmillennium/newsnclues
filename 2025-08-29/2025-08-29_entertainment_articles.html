There are many fewer movies about people who violently refuse to even consider that idea — people who would rather kill someone else than become someone else. Some American investors have bought a piece of the business, and with it the right to restructure things as they see fit. Related Stories André Holland on the Legacy of ‘Moonlight,' ‘The Knick' Season 3, and His New York Rom-Dram ‘Love, Brooklyn' Sales So Far Out of Venice, TIFF, and Telluride: Amazon MGM Lands Paul McCartney Doc ‘Man on the Run,' Nat Geo Buys Werner Herzog's ‘Ghost Elephants' “I've got it all,” he sighs over the grill as he barbecues for his smiling wife Miri (Son Yejin) and their two children on the lawn of the brutalist manse he bought as a monument to his success. “Off with your head” is a common refrain in Korea when someone gets fired, and Man-su truly reacts to the loss of his job as if it were an execution. He struggles to find another gig in the rapidly contracting paper industry (and to wave away dark thoughts about his dutiful wife fucking her tennis instructor), but there's too much competition for the few spots that remain, and he refuses to consider another career path. Man-su's only hope: A position at the ascendant Moon Paper, where he'd work as a subordinate to one of his former underlings. The interview is a disaster, but just as his old company had “no other choice” but to let him go, Man-su conspires to give the Moon Paper executives “no other choice” but to bring him aboard. That doesn't seem like an unreasonable body count for someone who's about to default on his mortgage — someone who's already suffered the indignity of being forced to cancel his family's Netflix account. So Man-su publishes an ad for a fake new company as bait for his competition, and orchestrates a plan to kill his way back to the top. Or to stay in the upper-middle, I should say. Among the more tragic ironies of “No Other Choice” is that Man-su goes to wild extremes just to avoid the horror of falling into a slightly lower tax bracket. But Park's film — despite skewering capitalism with much of the same wit, sadness, and slapstick buffoonery that made Bong Joon Ho's “Parasite” so resonant around the world — is pointedly not about poverty. While Miri can no longer afford to put meat in the noodle soup she makes for dinner, her kids are never at risk of going hungry. This is a story about sustenance of a different sort; it's a “Looney Tunes”-like fable about how capitalism exerts itself by feeding our self-images as it fattens our wallets, and by conflating what we do with who we are to the point that one becomes dependent upon the other. The movie's first life is so much funnier when it happens to other people snicker — a staple of Park's darkly humane sense of humor — comes from the sight of Man-su being stripped naked of a store uniform as he quits a retail job in order to attend his Moon Paper interview. But in focusing on an upwardly mobile striver like Man-su, “No Other Choice” eschews both need and entitlement in order to dramatize the more broadly relatable dilemma of rooting your entire identity in a system that will tear you out of the soil without a second thought. Immaculately spacious for a story this unsubtle, Park's film toys with the idea that capitalism is an engine for moral impunity — that it's a universally accepted excuse for the kind of thoughtless cruelties that would seem beyond reproach in any other context. And even though we understand the general outline of Man-su's plan from the start, it's so riveting to watch it play out (and go wrong) because “No Other Choice” sees his murder spree as a natural extension of capitalism, rather than a bizarre aberration from it. The result is the rare film that feels sympathetic toward its protagonist without ever rooting for him, and Lee's elastic performance as Man-su — clumsy, pathetic, cucked by osmosis, and still only a hair worse than we are — is key to the balancing act of Park's tragicomic tone. Easy to roll your eyes at from the opening scene and increasingly pigheaded in all of the ones that follow, Man-su starts off a long way from likable and tumbles much lower in our estimation from there. But the high-wire nature of the movie's plot requires us to appreciate the credibility of Man-su's conviction without necessarily sharing it ourselves (there's a terrific scene where an oblivious Man-su lectures one of the men he wants to kill with all of the same perspective we've been screaming at him in our heads), and no one on Earth can match Park's signature ability to make characters more endearing as they stumble toward the void. Imagine Wes Anderson collaborating with Joaquin Phoenix and you'll have a vague idea of the tension inherent to Park Chan-wook building a movie around a guy like Man-su, who plots like the villain from “Oldboy” or the heroine of “Lady Vengeance” but executes with all the grace of Wile E. Coyote. A bottomless wellspring of physical comedy, Man-su is so bad at killing people that it eventually starts to seem as if he might be the only person who doesn't survive this movie. “No Other Choice” is unmistakably still a Park Chan-wook project on its face (I lost count of all the diabolical match cuts, devious transitions, and delirious zooms that he sets to another string and harpsichord masterpiece from his long-time composer Cho Young-wuk), but it's meant to exist in a workaday register, and feels naturalistic even compared to the relatively, and I stress relatively, stripped down romanticism of “Decision to Leave.” Not only does that rawer approach offer a metatextual twist on the tension that's pulling Man-su apart at the seams (that between resistance and reinvention), it also creates a more immediate tension of its own: that between a delicately arranged movie and a main character so chaotic that you almost can't imagine him doing anything right. It allows “No Other Choice” to be both larger than life and also just a few missed paychecks away from a conceivable reality. Now it's up to his wife Miri, another of Park's indelible female leads, to be the family's last bastion of logic. As Man-su's arc begins to wilt toward the end of the story, the crude violence of his plan gradually overgrown with gardening metaphors and magical thinking, Miri's presence becomes stronger to balance things out. Although “No Other Choice” lacks the emotional gutpunch of Park's best films (much as its devastatingly ironic final shot leaves a lasting bruise in its own right), Miri becomes a poignant vessel for all of the movie's conflicted feelings about self-worth and survival. It's Miri who makes the hardest choices in a movie where everyone else refuses to accept that they have any choices to make at all. She holds onto the only choice that all of this madness has left her with, and as the world around her surrenders its last measure of agency to the demands of an apathetically efficient future (shoutout to AI! ), Miri's refusal to abandon what's left of her own almost feels like its own fucked up kind of heroic act. Capitalism won't ever care about you, but people will always be full of surprises. “No Other Choice” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Speaking during a Deadline-moderated event at the Venice Film Festival, Ponciroli was asked about the status of the movie and said: “I have turned in a first draft, which was very well received, and I'm on a second draft and I'm about 95% done with that so we're moving in the right direction.” Ponciroli said he wasn't immune to inevitable online misgivings about a sequel to such an adored classic, but said there are few bigger fans of the original than himself and that he would treat it with utmost care. Josh Brolin Explains Why He's Uncertain About A Sequel To 'The Goonies' Potsy Ponciroli Tapped To Pen 'The Goonies' Sequel For Warner Bros “I know there's a lot of ‘do we need a new Goonies',” he said, “but I'm the biggest fan of the original, it's my favourite movie of all time. To me it was a story that never ended so this is the movie I want to see as one of its biggest fans.” A director has yet to be revealed. Ponciroli is in Venice with new Alan Ritchson action-thriller Motor City, having also been at the festival four years ago with feature debut Old Henry. Steven Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Holly Bario will produce for Amblin Entertainment alongside Chris Columbus, with Lauren Shuler Donner exec producing. Released 40 years ago, the original introduced the world to a group of misfit kids — Mikey, Mouth, Data, Chunk, and others — who embark on a treasure hunt to save their homes from foreclosure. A cornerstone of '80s pop culture, the film launched the careers of young actors such as Josh Brolin, Sean Astin, Corey Feldman, Martha Plimpton, and Quan. The idea of a Goonies sequel has been floating around for decades, but despite persistent rumors and interest from fans and some of the original cast, has not yet come to fruition. Ponciroli was revealed as writer by us at the start of the year and that was last we heard. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. It's probably not gonna be great because we'll be comparing it to our childhoods (if you're Gen X), and it'll never live up to THAT nostalgia. It'll make some money but inevitably be seen as a failure. And what will eventually happen is that it taints the original slightly just by diluting the specialness that it had. (Kinda like how Crystal Skull and Dial of Destiny sorta sullied the OG trilogy.) Why can't Hollywood come up with NEW ideas nowadays? I love this original Goonies – it's probably my favorite growing up as a kid. Quit hinging the future of Hollywood on remakes. So long as Joe Pantoliano returns, I'm ok.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This year's August dump of indie films that gathered dust for years hasn't been kind to Sydney Sweeney, one of Hollywood's most in-demand young actresses whose summer of discontent also includes a major backlash over an American Eagle Jeans campaign that even resulted in President Donald Trump giving her a shoutout for being a registered Republican. 'Americana' Director Defends Weak Debut, Says Sydney Sweeney Movie "Got Gobbled Up by the Zeitgeist" It opened in theaters over the Christmas holidays in 2023 on its way to grossing north of $220 million, a sum that even caught Sony executives by surprise. What no one realized was that Sweeney was supposed to have another film hit theaters that year — Americana, a modern-day Western in which she plays a waitress who gets caught up in a scheme to peddle stolen Native American artifacts, and whose troubled brother believes he's the incarnation of Sitting Bull. The obscure indie film, directed by Tony Tost, made its debut in at SXSW in spring of 2023, but couldn't find a U.S. distributor until this year, when Lionsgate Premiere picked up U.S. rights. Insiders claim that Americana did just fine for Lionsgate Premiere, which banks more on home entertainment than theatrical, but even Tost acknowledged that the opening was a disappointment, when he wrote on X Aug. 21 that the film “gobbled up by the zeitgeist.” Like Americana, buyers passed on picking up Eden despite its veteran director and A-list ensemble cast led by Jude Law, Vanessa Kirby, Ana de Armas, Daneil Brühl and Sweeney. Eden, which has a 57 percent critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes, is based on the true story of a tiny group of European settlers who escape to the Galápagos Island following World War I. They also say Sweeney harbors no regrets for the choices she and her team have made. The Paradigm-repped actress has been laying low, however, but won't be able to for much longer. And Sweeney will be in theaters on Christmas Day with Lionsgate's high-profile The Housemaid, a psychological thriller filmmaker Paul Feig that also stars Amanda Seyfried. Given that the movie solely rests on her, rather than an ensemble, it will be a key test. One source close to Christy says Sweeney remains a big star with enormous brand recognition, and that two small indie films tanking hasn't hurt her career. “But outside of doing press in Toronto, she probably needs to stay quiet for a bit.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The chart-topping star has stepped into a mentor role for rising artist Ella Langley, offering support and wisdom at a time when the 26-year-old singer is navigating both big career moments and a brief touring pause for her health. The country superstar recently appeared on “Country Nights with Bev Rainey,” and spoke about her support for the “You Look Like You Love Me” singer. Wilson credited country music legends Miranda Lambert, Reba McEntire, and Wynonna Judd for sharing their “wisdom” with her. In a TikTok clip, which was captioned, “Country queens lift each other up. Lainey's got Ella's back!,” Rainey said, “I was talking to Ella Langley the other day, and she was telling me that she's getting advice from you, just like you were saying about Miranda. But I just think about the wisdom people have passed on to me, I mean folks like Miranda, and Reba, and Wynonna, and like all the ladies that — it's weird, it's like, we have all experienced some of the same things, but it's been completely different times.” And so, it's important for me to, you know, to check in on her, and just be there for her if she needs me.” Langley may need Wilson right now, as she announced on August 11 that she would be taking a break from touring amid health struggles. In an Instagram post, Langley wrote, “I'm so sad to be posting this. I've been fighting sickness and feeling more run down than ever. I've made the hard decision to take a couple of weeks to rest and focus on my health — mind, body, and heart. I want to be fully present for all the moments ahead. Langley joined Morgan Wallen and Riley Green on their 2025 tours. Because of this break from touring, Langley said she would miss shows between August 15 and August 25, and return to the stage in September. While Langley had to take a break from touring, Wilson continues on her 2025 “Whirlwind World Tour.” She began this tour in Zurich, Switzerland, on March 4. She continues to play in numerous cities across North America. The tour comes to an end on November 8 in Orlando, Florida.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fans, friends and family members had grown increasingly concerned about Kelley's well-being since the couple first announced their split on June 10, following 21 years of marriage. According to documents from the Summit County Sheriff's Office obtained by People on August 28, a judge set her bail at $5,000 and required her to “participate in inpatient or outpatient medical, behavior, psychological, or psychiatric treatment.” The outlet later reported that Kelley was released from custody before 4 p.m. After Kelley posted a slew of alarming Instagram Stories and posts on August 26, Us Weekly reported, Scott called police in Summit County, where their family lives, after one of the posts included his phone number. According to the police report obtained by Us Weekly, Scott received over 24 calls and texts from unknown numbers within minutes of Kelley posting his contact information via an Instagram Story in which she referred to him as “dimples.” And a night out!” She then directed “all press inquiries” to his number. According to People, the judge told Kelley that upon her release, she is not to “consume any alcohol or narcotic drug or other controlled substance unless prescribed by a licensed medical practitioner.” In addition to participating in “inpatient or outpatient medical, behavior, psychological, or psychiatric treatment,” per People, Kelley was ordered to “avoid contact with witnesses who may testify regarding the offenses.” Kelley's pretrial release conditions, People reported, also forbid her from posting on social media until another court order lifts that ban. As Kelley navigates the road to recovery, Scott will maintain temporary sole physical custody of their kids — Jackson, 16, Miller, 12, and Lucy, 11. In a revised agreement filed on August 22, according to People, the judge upheld that decision. That decision was upheld in July, per People, giving Kelley “liberal” supervised parenting time if coordinated through proper channels.</p>

Neville had unprecedented access to previously unseen footage and rare archival materials to tell the story of McCartney's transformative post-Beatles era through a uniquely vulnerable lens. The filmmaker, who made 2018's Won't You Be My Neighbor?, a documentary about Fred Rogers, has a long history of music-focused works. He tackled back-up singers with his 2013 film, 20 Feet from Stardom, which won the Academy Award for best documentary as well as a Grammy Award for best music film.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Earlier this week, staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received a message from the higher-ups, vaguely informing them of an “obscene” placard and some “vandalism” on government property. “We received a report of vandalism on Roybal Building 18, where an obscene sign was placed in the window,” the alert reads, per a copy reviewed by Rolling Stone. “We are investigating this incident and want to remind staff that vandalism of any kind will result in disciplinary action.” It was not immediately clear to some recipients of this email what the “obscene” sign was, but multiple former and current government personnel shared with this magazine photos of a highly visible, apparently hand-written “FUCK RFK” sign that sources say appeared recently on that building. As this work week came to a close, former and current CDC staff assured Rolling Stone that the internal rank-and-file animus toward the president, Kennedy, and their allies in the federal government has only intensified in recent days. The Trump administration is currently attempting to remove Monarez, a career microbiologist and infectious disease expert, from her position as head of the CDC. One of her lawyer's told Rolling Stone this week: “When CDC Director Susan Monarez refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts, she chose protecting the public over serving a political agenda. The standoff led to a wave of resignations within the CDC, including Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; Debra Houry, CDC chief medical officer; Daniel Jernigan, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases director; and Jen Layden, director of the CDC Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance and Technology. We've been talking about it for months, and the past few days, it was just escalating,” Houry told reporters at a protest on Thursday. “If one of us retired, it would have been a blip. On Thursday, Kennedy sent an email to staff at the CDC — which was reviewed by Rolling Stone —  in which he announced that Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services Jim O'Neill would serve as acting CDC director. O'Neill is a tech investor with no educational background in health or medicine who has spent the last several years promoting dubious anti-aging treatments and amplifying skepticism about the Covid-19 vaccine. Kennedy wrote that “President Trump and I are aligned on the commonsense vision for the CDC: strengthening the public health infrastructure by returning to its core mission of protecting Americans from communicable diseases by investing in innovation to prevent, detect, and respond to future threats.” All the ‘Saturday Night Live' Cast and Writers Leaving Ahead of Season 51 Hayley Williams Powers Through Grief to Deliver a Solo Masterpiece</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“It happened at Yale” says the opening of Luca Guadagnino's After the Hunt, which seems a little superfluous given that the director plunges us straight into a smug, well-heeled cocktail party for academics, complete with airy, pretentious chatter about the likes of Foucault and Kierkegaard. If that — and a title font that echoes Woody Allen's go-to choice of white Windsor Light Condensed over a black background — sets anti-intellectual alarm bells ringing, then this might not be the film for you. But though its conversations about tenure can be a chore, its presentation of the modern campus as the Somme — in terms of the battleground for progressive politics — does strike a very timely chord. It's also Julia Roberts' best work in a long, long time, a superb feat of casting that genuinely sends shivers and may well bury that old America's Sweetheart image for good. Her chic, killer wardrobe alone does a lot of the talking. She plays Alma Imhoff, a professor of philosophy, and she literally takes her work home with her, inviting staff and students alike to her nightly salons where issues such as collective morality and performative discontent are vigorously debated. A very vocal participant is her close friend and colleague Henrik “Hank” Gibson (Andrew Garfield), who very much shares Alma's views on life in the social media age (“When did offending someone become the pre-eminent cardinal sin?” she wonders aloud). Anyway, after bidding her guests a good night, Alma catches sight of Maggie and Hank leaving together, the latter clearly the worse for wear but in seemingly high spirits. Alma thinks nothing of it, until Maggie — who is gay and lives with her non-binary lover Alex (Lio Mehiel) — comes to her apartment, with a story to tell. When Alma confronts him, Hank denies this and becomes defensive, echoing a guest's assertion the night before — “The common enemy has been chosen, and it is the straight, white, cis man” — by painting himself the victim of Maggie's prim, over-sensitive boundary issues in what he calls “this shallow cultural moment”. — it becomes an almost Brechtian challenge for Alma, who is torn along so many lines, primarily wanting to defend her friend but also maintain her professional composure and intellectual rigor. Needless to say, the shadow of David Mamet's notorious 1992 play Oleanna is everywhere, but Guadagnino — working from a script by Nora Garrett — gives his story a more generously female-weighted sense of balance. The excesses of political correctness — and in particular the perverse right asserted by left-wing youth to stifle anything they don't agree with — gets a very firm and sometimes wickedly funny drubbing, especially when Alma is at the end of her tether with Maggie. (Indeed, there's a very entertaining gag about embattled British rock star Morrissey.) But though it bites, After the Hunt isn't just a diatribe about “woke” culture, it's a genuine attempt to look at what's happening now and see where it might take us. Maybe the academic elite deserves to be taken down, with its mealy mouthed hypothesizing and bourgeois fetishization of education as something somehow “better” than knowledge. It won't be a watercooler movie in that respect, and it may be a shock to unwary audiences lured in by Roberts's star wattage. But it could mark another milestone for the actress, being her strongest role since 2000's Erin Brockovich and an astonishing performance in its very own right.

You know you're in for an encounter with somebody who wants to start shit when the opening frames of Luca Guadagnino's “After the Hunt,” a thriller about a sexual assault scandal that rocks an intellectual community, are styled in the tradition of none other than Woody Allen: white Windsor typeface against a black backdrop, the cast including Julia Roberts and Ayo Edebiri in alphabetical order, and the credits acknowledging said alphabetical order. It's an intriguing provocation from the get-go that Guadagnino would want to announce his new film by calling back to Allen, an artist who has become the poster figure for sexual abuse scandals. That Guadagnino would want to interrogate the rhetoric of how alleged abuse is positioned at all via Allen's signature is a sit-up-in-your-seat creative choice that nearly hijacks the first moments of this Yale-set drama, about a philosophy professor (Roberts) unraveling amidst her student's (Edebiri) accusation of sexual assault against a colleague (Andrew Garfield). But that's unfortunately about as dangerous as the oddly chaste “After the Hunt” gets despite characteristically invigorating direction from the visionary filmmaker behind at least two masterpieces: “Call Me By Your Name” and “Queer,” two heightened immersions into the subjective state of desire, and maybe a third, “Suspiria,” if you're willing to go there. “After the Hunt's” talky, heady unfolding — with a snaking interest in the generational divide between Gen Z youth culture and pre-woke-era Gen Xers — works from a screenplay by first-time feature writer Nora Garrett, who came to Guadagnino's attention early last year. It's an overintellectualized script that reduces its characters to broad stand-ins and mouthpieces for hot topics, bizarrely retrograde, and a few beats behind the times in interrogating both the post-#MeToo context of how assault charges are handled, reacted to, and also in untangling a tricky identity politics inquiry that brushes against race and gender issues. Yale philosophy professor Alma Imhoff (Julia Roberts), like the filmmaker, clearly has a taste for risk, too. Hosting a party chez elle that mixes colleagues and faculty, she nurses a sizable glass of red wine while dressed in a top-to-toe white suit, and it's likely not the first drink this secretly hard-boozing, self-destructive teacher has had today. She greatly admires Alma but has secrets of her own: In that scene-setting party, Maggie absconds to Alma's bathroom, and finds an envelope with a photo of a dashing stranger taped under the sink. (Why Alma would hide this photo here, a relic of a hidden life, in New Haven, where she lives with her husband rather than the pied-à-terre she keeps in the city, suddenly revealed in the third act, is unclear.) In other words, as much as Maggie idolizes her teacher in the way that young people who weren't loved enough as children project parent-like silhouettes onto their mentors, Maggie also might be building a case against Alma. Soon into the movie, a rain-soaked Maggie shows up, dejected and nerve-jangled, to the home Alma shares with her psychotherapist husband Frederik (Michael Stuhlbarg). Meanwhile, her relationship to Hank is thrown out of orbit, as this very clear accusation of rape alienates them from each other, and Hank from his academic milieu, where he likens himself to a wild animal being chased out of the herd. Chloë Sevigny, who madly incarnated the freakiest scene out of Guadagnino's YA cannibal romance “Bones and All” and starred in his HBO series “We Are Who We Are,” has a small role here as student liaison Kim, who keeps the pupils' confidences as well as a blank prescription notepad in her desk, acting as a kind of guidance counselor. My issue with Garrett's unsubtle inquiry into the Gen Z vs. Gen X paradigm is no more sourly demonstrated than in a scene where Kim, throwing back a few drinks with Alma at the local dive Three Sheets, gives an on-the-nose remark on just how anachronistic-for-our-times it is that said college bar is blasting music by controversy-magnet, truther-opinioned Morrissey. Lingering close-ups on one another's hands as they embrace in moments of emotional frankness — and both painted with what seems to be the same nail polish — hint at a relationship that could've been explored with more risk. Guadagnino does bring back his regular scoring collaborators, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, who might have replayed the plunking, doom-harbinging piano refrain of “Eyes Wide Shut” a few too many times during the brainstorming phase. Limiting to the actress's bona fide capabilities, Edebiri's character is treated mostly as a nuisance, a fly to be swatted off, making the racial politics of her position as a queer Black student whose moneyed parents have endowed the university (thereby throwing Maggie's inherent academic worthiness into question) especially unresolved and unplumbed. That Maggie's dissertation — which Hank alleges is plagiarized as he scrambles to gain traction amid his downfall — and field of study is on the resurgence of “virtue ethics” suggests something provocative, more satirical and mischievous up Garrett's sleeve. But it's unclear, and not in a piquantly ambiguous way, what Garrett is trying to say here. The most recent movie “After the Hunt” calls to mind is Todd Field's “Tár,” similarly a cancel-culturally minded story set within academia, and about a female educator abusing her power. That film succeeded so well, in a way that everyone seemed to get without nose-wrinkling, because of its sense of humor about itself. Or when Alma sounds off on Maggie and her partner, asking, “Don't you have some obscure protest to be publicly angry at?” while repeatedly misgendering Mehiel's character. It's more cringe because of its bluntness than intentionally funny and satiristic. Guadagnino is a beautiful director of jolting power and skill, especially in capturing queer yearning and the psychic collisions of people against their station in life. The way he has also stood by “Call Me” star Armie Hammer, all but persona non grata after a surge of upsetting harassment accusations of his own, indicates a subversive artist unafraid to go against the grain. It strives for moral ambiguity, but ends up startingly morally stark, pampering the viewer against discomfort in a final coda that feels taped on, after-the-fact reassurance. It pains me to take down a Luca Guadagnino movie — he is one of the best filmmakers working — but “After the Hunt” isn't enough, its ideas ripped from an earlier time, transposed onto our own with a broad-strokes equivocation about what they want to say.

Deftones first reached Mainstream Rock Airplay in May 1998, via “Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away),” which peaked at No. 1 is the lengthiest in two categories over the Mainstream Rock Airplay chart's 44-year history: longest wait for a group's first leader and the longest by any act in a lead role with a first No. In July, Evanescence rewrote the record for the longest wait by a group, at more than 22 years between “Bring Me to Life” and “Afterlife.” Not only does that record fall, Deftones wrap the longest wait for any act in a lead role thanks to “My Mind Is a Mountain,” exceeding the more than 26 years for Ozzy Osbourne between “Crazy Train” in 1981 and No. Overall, Jeff Beck went a record 37-plus years between his debut, “People Get Ready,” in 1985 and his first No. 1, as featured on Osbourne's “Patient Number 9” in 2022. Worth noting: Deftones' feat comes a week after Yellowcard rewrote the all-time record for the same accomplishment on Alternative Airplay. Concurrently, “My Mind Is a Mountain” bullets at No. 25 on Alternative Airplay, one spot below its best so far. On the all-rock-format, audience-based Rock & Alternative Airplay chart, “My Mind Is a Mountain” jumps 13-7 with 3.1 million audience impressions in the week ending Aug. 28, up 18%, according to Luminate. It's the band's first top 10 (exceeding “Tempest,” which hit No. “My Mind Is a Mountain” appeared at No. In addition to its radio airplay, the song earned 1.3 million official U.S. streams Aug. 15-21. It was released Aug. 22, with its first-week impact to be reflected on the Sept. 6-dated album and song charts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ass-end of August, of course, a notorious cinematic dumping ground for distributors too timid to set their scrappy genre movies loose among the big dogs. Macon Blair's appropriately yucky reimagining of The Toxic Avenger adequately, perhaps heroically, mimics the gore-and-boobs-addled cadence of Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz's discount filmmaking, and that alone puts it head and mop above the summer's heavily curated trough of studio-safe products. A squirrely fusion of tribute and reboot, The Toxic Avenger pits its mutant superhero (voiced by Peter Dinklage, eventually embodied by Luisa Guerreiro) against shitheel corpo-villain Bob (Kevin Bacon in a hilarious Karen wig). Dinklage plays Winston Gooze, a down-on-his-luck janitor working for Bob's BTH Corporation, mopping up nuke-sludge overnight and caring for his emotionally distant stepson Wade (Jacob Tremblay) during the day. When Winston is given a terminal cancer diagnosis (delivered under the head-splitting din of a jackhammer), he begs unscrupulous Bob for help navigating his deliberately labyrinthine insurance policies, an act of humility that sends Winston blundering into the path of Bob's scuzzy underlings—and his gnarly metamorphosis. Toxie's revised origin is but one instance where Blair makes space for emotional resonance that Kaufman's nihilistic 1984 original wouldn't have countenanced, though the films share an undercurrent of vengeful class consciousness—the same maddening awareness that the system can and will fuck with people whenever and however it wants—that elevates Blair's film above its B-movie niche. Tramping around the goofy glass-and-syringe-strewn byways of Tromaville (here rechristened as St. Roma's Village) might limit its broader appeal, but drenched in every form of viscous goop, juiced by a punk/metal soundtrack (with a Dinklage contribution, no less), Blair's film makes a case for relevance through sheer chutzpah. And while this dual act does initially seem loosely stitched together (mostly by dodgy edits to obscure Toxie's mouth movement), Guerreiro and Dinklage find harmony in their mutual commitment to the character. But don't mistake this goodwill for squeamishness on Blair's part. He isn't afraid to tinker with Troma's baser instincts when a situation calls for it, populating his film with a concentration of Kaufman-styled freakazoids and maniacs who, among other grody deeds, occasionally whip out interesting parts of their anatomy just for fun. Blair also smuggles in some pertinent social commentary, to various comic effect: A cop screams “Show me your hands!” as he ventilates a suspect into Swiss cheese; a newscaster quibbles over Toxie's pronouns; and, in the clearest measure of how far we are from the deviant tendencies of '80s schlock, Toxie explicitly states that he is not a pervert, unlike original Toxie Melvin Junko. Self-awareness thrums throughout this new take on The Toxic Avenger. And while this metatext saps some of the film's danger and unpredictability, it makes a canny argument for future installments: The quality of this reboot, its dutiful nods, and its end-credits sequel tease all clear a path for Toxie to explore stranger, grodier frontiers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been said countless times since Liam and Noel Gallagher buried the hatchet last year to launch their rapturously received Oasis Live '25 reunion run, but the formerly quarrelsome siblings who used to make Cain and Abel look like the Kelce brothers have found that special magic again. When the tour finally hit U.S. shores on Thursday night (Aug. 28) at a sold-out Soldier Field in Chicago for one of only five American dates, there was an unmistakable, heart-warming majesty to the display of true brotherhood between the Gallaghers. From their now signature hand-in-hand walk out to subtle nods and hip-check nudges between them, the years of estrangement seemed like an ancient memory, leaving in their place a dedication to playing their most beloved songs as loudly, brashly and tightly as ever. One thing that hasn't changed is singer Liam Gallagher's punkish swagger, as evidenced by the shades that never left his face for the duration of the two-hour, 23-song gig and his playful shout-out to the “drug takers” and “glue sniffers” before “Bring It On Down.” Whereas in years past the band's formerly volatile vocalist might have tossed the occasional tambourine or maraca in frustration — he's now banned from letting any instruments fly for safety reasons, if you can believe it —  the closest he got to maligning one of his instruments in Chicago were the few times he playfully clamped his tambo between his teeth during instrumental passages. From the unending sea of Adidas stripes on track suits, football jerseys and sneakers, to what must have been a Midwest record for the most bucket hats in a single place at once, the crowd came to sing along and hoover up as much merch as possible. And off course they did the turn-around and jump-up-and-down Poznan dance during “Cigarettes & Alcohol,” making the ground shake like a Britpop earthquake. “Everybody said Americans wouldn't do that f–kin' s–t” Liam playfully poked. In the bad old days, Liam would sometimes wander off stage, or sulk on the drum riser during his vocal breaks over some perceived slight or agitation. But what a difference time has made, as 2025 Liam now blows kisses before “Some Might Say” before making the sign of a cross after dipping his fingers in his water bottle to get some holy mojo rolling. He joked about how the band and their diehard fans “invented all this madness” before brother Noel unleashed the primal roar of “Supersonic,” peeling off the gigantic, clear-as-a-bell riffs that had Liam swaggering over after “Roll With It” to give his older brother a friendly hand slap. In keeping with the sibling revelry on display all night, at one point Shultz sauntered over to older brother guitarist Brad Shultz and gave him a sweet brotherly shove after a bit of teasing. For a band that used to be dogged by obvious Beatles comparisons, Thursday's show felt less wedded to Fab formula and more focused on delivering waves of sonic overload and straight-up melodic stadium rock, as when “Live Forever” roped tens of thousands into reaching onto their tiptoes to get high enough for the falsetto “You and I we're gonna live forever” bit. But truth be told, this set was mostly focused on giving the people what they came for, packed in one of the most epic show closers in rock. Noel took lead vocals on 1998's “The Masterplan,” a lesser-known track that got No. 1 hit treatment from the passionate audience, who jumped up and down and pumped their fists with a kind of polite mayhem that never tipped over into loutish behavior. That kind of artistic abdication can sometimes come off as lazy, but in this case there was something heartwarming about letting the enthusiastic crowd carry that weight with joy and high fives all around. His hoodie now up over his head so his face was nearly obscured, Liam returned for a pair of songs that are basically eternal Great Britpop Songbook classics at this point beginning with a majestic “Wonderwall” and ending with an absolutely levitating “Champagne Supernova.” Their songs have, and do, stand the test of time. Their rancorous days seemingly are behind them, they have mastered the art of turning a football stadium into a pub sing-along with 60,000+ of their closest fans. But perhaps most impressive of all, they returned from a potentially career-killing hiatus just as strong, if not stronger than they were, minus the baggage and plus the hard-earned wisdom to trust that the songs are more than enough.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bella Ramsey delivered some good news this week for haters angry about various things changed in the TV adaptation of video game series The Last Of Us, which they star in: Those video games continue to exist, despite having also been adapted into an HBO show. “You don't have to watch it,” Ramsey's advice continued. “If you hate it that much, the game exists. The performer—who could be said to have come up deep in hater territory, having caught initial attention for their well-loved performance in the latter days of Game Of Thrones—was talking on The Awardist podcast about negative opinions about their current show. Ramsey's response was a polite but firm note that they avoid as much of such discourse as they can, and consider the games and the show to be very separate things. So I'm like, there's not really any point in reading or looking at anything.” When pushed to give a stronger message to the haters, Ramsey issued the above (and quite chipper) reminder about the games still being right there for you to play, along with an apparently heartfelt note that “If you do want to watch it, hope you enjoy it.” The Last Of Us is nominated for most of the major Drama awards at this year's Emmy's, including for Outstanding Writing, Directing, and Series overall.
