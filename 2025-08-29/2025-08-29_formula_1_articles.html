                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2025 Dutch GP FP2: Every spill, spin and crash from Friday practice at Zandvoort It was an eventful day for Mercedes on Friday at the Dutch Grand Prix, with George Russell going fourth fastest in FP2 while Kimi Antonelli ended up in the gravel during FP1. George Russell conceded that Mercedes were not quite as competitive as hoped for during the opening day of action at the Dutch Grand Prix, with the Briton ending FP2 in fourth while team mate Kimi Antonelli lost out on mileage in FP1 after becoming beached in the gravel. Following a run of more challenging races during the middle of the season, things seemed to be looking more positive for the Silver Arrows last time out in Hungary after reverting to an older suspension. “It was great to be back driving again after a couple of weeks out. “It was really windy and this circuit has a lot of 180-degree corners so, when it is windy and gusty, the car is going through that whole phase of the corner, so it's more exposed than on other circuits, maybe like Silverstone, where it's a little bit in and out of the corners – I hope that makes some sort of sense! “But, [in terms of] competitiveness, maybe not quite as close to the front as we'd like, but the race pace looks okay, sort of in the usual mix.” Pushed on whether Aston Martin could be the team's main competition during the weekend – following an impressive performance by the squad on Friday, with Fernando Alonso ending FP2 in second place – Russell responded: “These last couple of races have been really surprising. “Aston had a really bad run of form, and then they were really on it in Hungary and they had a great result. Ferrari have seemed really off the pace today, but I'm sure that can turn very quickly as well, and same with Max [Verstappen]. “He had a tough race in Hungary, but I think that was more of an outlier. So, as it stands, it looks like a bit of a fight with the Astons, with Max and with ourselves, but I'm sure Ferrari will get in there.” Reflecting on his day, the youngster explained: “I was pushing pretty hard early on in FP1 and then I locked up, and then I got beached and my session was over after just one lap. It was obviously not ideal because I lost some mileage and didn't do any laps basically. “In FP2 I kind of had to build my rhythm. “We'll see how the weather's going to be, but if it's going to be dry we'll try to improve those few things, and then I think it was a decent session. Of course there were quite a few mistakes during the lap, but we'll try to be ready for tomorrow.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2025 Dutch GP FP2: Every spill, spin and crash from Friday practice at Zandvoort As Formula 1 returns with the Dutch Grand Prix, Need to Know is your all-in-one guide with statistics, driving pointers, strategy tips and more. With its traditional summer break now drawing to a close, Formula 1 is back in action this weekend as the Dutch Grand Prix kickstarts the second half of the season. First and second practice will take place on Friday, August 29, followed by final practice and Qualifying on Saturday, August 30 and the Grand Prix itself on Sunday, August 31. Jolyon Palmer, former Renault F1 driver: I've only done this one on a bike! Zandvoort is actually a lovely circuit that has been adapted really well for modern F1. It's still difficult to overtake on, as expected with an old design of track, but the banking makes a huge difference. You've got to have commitment, particularly in the middle sector, which is undulating, and you've got to just have it hooked up in the high speed sections. You don't want to be having random snaps of oversteer, because it's a punishing circuit as well... “For the race in the Netherlands, Pirelli has gone a step softer in terms of compounds than last year,” reads Pirelli's weekend preview. “A further step in this direction stems from the FIA's decision to increase the pit lane speed limit from 60 to 80 km/h, thus reducing the time taken for a pit stop. “The Mercedes pair pitted twice – Hamilton used two sets of C3 and George Russell one – while the remaining three, Tsunoda, Bottas and Zhou Guanyu, ran all three available compounds, with Alex Albon choosing to run medium, hard, medium. Piastri, however, has six Grand Prix victories to his name this season – one more than Norris – and has displayed solid consistency throughout the campaign, being the only driver to have scored points at every round so far. It will be fascinating to see who comes out on top in Zandvoort, a venue that Norris triumphed at back in 2024. Both Ferrari and Mercedes appeared to have found more pace last time out in Hungary and, as the two sides vie for second place in the Teams' Championship, each will be keen to seal some valuable points as the season gets underway again. But one thing for certain is that Max Verstappen can never be counted out. Can he score a good result in front of his passionate home fans? Williams' previously comfortable advantage in fifth place looks to be under threat, with Aston Martin and Kick Sauber not far behind in sixth and seventh respectively. Amid such fine margins, any of these teams could make gains – or indeed losses – depending on how they fare at Zandvoort. James Hunt claimed 10 Grand Prix wins during an F1 career that spanned most of the 1970s, and the first of them was a piece of history not just for himself, but also the plucky Hesketh upstart team he represented. In a 1975 encounter that started on a damp track but soon shifted to dry conditions, Hunt pitted after seven laps to change his wet tyres for slicks, but many others – including pole-sitting Ferrari driver Niki Lauda – initially stayed out. However, the inimitable Briton could not be stopped as he logged his maiden F1 win and the one-and-only triumph for Lord Hesketh's operation. Watch how it all unfolded in the video player below...</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2025 Dutch GP FP2: Russell and Piastri have close call in the pit lane Today he's on F1 TV, giving us expert racing insight. But, 10 years ago, James Hinchcliffe suffered a near-fatal accident during practice for the 2015 Indy 500, which left many people doubting that his racing career could continue. A year later, he scored a sensational pole position at the very same racetrack. Speaking to Beyond The Grid host Tom Clarkson, James talks through the freak injury he suffered and how he made such a miraculous recovery. A six-time IndyCar race winner, he also explains what it takes to be quick on high-speed ovals, whether the likes of Max Verstappen would be competitive on them and whether Indy stars like new four-time champion Alex Palou could succeed in Formula 1. Tom asks James why, despite being such a huge fan of F1 growing up, he didn't pursue a career in the pinnacle of motorsport, and whether he thinks the United States needs an American on the grid. Now a regular pundit and commentator on F1 TV, James also shares his thoughts on the thrilling battle between McLaren team mates Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris to become World Champion in 2025.
