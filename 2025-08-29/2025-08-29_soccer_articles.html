                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Barcelona star Robert Lewandowski has been recalled to the Poland squad for September's 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. The decision comes following a dramatic saga over his status as Poland captain after opting against linking up with Michal Probierz's panel for June's international camp on the back of a demanding club season. Lewandowski made the call after speaking with Probierz but the 37-year-old faced some negativity over the decision which ignited a row with Probierz. The June games were overshadowed by the issue as Lewandowski stated would not consider playing for Poland again until there was a change of manager. Lewandowski was ultimately the winner in the stand off, as Probierz was sacked over the summer, and promptly replaced by Jan Urban. The new boss quickly stated bringing Lewandowski back in as captain was a crucial priority and Barcelona's No.9 accepted the olive branch. Lewandowski has 85 goals in 158 international appearances as the leader in both lists for Poland and they will need him at full power next month despite an injury impacted start to the 2025/26 in Catalonia. Poland won their first two qualifiers back in March, via home wins over Lithuania and Malta in Group G, and Lewandowski scored the clincher in the first game. September will be crucial, with qualification squeezed into three windows in 2025, followed by playoffs in March 2026. On the horizon is a crunch trip to the Netherlands on September 4 followed by a home tie with Finland three days later.</p>

LONDON (AP) — Trent Alexander-Arnold was left out by England for its upcoming World Cup qualifiers in the national team's first squad announcement since the right back left Liverpool to join Real Madrid.

Reece James, Tino Livramento and Djed Spence have been preferred as right-back options in coach Thomas Tuchel's 24-man group for matches against Andorra and Serbia that was announed on Friday.

Alexander-Arnold played for Madrid at the Club World Cup in the United States over the summer. For the team's opening two games in the Spanish league, he started the first and was benched for the second to accommodate fit-again Dani Carvajal.

“After a change of club, I think he's got to have a bit of time to settle,” Tuchel said at a news conference.

Tuchel has handed a first senior call-up to Spence, a versatile Tottenham fullback, and Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson, who impressed playing for the England Under-21s in that age group's European Championship this summer.

There was also a recall for Marcus Rashford, who has joined Barcelona on loan from Manchester United, and Manchester City defender John Stones after his return to full fitness.

There was no room for winger Jack Grealish, who is trying to ignite his career at Everton, and playmaker Cole Palmer, who is currently out injured at Chelsea.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Giovanni Reyna and Joe Scally react to missing out on Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT squad. The last 12 months before a World Cup are an exercise in balancing risk and reward for professional soccer players. Do you play it safe and stick with your current club even if it might result in some stagnation? Or do you take the ultimate risk and move to your dream destination, regardless of the World Cup consequences? Then, there's the third scenario: knowing a switch needs to be made, but being careful about where you land. It's a dilemma that past and present United States men's national team players have faced. In the last window, Gio Reyna moved to Borussia Monchengladbach; Matt Turner secured a loan to the New England Revolution, his former club; and Paxten Aaronson turned some heads by leaving Eintracht Frankfurt and landing back in MLS with the Colorado Rapids. Others, such as AC Milan's Yunus Musah, might make a move. Navigating that goal has different challenges for every player, as these examples illustrate. Fifteen years ago, Holden went all in, placing a massive bet on himself. He had let his contract with Houston expire, allowing him to become a free agent and chase his ultimate dream of playing in the English Premier League. After a friendly against Denmark in November 2009, Holden sat down with then-manager Bob Bradley to talk about his chances of making the 2010 World Cup squad. Holden recalls that he was told his odds were at about 60%. - USMNT countdown to the World Cup: Will Reyna's fresh start save 2026 hopes? "I was never guaranteed anything by Bob," Holden told ESPN. Holden also had immense confidence in his game. He didn't dwell on the negatives, instead focusing on the task of becoming a regular with Bolton. Holden knew if he accomplished that goal, the World Cup would take care of itself. But he knew it wouldn't come easy. "It's not like I was signed for a transfer fee and there was pressure for me to be played by the coach. I had to really kind of earn that opportunity," Holden said. "Maybe there would've been a chance I missed out on the World Cup, but to me, there had been a lifelong goal of mine to play in the Premier League, and I had that opportunity and so I went for it, and just kind of bet on myself. I had found previously in my career if I bet on myself, more often than not, things had gone my way." Holden didn't make the gameday roster for Bolton until late February. Bradley knew he wasn't completely fit but still put him on the U.S. roster. He could easily have re-signed with MLS and "parked it in Houston for another couple of years" through the World Cup and beyond. "It ended up being the best decision I made in my life, and I got to go and play in the Premier League," he said. "But I guess as I sit here and reflect, it could have gone completely the other way for me." Paxten Aaronson appeared to have everything in Europe. There was some shock, then, when it emerged that Aaronson secured a transfer to the Colorado Rapids earlier in August. Why leave Europe just when things were taking off, at age 22, no less? As it turned out, there were a few things that Frankfurt couldn't give Aaronson. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. "[Frankfurt] kind of told me that I probably wouldn't get the playing time there that I would need at this stage in my career, and especially since the season I had last year," he said. "And then I kind of knew it was time to probably find another team and they did as well." A second issue was stability -- or in Aaronson's case, the lack of it. Another year on loan wasn't appealing, and Aaronson said he wanted to lay down some roots. He also spoke of "little things" that added up during his time in Europe, though he also mentioned one big thing. "It's just like these little things, [they] all kind of accumulate to not being able to really settle in or find a home, and that was one big reason for me to come back and be close to family, and all these little things that maybe the media doesn't know," he said. It looks like a retreat or failure, as if the player couldn't handle the rigorous nature of European soccer. There's also the fact that such a decision doesn't weigh as heavy on a player's reputation as it used to. Part of that is down to U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino's attitude toward MLS. Alejandro Moreno assesses Giovanni Reyna's move to Borussia Mönchengladbach. Certainly, Aaronson's World Cup prospects impacted his decision. Aaronson added that he didn't discuss his decision with Pochettino, but in some respects, he didn't need to. "I do think [Pochettino and his staff's] view on MLS is high," Aaronson said. You can see from the amount of players that they bring in, and also the way they speak about it. So, it's definitely something that I knew if I came back to MLS, it's not like an automatic big 'X' on my name. Aaronson recalled that the final decision was difficult. But ultimately, he decided to go to Colorado, with manager Chris Armas' sales pitch of making Aaronson a key cog proving vital. To hear Aaronson explain it, he's making a bet on himself much like Holden did 15 years ago. Matt Turner has experienced some precipitous ups and downs over the past several months, even as there was total clarity as to what he needed to do. His starting spot with the USMNT was already under threat, with New York City FC's Matt Freese playing every minute at the Gold Cup while Turner watched from the bench. And for me, I need to play and I need to recoup that feeling of playing and being relied upon consistently week in, week out, so that way I can go back into the national team and use the experiences of having been relied upon consistently." The U.S. keeper thought he had found the right club when he transferred to Ligue 1 side Lyon for $9 million. But a tumultuous ownership and financial situation, which nearly resulted in Lyon's relegation to Ligue 2, meant budgets were cut, and Turner was a casualty. Teams in the English Championship were interested, but Turner felt he was "stagnant" in England, and at Palace, he lost a bit of his edge, knowing that he would be backing up starter Dean Henderson every week. At Premier League level, he was viewed as a backup. Turner recalled that New England was "ready to move the fastest," and he ultimately secured a one-year loan to the club where he began his professional career. Watch your favorite events in the newly upgraded ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. "I've been a tradable asset at the end of transfer windows in England a few times, and it can get pretty stressful," he said. Turner knows the club, and there are familiar teammates like defender Andrew Farrell with whom to reconnect. Turner will also have the opportunity to work with goalkeeper coach Kevin Hitchcock once again. "[Hitchcock] knows how to get the best out of me," Turner said. "He knows what makes me tick, and he could really push me to get to the level that we both know that I can play at consistently." Turner's motivation wasn't solely about his World Cup prospects, or a desire to head back to his old club. Turner's son was born with a heart defect, which required his wife, Ashley, to make periodic trips to the U.S. for treatment in Boston. Turner said that Pochettino was "looped in" on everything that was going on, and though he relied on the U.S. manager's advice, he ultimately would do what was best for him and his family. In three matches, two of which the Revs have won, he has already prevented 1.62 expected goals. Not that Turner is taking anything for granted.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, a worse situation unfolded in the aftermath of the game involving PSG head coach Luis Enrique and Chelsea's Joao Pedro. PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma appeared to be involved in an argument with Pedro, during which Enrique interfered to support his player. Even though the FIFA Disciplinary Committee were initially looking into the chaotic incident, they are no longer referring the case, allowing Enrique to walk free without any ban or penalty, according to AS. FIFA reportedly did not notify Enrique of any proceedings, dismissing the case without a formal response from PSG or Enrique, who has previously expressed regret about his outburst. While a potential two-game suspension for ‘unsportsmanlike conduct' and financial penalty was expected, the governing body are no longer pursuing the case amid other priorities. FIFA's decision has raised eyebrows due to their conflicting ruling in another similar incident, where PSG's Joao Neves was handed a two-match ban for pulling Marc Cucurella's hair in the same final. With no reported punishment, PSG and Enrique would both be relieved, as they would not have to worry about their manager's presence on the touchline, along with having no concerns about a disciplinary battle. The Parisians are set to face Toulouse in their next match in the top flight at Stadium de Toulouse on August 30. Rwittika Chakraborty is a content producer for The Sporting News.

MADRID (AP) — Ballon d'Or holder Rodri and Real Madrid veteran Dani Carvajal have been recalled by Spain for upcoming World Cup qualifiers after long absences because of knee injuries. Spain coach Luis de la Fuente included the stalwarts in his squad on Friday for games in Bulgaria and Turkey on Sept. 4 and 7, as the European champion seeks a spot in the 2026 World Cup. Rodri sat out nearly all of last season after tearing the ACL in his right knee a year ago. He then picked up an injury, reportedly to his groin, at the Club World Cup in the summer. Manchester City coach Pep Guaridola is now gingerly working him back into his lineup. De la Fuente also gave a first call-up to Jesús Rodríguez, who plays for Italian side Como. The 19-year-old winger joined Cesc Fabregas' team this summer from Real Betis. Goalkeepers: David Raya (Arsenal), Unai Simón (Athletic Bilbao), Álex Remiro (Real Sociedad). Defenders: Dani Carvajal (Real Madrid), Marc Cucurella (Chelsea), Pedro Porro (Tottenham), Alejandro Grimaldo (Bayer Leverkusen), Robin Le Normand (Atletico Madrid), Pau Cubarsí (Barcelona), Dani Vivian (Athletic Bilbao), Dean Huijsen (Real Madrid). Forwards: Álvaro Morata (Como), Lamine Yamal (Barcelona), Jesús Rodríguez (Como), Dani Olmo (Barcelona), Ferran Torres (Barcelona), Nico Williams (Athletic Bilbao), Yéremy Pino (Villarreal), Mikel Oyarzabal (Real Sociedad).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MADRID (AP) — Ballon d'Or holder Rodri and Real Madrid veteran Dani Carvajal have been recalled by Spain for upcoming World Cup qualifiers after long absences because of knee injuries. Spain coach Luis de la Fuente included the stalwarts in his squad on Friday for games in Bulgaria and Turkey on Sept. 4 and 7, as the European champion seeks a spot in the 2026 World Cup. Rodri sat out nearly all of last season after tearing the ACL in his right knee a year ago. Manchester City coach Pep Guaridola is now gingerly working him back into his lineup. De la Fuente also gave a first call-up to Jesús Rodríguez, who plays for Italian side Como. The 19-year-old winger joined Cesc Fabregas' team this summer from Real Betis. Goalkeepers: David Raya (Arsenal), Unai Simón (Athletic Bilbao), Álex Remiro (Real Sociedad).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kansas is gearing up for the upcoming World Cup, hosted across 16 North American cities, including its smallest host city, Kansas City. Kansas doesn't know which teams will be playing in the seven matches scheduled for the region, but will be announced on Dec. 5. There will be four group stage matches, one in the first bracket of the tournament when 32 teams remain and one quarter-final match, all played at Arrowhead Stadium. There may also be teams that stay at a local facility for training and lodging. Possible base camps include the Sporting Kansas City training facility in Kansas City, Kansas, the KC Current training facility in Riverside, Missouri, and the Rock Chalk Park in Lawrence. "These teams are going to bring their entire support staff, sometimes their families, so the influx of folks that come with a team are pretty substantial." It's unclear how much will specifically go to the Kansas City region, but Douglas estimated that it will be around $50 million. The profile of the visitors estimates about 54% will be visiting from another country, and will stay an average of 10 days. It's estimated that half the world's population will tune in for at least one game. "We really want to maximize that for the tournament and make sure we're getting the biggest bang for our buck out of business attraction and really telling our story through this," Douglas said. There are also local business that can take advantage of the event, and so far, 2,000 vendors have signed up with KC 2026 as potential partners. The Fan Fest at the World War I museum in Kansas City is going to have a capacity of 25,000. He worried that hotel rooms could see a massive surge in pricing during the World Cup. "We know that people are going to travel two to four hours if they can't find accomodation within the metropolitan area," Douglas said. "We also know that VRBOs, AirBnBs are going to be in demand. And so I would imagine that every type of accommodation will be maximized to host the number of visitors we'll have." Transportation was also brought up, specifically whether Kansas City 2026 will utilize school bus fleets to shuttle fans to World Cup events. School buses may be one way to increase capacity by shuttling people from the Kansas City International Airport to downtown Kansas City, Arrowhead or the FIFA Fan Fest. Currency exchange was also brought up, with Kansas City having few options to trade other currencies for U.S. dollars. An estimated 68% of tourists will have a credit or debit card that works in the United States, but the other 32% may have to rely on currency exchange at the airport. FIFA 2026 said they're discussing options with Visa, which is a commercial sponsor of the World Cup, to get more options for currency exchange.</p>

The region's first-ever professional league is scheduled to kick off on January 10 and will serve as a qualifier for the FIFA Club World Cup in 2029.

Seven nations will be represented with Bula Boys FC (Fiji), Hekari United FC (Papua New Guinea), Solomon Kings FC (Solomon Islands), Tahiti United FC (Tahiti) and Vanuatu FC (Vanuatu) all confirmed as preferred candidates.

They will be joined by Auckland FC and Christchurch United from New Zealand, with South Melbourne representing Australia as the sole team from outside the OFC region.

The clubs are still subject to the final stages of the licensing and compliance process before full confirmation.

"This is a historic moment for Oceania football," OFC General Secretary Franck Castillo said in a statement.

"For the first time our region will have a professional league that provides a pathway for players, coaches and clubs to compete at the highest level within the Pacific."

The opening season will run until May with each club playing a minimum of 17 matches, before being split into two groups comprising the top four and bottom four.

The top teams will battle for three of the four semi-final spots, with the leading side from the bottom tier also earning a playoff match.</p>

As such, Spain will largely stick with the squad that reached the Nations League final, which already guarantees them a playoff spot in case things go wrong during qualification. Meanwhile, the outlet also mentions that alongside Gonzalo, another Real Madrid youngster making waves is defender Dean Huijsen. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. However, that does not rule out the possibility of one or two late departures, particularly from the youth and reserve ranks, with a number of top-flight teams eyeing players from Castilla. In such one case, AS reports that newly-promoted La Liga club Levante have turned their attention to Manuel Angel, a 21-year-old midfielder from Real Madrid Castilla. In fact, Manuel Angel was primed for a first-team call-up under Xabi Alonso, but an injury prevented it, leading to Thiago Pitarch getting the opportunity instead. Real Madrid's policy has been clear in recent years regarding players leaving their academy.</p>
