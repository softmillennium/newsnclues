                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists saw the impossible inside a shielded lab. The U.S. goverment tried to turn it into a weapon. IN 1972, AMERICAN ARTIST AND PSYCHIC INGO SWANN altered the magnetic field inside a thickly shielded vacuum container located underground for several seconds—by simply thinking about it. As Harold Puthoff, a physicist with the Stanford Research Institute, witnessed the output from his magnetometer changing, he was mind-blown. Psychic phenomena are real,” Dean Radin, Ph.D., chief scientist at the California-based nonprofit Institute of Noetic Sciences, tells Popular Mechanics. By the time Puthoff and his colleague Russel Targ, another physicist at the Stanford Research Institute (now known as SRI International), presented their results at an international meeting on quantum physics and parapsychology, the CIA had already begun working with SRI to perform top-secret research on paranormal phenomena—primarily “remote viewing” for intelligence collection. Remote viewing refers to a type of extra-sensorial perception that involves using the mind to “see” or manipulate distant objects, people, events, or other information that are hidden from physical view. Radin, who served as a visiting scientist on the Stargate program, says security personnel would brief him and his colleagues about the incredible sensitivity of their highly classified work every two weeks, and ask them if they had any reason to believe that anyone outside of the project knew anything about it. “You had to become a professional paranoid, essentially. It was very uncomfortable for me,” Radin says. He remembers asking one of his supervisors what would happen if they had a breakthrough—say, coming up with a drug to make someone super psychic. “It would disappear and you would never be able to talk about it again,” Radin recalls, “which is antithetical to the whole scientific process, but I also understood why.” Any weapon or intelligence tool developed under Stargate would have presumably been too valuable and too dangerous for public release. In June 1995, the CIA asked The American Institutes for Research (AIR)—an Arlington, Virginia-based nonprofit tasked with evaluating and providing technical assistance in behavioral and social science research—to conduct an external review of the Stargate program. To present a balanced review of the scientific credibility of the program, AIR asked two researchers with opposing perspectives on parapsychology to write the report: Jessica Utts, Ph.D., an accomplished statistician and now professor emerita at the University of California, Irvine, who views parapsychology as a promising science; and Ray Hyman, Ph.D., a renowned psychologist and now professor emeritus at the University of Oregon, who is a noted skeptic and critic of parapsychology. “They sent us these boxes full of reports and papers and told us we had one summer to write this report,” Utts tells Popular Mechanics. She and Hyman separately reviewed dozens of Stargate experiments while also taking into account data from the broader scientific community at the time. One of the things she found most convincing was that the results seen across studies in different laboratories were all very similar. To that extent, Hyman agreed with Utts, but it wasn't enough to convince him that remote viewing is real. Her favorite stories are about health, animals and obscurities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission. Series finales can be tricky even for shows with the kinds of fanbases who have stuck around through thick and thin, and I would still say that Supernatural's ending is one of the most controversial genre finales of the last ten years. (All fifteen are available streaming with a Netflix subscription now.) They're like, ‘Look, we're putting out a PSA. We're just going to get the word out there.' The Winchester brothers may have had a pretty sizable network of allies by the end, but they definitely never went public with a PSA. I could have imagined it happening in a dream sequence, meta episode, time travel storyline, or even parallel world that no show could pull off quite like Supernatural did, but not in the main canon of the show. And that's saying something, since the main canon of the show once de-aged Dean for an episode and made him a Taylor Swift fan! It would've kind of blown up the show in a very odd way. But that was always something I was like, ‘They probably should do that, you know what I mean? But again, a little logistically difficult for the show. Sam and Dean passed plenty of what then seemed like points of no return over the years, but it might have taken an intervention from Chuck/God at his most powerful to make that storyline logistically feasible. Andrew Dabb explained why this really would have been going too far: Suddenly, Sam and Dean are known worldwide, which, again, I think sounds interesting in theory, but I actually think would've destroyed the show. Short of a Supernatural revival, that storyline will likely never be explored for Sam and Dean Winchester. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles weighed in on a revival potentially happening someday, with Padalecki doubling down on the idea of returning for a limited series. Ackles thought that the show might have been R-rated on a streamer, and he could see perks of keeping it "like a broadcast show."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elizabeth Klarer wtih a bust of her intergalactic lover, Akon. As scientists try to make sense of 3I/Atlas - the mysterious object hurtling towards Earth - it's unleashed fears of an alien invasion and brought back to the surface numerous supposed alien abduction cases that have never been disproved. Closer to home, Elizabeth Klarer of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands even wrote a book about her intergalactic romance with a starship commander who got her pregnant in 1959. These two alien abduction stories are among dozens that have resurfaced as people ponder whether there could be any truth behind their extraordinary experiences, now that 3I/Atlas - bigger than Mount Everest - hurtles toward Earth in a way scientists describe as "not natural". This image from NASA shows the fast-moving interstellar object that has got many to wonder about alien encounters that have been reported over the years. It was first picked up by a telescope in Chile and then photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope a few weeks ago. Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University thinks the visitor is unlikely to be a natural object and believes governments around the world should formulate a treaty so they know how to handle a possible hostile alien invasion. For her, it was all about peace, love and understanding - things she tried to convey from her lover from the planet Meton in the Alpha Centauri System, according to earlier reports by "Independent Media". Klarer, who was a meteorologist, claimed to have had the most intimate encounter with extraterrestrials, writing in her book "Beyond the Light Barrier", published in 1980, that she bore a son with her alien lover, Akon. This time, Akon took her aboard his scout ship, a craft some 18 m in diameter, before transporting her to the cigar-shaped mother ship. He also claimed that several Venusians were living among us. In 1959, Klarer claimed she visited Meton with Akon, orbiting Proxima Centauri, where she gave birth to their son, Ayling, before returning to Earth because the planet's vibrations played havoc with her heart. Klarer's main thrust throughout her life, and in the pages of her book, she strived to convey a message of peace, love, understanding and environmentalism, which she credited to the superior wisdom of an advanced and immaculately utopian Venusian civilisation. Klarer often commemorated the April 7 anniversary of her union with Akon by returning to Flying Saucer Hill, sometimes aided by others as she grew frail. When this reporter covered Klarer's funeral in Pietermaritzburg in February 1994, her sisters expressed profound loss, but were also at peace now that her battle against scepticism had come to an end. Betty and Barney Hill claimed they were abducted by aliens in 1961 while returning home from a visit to Niagara Falls. They were on their way home from a trip to Niagara Falls when they saw a string of bright lights in the sky. The couple claimed that they were rendered unconscious by a group of humanoids who approached them when Barney got out of the family car, armed with his pistol, soon after a craft, measuring 12 meters across, blocked their path. What they did recall was waking up not far from the car. After the troubling incident, Betty drew a star map which closely resembles actual star placements which were only discovered by astronomers a decade later, indicating that their alleged abductors had come from Zeta Reticuli. Media coverage turned the Hills into celebrities, spawning a 1975 made-for-television film starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons. Betty's subsequent dreams showed a strong correlation with details Barney shared under hypnosis. However, in both cases, there was never enough evidence to conclusively prove their abduction story, nor to disprove it as a mere fiction. An ominous interstellar object named 3I/Atlas is hurtling towards our solar system at astonishing speeds. What does this mean for Earth, and could it be a sign of extraterrestrial …</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Whatever it is, Google Maps users are getting seriously freaked out after discovering this strange object in Antarctica. The round entity, described as a 'UFO', is hiding under what seems to be a cliff about 90 miles from Antarctica's coast. With no known origin, people are questioning whether this strange relic at the bottom of the Earth is man-made – or something not of this world. Scott C. Waring, who runs the UFO Sightings Daily website, posted a YouTube clip of the sleek disc being found on Google Maps. Too hard to recover or still being used?' It is also about six miles away from the A. B. Dobrowolski Polar Station, an occasionally active Polish research base. Intriguingly, the object seems to have a sliverish line going around the rim, which corresponds with traditional depictions of UFOs from pop culture. But otherwise, it has a consistently uniform black colour, which very clearly contrasts with the jagged rock and snow surrounding it. Philip Mantle, a British UFO researcher, called the disc 'a new one for me', adding that he'd 'never seen it before', but declined to speculate on what it might be. UFO stands for 'unidentified flying object' and so the term doesn't necessarily describe an object with an extraterrestrial origin. In his post on his UFO Sightings Daily website on Wednesday, Mr Waring said this UFO was discovered about two years ago, but in fact some people spotted it years earlier. On Reddit four years ago, someone posted a screenshot with the caption: 'Any thoughts on the UFO “crash” site in Antarctica?' One commentator said: 'If I had to ditch an advanced spacecraft on a populated planet, I would put it down on an unpopulated continent, and wait for rescue', while someone else joked: 'So that's where my giant pancake ended up after I threw it out the window...' 'There is a small patch of snow and the warmer lake water has a lower albedo so it absorbs more solar radiation,' she told the Daily Mail. Laura Gerrish, mapping specialist at the British Antarctic Survey, said: 'From the satellite imagery, this round feature looks like a small lake. 'This area is called the Bunger Hills, which is a largely ice-free region along the Knox Coast in Antarctica - and it has lots of small lakes and ponds. It's far from the first time that strange features located on Google Maps have gone viral. The imposing structure's location led conspiracy theorists to speculate that it is somehow involved in alien contact. However, there was a rational explanation for the tower – not to do with aliens or global warming as people speculated. This followed a structure in a mountainous region of New Mexico taking the internet by storm, sparking claims of UFOs. Meanwhile, a 'doorway' spotted in Antarctica, just southeast of the Japanese-run Showa Station, sparked a similar wave of theories across the internet, with one describing it as 'bigfoot's vacation home'. Based on clues from reported sightings between 1996 and 2023, the typical UFO has a round shape, usually described as spherical or an orb, with a white or silver colour, often translucent. It also has a size of between 3 and 13 feet (1 to 4 metres) and usually travels through the air at a height just below commercial passenger planes. Most UFOs (28 per cent) have been sighted at altitudes of around 20,000 feet - just under commercial air traffic. Meanwhile, 16 per cent have been described as having lights.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Topics: Aliens, Celebrity, Conspiracy Theories, Emma Stone, Film and TV She first began delivering news when she was just 11 years old - with a paper route - before graduating with a BA Hons in English Language in the Media from Lancaster University. Emily joined UNILAD in 2018 to cover breaking news, trending stories and longer form features. She went on to become Community Desk Lead, commissioning and writing human interest stories from across the globe, before moving to the role of Editorial Lead. Emma Stone has faced plenty of supernatural experiences through her roles in movies like Spider-Man and Zombieland, but during a recent interview she revealed her belief in otherworldly beings goes beyond the big screen. Naturally, this plot led some reporters at Venice on to the topic of aliens, and Stone decided to share her thoughts loud and clear. Stone explained her reasoning, telling the crowd that she'd been inspired by astronomer Carl Sagan, who is known for his research on the possibility of extraterrestrial life. The La La Land actor said: “One of my favorite people who has ever lived is Carl Sagan and I fell madly in love with his philosophy, science and how brilliant he is." Stone indicated she shared in Sagan's stance on aliens, pointing out that to believe that our world is the only one with life is pretty big-headed of us. She said: “He very deeply believed the idea that we're alone in this vast expansive universe - not that we're being watched - is a pretty narcissistic thing.” One reporter also jokingly asked Stone how she manages to live in the spotlight as a celebrity without 'turning into an alien' herself, to which the 34-year-old took a leaf out of Bugonia's book. “How do you know I'm not an alien?” she responded. They're the same person, but it's what I do to keep myself sane.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Taylor Swift announced news of her engagement to NFL star Travis Kelce earlier this week, there was one group in particular that was left devastated. Over the years, these wild conspiracy theories have suggested that Taylor had romantic relationships with the likes of Glee star Dianna Agron and model Karlie Kloss, insisting that Taylor's close friendships with her female friends have actually been something more. The theory first gained traction in 2014 when a grainy picture emerged on social media appearing to show Taylor and Karlie kissing at a 1975 concert. As Taylor is known for leaving 'Easter eggs' in her songs and photos, her song lyrics have often been cited in the Gaylor debate (which combines 'gay' and 'Taylor'), with fans claiming her lyrics signify she is lesbian, bisexual - or not straight in some form. Since news of Taylor's engagement this week, the Gaylor community has gone into meltdown - but still the rumours have not been quashed, with some even claiming her relationship with Travis is 'PR' to cover up her true identity. One person said: 'Oh Christ, happy for her but this is the worst news of my life. Taylor Swift fans have long suspected that the singer secretly likes women - although she has denied it. Pictured with Karlie Kloss at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in 2014 'For all we know, she just wanted an excuse to wear the actual wedding ring she got from her actual WIFE!' Hyper-analysing Taylor's engagement photos, showing Travis down on one knee in his garden, one fan even said she was wearing 'black and white stripes... like she's in jail'. The Reddit thread r/GaylorSwift, a community which has racked up more than 50,000, has now changed its status to private following news of the engagement. The 'Swiftgron' theory has fuelled speculation that there was once romance between Swift and Glee star Dianna Agron. The Gaylor theory first gained traction in 2014 when a grainy picture emerged on social media appearing to show Taylor and Karlie kissing at a 1975 concert This week, Taylor announced her engagement to NFL star Travis Kelce (pictured) - but still this has not put the rumours to rest Swift has previously been romantically linked to Harry Styles, Conor Kennedy, Jake Gyllenhaal, Lucas Till, Cory Monteith, Joe Jonas, John Mayer, Calvin Harris, Tom Hiddleston Joe Alwyn, Taylor Lautner, and most recently, Travis Kelce, to whom she is now engaged. But the Gaylor community maintains that many of these relationships have been the result or a PR strategy, or covering up of her true identity. The theory first entered into the mainstream fans speculated they could see Taylor and her former best friend Karlie Kloss kissing in a blurry picture from a 1975 concert in 2014. Swift and Kloss' worlds first collided in 2012 when the Mean singer admitted to Vogue that she 'love[s]' Kloss and wanted nothing more than to 'bake cookies with her!' They were first photographed together in November 2013 when the Grammy Award-winner served as the musical entertainment for that year's Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, which Kloss walked in. Their friendship continued to grow in 2014 as they embarked on an epic cross-country road trip and enjoyed countless nights out in New York City. Since news of Taylor's engagement this week, the Gaylor community has gone into meltdown They were clearly close: Swift revealed to Rolling Stone that Kloss even had her own room in her NYC apartment that was decorated with pictures of the model and included a basket of her favorite Whole Food treats by the bed. In November 2014, the besties shared an epic runway moment as Swift performed at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show for a second time. In 2015, they took their friendship to a whole new level, when they teamed up to pose for a joint Vogue cover in February 2015. 'People had been telling us for years we needed to meet,' said the Pennsylvania native. 'I remember makeup artists and hair people going, 'Doesn't she remind you of Karlie? Kloss also made a cameo in Swift's Bad Blood music video in May 2015, alongside the likes of Gigi Hadid, Martha Hunt, Cara Delevingne and Lily Aldridge. Taylor and Karlie Kloss were best friends for many years, but fans long speculated there was something more between them The pair would often share pictures of each other on Instagram, but their friendship appeared to cool off from 2017 Taylor Swift performs as Karlie Kloss walks in the 2013 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show at Lexington Avenue Armory on November 13, 2013 Kloss got engaged to business man Joshua Kushner in 2018 and they held two wedding ceremonies in the summer of 2019 - both of which Swift failed to attend. Another central 'Gaylor' theory focuses on 'Swiftgron' - the friendship between Taylor and Glee actress Dianna Agron. Fans first speculated that Agron, 37, and Swift, 33, were romantically involved when Agron was mentioned on the liner notes for Swift's song 22 from her 2012 album Red. They also shared photos from Agron's own circus-themed birthday bash, which Swift said was, 'the most magical night.' A few years later, Swift gave Agron a shout-out at the 2014 American Music Awards, when she received the Dick Clark Award for Excellence. Meanwhile Wonderland, from 1989, contains the lyrics 'I fell down the rabbit hole' - which fans claim is a reference to Diana's old Tumblr blog - and 'you flashed your green eyes at me', also claimed to be a reference to the actress. When Taylor sings she was 'too in love to think straight', one fan claimed they could see the 'queerness' in her lyrics, adding: 'This is all consistent with a closeted queer relationship.' before turning to the camera, blowing a kiss and purring, 'Hi, Taylor.' During a wide-ranging interview with Rolling Stone, Agron opened up about the rumors of romantic speculation. When asked if she was the inspiration for 22, Agron said, 'Me? But I would not be the person to ask about that. She was also asked about rumors that she was in a romantic relationship with the songstress, responding, 'That is so interesting. To a lesser extent, fans have also theorised about a potential romance between Taylor and English model Lily Donaldson, with some believing the song 'Gorgeous' is about her, and speculating that Lily's snake jewellery could be a reference to the Reputation album. Lily Donaldson, Ellie Goulding, Karlie Kloss, Taylor Swift and Cara Delevingne are pictured in 2015 Taylor Swift, Martha Hunt and Karlie Kloss Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in 2014 Fans also see Lover, Folklore and Evermore as break-up albums about the relationship. In 2014, Swift tweeted a request that as a '25th birthday present from the media' that she would like people to 'stop accusing' her of dating all her friends. 'If I only hung out with my female friends, people couldn't sensationalize or sexualize that right? The Cats actress explicitly told Vogue in 2019 that she was 'not a part of' LGTBQ+ community, but was passionate about speaking up for the community. Even amid Taylor's outright denials of the rumours, fans have continued to analyse her lyrics for any hidden signal that she may not be straight. Fans have also theorised some of Taylor's songs originally had different lyrics. One song used in Gaylor theories is The Very First Night, released as a vault track on Red (Taylor's Version), released in November 2022. However, people have since speculated that the lyrics were originally supposed to read 'I miss her', in order to rhyme with 'picture' from the line before. 'It was definitely meant to be 'how much I miss her'' one person said on the Reddit forum. They added: 'It's almost painful to force out that you when it is in a rhyme sequence with 'whisper' and 'picture'. Others believe Swift swapped a lyric from Reputation track New Years Day from 'I want your midnights' to 'I want her midnights' during a 2019 performance at the Time100 gala. At the same time, Swift teased an upcoming announcement for April 26 - Lesbian Visibility Day - leading fans to speculate she would be coming out. However, it turned out to be an announcement for the lead single of her album, Lover, called 'ME!' (You could be GLAAD)' and 'control your urges to scream about all the people you hate / Cause shade never made anybody less gay.' In 2024 the New York Times ran a near 5,000 word opinion piece speculating on Taylor's sexuality, titled Look What We Made Taylor Do. 'This article wouldn't have been allowed to be written about Shawn Mendes or any male artist whose sexuality has been questioned by fans.' 'There seems to be no boundary some journalists won't cross when writing about Taylor, regardless of how invasive, untrue, and inappropriate it is - all under the protective veil of an 'opinion piece'. On Tuesday, Taylor announced her engagement to Travis Kelce after a secret proposal earlier this month On Tuesday, Taylor announced her engagement to Travis Kelce after a secret proposal earlier this month. The pop icon and the NFL star, both 35, who have been dating for two years, officially revealed their marriage news on Tuesday with a romantic engagement photoshoot showing Kelce proposing in a rose garden. The couple went public with their relationship in September 2023 when the singer appeared alongside Kelce's mother, Donna, at a Kansas City Chiefs game. Since that day their romance has captivated the world, with Swift supporting Kelce's run to two Super Bowls while the NFL star has traveled alongside her around the globe on her wildly successful Eras Tour.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elizabeth Klarer wtih a bust of her intergalactic lover, Akon. As scientists try to make sense of 3I/Atlas - the mysterious object hurtling towards Earth - it's unleashed fears of an alien invasion and brought back to the surface numerous supposed alien abduction cases that have never been disproved. Closer to home, Elizabeth Klarer of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands even wrote a book about her intergalactic romance with a starship commander who got her pregnant in 1959. These two alien abduction stories are among dozens that have resurfaced as people ponder whether there could be any truth behind their extraordinary experiences, now that 3I/Atlas - bigger than Mount Everest - hurtles toward Earth in a way scientists describe as "not natural". This image from NASA shows the fast-moving interstellar object that has got many to wonder about alien encounters that have been reported over the years. It was first picked up by a telescope in Chile and then photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope a few weeks ago. Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University thinks the visitor is unlikely to be a natural object and believes governments around the world should formulate a treaty so they know how to handle a possible hostile alien invasion. For her, it was all about peace, love and understanding - things she tried to convey from her lover from the planet Meton in the Alpha Centauri System, according to earlier reports by "Independent Media". Klarer, who was a meteorologist, claimed to have had the most intimate encounter with extraterrestrials, writing in her book "Beyond the Light Barrier", published in 1980, that she bore a son with her alien lover, Akon. This time, Akon took her aboard his scout ship, a craft some 18 m in diameter, before transporting her to the cigar-shaped mother ship. He also claimed that several Venusians were living among us. In 1959, Klarer claimed she visited Meton with Akon, orbiting Proxima Centauri, where she gave birth to their son, Ayling, before returning to Earth because the planet's vibrations played havoc with her heart. Klarer's main thrust throughout her life, and in the pages of her book, she strived to convey a message of peace, love, understanding and environmentalism, which she credited to the superior wisdom of an advanced and immaculately utopian Venusian civilisation. Klarer often commemorated the April 7 anniversary of her union with Akon by returning to Flying Saucer Hill, sometimes aided by others as she grew frail. When this reporter covered Klarer's funeral in Pietermaritzburg in February 1994, her sisters expressed profound loss, but were also at peace now that her battle against scepticism had come to an end. Betty and Barney Hill claimed they were abducted by aliens in 1961 while returning home from a visit to Niagara Falls. They were on their way home from a trip to Niagara Falls when they saw a string of bright lights in the sky. The couple claimed that they were rendered unconscious by a group of humanoids who approached them when Barney got out of the family car, armed with his pistol, soon after a craft, measuring 12 meters across, blocked their path. What they did recall was waking up not far from the car. After the troubling incident, Betty drew a star map which closely resembles actual star placements which were only discovered by astronomers a decade later, indicating that their alleged abductors had come from Zeta Reticuli. Media coverage turned the Hills into celebrities, spawning a 1975 made-for-television film starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons. Betty's subsequent dreams showed a strong correlation with details Barney shared under hypnosis. However, in both cases, there was never enough evidence to conclusively prove their abduction story, nor to disprove it as a mere fiction. An ominous interstellar object named 3I/Atlas is hurtling towards our solar system at astonishing speeds. What does this mean for Earth, and could it be a sign of extraterrestrial …</p>

Chinese scientists successfully test drone which resembles a flying spindle and represents a radical change in aerodynamic design

In 2015, a US Navy F/A-18 pilot flying off the East Coast with the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt encountered something inexplicable: an unidentified flying object shaped like a spindle, hovering above the clouds with no visible means of propulsion.

Encoded as “Gimbal”, the footage – officially declassified in 2021 – ignited global speculation about unidentified aerial phenomena and prompted serious questions about advanced aerospace technology beyond known military capabilities.

Now, nearly a decade later, scientists in China have unveiled and successfully tested a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) drone whose form bears a striking resemblance to that enigmatic object. While still at an experimental stage, this new aircraft represents a radical change in aerodynamic design that could improve endurance, stability and multi-mission versatility in uncrewed flight.

Unlike most drones, this new vehicle's airframe is centred around an elliptical, ringlike wing that integrates a straight central wing section, forming a closed-loop structure.

Four rotors are mounted at junctions between the elliptical wings and vertical stabilisers – serving both as lift generators and structural reinforcements.

At a distant glance, it resembles a flying spindle rather than a conventional fixed-wing or quadcopter drone.</p>
