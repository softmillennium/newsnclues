                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto prices have cooled today, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP all in the red. However, an analyst believes that Bitcoin is poised for its next surge, with significant upside potential ahead. TOKEN6900 ($T6900) is the SPX6900-inspired meme coin that's going viral in its presale. It has raised a total of $3 million so far, driven not by flashy branding, but by a shared belief in something bigger: that this project represents the pinnacle of financial regression and it's ready to take over the meme coin market. However, this offer is limited, with the official exchange listing scheduled to take place at 2 pm UTC on September 3. Crypto whales are investing heavily, aware that the growing hype and FOMO could lead to a sudden surge once the token is listed on exchanges. Recently, one whale invested $19,000 in the ICO, showing immense belief and conviction. üìàüö®üîç Same falling wedge breakoutüìä Same retest & sideways rangeüî• In 2020, this led to a vertical rally‚Ä¶ 2025 setup looks identicalAre we on the edge of liftoff?#Bitcoin #Crypto pic.twitter.com/0vEmwuoDr6 Yet TOKEN6900's early stage and untapped potential mean it could be one of the biggest benefactors. Instead, what matters most for TOKEN6900 is the collective belief in how much people truly value this project. And if it's anything like SPX6900, which peaked at over $2 billion, there's immense upside potential from its initial listing market cap of just $6 million ‚Äì and there's very little in the way of achieving it. Regarding tangible price targets, a Cryptonews analyst is predicting 100x gains. Although targeting 100x returns may seem ambitious for a new project, the numbers signal why: Rallying 100x would elevate $T6900's market cap to $600 million ‚Äì less than 30% of SPX6900's peak valuation. If Bitcoin breaks out and hits new highs, meme coin prices across the board will surge, and it's likely that SPX6900 also reaches new highs. Moreover, its low market capitalization means that liquidity inflows would have a disproportionate price impact, helping it generate gains far more quickly than SPX6900 or other large-cap meme coins. Like SPX6900, TOKEN6900 offers a glimpse into the economic circus that shaped you. SPX6900 has rallied over 10,000% this year on similar rhetoric, outperforming the stock market's 50-year return without any real utility or fundamental value. This shows that collective belief and vibes are enough to send a price skyrocketing. TOKEN6900 tokenizes attention, farms virality, and embraces the chaos of social-driven finance. But with only five days until the launch, potential investors must lock in soon or risk paying a far higher price on exchanges.

The logic behind that price action isn't that hard to decipher: in the weeks leading up to the show, conference organizers ‚Äî looking to sell tickets and generate media coverage ‚Äî overhype the speakers and what are sure to be "massive" announcements. How could the price do anything but dump? For those not paying close attention, Bitcoin Magazine's Bitcoin Asia conference took place this week in Hong Kong. The featured speakers included Eric Trump, CZ, Adam Back, Balaji Srinivasan and David Bailey. Among the subject matter covered ‚Äî you guessed it ‚Äî "freedom money," "massive institutional and sovereign adoption," and "bitcoin to the moon." At around $115,000 as attendees began arriving in Hong Kong earlier this week, bitcoin has tumbled to the current $108,400. This included about a 4% dive overnight in the U.S. (Friday in Hong Kong) as David Bailey and Eric Trump took the stage for a chat titled "Bitcoin Takes Over the World."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After awarding millions of dollars, the Ethereum Foundation is overhauling its Ecosystem Support Program, shifting from open applications to a curated model. After funding hundreds of projects with millions of dollars, the Ethereum Foundation is temporarily pausing the Ecosystem Support Program's (ESP) open grant application process to refocus on a more proactive funding model that is better aligned with the ecosystem's strategic needs. In a Friday blog post, the Ethereum Foundation stressed that the ESP will continue funding new projects, but under a refined approach to grantmaking. More details are expected in the fourth quarter, including a curated methodology outlining specific ecosystem priorities. As a nonprofit established in 2014 by Ethereum's co-founders, the Ethereum Foundation has historically played a key role in providing funding, coordination and long-term vision for the blockchain's development, including major network upgrades. In June, the foundation introduced a more transparent treasury policy detailing operational costs and cash requirements. As the world's second-largest blockchain, Ethereum has strong backing from institutional investors and developers but faces growing competition from faster, lower-cost alternatives such as Solana, Avalanche and BNB Smart Chain, which market themselves as more scalable and user-friendly platforms. As such, Ethereum is being steered toward a renewed focus on layer-1 scaling, reducing network costs and improving the overall user experience. Interoperability has become a central focus given the rapid proliferation of layer-2 protocols. While these solutions extend Ethereum's functionality, they also introduce new challenges, particularly fragmentation, the foundation said. Ethereum has already made inroads with financial institutions, with VanEck CEO Jan VanEck calling Ether (ETH) the ‚ÄúWall Street token.‚Äù On stablecoins, he argued that the winning blockchain will be the one that attracts the most builders: ‚ÄúIt's going to be Ethereum, or something that uses Ethereum's methodology.

And there's much more money to go around, Hougan said in an August 28 interview. ‚ÄúThere's a relentless bid for Ethereum ETFs,‚Äù Hougan told podcaster Scott Melker. And even though Ether's new all-time high proved short-lived, market watchers are predicting the token's price can go anywhere from $7,500 by year-end to $20,000 at some point in the current cycle. Instead of Bitcoin, institutional investors are deploying capital straight into Ethereum. That's because they're drawn in by fresh regulation that should further cement its stablecoin dominance ‚Äî nearly half of the $283 billion market lives on Ethereum ‚Äî the potential $19 trillion tokenisation boom, and staking yields that Bitcoin doesn't offer. ‚ÄúThe other day, I was on with a multi-billion dollar adviser. Some, like Jan van Eck, CEO of investment manager VanECk, are even calling Ethereum the ‚ÄúWall Street token.‚Äù For years, Bitcoin advocates have been calling the top crypto digital gold. Ethereum, meanwhile, fits their framework: it's a tech play with cash flows, real-world utility, and has become the skeleton for tokenisation projects from BlackRock to JPMorgan. Sprinkle the voraciousness of Ethereum treasury companies in adding Ether to their balance sheets, and a rising price should follow suit. For Hougan, whose watching institutional money flood in at unprecedented rates, even the recent pullback is just noise. ‚ÄúThere is no market pullback for them,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey still see it in a raging bull market.‚Äù Pedro Solimano is DL News' Buenos Aires-based markets correspondent.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HONG KONG ‚Äî The Trump family ‚Äúloves‚Äù the Bitcoin community, Eric Trump said in Hong Kong on Friday, predicting that its value could hit $1 million as concerns mount over conflicts of interest in his latest venture set to go public. ‚ÄúAnd I hope that's paid off in spades, because we love this community,‚Äù he said, sitting in front of a screen with a live ticker showing the cryptocurrency's price at nearly $110,000, up from about $70,000 on the day his father, Donald Trump, was voted back into office in November. Eric Trump has attracted an almost cult-like following in the crypto industry, which was apparent in Hong Kong as hundreds of attendees ‚Äî some dressed up in outfits ranging from sparkly robes to white suits covered in Bitcoin symbols ‚Äî cheered as Trump took the stage, bashed his father's predecessor, Joe Biden, and said, ‚ÄúThis is the time to buy.‚Äù The cryptocurrency industry has become big business for the Trump family, whose patriarch has become one of its biggest champions since it helped return him to office. Launched in March with his older brother, Donald Trump Jr., and the Nasdaq-listed Hut 8, a crypto energy infrastructure company, American Bitcoin aims to be the ‚Äúworld's largest, most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner while building a robust strategic Bitcoin reserve,‚Äù according to a news release. ‚ÄúWe are one of the biggest Bitcoin mining companies on Earth,‚Äù he said. He insists that the family's business is separate from national politics and has dismissed concerns about conflicts of interest. There's total separation of church and state,‚Äù he told CNBC in December. Since returning to office in January, Trump has pushed to ease regulation of the industry, shut down the Justice Department's national cryptocurrency enforcement team, appointed a ‚Äúcrypto czar‚Äù and held a White House summit for industry leaders. He also said the U.S. would create a national strategic crypto reserve. This month he signed an executive order allowing cryptocurrency and real estate investments to be included in 401(k) retirement accounts, which critics say could put Americans' retirement savings at risk. One of the three bills that received support on Capitol Hill last month was the GENIUS Act, which allows stablecoins to be issued by private companies. A meme coin was also launched for first lady Melania Trump. Industry professionals call these meme coins, meaning they have little practical use and are mostly symbolic, making their value subject to extreme volatility. About 764,000 wallets of mostly small holders lost money on $TRUMP while 58 wallets made more than $10 million each, CNBC reported in May, citing data from the blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. In May, Trump briefly appeared at a dinner outside Washington for the 220 largest buyers of $TRUMP, who spent an average of $1 million on the token. Trump also has a large stake in World Liberty Financial, a decentralized crypto exchange that was launched last fall and is majority-controlled by the Trump family. World Liberty's flagship project is its $WLFI stablecoin, which holders voted last month to make more widely tradable. That currency will then be used to invest in Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, whose CEO stepped down in 2023 after the company pleaded guilty to money laundering and other charges. The deal was announced at a crypto conference Eric Trump attended in Abu Dhabi shortly before his father visited the United Arab Emirates city in May. ‚ÄúThere is serious conflict of interest, and people recognize it,‚Äù said Bharat Prabhakar, 25, a New York-based conference attendee.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Department of Commerce just published GDP data on Bitcoin, Ethereum & 7 more blockchains. In a groundbreaking move, the U.S. Department of Commerce has begun publishing official economic data directly onto public blockchains. Through partnerships with two leading oracle providers, Chainlink and Pyth , core indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP), real personal consumption expenditures, and private domestic sales are now verifiable on 9 blockchain networks, including: This initiative reflects  the Trump administration's push toward greater transparency in government spending and accountability. Instead of filtering through agency reports, news outlets, or data aggregators, citizens and institutions can now access official statistics directly from blockchain infrastructure‚Äîimmutable, timestamped, and globally available. For blockchain advocates, the significance  is twofold: government adoption of decentralized technology is no longer theoretical, and trusted economic data has become programmable within decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. Markets move, policies shift, and businesses plan around its quarterly updates. Get $10 in Bitcoin when you register through a referral link from an existing member. But traditional publication methods rely on centralized servers and intermediaries‚Äîmaking them vulnerable to manipulation, selective access, or delays. At the heart of this initiative are blockchain, middleware that bridges real-world data with decentralized networks. Oracles solve a key problem: blockchains are self-contained and cannot natively access external information. Together, these oracles ensure data integrity using cryptographic proofs and decentralized validation. For years, blockchain advocates pitched decentralized tech as a way to improve public services. Earlier efforts focused on land registries, supply chains, or digital IDs. Economic data‚Äîarguably the backbone of democratic accountability‚Äîmarks a more central and politically sensitive use case. The Department of Commerce said : ‚ÄúPublishing GDP on-chain is not just about embracing new technology‚Äîit's about giving citizens the tools to hold us accountable with verifiable, tamper-proof data.‚Äù With government data now available, algorithmic trading strategies can consume official statistics instantly‚Äîwithout waiting for them to trickle through legacy newswires. The U.S. isn't alone in experimenting with blockchain for public transparency. Countries from Estonia to Singapore have tested distributed ledgers for public registries and finance. But the scale and symbolism of putting data on-chain set this case apart. The Department of Commerce's partnership could thus become a template for governments navigating both digital transformation and public skepticism. When only a few institutions control access to economic statistics, public trust erodes‚Äîespecially in times of political tension. It empowers citizens, journalists, academics, and investors to verify data independently. It removes ambiguity over whether numbers were ‚Äúmassaged‚Äù for political ends. And it does so in a way that's globally accessible, not limited to those with expensive terminals or institutional subscriptions. Making the data instantly accessible to over 600 connected applications across more than 100 blockchains.‚Äù The Department of Commerce's decision to publish GDP and related economic indicators on public blockchains is more than a technical milestone. Blockchain, once dismissed as niche, is now being trusted to handle some of the nation's most important data. The future could see a world where inflation rates, unemployment figures, and even election results are verified on-chain. Whether this vision unfolds smoothly will depend on regulation, adoption, and education. But one thing is clear: the line between government and decentralized technology has blurred. What does it mean to put GDP on the blockchain? Publishing GDP on the blockchain means that official U.S. government economic data, such as gross domestic product, is uploaded directly to decentralized networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This ensures the information is immutable (cannot be changed), globally accessible, and verifiable by anyone. Why is the Department of Commerce using Chainlink and Pyth? The Department of Commerce selected oracle providers Chainlink and Pyth because they specialize in securely transmitting real-world data to blockchains. These oracles act as trusted bridges between traditional government databases and decentralized systems. By making GDP data available on-chain, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols can build products that automatically respond to macroeconomic trends. For example, lending platforms could adjust collateral requirements based on GDP growth, while synthetic assets or derivatives could track government-reported data in real time. Hedge funds and institutional traders may also plug these feeds into algorithmic strategies. What risks or challenges come with publishing economic data on-chain? Concentrating trust in just two oracle providers creates potential risks if they fail or are compromised. Additionally, raw numbers without context may confuse citizens, and some lawmakers remain cautious about embedding government data into crypto infrastructure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Friday, the Ethereum Foundation outlined a multi-track roadmap to make Ethereum feel ‚Äúlike one chain again,‚Äù publishing a protocol update that prioritizes faster confirmations, trust-minimized cross-chain interactions, and new UX and privacy tooling on crypto's second-largest blockchain. The plan introduces a trio of workstreams dubbed ‚ÄúInitialisation,‚Äù ‚ÄúAcceleration,‚Äù and ‚ÄúFinalisation.‚Äù It also shares deliverables and target dates extending into 2026, according to the official blog post. Under the Initialisation stream, EF engineers and ecosystem teams are rolling out an Open Intents Framework that lets users express desired outcomes. Additionally, developers proposed an Ethereum Interoperability Layer aimed at facilitating trustless transactions across Layer 2 networks, along with a set of standards designed to reduce friction. "The Ethereum Interoperability Layer (EIL) focuses on making Ethereum feel like one chain again, without compromising on CROPS values (censorship-resistance, open-source, privacy, and security), developers wrote. Production contracts for the intents framework are live, with audits and a reference solver due by Q4 2025. A fast L1 confirmation rule‚Äîgiving strong confirmations in roughly 15‚Äì30 seconds‚Äîwill be specified and implemented across consensus clients, with broad availability targeted for Q1 2026. There are also plans to support optimistic rollups that adopt ZK-based real-time proving or a secure ‚Äú2-of-3‚Äù faster settlement mechanism to reduce withdrawal delays. The Finalisation stream pushes toward research and development of real-time proving, or snarkification, for cross-chain settlement and materially faster Layer 1 finality. Snarkifying or snarkification refers to utilizing zero-knowledge proofs, specifically ZK-SNARKS, to improve the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) environment. According to the Aug. 29 blog update, developers are exploring options such as changes to the beacon chain, three-slot finality designs, and alternative consensus protocols that reduce finality to seconds if proven safe and decentralized. The latest protocol update ties the UX agenda to two ongoing EF initiatives aimed at advancing Ethereum's global computer plan. First, Phase 2 of the ‚ÄúTrillion Dollar Security‚Äù program, which focuses on safer signing, key management, and wallet standards. It also links to ‚ÄúKohaku,‚Äù a privacy wallet effort co-led by Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin and EF coordinator Nicolas Consigny. It aims to ship an SDK and an advanced browser extension with private addresses, balances, and sends backed by a light client. In other related news, onchain activity on Ethereum has surged while developers work to improve the blockchain's engine room.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I was a college student studying accounting in the mid-1990s, and one of my projects was to decide if the Internet could become a viable platform for commerce. At the time, we couldn't imagine using a credit card online. Or buying shoes on a computer. Like many people then, we underestimated what would become the most important technological advancement of our lives. In the long run, though, my college experience would give me a deeper understanding of the forces of innovation. That insight led me to found Pure Crypto, a digital asset investment firm which was the best-performing hedge fund-of-funds globally between 2018 and 2025. Since launching Pure Crypto, I've watched digital assets transform from a fringe experiment into a Wall Street-approved asset class. Despite this, I believe crypto is still in its early days. It sounds counterintuitive to call something ‚Äúearly‚Äù when it's created trillions in value, but consider how few people own crypto ‚Äî only about 6.8% of people globally at the end of 2024. What that tells me is simple: When a transformative technology arrives, the window of opportunity is longer and bigger than it looks. One of the biggest shifts in my approach ‚Äî and maybe the reason I didn't misjudge crypto like I did the Internet ‚Äî was learning to dig deeper. When I initially dismissed the Internet as a viable commercial platform, I didn't understand the infrastructure. I looked at the surface ‚Äî what seemed possible then ‚Äî instead of understanding what might come next. With crypto, I've made an effort to be more tenaciously curious. I want to know how a system creates trust without intermediaries, what incentives are built into the design and whether it unlocks new behaviors or markets that weren't possible before. One thing crypto taught me quickly: you can't do this alone. It's such a fast-moving, interdisciplinary space that no one can fully keep up on their own. It was about being in rooms where I could learn. That's become a theme throughout my journey. Some of the most important insights I've gained in this space haven't come from a spreadsheet or whitepaper, but from conversations. From putting myself around people who were thinking deeply about this technology in ways I wasn't yet. Finally, if there's one thing I've come to believe about innovation, it's that the most important shifts don't happen overnight. The early Internet dates back to the 1950s ‚Äî but it took decades to evolve from an academic tool into a global engine of commerce. Crypto reminds me of that timeline. The hype cycles come and go, but the underlying arc ‚Äî turbulent, relentless ‚Äî keeps bending forward. To tune out the noise and look for the quieter signals: where real adoption is happening, where infrastructure is quietly being built and where people are solving hard problems, not chasing trends. But it might be the most underappreciated edge in a space like this.

CRO price prediction is heating up after Cronos recorded its biggest surge in 3 years, breaking the $0.30 mark. Gains from July has reached nearly 400% with investors booking profit, resulting in a pullback. CRO price is currently hovering at $0.29 with a 14.37% drop in the last 24 hours. The project has already raised over $12.5 million in its ongoing presale and is gaining significant traction as the first Bitcoin L2 blockchain addressing congestion issues. The crypto market continues to be dynamic, with huge volatility, bringing Cronos into focus as investors witness an overwhelming price surge. A lower time frame analysis shows that the $0.28-$0.29 zone has been acting as a strong support level, with the price bouncing from this level twice. A Crypto Pulse analyst recently posted that the CRO price is currently cooling off after its recent run. He pointed to an ascending trendline of support and noted that if the trendline were to fail, the price could drive another correction. He pointed out the levels to be dip buy opportunities for a possible bounce. Cronos is cooling off after its run, as $CRO loses the trendline and price action looks to be undergoing a correction.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Their value can fluctuate significantly based on factors such as perceived utility, technological innovation, market sentiment, or pure speculation. While some altcoins support innovative blockchain applications, many‚Äîincluding meme coins‚Äîlack fundamental value and trade primarily on hype, making them especially volatile. With over 18,000 altcoins available, investors must conduct thorough due diligence before investing in any project. This includes researching the technology, development team, use case, and tokenomics of each coin. For risk averse investors, alternatives such as crypto-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or regulated staking services. Altcoins, short for "alternative coins," are any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin (and sometimes Ethereum). The first altcoins, Namecoin and Litecoin, were created in 2011 as developers sought to improve upon Bitcoin's limitations. Now, these tokens can serve a variety of purposes such as governance rights, smart contracts, decentralised finance (DeFi), and native network transactions, which gives them their value. Many altcoins are directly tied to innovations within their ecosystems, meaning increased adoption and utility can drive corresponding increases in token value. For investors, altcoins with strong fundamentals from reputable projects can be a good portfolio diversification option. However, the speculative nature of altcoins creates significant variation in profitability, with smaller-capitalization or lesser-known projects sometimes outperforming larger, potentially better known altcoins, rewarding risk-tolerant investors who were willing to hold positions long-term. When Bitcoin dominance is high, altcoins typically experience slower growth as investors prefer to allocate capital to Bitcoin, but when Bitcoin fever subsides, investors often rotate their funds into alternative cryptocurrencies, creating opportunities for altcoins to grow. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Ripple with selling XRP as an unregistered security. Before investing in any altcoin, you should check if the project faces current or foreseeable regulatory challenges, as legal battles can severely impact token prices regardless of the project's underlying fundamentals. Like every other asset class, altcoins can be subject to scams and ‚Äúrug pulls,‚Äù where developers abandon projects after collecting investor funds. While no approach is completely fail-safe, it's advisable to stick with altcoins listed on popular, regulated exchanges. These exchanges also provide additional security measures and regulatory oversight that can help protect investors from market manipulation, though you should still conduct your own research. When buying altcoins, be wary of new projects with no price history or proven performance track record. It's generally better to invest in tokens that are at least one to two years old and have demonstrated consistent value, one study says, especially in comparison to new projects promising instant returns within incredibly short timeframes. For example, Solana has experienced multiple technical vulnerabilities, including core protocol outages, that created fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) among investors, causing the price to fall sharply at those times Sudden moves like that can immediately lead to huge unrealized losses. Altcoins can be exciting investments, and you might be tempted to allocate a large percentage of your portfolio to them, especially during bullish markets when prices are rising rapidly. Remember that cryptocurrencies are a highly volatile asset class, and if you become overweight in altcoins, even small changes in the market could significantly tilt your portfolio, affecting its overall performance. It's a process that‚Äîin short‚Äîpays you crypto for locking up coins with normal volatility, like Cardano, and even stable coins like USDC for a specific period. Basically, you lend your crypto to others, who pay interest. DeFi yield farming provides higher returns than staking but with more complexity and risk. In yield farming, you provide liquidity to decentralized protocols in exchange for interest and rewards, though this strategy demands deep technical knowledge and exposes you to smart contract risks, impermanent loss, and potential protocol failures. These vehicles give you diversified exposure to multiple altcoins through traditional brokerage accounts. Meanwhile, you benefit from professional management and regulatory oversight, which are far less available to individuals trading directly in altcoin. Altcoins, especially lower-cap ones, allow you to invest with as little as $10 in some cases, providing an excellent opportunity to test the waters and see what fits your portfolio without significant capital commitment. When investing, avoid concentrating on just one narrative since the cryptocurrency market spans diverse sectors such as gaming, media, NFTs, and AI. Instead, choose altcoins from at least two to three different narratives. This diversified approach helps reduce concentration risk while allowing you to benefit from different growth cycles. When buying altcoins, only buy those that can be stored on reputable and secure wallets or bought through well-recognised exchanges. These steps will help you avoid hassles over accessibility, security, and liquidity. This approach also ensures you maintain control over your assets. Always monitor general news and changing regulations, as these can quickly impact your altcoin holdings. If you are directly buying altcoins through spot trading, have a solid exit and profit-taking strategy in place before making any investment. This disciplined approach will minimize your losses and prevent you from losing much or all of your capital in the event something goes catastrophically wrong and the altcoin goes to zero, as happened with Terraform Lab's LUNA and TerraUSD. However, before you begin researching these alternative assets, remember they are subject to high volatility, even more than Bitcoin. Thoroughly research any project you are interested in, checking for vital signs like utility, tokenomics, and regulatory status. While some altcoins come with risks like rug pulls and unverifiable track records, there are still many altcoins that can pass these checks and make a good fit for your portfolio.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>‚ÄúThere is no question that you have made an unbelievable mark on cryptocurrencies,‚Äù said the second son of US President Donald Trump in his chat with Bitcoin Asia's CEO David Bailey. The younger Trump, who was in Hong Kong to promote his American Bitcoin venture with Hut 8, delivered one of the highlights during the two-day event, which has attracted more than 17,000 attendees, more than triple last year's total. ‚ÄúThe hospitality you showed me since we've come into town has been unbelievable.‚Äù ‚ÄúHong Kong has been positioned by Beijing to be the place where they can experiment with their bitcoin policy in their digital asset policy,‚Äù Bailey said. ‚ÄúSo they've identified this as the meeting point for the world to discuss this topic as it relates to China.‚Äù By submitting, you consent to receiving marketing emails from SCMP. Unlike cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are a type of digital currency pegged one-to-one to fiat currencies and reserve assets such as the US dollar, designed to provide price stability. The stablecoins issued in Hong Kong will have to be similarly backed by assets. The younger Trump said his journey in cryptocurrency began after US banks including JPMorgan and Bank of America refused to accept Donald Trump as a customer. ‚ÄúPeople always ask me: if the banks had not shut down all your accounts, do you think you would be doing this?‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúI started meeting some of the greatest people I've ever met in my life, who believe in the future, believe in technology [and] are great people who wanted to build dynamic companies that could transform the future of life. The US State Department had been urging American visitors to the city to ‚Äúexercise increased caution‚Äù since it updated its travel warning in November 2024. The move to expand globally was a boon for greater bitcoin adoption and its shareholders, Genoot said. American Bitcoin's merger with Nasdaq-listed Gryphon Digital Mining will grant it a listing status. Since the acquisition announcement in mid-May, Gryphon's shares have surged nearly 231 per cent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cryptocurrencies have evolved significantly from being viewed solely as speculative assets. Today, they're powering new technologies that touch everyday life, from secure healthcare data to more intelligent devices at home. Their lists do not only comprise popular names but also highlight some up-and-coming tokens with serious potential. The willingness of these platforms to support a token with exposure, liquidity, or integration often gauges market confidence. Industry trackers bring all of these signals together in a way that's easy to digest. They compile insights from experts, exchanges, and communities to provide investors with a more comprehensive picture. For example, upcoming Coinbase listings are often highlighted in these watchlists, and for many people, that's the kind of cue that suggests a project has reached a certain threshold of credibility. Community discussions are less formal but very powerful as early adoption signals. If developers, enthusiasts, and skeptics are all discussing a certain coin, then yes, it has gained some real traction. It might not be featured in glossy magazines or newspapers, but it can be found in Forums, Social Media Groups, and Discord Channels, where genuine excitement and participation are beginning to build. Payment processors that allow for the direct integration of crypto into everyday purchases, in actuality, make digital assets far less abstract. It is a well-known fact that sending money overseas has traditionally been expensive and time-consuming; yet, fintech-enabled crypto solutions are substantially reducing these costs and delays. This kind of family that depends on remittances will, in most cases, receive a shoulder as well, almost instantly; this shows how workable crypto can be when well implemented. Even traditional finance has begun to learn from these fintech-led innovations. According to people specializing in outsourced MSP staffing services, the industry, apart from finance, is already observing that fintech and crypto partnerships reconfigure expectations, demonstrating how far-reaching this influence has become. Healthcare is one of those sectors where blockchain can help solve long-standing problems concerning secure data. Tokenized health records would mean that patients could access their information without relying on a centralized institution to store it. This empowers the individual while still keeping sensitive medical data under strong protection. Medical research would also benefit from transparent information enabled by blockchain. Immutably sharing data reduces duplication and eliminates the possibility of manipulating trial results. Researchers can work with confidence, knowing that no data has been altered or hidden to fit a narrative. For patients, it results in better plans or faster settlements. Not only does this benefit resource-wise, but it also makes the whole space a more attractive proposition for environmentally conscious users. This way, blockchain technology can render carbon offset markets more transparent and accessible. Users and organizations will be able to track the progress of their contributions, rather than being directed into opaque systems, and see the measurable environmental impact of their participation. Some incentivize energy production from renewable sources in a direct manner. When individuals or companies produce clean power, they are rewarded with tokens, creating a reinforcing cycle of cryptocurrency and sustainability. Partnership with eco-enterprises is the key to scaling these solutions. It sheds light on the fact that blockchain can support industries well beyond finance, demonstrating that technology and sustainability can sometimes go hand in hand. Seamless payments make the concept of a truly connected environment much more practical. Safe machine-to-machine communication is also a key aspect of this evolution. IoT devices generally have poor security, but with blockchain, a foundation for tamper-proof logs and authentication can be established. When your smart lock communicates with your phone, you want that connection to be verifiable and secure, and crypto-backed solutions can provide exactly that. Decentralized IoT marketplaces are the first to give a glimpse of what such scale fusion looks like. Picture a grid where your neighbor's battery can top up directly from your solar panels, selling surplus power through token-based transactions within the same household, thereby bypassing intermediaries and saving costs while making the system more efficient. Smart home automation is already familiar to many people, but incorporating blockchain adds another layer of trust. Devices could manage access, energy use, and maintenance schedules automatically, with every action recorded on an immutable ledger. From sustainability to fintech partnerships, these projects are quietly building tools that improve daily life. Recognizing them early offers a glimpse into how digital assets can become an essential part of tomorrow's technology.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also praised the decision to bring America on-chain and thanked Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick for his leadership. See Also: Ethereum Is ‚ÄòThe Wall Street Token', Jan van Eck Says The Commerce Department announced that it published the second-quarter GDP results on nine blockchains, including Bitcoin BTC/USD, Ethereum ETH/USD and Solana SOL/USD, marking the first time a federal agency put official macroeconomic data on blockchain rails. The data was also disseminated through coordination with Chainlink LINK/USD and Pyth Network PYTH/USD, the oracle networks that help bring real-world, off-chain data to smart contracts. Over time, the government is expected to post data such as the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index and Real Final Sales to Private Domestic Purchasers on-chain, Chainlink said. ‚ÄúWe are making America's economic truth immutable and globally accessible like never before,‚Äù Lutnick said. While blockchain data is designed to be immutable, i.e, cannot be edited or deleted, some networks have reversed transactions to recover hacked funds. The most notable incident that comes to mind is Ethereum's  Decentralized Autonomous Organization hack in 2016. LINK token traded up 1.5% to $24.20 at last check.
