France, Germany, and the UK (E3) have announced they will trigger snapback sanctions on Iran at the United Nations. This will launch a 30-day process that will likely culminate in the full reinstatement of all U.N. sanctions lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. First, the U.N. Security Council will formally adopt the demand — pushed by Israel — that Iran cease all uranium enrichment. Israel designed this demand to sabotage nuclear diplomacy and edge the conflict toward war. Next, a U.N. arms embargo on Iran will return, potentially curbing Tehran's ability to rebuild deterrence against future Israeli or American strikes, provided Russia and China treat the snapback as legitimate and enforce it. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. And finally, far from advancing diplomacy, the measure risks accelerating escalation. While Israel hardly needs a pretext to launch another strike on Iran, as I have argued, snapback could provide useful political cover — a thin veneer of legitimacy — for renewed attacks. On the surface, these demands may seem reasonable. Iranian officials suspect the IAEA of leaking sensitive information that enabled Mossad's assassination campaign against their nuclear scientists, and they fear that revealing the stockpile's location could simply invite another round of U.S. airstrikes. The E3 now insists Tehran return to talks, yet they make no parallel demand that Washington refrain from bombing again. Perhaps most importantly, given the unbridgeable gap over enrichment, Trump's limited patience for diplomacy, and Israeli pressure to resume hostilities, restarting talks that are almost certain to collapse — unless both sides show greater flexibility on enrichment — only increases the likelihood that war will start sooner rather than later. When it was created in 2003, its purpose was to prevent the Bush administration — fresh off its disastrous and illegal invasion of Iraq — from launching another war, this time against Iran. The EU is also far more dependent on the transatlantic relationship than it was 20 years ago, while successive rounds of sanctions have rendered Iran a negligible economic partner for Europe. Escalation with Iran through snapback now serves two EU objectives: punishing Tehran for supporting Russia in Ukraine, and aligning Europe with hawkish elements in the Trump administration — an alignment calculated to ease tensions in other areas of a transatlantic relationship under unprecedented duress. After all, Germany's chancellor has openly admitted that Israel “did Europe's dirty work for it” by bombing Iran in June.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some restaurants in the US capital have closed their doors as workers stay home rather than risk deportation Hernán was at the Latin American restaurant that he owns with his brother in the Northwest quadrant of Washington DC last week when his staff started getting phone calls and messages about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) checkpoints in the neighborhood. Within hours, Hernán had to close their doors, and the restaurant hasn't been open since. “Literally after President Trump brought the national guard on DC, everything stopped,” said Hernán, who requested his last name not be used due to fears of Ice retaliation. Hernán, who also owns a restaurant in Maryland, said he was hoping to be able to reopen in a few weeks if and when the Trump administration's takeover of the DC police ends and immigration enforcement arrests become less frequent. Already suffering from fewer customers due to the administration's almost three-week-long crackdown, restaurants are also having to contend with staff shortages because many immigrants, both documented and undocumented, fear coming into DC and being on the streets, and some have been detained by Ice. Trump has attempted to claim that the crackdown is benefiting restaurants. “Half the restaurants closed, because nobody could go, because they were afraid to go outside,” he told reporters on Monday about Washington before his intervention. Some restaurants, like Hernán's, have had to close their doors. “Restaurants will close because you have troops with guns and federal agents harassing people … making people afraid to go out,” José Andrés, the well-known Washington restaurateur, wrote on social media. Immigrants account for 253,000 workers, or 36% of the workforce, in DC's restaurants, hotels and related sectors, according to Migrant Insider, which cited data from FWD.us. Included in that total are 42,000 self-employed immigrant entrepreneurs running local food and service businesses. “Last week, two of our beloved team members were detained while simply walking home from work,” the restaurant wrote. He's looking for people who live in DC, speak Spanish and English, and are willing to come into work so that they can reopen. “But I don't know if we can find people,” he said. About a mile away, near the Columbia Heights neighborhood, a sign in Spanish on the door of Elizabeth Pupusería & Deli hung up last week read: “We are closed temporarily during the terrible situation in our larger neighborhood. Let's take care of ourselves and stay safe in our homes.” Our business relied on construction workers because they are the big groups that came to bring various orders for all their colleagues. She hasn't been able to pay any of her staff these last two weeks – only she and her daughter-in-law are coming in. The restaurant doesn't typically allow delivery, but Rodriguez is thinking about changing that if it reopens because so many people don't want to leave their homes. “Today I said, ‘Today is the right time to add delivery,' so I called DoorDash and he told me that he doesn't have workers because most of them have been taken and others are afraid to leave.” Ice has reportedly been targeting delivery drivers on mopeds, worsening the crisis for restaurants. Several videos of Ice detaining delivery drivers have spread across social media, and the Washington Post reported, citing anonymous police sources, that Ice is accompanying officers with DC's Metropolitan police department to conduct traffic stops of moped drivers to check their immigration status. “You don't want to go outside,” Yonatan Colmenarez, an asylum seeker who came from Venezuela two years ago and has driven a moped around DC, told the Post.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Government faces calls for police reform amid violent clashes across Jakarta and demonstrations in other cities Hundreds of Indonesians have protested at sites across Jakarta over the death of a man hit by a police vehicle, in the first big test for Prabowo Subianto's nearly year-old government. The man, a motorcycle ride-sharing driver, was hit at the site of violent clashes near parliament on Thursday as police sought to disperse demonstrators protesting about a number of issues including lawmakers' pay and education funding. The military was deployed in some areas, footage broadcast by local media showed. “We don't want our colleagues here to become victims of this riot again,” he told Reuters, urging action against those at fault. Protesters were undeterred by the earlier remarks of Prabowo, the country's president, who called for calm, expressed condolences for Kurniawan's death and ordered a thorough investigation. Drivers wearing their signature green jackets also staged protests in other cities, including Surabaya and Bandung on Java island, and Gorontalo on the island of Sulawesi. The stock index fell by as much as 2.3% to hit its lowest point since 12 August, before closing 1.5% down after recovering some of its losses on Friday. “If Prabowo isn't careful … protests may devolve into chaos,” Made Supriatma, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, told Reuters. As Thursday's protest persisted into the night, local media reported that riot police fired teargas and used water cannon to try to disperse people. A motorcycle drivers' association said Kurniawan was not involved in the protests. On Friday afternoon, the national police official Abdul Karim told reporters that authorities would detain for 20 days the seven police officers who were in the vehicle that hit Kurniawan for a breach of ethics and said questioning was taking place. After Kurniawan's death, a group led by motorcycle drivers protested in front of the riot police's headquarters on Thursday night and on Friday, local media reported. “We are deeply disappointed, especially with the security officials and national police chief,” Ari Potret, a driver who attended Kurniawan's funeral, told Reuters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ernst, 55, has been wrestling with the decision for months, but began telling friends in recent days. Her retirement creates an open Senate seat in Iowa. Rep. Ashley Hinson is making plans to jump into the race, one GOP official says. National Republicans, anticipating Ernst's retirement, have long said they believe Hinson would be a strong candidate. The party's primary field includes state Rep. Josh Turek, a Paralympian wheelchair basketball player, state Sen. Zach Wahls, Knoxville Chamber of Commerce executive director Nathan Sage and Des Moines School Board chair Jackie Norris. Ernst has come under fire since responding “we are all going to die” to a constituent at a town meeting who raised concerns about Medicaid cuts in Trump's policy megabill. She was first elected in 2014 on a pledge to cut government spending with her signature slogan: “Make ‘em squeal.” As the Republican Party has evolved under President Donald Trump, Ernst has often struggled to strike a balance between GOP voters identifying with Trump's “Make America Great Again” movement and those who don't. A decade ago, Iowa was a critical swing state won by Barack Obama twice and then by Donald Trump in 2016. The state swung partially back in Democrats' favor in 2018, with Democratic candidates winning three of Iowa's four US House seats. But Republicans have dominated since then — winning all statewide races except auditor, a post held by current Democratic gubernatorial candidate Rob Sand, and ultimately claiming all four House seats. However, Iowa Democrats point to the party's stronger performance compared to 2024 results in special elections this year — including a victory in a conservative state Senate district this week — as evidence that the tide could turn in 2026. The party's top target is an open-seat race in North Carolina. But Democrats also aim to be competitive in some combination of Maine, where Democratic Gov. Janet Mills this week said she is “seriously considering” running against GOP Sen. Susan Collins; Ohio, where former Sen. Sherrod Brown is attempting to mount a political comeback by running against incumbent Republican Sen. Jon Husted; and Texas, where Sen. John Cornyn faces a stiff primary challenge from conservative firebrand Attorney General Ken Paxton — who Democrats view as a more favorable general election opponent. This story has been updated with additional details.</p>

In a letter sent to Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon on August 25, a group of Democratic senators, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts), condemned the department's decision to remove the ‘Submit a Complaint' button on the Office of Federal Student Aid's (FSA) website. Since Trump's inauguration in January, the department has laid off approximately 1,300 people, close to half of its staff. Many of those employees handled borrowers' complaints, according to the senators. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. “What was once a simple click from the Department of Education's homepage, is now a multi-step, illogical navigation process,” they wrote in their August 25 letter. On the bottom of the FSA homepage, on the left hand side, in a font smaller than almost everything else on the page, it says: “Help Center | Contact Us | Site Feedback.” If the user clicks on “Site Feedback,” a pop-up asks, “What kind of feedback are you sharing today?” Two options are provided — “Website Feedback” and “Other.” If the user clicks “Other,” they're finally provided with a link to submit a complaint. In March, Politico reported that emails between Education Department staffers show that they intentionally hid the button in order to reduce the number of complaints received. “Removing the ‘Submit a Complaint' button on Studentaid.gov is already underway,” Mell Brittian-Smith, a senior Education Department employee, wrote in an email obtained by Politico, adding that they would also like to remove the word “feedback” from the site. “I believe this change would help decrease contact center volume and the number of complaints that the Ombuds office receives — so an overall win,” she wrote. More than half of those complaints were related to student loan repayment. As Department of Education secretary, McMahon, a former professional wrestling executive, has championed budget cuts, layoffs and, ultimately, the end of the department altogether. Earlier this year, the department stopped forgiving student loan debt for people enrolled in the Income-Based Repayment Program, without notifying Congress or borrowers. The department has not said when it will resume forgiving borrowers' debt.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to the top Hungarian diplomat, due to the European Union's serious political mistakes, including its military support for Ukraine and anti-Russian sanctions, Europe has turned into a "continent of war," has lost its competitive capacities and now is lagging behind the United States and China. "Instead of putting an end to the war, they opted to expand it, which entailed apparent losses for Europe from the point of view of its socio-economic security, inflation, growing food, energy prices and so on. And once the war ends, European political leaders will have to answer the question of why they chose this strategy. It is becoming clear why Western European leaders are not interested in the cessation of the war," he said addressing the Transit annual political festival in Tihany on Lake Balaton shore. "Half of the country is in ruins, hundreds of thousands of people have died, millions have become refugees seeking to escape an economic collapse, and so on and so forth. And if an agreement is signed now, it is obvious that because of the battlefield situation it cannot be more favorable for Ukraine than the deal that would have been done three years ago. That is why the question of why they did not want to negotiate three and a half years ago when a more advantageous deal was quite possible will be asked not only to the European leaders but also to the Ukrainian president," Szijjarto said. "Why wasn't any peace agreement signed there? Who did such instructions come from and who forced Zelensky not to sign this agreement and continue the war? However, this agreement never took effect because Kiev changed its position due to the interference of Western leaders. The agreement bound Ukraine to proclaim its neutral, off-bloc status and refuse from deploying foreign-made weapons in its territory.</p>

NEW YORK, August 29. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump has ordered that former Vice President and ex-Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris be barred from receiving government security protection provided by Secret Service agents, CNN reported.

According to the broadcaster, Harris had been granted six months of protection after her term ended, which was set to be extended for another year under a directive signed by former President Joe Biden shortly before leaving office. Trump's order revoked this directive.

"You [Secret Service agents] are hereby authorized to discontinue any security-related procedures previously authorized by Executive Memorandum, beyond those required by law, for the following individual, effective September 1, 2025: Former Vice President Kamala D. Harris," CNN quoted the document as saying.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump revoked Kamala Harris' Secret Service protection on Thursday, according to a copy of a letter reviewed by CNN. Harris, as a former vice president, received six months of protection after leaving office, according to federal law. However, her protection had been extended for an additional year via a directive –﻿ not made public until now – signed by then-President Joe Biden shortly before leaving office, according to multiple people familiar with the undisclosed arrangement. “You are hereby authorized to discontinue any security-related procedures previously authorized by Executive Memorandum, beyond those required by law, for the following individual, effective September 1, 2025: Former Vice President Kamala D. Harris,” the letter reads in full. Leadership within the agency did not flag any security concerns or push back from the White House's order, the official said, who noted that Harris's detail would range from a dozen to a few dozen agents depending on her schedule and shift changes for 24-hour security. Trump's ending of Harris' protection comes as she soon embarks on a multi-city, high-profile book tour around the release of “107 Days,” her new memoir on her short presidential campaign, set to be released September 23. That will put her more in the public spotlight than she has been since leaving office, during which time she's attended only a few public events. “The Vice President is grateful to the United States Secret Service for their professionalism, dedication, and unwavering commitment to safety,” Kirsten Allen, a Harris senior adviser, told CNN. There were two assassination attempts against Trump during his run for president last year. Harris, according to people familiar with her security operations, faced particular security concerns given that she was the first woman and first Black woman in the role. But what will now disappear is not just the agents assigned to guard her in person, 24-7: Secret Service protection includes constant analysis of threat intelligence and covering in-person situations, emails, texts and social media. With her detail canceled, Harris aides are worried they will lose the same access to threat warnings, the people familiar with her security operations said. Her home, in the middle of Los Angeles, will also stop being protected by federal agents. Trump rescinds security clearances of political rivals Harris, Clinton and others Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, lost his own personal detail on July 21 under the standard provisions for a former vice president's spouse. Gavin Newsom was briefed on Harris losing her protection late Thursday. A person familiar with the discussions told CNN that the governor's office could not comment on security arrangements or methods which may be activated as a replacement. However, Newsom spokesperson Bob Salladay expressed outrage about Trump making the change. “The safety of our public officials should never be subject to erratic, vindictive political impulses,” Salladay told CNN. Harris, as a Los Angeles resident, could also receive protection from the city police department. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Newsom were in touch Thursday evening about the situation. This puts the former Vice President in danger and I look forward to working with the Governor to make sure Vice President Harris is safe in Los Angeles,” Bass told CNN in a statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia launches mass overnight drone and missile attack on Kyiv, killing at least 21 North Korea's Kim and Russia's Putin to join Xi in China for Second World War victory parade They also discussed European troops' deployment in Ukraine to guarantee security and monitor a peace that seems distant as American efforts to broker peace between Ukraine and Russia appear stalled. Kyiv's European allies are looking to set up a force that could backstop any peace agreement, and a coalition of 30 countries, including European nations, Japan and Australia, has signed up to support the initiative. On Thursday, two missiles landed about 50 metres from an EU diplomatic mission in Kyiv, shattering the office's windows and doors but causing no injuries there. The UN Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting on air strikes against Ukraine on Friday afternoon at the request of Ukraine and five European council members – Britain, France, Slovenia, Denmark and Greece. Two of Ukraine's top envoys were set to meet Friday with the Trump administration regarding mediation. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky after Thursday's attack on Kyiv. Leavitt noted that Ukraine has also launched effective assaults on Russia's oil industry in recent weeks. “Perhaps both sides of this war are not ready to end it themselves,” Leavitt said. In Copenhagen, Kallas said defence ministers from across the 27-nation bloc discussed increasing sanctions on Russia, ramping up defence supplies to Ukraine's army and European contribution to postwar security guarantees, which could include EU training missions into Ukraine once a ceasefire is in place. Lithuania's Defense Minister Dovilė Šakalienė said the attack on Kyiv on Thursday shows that hope now for peace is “naive” and that “all Putin is doing is really stalling, actually cheaply buying time to kill more people and to imitate sort of willingness to maybe stop his own murderous actions.” She said Europe must deal with Russia more forcefully, like seizing frozen Russian assets. “It's imperative that those of us in the European Union now consider further sanctions, what more measures can be taken to increase the pressure on Russia to end this brutal and aggressive war on Ukraine and the huge impact that that's having on civilians,” he said. European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen began a tour of EU nations bordering Russia or Belarus on Friday, including visits to arms factories and border installations. She met Friday with Latvian Prime Minister Evika Silina and toured a drone manufacturer. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week, I wrote about how empty nesting might become a past concept as more parents are supporting their kids financially well into their 20s and 30s. According to Bank of Montreal's Real Financial Progress Index released earlier this month, 29 per cent of Canadians surveyed believe financial support should last as long as the parents are alive. Twenty-two per cent said it's when their child secures full-time employment, with 18 per cent planning to assist financially until the child moves out of the family house. “It boils down to personal and family values,” he says. “I've seen cases in which people refuse to retire until they know their kids are completely set up.” Put another way, money originally earmarked toward ramping up parents' retirement savings is going toward helping their kids instead, he says. Some parents, for example, have enough to retire and need more financial data, reassuring them it still works with adult kids at home. He says some kids are on track to have a strong financial footing, but parents still worry about retiring. Mr. Pesa says that generally, immigrant families have always embraced the full nest with no restrictions. Kids are encouraged to stay home until they marry and start their own respective families. “In some of these cases, the kids actually purchase properties and keep them as rentals while staying with their parents,” he says. Still, as adult kids at home consider their situation and delayed milestones, that may cause them to rethink whether parenthood is in their cards for the future. The same BMO survey found that while seven in 10 members of Generation Z and millennials would like children, they worry about financial security. And it's more than a valid feeling, as 53 per cent of Canadians surveyed admitted that having children did compromise their financial security. Google Maps is your tax friend: The Tax Court of Canada has ruled in favour of a taxpayer who deducted relocation expenses related to a move for a new job, relying on Google Maps to demonstrate he met the distance threshold requirement. Retirement system reform: A leading investment industry group is calling for policy changes to update Canada's retirement income system, warning that without reforms, many Canadians may fall short of what they need in retirement. GIS, RRIF relief for retirees: The federal government plans to follow through on the proposed policy changes for both guaranteed income supplement payments and registered retirement income fund accounts, although it is not clear when those measures will take effect. Trust is a two-way street: A new research paper found that when advisors trusted clients, they were more likely to value and follow the advice. Advisors who didn't show signs of trust in the client were associated with advice that was valued less. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv overnight on Aug. 28, which left 23 dead, is undermining peace efforts led by U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukraine's allies, President Volodymyr Zelensky said later the same day. And it is also a strike by Russia against President Trump, and against other global actors," Zelensky said in an evening address. At least 23 people were killed in the attack on Ukraine's capital, including four children, authorities said. "This strike clearly shows that Russia's goals have not changed. Russia is now striking at everyone in the world who seeks peace," Zelensky said. Zelensky denounced Russian President Vladimir Putin for the strikes on Kyiv. Trump has previously threatened to impose secondary sanctions in the form of tariffs against Russia's trading partners if Moscow does not work towards a peace deal to end its war against Ukraine. "In Washington, we heard that Putin is supposedly ready to end the war — to meet at the leaders' level and resolve key issues. But instead, he chooses (ballistic missiles) over any real steps toward peace," Zelensky said. Trump has previously proposed facilitating a bilateral meeting between Zelensky and Putin, which could then be followed by a trilateral meeting with the U.S. leader. "He kills children in order not to talk about when and how peace will come. Putin and Trump met in Alaska on Aug. 15 as the U.S. leader intensifies efforts to broker a peace deal. "A clear response of the world to this evil is needed. There are no diplomatic opportunities that would not be ruined because of Russia. Volodymyr Ivanyshyn is a news editor for The Kyiv Independent. He is pursuing an Honors Bachelor of Arts at the University of Toronto, majoring in political science with a minor in anthropology and human geography. Volodymyr holds a Certificate in Business Fundamentals from Rotman Commerce at the University of Toronto. He previously completed an internship with The Kyiv Independent. Kallas met with the ministers in Copenhagen on Aug. 29 to discuss several issues, including security guarantees for Ukraine. "I welcome that there is broad support today to expand our EU military mission mandate to provide training and advice inside Ukraine after any truce," Kallas said. Russia has quietly expanded its Votkinsk missile plant to produce intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States. Its output has reportedly tripled since 2022, strengthening Russia's capacity to wage war. Security guarantees for Ukraine should include provisions related to army funding, agreements with NATO members, and sanctions against Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Some 22% of respondents said they are very pessimistic about a possible peace deal in Ukraine, while 45% said they are somewhat pessimistic, according to a Gallup poll. "This funding goes on top of the 1 billion euros ($1.17 billion) military aid that Belgium has already delivered," Ukraine's Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal said. The U.S. State Department approved a military sale to Ukraine for Extended Range Attack Munition (ERAM) missiles and related equipment worth an estimated $825 million, the agency announced on Aug. 28.</p>
