                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz suffered the first mid-match wobble of his US Open campaign on Friday, but he nonetheless refound his rhythm to defeat Luciano Darderi 6-2, 6-4, 6-0 and reach the fourth round. Leading by a set and 4-1, Alcaraz lost serve for the first time this week and was pulled into a second-set battle, during which he appeared to land awkwardly after a serve. The 22-year-old Spaniard took a medical timeout at 5-4 to receive treatment on his right knee, but reeled off the following seven games to regain control and race through a one-hour, 44-minute victory. “I'm feeling good, it was just a precaution that I asked for the physio,” Alcaraz said when asked about the medical timeout. “When he broke my serve, in the last point I felt something in the knee, but after five or six points it was gone. I just asked the physio to take care of the knee, so I had to be feeling good. Alcaraz, who won his first major title at the US Open in 2022, remains on track to meet four-time winner Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals. For now, though, Alcaraz faces a fourth-round clash with Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech, who rallied past countryman Benjamin Bonzi 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-2. Alcaraz leads Rinderknech 3-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. In the second set, however, Darderi produced some moments of magic of his own, including winning an epic all-court point that ended with a stunning drop volley that caught Alcaraz out to tee up two break points, eventually converting the second. “I just tried to start awake, that was important,” said Alcaraz. I think I started really well, pushing him to the limit, playing long rallies, and after that kept it going. For me, it's difficult to wake up in the mornings, so that's a good thing today that I woke up early, I did the warmup well, played good... It seems like I'm a Spanish guy!" >/p> With a Tour-leading 57 wins and six titles in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, Alcaraz is on the heels of fierce rival Jannik Sinner for the No. The Spaniard could reclaim that position for the first time since September 2023 if he matches or betters Sinner's result in New York.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Denis Shapovalov shut down his 2023 season with a troubling knee injury, he couldn't be sure he'd ever play pain-free tennis again. However, since his return last year, the Canadian has added three ATP Tour titles to his breakthrough Stockholm crown from 2019. His resurgence has undoubtedly fueled a new level of belief, and as he enters the US Open third round for a seventh time in his career, Shapovalov will need every ounce of that confidence in a clash against defending champion and World No. “I would say my confidence is very high. I would say it's different than when I was young and the confidence would be high, but it would be pretty fragile,” Shapovalov said after his second-round win against Valentin Royer. “I think now — and you can see with my results — that the confidence is there. Even if I have a bad few weeks or unlucky draws or a couple of tough matches, I'm able to bring it back and play at a high level when the next week comes. “I think that's why I have been able to win three titles in less than 12 months, and that's why I've been able to have so many great weeks recently. I definitely think that the confidence is there. Even though Shapovalov won a five-set tussle in his only previous Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Sinner at the Australian Open in 2021, the 26-year-old admits that they have both changed a lot as players since then. Shapovalov has traversed a long road back from injury, while Sinner rose to No. Shapovalov acknowledges he will have to bring his A-game if he is to challenge the defending champion, who is unbeaten at the hard-court majors since 2023. “[I'm] definitely looking forward to another matchup with him. He's not going to give too much away for me in the match. I just have to take what I can with him, take my opportunities as well when I get them, and try to stay aggressive and not let him dictate too much.” Denis Shapovalov defeats Jannik Sinner at the 2021 Australian Open. After his fourth-round exit at Wimbledon in 2023, Shapovalov ended his season and slipped outside the Top 100 by year's end. 10 did not compete for six months, and during his difficult return in 2024 fell as low as World No. Still, the Canadian — with the help of his team and family — never lost sight of his ambitions or the explosive game that he used to defeat Rafael Nadal as a teenager. It was definitely the toughest challenge I've ever had, not knowing if I would ever be back on court pain-free,” Shapovalov recalled. “There were a lot of doubtful days and tough moments. It was a long road to get back. So it was a really, really tough road, but I'm very grateful for my team and the close ones around me, because they kind of kept me going forward and kept reassuring me that the results and everything will come.” In his final tournament of the 2024 season, Shapovalov lifted his second ATP Tour trophy in Belgrade, a breakthrough that seemed to spark a new chapter. This February, Shapovalov rolled past Top 10 opponents Taylor Fritz, Tommy Paul and Casper Ruud en route to the biggest title of his career at the ATP 500 in Dallas. Shapovalov recovers from injury to win maiden ATP 500 crown: Then, after an underwhelming clay-court season and first-round loss at Wimbledon, Shapovalov struck again on the hard courts in Los Cabos, winning his fourth tour-level title without dropping a set. It's never easy to climb back in the rankings. There's a lot of new, young guys coming up. 10 in the world, it has a little bit more emphasis than when you're climbing back in the rankings. I think I'm in a great spot, winning two titles this year, playing some great tennis, into the third round here.

But the emotions of these moments, it is really theatrical. “I'm sure this is going to be a pivot point for her with her serve … she is inspirational.” ❤️We react to Coco Gauff's emotional win against Donna Vekic. Lindsay Davenport called Gauff's mid-match emotions “heartbreaking” as the reigning Roland Garros champion struggled to employ changes made by biomechanic coach Gavin MacMillan, an expert hired after Gauff's serving woes carried throughout the US Open swing.MacMillan famously reworked the serve of Aryna Sabalenka, who went on to win three Grand Slam titles and rise to her current spot as world No. MacMillan famously reworked the serve of Aryna Sabalenka, who went on to win three Grand Slam titles and rise to her current spot as world No. “It seems like everyone's got to take a step back and just say, ‘You know what? Go try and figure out this last major of the year. '”In her visit to the TC Live desk, Martina Navratilova is also waiting for Gauff to exhale, the 18-time Grand Slam champion questioning the wisdom of attempting a technical overhaul in the midst of a major tournament.“If you're trying something new and you have no idea how it's going to turn out, especially when you don't have any confidence, you really need to do it in a quiet space,” advised Navratilova. “I don't want anybody watching me except my coach and the cameras doing the video so I can figure it out.” In her visit to the TC Live desk, Martina Navratilova is also waiting for Gauff to exhale, the 18-time Grand Slam champion questioning the wisdom of attempting a technical overhaul in the midst of a major tournament.“If you're trying something new and you have no idea how it's going to turn out, especially when you don't have any confidence, you really need to do it in a quiet space,” advised Navratilova. “I don't want anybody watching me except my coach and the cameras doing the video so I can figure it out.” “I don't want anybody watching me except my coach and the cameras doing the video so I can figure it out.” The four-time US Open singles champion talked through some of her favorite memories in New York on Friday's "TC Live at the US Open. Chanda Rubin was more optimistic about Gauff's chances in Flushing Meadows, noting the 2023 champion's marked improvements in the second set versus Vekic, and from a tense first-round against Ajla Tomljanovic.“Overall, this was not a bad match in terms of numbers,” said Rubin, a 1996 Australian Open semifinalist. I'm sure this is going to be a pivot point with her serve, and it's going to be something she will ultimately put behind her. But the emotions of these moments, it is really theatrical. “I think we saw, again, how impressive Gauff is, the fact that she was able to turn that first set around. She was able to dig in and somehow win it. At times, she was visibly shaking during the changeovers and it was just so incredible how she, once again, dug in and didn't let the moment overwhelm her completely. Getting that first set was huge and she was able to run away with the second set in the end.”Gauff will be back on court on Saturday when she takes on No.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the US Open celebrates the 75th anniversary of Althea Gibson breaking tennis' colour barrier at the 1950 U.S. National Championships, Frances Tiafoe is among many Black tennis stars eager to continue her legacy. After his second-round win on Wednesday at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, Tiafoe reflected on how Gibson paved the way for him and many of his peers. "[Althea] was a true leader and an incredible person. Her and Arthur [Ashe], man," the American continued. Tiafoe also referenced Canadian teen Victoria Mboko, who won her first WTA 1000 title three weeks ago in Montreal. Answering a question about the growing African-American presence in tennis, Tiafoe explained what it means to him to be the son of Sierra Leonean immigrants. "For me, I sit in a different spot with it. Obviously, at the end of the day, yes, I'm African-American, but I'm African, right, and African-raised," he shared. You've got parents that are coming to try to make these kids' lives, give them a chance better than they had. So I understand that, being the son of immigrants. "Ultimately, to be able to see so many people of colour do great things in a predominantly white sport, it's tremendous. I think that brings unbelievable diversity to the game. I think that brings a totally different demographic for the game. "Obviously I had a ton of great examples before me and will have a bunch of people come after me. "African-Americans in tennis, we're at an all-time high right now.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coco Gauff didn't always have her best stuff Thursday night but displayed her championship pedigree, while Amanda Anisimova defeated Maya Joint to reach the third round for the first time since 2020. That's exactly what Coco Gauff did Thursday night, defeating Donna Vekic, 7-6 (5), 6-2 in the US Open second round at Arthur Ashe Stadium. It came on a night when the former US Open champion had to dig deep to find her best tennis, especially during a tense opening set that left her visibly shaken. After that I felt a lot better out here.” After her seventh double fault -- which came on the opening point of the tiebreak -- Gauff steadied herself just enough to secure the set, moments after wiping away tears following another dropped service game. Moments after clinching victory, Gauff shed a few more tears, thanked the crowd for its support and revealed a surprising secondary source of inspiration behind her second-set resilience: Simone Biles. “I saw her, and honestly, I don't know if she's still up there, but she helped me pull it out,” Gauff said. … I don't know how big this court is. “But I saw her late in the second getting interviewed by ESPN, and it brought me a little bit of calm just knowing her story with all the things she went through mentally. She's an inspiration, surely, and her presence definitely did help me today.” With the victory, Gauff earned her 73rd Grand Slam match-win. Since 2000, only Maria Sharapova (85) has recorded more women's singles Grand Slam victories before turning 22. 74 in the third round when she faces off against Magdalena Frech, whom she has defeated in both of their previous meetings without dropping a set. The crowd at Louis Armstrong Stadium witnessed a thriller of an opening set, with Joint earning an early break against the reigning Wimbledon finalist. Anisimova finished with 23 winners compared to just five for Joint. Next up for Anisimova is Romania's Jaqueline Cristian, who is making just her second career appearance in a Grand Slam third round.

Improving it was, according to her, just a matter of reps now. But that optimism quickly looked misplaced tonight.She started double faulting right away, and was broken in the first game. Two games later, Gauff hit a second serve as hard as she could, missed it by three feet, and was broken again. Improving it was, according to her, just a matter of reps now.

Two games later, Gauff hit a second serve as hard as she could, missed it by three feet, and was broken again. “It's an uncomfortable watch,” Mary Carillo said in the commentary booth. It came in the form of a physio who walked on court to help Vekic with an arm issue. Up to that point, the Croatian had hardly played much better than Gauff. And her game would only go downhill from there.In the first-set tiebreaker, Vekic made four errors, including one on set point. The crucial, match-changing moment came with Vekic serving at 4-5. Coco ran it down and closed the point with a forehand winner. In the first-set tiebreaker, Vekic made four errors, including one on set point. The crucial, match-changing moment came with Vekic serving at 4-5.

Her serve felt better, too, as the double faults decreased. She would finish with just eight, and make 69 percent of her first serves.There was no second wind for Vekic, as the mistakes continued to flow. She finished with 12 winners and 36 errors, which was reminiscent of the 12 winners and 56 errors that Gauff's first-round opponent, Ajla Tomljanovic, made.Which brings up a point about Gauff: Even when she's not playing well, she has a knack for making her opponents play badly—just ask Aryna Sabalenka. Gauff's forehand is rightfully seen as her weaker ground stroke, but it does work well on defense. Vekic targeted that side for most of the night, but Gauff responded by rolling her forehand back crosscourt high and heavy, forcing Vekic to go for more—and ultimately miss.

When it mattered most on Thursday night, @CocoGauff drew inspiration from @Simone_Biles who was in attendance. Gauff said she was especially inspired by one fan in particular: Simone Biles. Gauff looked up and saw her being interviewed during the match.“I was just thinking, ‘If she can go on a six-inch beam, and do that with all the pressure of the world, then I can hit a ball [in this court],” Gauff said.“It brought me a little bit of calm.”For a set, Gauff looked as lonely as any tennis player can, by herself in front of a sea of people, and unable to make her game work. “I was just thinking, ‘If she can go on a six-inch beam, and do that with all the pressure of the world, then I can hit a ball [in this court],” Gauff said.“It brought me a little bit of calm.”For a set, Gauff looked as lonely as any tennis player can, by herself in front of a sea of people, and unable to make her game work. “It brought me a little bit of calm.”For a set, Gauff looked as lonely as any tennis player can, by herself in front of a sea of people, and unable to make her game work.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Venus Williams and Leylah Fernandez made a hell of a doubles debut on Thursday in Louis Armstrong Stadium, coming from behind in the first set to defeat Lyudmyla Kichenok and Ellen Perez, 7-6 (4), 6-3. Growing up, when I first started playing tennis, people asked me, 'Who did you watch when you were growing up?' I always said Justine Henin and the Williams sisters." Leylah Fernandez said that matter of factly, on the rooftop of the player clubhouse at the Lindner Family Tennis Center in Mason, Ohio during a casual conversation in early August. Less than a month later, in a scene she likely would not have predicted, she was sharing a court with her idol on Louis Armstrong Stadium in front of more than 14,000 rabid fans who were no doubt thrilled to have one more opportunity to see Venus play. The duo, which accepted a wild card into the US Open doubles draw on Tuesday, upset sixth-seeded Lyudmyla Kichenok and Ellen Perez, 7-6 (4), 6-3, in their first-round matchup on an unseasonably windy day in Queens. (It was downright uncomfortable if you were dressed for summer, though the fired-up crowd hardly seemed to notice.) Towering over her partner -- a former US Open singles finalist and doubles quarterfinalist -- and looking at times like a big sister, the 45-year-old Williams earned her first win in three New York tries after bowing out in the revamped mixed doubles tournament last week and losing to Karolina Muchova on Monday. It looked bleak to start, with Williams and Fernandez falling behind 5-2 in the first set, but they rallied to even it at 5. "I have no idea what I was thinking during that tiebreak," Fernandez, who's into the third round in the singles draw, said with a laugh. So I just didn't want to think too much. ... No, I just wanted to go out there, play, and I had full confidence with Venus at the net and even in the baseline." The next set was far less dramatic, as the unseeded pair jumped out to a 4-1 lead and comfortably closed it out. They seemed to gel and complement each other more effectively as the match wore on, finding a rhythm that kept their opponents off balance and defensive. Communication was key in establishing that cadence. "I'm used to being the big sister," Williams told reporters after the match, "so I'm kind of asking her what she wants. Theoretically I have more experience, but she's been playing a lot more matches, so maybe that makes us neck and neck in terms of how we can compete. It was a full circle moment for the 22-year-old Fernandez, who remembers practicing with Venus outside of Lexington, Kentucky back in 2020. "I thought I was going to be very intimidated, but she was super nice and welcoming," Fernandez recalled during the Cincinnati Open. This was Williams' first doubles victory in Queens in 11 years, though she's certainly no stranger to doubles success at this venue. Venus Williams and Leylah Fernandez made a hell of a doubles debut on Thursday in Louis Armstrong Stadium, coming from behind in the first set to defeat Lyudmyla Kichenok and Ellen Perez, 7-6 (4), 6-3.</p>
