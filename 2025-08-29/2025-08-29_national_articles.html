Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Former Iowa State Sen. Jim Carlin, who has mounted another U.S. Senate bid, spoke to Fox News Digital about his policy views Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa will not run for re-election in next year's midterms, three sources confirm to Fox News. And the 55-year-old Ernst, who was first elected to the Senate in 2014, is expected to make an official announcement next week. Ernst, a retired Army Reserve and Iowa National Guard officer who served in the Iraq War, has been wrestling for months whether to run for re-election in 2026. The senator's decision to retire rather than seek a third six-year term creates an open seat in Iowa. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, arrives for a closed briefing for members of the Senate Armed Services Committee at the U.S. Capitol on July 29, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Win McNamee/Getty Images) GOP Rep. Ashley Hinson, a former TV news anchor who is in her third term representing Iowa's 2nd Congressional District, which covers the northeastern portion of the state, is planning on running to succeed Ernst, multiple sources confirm to Fox News. Iowa was once a top battleground state that former President Barack Obama carried in his 2008 and 2012 White House victories. Republicans currently hold both of the state's U.S. Senate seats – Ernst and longtime Sen. Chuck Grassley  – and all four of Iowa's congressional districts, as well as all statewide offices except for state auditor, which is held by Democrat Rob Sand, who's running for governor next year. Four Democrats are already running for Senate in Iowa. The field includes state Rep. Josh Turek, a Paralympian wheelchair basketball player, state Sen. Zach Wahls, Knoxville Chamber of Commerce executive director Nathan Sage and Des Moines School Board Chair Jackie Norris. Ernst first grabbed national attention 11 years ago with her "make 'em squeal" ads as she won the high-profile Senate election in the race to succeed retiring longtime Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin. The senator, thanks to her military background, has often taken a lead on defense issues. Sen. Joni Ernst, center, deliver remarks on Capitol Hill with Sens. Since Trump's White House victory in 2016, Ernst has tried to strike a balance between her support for the president as she hued to a more traditional Republican agenda. Earlier this year, Ernst sparked a controversy after "we are all going to die" as she responded to a voter at town hall meeting who raised concerns over Medicaid cuts in the GOP's sweeping domestic policy bill. Republicans are aiming to not only defend, but expand, the current 53-47 Senate majority in next year's elections. Senate Republicans enjoyed a favorable map in the 2024 cycle as they flipped four seats from blue to red to win back the majority. Nevertheless, a current read of the 2026 map indicates the GOP may be able to go on offense in some key states. In battleground Georgia, which Trump narrowly carried in last year's White House race, Republicans view first-term Sen. Jon Ossoff as the most vulnerable Democrat incumbent up for re-election next year. They're also targeting battleground Michigan, where Democratic Sen. Gary Peters is retiring at the end of next year, and swing state New Hampshire, where longtime Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen decided against seeking a fourth six-year term in the Senate. But the GOP is defending an open seat in battleground North Carolina, where Republican Sen. Thom Tills decided against seeking re-election.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A member of the West Virginia National Guard gazes up at the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, as part of President Donald Trump's order to use federal law enforcement to expel homeless people and rid the nation's capital of violent crime, Monday, Aug. 25, 2025. People rally against President Donald Trump's use of federal law enforcement and National Guard troops along the U street corridor in northwest Washington Thursday, Aug. 21, 2025. Judges, too, have balked at keeping several defendants in jail, citing weak evidence and dubious charging decisions. President Donald Trump's crackdown on crime in the nation's capital has generated a torrent of charges against people caught up in a surge of street patrols. Judges, defense attorneys and even grand jurors are already poking holes in many cases. “I've seen things over the past 72 hours that I've never seen in federal court,” U.S. District Judge Zia Faruqui said Wednesday during a hearing for a man who was jailed for five days on a misdemeanor marijuana possession charge. Later, he added: “It feels like some sort of bizarre nightmare.” Trump has framed the three-week-old operation as a campaign to eradicate rampant crime and “take our capital back.” The judges and lawyers adjudicating the criminal cases say they're striving to strike a delicate balance between protecting public safety and preserving civil liberties. Some people have been held in jail for days while waiting to appear before a federal judge in district court. But he spent eight days in jail after police stopped his car near The Wharf neighborhood in Washington on Aug. 19 and said they found his registered gun, around 20 ounces of marijuana and drug paraphernalia. U.S. Magistrate Judge G. Michael Harvey wasn't buying the government's contention that Rodriguez is a dangerous drug dealer. “The cases in which drug dealers register their guns are exceptionally rare,” Harvey said as he ordered Rodriguez's release. Police officers and unspecified “federal partners” stopped Rodriguez because he was driving a Lexus with a license plate on the back but not the front of the vehicle, prosecutors said in a court filing. “We don't hold people based on assumptions,” Scrofano said. The White House says over 1,200 people have been arrested and 135 firearms have been seized since the surge started on Aug. 7. Approximately half of them are charged with assaulting officers, agents or National Guard members, according to an Associated Press review of court records. The rest are charged with illegally possessing guns, drugs or both. Former federal prosecutor Michael Romano, who spent more than 17 years at the Justice Department and helped supervise Capitol riot prosecutions, said he never had a grand jury refuse to return an indictment in one of his cases. He said the Trump administration's efforts to appear tough on crime may have backfired with many D.C. residents, who serve on federal grand juries. “Sometimes when you arrest people with scant evidence and you overcharge them, the community doesn't like it and the evidence won't support it,” said Romano, who resigned from the department earlier this year. “This illustrates the danger of having a Justice Department where attorneys can't do their job and can't properly evaluate whether cases are going to be good or not.” “Grand juries, judges, we will not simply go along with the flow,” Faruqui said. He questioned why people have been locked up for days for relatively minor offenses that typically aren't handled in district court. Faruqui said he shared his concerns with the leadership of U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro's office and hopes they can reduce the waits for detention hearings and initial court appearances. Police officers said they followed Torez Riley into the grocery store and found two unregistered guns inside his satchel. He was charged with being a felon in possession of firearms, but Pirro's office dropped the case a week later. He said it was “without a doubt the most illegal search I have ever seen in my life.” Pirro, a former Fox News host whom Trump appointed in May to lead the nation's largest U.S. Attorney's office, responded with a statement accusing Faruqui of having “a long history of bending over backwards to release dangerous felons in possession of firearms.” On Thursday, Harvey ordered the release of a man who was arrested on Aug. 16 after a traffic stop by members of the U.S. Park Police and U.S. The magistrate pressed a prosecutor to explain why the driver, Amarian Langston, was charged with illegally possessing a handgun that officers found beside a road after he crashed the vehicle. Prosecutors separately charged Langston's girlfriend in D.C. Superior Court, which hears less serious cases and is handling the bulk of the surge-related arrests. Said McWaters: “I'm not saying it's an easy hill to climb, your honor.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some National Guard units patrolling the nation's capital at the direction of President Donald Trump have started carrying firearms. Members of the Louisiana National Guard patrol Union Station, Thursday, Aug. 28, 2025, in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — Since sending the National Guard to Los Angeles and Washington, President Donald Trump has openly mused about sending troops to some of the nation's most Democratic cities — including Chicago and Baltimore — claiming they are needed to crack down on crime. The threats to expand a federal intervention have legal experts and some military officials raising concerns that Trump is considering novel ways to use National Guard troops in American cities that could set up conflicts not seen since the civil rights era. Though most violent crime has fallen in recent years in the cities Trump has called out, the Republican president said Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker “should be calling me, and he should be saying, ‘Can you send over the troops please?' Whether Trump can repeat what he's done in LA and the nation's capital — call up the National Guard and have it assist a surge of federal law enforcement and immigration officers — is an open question and likely to become a point of contention should he press forward. Here's a look at how Trump has used troops in U.S. cities, what the law allows and what could come next: Trump first deployed troops to Los Angeles in early June over Gov. Gavin Newsom's objections by putting the California National Guard under federal jurisdiction, known as Title 10, to protect federal property from protests over immigration raids. Besides 4,000 Guard members, Trump later sent 700 active duty Marines, and California sued over the intervention. The Guard went on to help protect officers during immigration arrests. Meanwhile, the unique status of the District of Columbia National Guard — Trump is their commander in chief — means he has been able to use it for everything from armed patrols to trash cleanup without any legal issues. Because it is on state and not federal orders, legal restrictions on law enforcement don't come into effect. “Where we have a big question mark” is whether “the governor of a state has to consent to the sending of troops to his state,” said Huntley, a retired Navy captain and judge advocate. The Trump administration is planning to surge officers to the nation's third-largest city for an immigration crackdown, two U.S. officials said. The Department of Homeland Security asked Naval Station Great Lakes outside Chicago for support on immigration operations, including with facilities and logistics, the base said this week. The Illinois National Guard and the base said they had not received requests regarding a mobilization of troops to Chicago. A D.C. National Guard official, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said invoking the Insurrection Act over a broad topic like crime could allow the Guard to be deployed indefinitely. If the D.C. Guard is put on federal orders — something Trump has the power to do — it could lead to some rare situations, including federalized D.C. Guardsmen sent to another state that in turn could activate its own Guard as a counter, Huntley said. To take the ability of that state governor of using state National Guard forces away, the president could simply federalize them,” Huntley said. In an executive order signed Monday, Trump ordered Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to create “a specialized unit” within the D.C. Guard “dedicated to ensuring public safety and order.” He also directed Hegseth to ensure every state's Guard is ready to assist federal and local law enforcement in “quelling civil disturbances and ensuring the public safety and order” when needed. A defense official confirmed that Hegseth's office was aware of the order and that they were reviewing it and its specific requirements. All state Guards already have a “reaction force” that is aimed at responding to a wide variety of incidents with an initial force of 75-125 personnel within eight hours and a follow-on force of up to 375 personnel within 24 hours, according to a National Guard fact sheet. And the D.C. National Guard already has a unit that is made up entirely of soldiers trained as military police.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wes Moore (D-MD) said he would “absolutely welcome” federal support to help lower crime in Baltimore after pushing back on President Donald Trump's comments about the city's high crime rates. “I would absolutely welcome federal support, but I also know that federal support is going to be necessary and required,” Moore said on Fox News's the Will Cain Show on Thursday. Moore's comments came after a back-and-forth between him and Trump regarding Baltimore's crime rate. Moore reiterated he would not activate the Maryland National Guard and wrote a letter to Trump, inviting the president to join him for a public safety walk in September to show Baltimore's progress in lowering crime. “If there's anything Maryland has proven over the last two years, it's that we can achieve performance without being performative,” Moore said. Trump responded to Moore's invitation, saying he “would much prefer that [Moore] clean up this Crime disaster before I go there for a ‘walk. “We would love to have additional support for license plate readers, things that we know that can actually stop crimes as they're happening and making sure people are brought to justice,” Moore said. The Maryland governor also said he would love to see the federal government ban ghost guns, as well as investments in local law enforcement. Moore said safety was one of the reasons he ran for governor. 1 priority was going to be public safety,” Moore said. According to a new Harvard Center for American Political Studies-Harris poll, a majority of people support Trump's actions in Washington, with 54% saying it's “justified” and “necessary.” The poll was conducted online from Aug. 20-21 among 2,025 registered voters within the United States.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This photo shows the National Weather Service monitoring station in Brownville, Texas, May 23, 2014. A posting from the weather service's parent agency seeking meteorologists asks applicants to identify one or two of Trump's executive orders “that are significant to you, and explain how you would help implement them if hired.” It's among screening questions added to government job applications as part of a “ merit hiring plan” that Trump announced at the outset of his second term, and it's not unique to the weather service positions. But some experts said they are alarmed at the prospect that a candidate's ideology could matter for jobs in science. “The fundamental question is, will this make forecasts any better? ... Bottom line, I'd rather have a great forecaster who's never read an EO than a policy muck who's taken one meteorology class,” he said, referring to executive orders. Spokespeople for NOAA didn't respond to emails seeking comment. Before Elon Musk left DOGE, it cut hundreds of NOAA forecasters and other employees soon after Trump took office. Experts warned that the vacancies could hurt forecasts and dangerous consequences for people if extreme weather warnings were slowed. NOAA confirmed in early August that it had received approval to hire as many as 450 people for critical positions within the weather service after this spring's deep cuts. Trump has issued numerous executive orders, and applicants could presumably choose any to endorse — or none at all, since the application says responses aren't required, only encouraged. But Trump has consistently attacked clean energy and climate science while promoting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which emit planet-warming gases. One of his first executive orders, which he dubbed “ unleashing American energy,” directed agencies to sweep away any “undue burden” to fossil fuel development. Under Trump, NOAA has stopped tracking the cost of weather disasters worsened by climate change. His administration has also moved to shut down two NASA missions that monitor a potent greenhouse gas and plant health — data seen as helpful for measuring the impacts of climate change. Some EPA and FEMA employees who signed those letters were put on leave. A third asks how they would use their skills to improve government efficiency and effectiveness. Craig McLean, a former NOAA acting chief scientist under Biden and during Trump's first term, said none of the questions are relevant to weather service positions. “Asking a meteorologist to define how they as a new employee, are going to make the government more efficient is ludicrous,” McLean said. Jeff Masters, a meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections and co-founder of Weather Underground, said the questions amount to a loyalty test that will discourage many qualified applicants from applying.

Finnish aerobatics group Midnight Hawks performs during a celebration marking the Russian air force's 100th anniversary in Zhukovsky, outside Moscow, Russia, on Aug. 11, 2012. GENEVA (AP) — Finland's Air Force, now part of NATO, still flies swastikas on a handful of unit flags — but is preparing to phase them out, largely to avoid awkwardness with its Western allies. It is an ancient symbol and Finland's air force began using it many years before the birth of Nazi Germany. But swastikas have remained on some Finnish air force flags, raising eyebrows among NATO allies, tourists and other foreigners who spot them at military events. It may be wise to live with the times, Col. Tomi Böhm, the new head of Karelia Air Wing air defense force, was quoted as saying in a report Thursday by the public broadcaster YLE. It referred to an article in daily Helsingin Sanomat on Friday, which said the reason for the removal was a perception that the swastika has been an “embarrassing symbol in international contexts.” Finland, which shares a long border with Russia, joined NATO in April 2023 over concerns related to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. But now, following Finland's integration with NATO, policymakers have decided “there's now a need to get more integrated with the forces of countries like Germany, the Netherlands, and France — countries where the swastika is clearly a negative symbol,” he said. Teivanen said that in 2021, German air force units bowed out of a final ceremony following exercises at a military base in Finland's Lapland region after learning that the Finnish swastikas would be on display. Finland's air force adopted the swastika emblem in 1918 soon after country gained its independence after more than a century of Imperial Russian rule. Count Eric von Rosen of neighboring Sweden donated Finland's first military plane in 1918, which bore his personal symbol, the swastika. The Finnish air force soon after adopted a blue swastika on a white background as the national insignia on all its planes from 1918 to 1945. But that doesn't mean there is no Nazi connection at all. Von Rosen, an aristocratic explorer and ethnographer, was the brother-in-law of Hermann Goering, a decorated World War I German fighter pilot who became an early Nazi Party member. Goering went on to lead Germany's Luftwaffe during World War II under Hitler. The Finnish air force stressed that its use of the symbol had no connection to Nazi Germany, although Finland entered into a reluctant alliance with the Third Reich during World War II. New flags — featuring an eagle — will be published when the work has been completed and the flags are introduced into use for events like parades and local ceremonies, the Defense Forces said, without saying when that would happen. “The traditional Von Rosen swastika emblem, in use since 1918, has already been removed from most other Air Force emblems during earlier reforms, so its removal from the unit flags is a logical continuation of this work,” the emailed statement said.</p>

Christina Haack, who is starring alongside her ex-husband Tarek El Moussa and his wife Heather Rae El Moussa in "The Flip Off," explained why she believes that her estranged husband Josh Hall's exit from the series was for the best. Christina Haack's highly publicized third marriage has come to a close — and her ex‑husband, Josh Hall, isn't holding back his thoughts on the matter. Following the finalization of their divorce earlier this week, Hall took to Instagram with a scathing message aimed at the HGTV star. Christina Haack's divorce has been finalized as Josh Hall posts a scathing message about her on social media. "Finally, legally divorced and a free man," he continued. "I've always worked hard, kept what's mine, and declined hand outs, and I'm keeping it that way. Lesson learned: don't marry someone who needs constant public validation and will use your personal drama for attention." A source close to Hall told Fox News Digital, "This was one of the most fair divorces in reality TV history. Josh agreed to split everything he and Christina earned together, and they each walked away from the divorce with everything that they had made prior to the marriage." The source claimed that Hall's assets – including his car collection – were independently acquired. "Josh bought each and every one of those cars on his own. The source added that Hall voluntarily waived spousal support, even though the couple had no prenuptial agreement in place, remarking, "Given there was no prenup, Christina should send Josh a thank you." "This era of tabloid theatrics is over for Josh. According to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital, neither Haack nor Hall will receive spousal support. Hall has since moved on with model Stephanie Gabrys, while Haack is now dating businessman Christopher Larocca. Haack will stay in her Newport Beach mansion and Tennessee farmhouse, while Hall retains several vehicles. Prior to filing for divorce, Haack and Hall filmed footage for the HGTV show "The Flip Off" alongside her first ex-husband, Tarek El Moussa, and his second wife, Heather Rae. During a February episode of "The Flip Off," Haack shared an update on their settlement negotiations as she claimed that Hall had continued to make her "financial offers" and "wants to retire off me." Prior to filing for divorce, Haack and Hall filmed footage for the HGTV show "The Flip Off" alongside Tarek El Moussa and his second wife, Heather Rae. "Honestly, if I would've really understood the repercussions of all of this, I would've gotten a prenup, or I would've never married him," she said, per People. In July, Haack and Hall both filed their own divorce petitions, each citing irreconcilable differences as the reason for the dissolution of their marriage. Hall requested spousal support and asked the court to terminate Haack's ability to receive spousal support from him. The pair did not share any children together. Meanwhile, Haack requested the court terminate both of their ability to be awarded spousal support. In a court filing, she stated that Hall "should not need" spousal support because he has his own source of income. The former couple later had a formal ceremony in Hawaii. The pair did not share any children together. Fox News Digital's Ashley Hume contributed to this report. Stephanie Giang-Paunon is an Entertainment Writer for Fox News Digital.

President Donald Trump is facing some backlash from on his plan to allow 600,000 student visas for Chinese nationals to be issued, including Hudson Institute senior fellow Michael Sobolik. A China expert warns that President Donald Trump's Chinese student visa push amid trade talks between the United States and China could exacerbate the growing CCP "influence" in American universities. Sobolik explained that Chinese students in the United States can become a major national security liability, adding that the CCP has taken advantage of Chinese nationals to "advance malign influence operations." "They do this by re-appropriating basic and applied research in American universities, taking it over to China, and stealing American innovations, essentially," he said. They will silence Chinese students on American campuses and force them to either advance the CCP propaganda line or silence them. Sobolik continued by pointing out the history of the trade agreements between Trump and Xi Jinping. "I think it's partially a function of the fact that [Trump's] trying to get to a trade deal with Xi Jinping and he wants to smooth that road, make sure there aren't any bumps along the way, much like he did in his first term when he was trying to get his phase one trade agreement with China negotiated," he said. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on April 10, 2025 in Washington, DC. President Donald Trump said in a Tuesday cabinet meeting that the "college system would go to hell very quickly" if the Chinese student visa policy were significantly altered. "And it wouldn't be the top colleges, so it'd be colleges that struggle on the bottom. "I like having, and I told this to President Xi that we're honored to have their students here. Now, with that, we check in with careful and we see who's there," the president continued. "President Trump isn't proposing an increase in student visas for Chinese students. The 600K references two years worth of visas," a White House official told Fox News on Thursday. "It's simply a continuation of existing policy." People hold up signs during the Harvard Students for Freedom rally in support of international students at the Harvard University campus in Boston, Massachusetts, on May 27, 2025. Sobolik said universities will ultimately go along with the "repressive tactics of China," as he says students are willing to attend American institutions for their full price. "It's not just STEM programs and security risks. It's all about the bottom line for them, and American values suffer in the process," Sobolik added.

A debate over U.S. intervention against drug cartels spiraled out of control as Alejandro "Alito" Moreno and Gerardo Fernández Noroña clashed in a shocking on-camera brawl. A Mexican Senate session descended into chaos on Wednesday when two senior politicians traded blows following a heated debate over the U.S.' involvement in the fight against drug cartels. The issue has grown especially contentious following reports that President Donald Trump authorized U.S. military force against Latin American drug cartels designated as terrorist groups. Chaos erupts as Mexican politicians Alejandro "Alito" Moreno and Gerardo Fernández Noroña exchanged blows in a heated Senate session Wednesday. Moreno, who claimed his party was denied the floor, was seen approaching Fernández Noroña, reportedly saying, "I'm asking you to let me speak," while clutching the Senate president by the arm. Fernández Noroña reportedly yelled back, as the two politicians violently shoved each other as colleagues scrambled to intervene. In the scuffle, Moreno also clashed with one of Fernández Noroña's collaborators, cameraman Emiliano González González, who was knocked to the floor. Another lawmaker was seen yanking the Senate president's suit jacket and taking a swing at him as he tried to escape the mayhem. Alejandro "Alito" Moreno and Gerardo Fernández Noroña exchanged blows at the end of Wednesday's Senate session. "He hit me and told me ‘I'm going to break your mother, I'm going to kill you,'" Fernández Noroña said in a press conference, according to El Pais. Moreno countered that the ruling party was silencing opposition voices and insisted Fernández Noroña had instigated the fight. "Let it be clear: the first physical aggression came from Fernández Noroña," Moreno said in a post on X Wednesday. Minutes before reaching the corresponding point, Morena changed it to their convenience to silence us and prevent the opposition from speaking out. Their obligation was to give me the floor, and they didn't do it." Politician "Alito" Moreno knocks down a cameraman during the Senate scuffle Wednesday. The Senate president said he plans on filing a criminal complaint against Moreno as well as three other PRI legislators involved, including Carlos Eduardo Gutierrez Mancilla, Alonso Erubiel Lorenzo and Ruben Moreira. Fernández Noroña is also calling an emergency session Friday to propose expelling Moreno and the three other PRI lawmakers as a result of the scuffle, the New York Post reported. Fernández Noroña and Alejandro Moreno did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte said Thursday that he filed a second criminal referral to the Department of Justice against Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, whom President Donald Trump is attempting to fire. Pulte said the new referral relates to a third mortgage at her Cambridge, Massachusetts, property. In the latest complaint, Pulte alleged that Cook took out a mortgage on the Massachusetts condo for $361,000, which she said was a second home, and claimed that less than a year later, Cook said she had earned between $15,000 and $50,000 in rental income and listed it as an investment property. “Representing the property as a second home may have allowed Cook to secure a lower ‘Second Home' mortgage down payment and rates, as investment properties typically carry higher down payments and higher rates due to increased risk,” Pulte wrote in the complaint. Pulte was appointed to lead the FHFA by Trump earlier this year and has worked on Trump's behalf in his anger with the Fed and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. Trump moved to fire Cook earlier this week after Pulte's first criminal referral. Her lawyers have categorized the mortgage dispute in Pulte's first criminal referral as an unintentional “clerical error.” A judge is expected to hear the case Friday morning on Cook's push for a restraining order as she looks to remain in her role. For months, Trump has unsuccessfully demanded that the Fed cut interest rates. Before his attempt to oust Cook, Trump had seriously considered firing Powell.</p>

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? For the last few years, we've been asking Future Perfect newsletter readers what their biggest questions are. This week, we've answered questions from three readers on classic FP issues: artificial intelligence, animal welfare coverage, and, of course, altruistic kidney donations. We'd like to do more of these, so if your question wasn't featured — or privately answered — please stay in touch for a chance to be included in the future. We're also kicking off the process for our annual Future Perfect list of changemakers. We're looking for experts, humanitarians, activists, movers, and shakers in global health, broadly speaking. If there is someone you want to nominate, a topic you want explained, or a question you want us to answer in the future, fill out this form or email us at futureperfect@vox.com. For any question you're considering asking an AI model, the first thing you need to do is think about its epistemic nature: Is the answer knowable in an objective way? The best use case is a situation where it's hard for you to come up with the answer, but once you get an answer from the AI, you can easily check to see if it's correct. I find chatbots particularly helpful for semantic search — that is, cases where I say, “There's some psychology theory or idea in philosophy that basically says XYZ, but I can't remember what it's called or who said it, help!” The chatbot will give its best guess, and then I can just fact-check that. Same with other empirical facts that are verifiable through observation or data — anything from “What's the boiling temperature for water?” to “Is it true that humans share 98.8 percent of their DNA with chimpanzees?” While you can easily verify the first by yourself through observation, you'll need to rely on experts' data for the second. We've developed tools that increase our confidence, like the scientific method, so if you're consulting scientific experts, you can at least have some degree of confidence that they're reporting observable and repeatable facts. If you've got the type of question for which there is no One True Answer, you'll want to be more hesitant about using AI. I think ethical dilemmas fall into this category; no matter how much OpenAI tries to create a “universal verifier,” AI will always be limited in its ability to advise you on how to handle an ethical dilemma, because there's no One True Ethics. Ok, after more than five years as a vegan and 73 years on the planet, I want to know why the great majority of journalists consistently abandon everything they learned about objectivity when it comes to a multitude of issues with the monster industry known as “animal agriculture?” And I want to know how to combat that bias effectively. It is a huge blind spot for most of them. It starts as a toddler, is reinforced by the parental relationship, expands to extended family, friends, reinforced again by all types of advertising media, entertainment, etc. Then they go to journalism school and are taught by instructors who also have this blind spot. So later a reporter will go to a “chicken farm” and empathize with them when they tell their story about losing thousands of birds to avian flu — their sense of loss is not about the birds; it's about the money. Things like “where are all the male birds?” [and] “how is it possible for anyone to think that 35,000 birds could be forced to live together in a building without reasonable access to the outdoors?” and “why does it smell so bad?” and “why do you have permission to confine animals without their permission?” I think the reason is pretty simple: Journalists are people with their own biases, just like everyone else. Most news outlets and editors don't take factory farming seriously, which is why I'm proud to work at Vox, where we do. I've written one story about how the media could cover these issues better, and I hope to keep covering that in the future. I asked my doctor about it, and surprisingly, instead of encouraging me to save a life, he tried to talk me out of it. Anyway, I thought about donating while on a vacation in the US, but it would require too much time, so I gave up. Unfortunately, my second kidney will probably die with me in old age, and someone with kidney failure will needlessly die. Anyway, maybe another story idea would be about paying kidney providers in countries other than the US? In the US, only a sliver of living donations go to strangers. And, as you indicate, the need for kidneys is a global problem, too. Many places only allow donations to relatives or known recipients (or require tough ethics reviews for unrelated donors), while a minority — like the US, UK, Canada, and Australia — offer a formal pathway for anonymous “good Samaritan” donors. In Hong Kong, where you're based, you can donate to a family member easily, but unrelated donations need official approval, and there's no standard program for that. In 2007, the WHO estimated that about 5–10 percent of kidney transplants involved trafficking, and countries like the Philippines and Pakistan became hubs for foreign patients buying organs from desperate locals.Transplant experts met in Istanbul in 2008 and wrote what became the worldwide rulebook. The Istanbul Declaration pushed countries to crack down on coercive sales of organs. Every country had its own laws, but began incorporating the declaration's recommendations. As a result, transplant tourism dropped sharply in Israel and the Philippines once new rules kicked in, and tighter oversight became the norm across Europe. But, in its efforts to shut down trafficking, the declaration argued that compensating donors at all “leads inexorably to inequity and injustice.” There was little empirical data to back that claim, but because it came from a major international statement it hardened into gospel: organ donation must be “financially neutral.” But neutrality isn't actually neutral in practice. Living donors lose wages, take time off work, take medical risk, and sometimes even face higher insurance premiums after donating. We don't call that exploitation — but it is a penalty for doing the right thing. And it's inconsistent with how we treat other socially valuable, risky, or unpleasant work. In many places, we even pay plasma donors. It's the only country with a regulated system that pays kidney donors. Iran established this system in 1988, and today performs about 2,500-2,700 kidney transplants annually, and it claims to have essentially eliminated its waiting list. It's a proof-of-concept that incentives can be structured. The US debate is inching in that direction. The act, which has not been voted on yet, acknowledges that donation involves real costs: time off work, medical risks, recovery time.The path forward globally isn't throwing out Istanbul's anti-trafficking work, but to build on it with smart incentives and guardrails so people can donate altruistically if they want to. That means actually testing new approaches, but doing it carefully. Give donors independent advocates, make sure there's time to think it over, and guarantee lifelong follow-up care. In the meantime, you might not be able to easily donate your kidney to a stranger right now in Hong Kong, but the needle is moving in the right direction.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Companies in the AI race are barreling toward a new goalpost: so-called superintelligence, or an AI model that can surpass human intelligence. The terminology here can get a bit dizzying. Top AI companies had already been trying to build what's long been called “artificial general intelligence” (AGI), or AI that they claim will be as smart as humans. Depending on who you talk to, superintelligence might just be a flashy marketing term meant to draw even more venture capital — or it might be the obvious next step in the development of AI models that some believe are already as intelligent as humans. Meta, in particular, has branded its AI department around the goal of superintelligence through its new “Superintelligence Labs.” Over the past few months, Mark Zuckerberg has escalated the industry's talent war, reportedly offering pay packages of up to $1 billion dollars to recruit Silicon Valley's top AI engineers. Today, Explained co-host Sean Rameswaram recently spoke with Riley Griffin, tech reporter at Bloomberg, about why Meta is gunning so hard for top AI talent right now and what the company hopes to build with these top technologists. Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity.

The superintelligence lab is incredibly new, and the story of Meta's superintelligence lab is at its core a story of competition. So, you've got Mark Zuckerberg, a famously competitive CEO, and this past spring, we learned through our reporting that he'd begun to feel quite acutely that Meta was falling behind in this all-consuming race for AI. Meta had just released the latest version of its large language model – they call it Llama. This is a system meant to rival open AI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude. But when the rollout landed, it fell flat. And it fell flat internally, according to our sources. It had just become clear that Meta was not leading the pack among these AI companies. But Meta is increasingly seeing itself as an AI company, too. And so Zuckerberg, seeing, feeling that he was falling behind in this race, immediately sprung into action. From his homes in Tahoe and Silicon Valley, he started personally recruiting, and he was basically quietly building this new secretive team that we now know is Meta Superintelligence Labs. What is this super secretive team going to do? It sounds like they should have changed their name to AI. It hasn't proved itself to be the dream that Mark Zuckerberg once painted. If you were watching that at the time, you might've thought Meta was really well-positioned to be the AI leader. But when OpenAI came out with ChatGPT, it blew everyone out of the water, including AI researchers at Meta who I've spoken with. They'd been building their own large language models, but the approach was still rather academic. So, I think that's when the race began, but it really kicked into gear this April with what felt to many internally at Meta as a flop with its latest release of Llama. And what exactly has Meta done in this space so far? We're seeing Meta create a new organizational structure for its AI talent. This is a multi-billion-dollar effort, and Meta has the cash to deploy. The perspective of company leadership is that they're looking to make a big bet and plug that talent gap. They believe there's only a small talent pool that can best make use of that spend, to put together these competitive models. Many are focused on reasoning, and that means they're specialists who can help build models that think step by step, as opposed to in this probabilistic approach where they're predicting the next word in the sentence. One thing I've heard from folks who have left Meta over the years is that if you are a PhD type who got into this really complicated question of AI reasoning and superintelligence, you weren't necessarily inspired when Meta announced that they were creating AI chatbots that sounded like Snoop Dogg. So, there has been skepticism of Mark Zuckerberg as a leader. He's someone who really wants to bring AI into the hands of individuals. What has been successful is Mark's efforts to court some of the biggest names out there. They are taking away top talent from competitors. But we also know there are people who have turned down Mark Zuckerberg's sports-team-level compensation packages. I will say that pushback isn't coming from Wall Street. Meta's stock is up nearly 30 percent this year to date. So, it sounds like Meta is restructuring itself or creating altogether new structures, to play the long game on superintelligence. His efforts have set a new bar for compensation across the industry. OpenAI has said that they're going to spend trillions on the AI race. Other companies are being quite loud about the money they're going to throw. But we're talking about the biggest players here — we're not talking about the upstarts that have just gotten some venture cash and have no revenue. Meta, Google, even OpenAI are in a different position because they have cash to burn.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vietnam is on a South China Sea island-building binge that will likely see it soon surpass the area China has reclaimed in the strategic and contested Spratly Islands, according to a new report from the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative. The Spratly Island chain consists of more than 100 small islands or reefs and is claimed in full by China, Vietnam and Taiwan with partial claims by the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei, according to the CIA World Factbook. China's claims have drawn headlines for more than a decade, as Beijing has reclaimed land at several features, building runways and military installations to solidify its positions. Its building of fortifications came despite leader Xi Jinping in telling then-US President Barack Obama in 2015 that it had no plans of doing so. Beijing claims almost all of the 1.2 million-square-mile South China Sea, through which trillions of dollars in global trade passes annually, as its sovereign territory. It bases that claim on its so-called Nine Dash Line, which the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague has previously ruled has no legal basis. New land is also being constructed at three features that were built up in earlier rounds of reclamation – Amboyna Cay, Grierson Reef and West Reef – the AMTI report said. “All 21 Vietnamese-occupied rocks and low-tide elevations in the Spratly Islands have now been expanded to include artificial land,” AMTI said. Reclamation at these eight new features all but ensures that Vietnam will match—and likely surpass—the scale of Beijing's island-building,” the report said. Meanwhile, on seven other Vietnamese-controlled islands where reclamation work has largely been completed, military-related structures, including munitions depots, have been or are being built, according to the report. Competing claims by Beijing and Manila have become increasingly contentious in the past few years, including violent clashes between their coast guards with water cannons and, in one case, bladed weapons. Last month, north of the Spratlys near Scarborough Shoal, a Chinese navy destroyer collided with a China Coast Guard ship as the two harassed a Philippine Coast Guard vessel in contested waters. US warships sail in vicinity of disputed shoal where Chinese ships collided The China-Philippines flare-ups may have provided Vietnam with excellent cover for its move to build up the islands it controls, analysts said. “For now much of China's bandwidth of attention is directed at the Philippines, and it would rather maintain a stable front with each of the other Southeast Asian rivals in the South China Sea,” said Collin Koh, a research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) in Singapore. Ray Powell, director of SeaLight, a maritime transparency project at Stanford University's Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation, echoed Koh's comments. “It seems that Beijing has calculated that keeping the Philippines isolated from the other South China Sea claimants is worth more right now than preventing Vietnam from making substantial territorial gains,” Powell said. “Hanoi may owe Manila a debt of gratitude, since it's hard to see how this could have happened if Beijing hadn't been so preoccupied with the problem to the east,” Powell said, adding that, “China has been remarkably muted about Vietnam's island-building campaign.” That was reflected in Beijing's official reaction to the AMTI report. US calls out ‘dangerous' Chinese helicopter maneuvers as tensions rise over South China Sea China firmly opposes relevant countries' construction activities on illegally occupied islands and reefs. China will take necessary measures to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told a regular press briefing Monday. Past disagreements between China and Vietnam over South China Sea territory have resulted in bloodshed, including in 1974 when a South Vietnamese naval vessel was sunk and 53 South Vietnamese troops killed in a battle with Chinese forces over the Paracel Island chain in the northwestern part of the South China Sea. Beijing has maintained a big edge in the South China Sea since, and Koh said it may not find Hanoi's latest moves to be overly threatening. “There's been effort between Vietnam and the Philippines to come closer on maritime security cooperation, as evidenced by the recent bilateral coast guard exchanges and joint exercise.</p>

Federal prosecutors on Thursday charged a man seen throwing a sandwich at a federal agent with a misdemeanor offense after a grand jury declined to bring a harsher felony charge against the Washington, D.C., protester. 

The grand jury recently refused to indict Sean Dunn, a former government employee, on felony charges, leading to prosecutors' latest move to lessen the charges to a simple assault offense.

Earlier this month, Dunn hurled a Subway sandwich at a federal agent stationed in Washington as part of President Donald Trump's federal takeover of the nation's capital, a move the White House has branded as an anti-crime effort. 

Video capturing Dunn's act of protest against the government takeover went viral, leading U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro to level felony charges against the district resident. 

The felony charge would have carried up to eight years in prison. Under the relaxed misdemeanor charge, which does not require prosecutors to go to a grand jury, Dunn would spend under one year in prison for throwing a hoagie sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer.

Dunn was a Department of Justice employee when he encountered the federal agent. He was fired from his job after the incident. 

Dunn's case was assigned on Thursday to U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for next week.</p>
