                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta on Friday said it is making temporary changes to its artificial intelligence chatbot policies related to teenagers as lawmakers voice concerns about safety and inappropriate conversations. The social media giant is now training its AI chatbots so that they do not generate responses to teenagers about subjects like self-harm, suicide, disordered eating and avoid potentially inappropriate romantic conversations, a Meta spokesperson confirmed. The company said AI chatbots will instead point teenagers to expert resources when appropriate. "As our community grows and technology evolves, we're continually learning about how young people may interact with these tools and strengthening our protections accordingly," the company said in a statement. Additionally, teenage users of Meta apps like Facebook and Instagram will only be able to access certain AI chatbots intended for educational and skill-development purposes. The company said it's unclear how long these temporary modifications will last, but they will begin rolling out over the next few weeks across the company's apps in English-speaking countries. TechCrunch was first to report the change. Last week, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said that he was launching an investigation into Meta following a Reuters report about the company permitting its AI chatbots to engage in "romantic" and "sensual" conversations with teens and children. The Reuters report described an internal Meta document that detailed permissible AI chatbot behaviors that staff and contract workers should take into account when developing and training the software. In one example, the document cited by Reuters said that a chatbot would be allowed to have a romantic conversation with an eight-year-old and could tell the minor that "every inch of you is a masterpiece – a treasure I cherish deeply." Most recently, the nonprofit advocacy group Common Sense Media released a risk assessment of Meta AI on Thursday and said that it should not be used by anyone under the age of 18, because the "system actively participates in planning dangerous activities, while dismissing legitimate requests for support," the nonprofit said in a statement. "This is not a system that needs improvement. It's a system that needs to be completely rebuilt with safety as the number-one priority, not an afterthought," said Common Sense Media CEO James Steyer in a statement. "No teen should use Meta AI until its fundamental safety failures are addressed." We want to hear from you. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You may have heard Bill Pulte's name a lot as of late. Pulte has been an outspoken critic of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, has called on him to resign, and reportedly gave Trump a drafted letter that would fire Powell. And earlier this month, Pulte accused Federal Reserve Board Gov. Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud, leading Trump to attempt to fire her and kicking off a legal battle that remains ongoing, with implications for the US economy. In addition to being CEO of Pulte Capital, he also served on the board of PulteGroup and was based in Michigan, near Detroit. That involved things like investing in small businesses, paying for some users' groceries, or offering a reward to find a missing person. He even once partnered with the make-up artist Jeffree Star on a $30,000 cash giveaway. He's also a major political donor, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to support Trump and other GOP candidates during the 2024 election cycle. He made some early moves at FHFA, including consolidating the agency's control over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Pulte announced earlier this year that he was directing both companies, which are under a government conservatorship, to consider cryptocurrency as an asset in mortgage lending. But he's garnered even more notoriety for his role in Trump's war with the Fed. According to the New York Times, Pulte drafted a letter for Trump that would have fired Powell. Pulte has also been a loud critic of Powell, and he accompanied Trump during his high-profile tour of the Fed later in July. Pulte's focus on Powell drew the ire of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who in a July letter to Pulte said that he appeared "distracted" from his main job. More consequentially, Pulte helped spur Trump's attempted firing of Lisa Cook, a Federal Reserve Board governor appointed by President Joe Biden. In addition to his allegations against Cook, Pulte has also used his position to accuse Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California and New York Attorney General Tish James — both prominent Trump critics — of mortgage fraud. The Department of Justice is now investigating both officials, who have denied Pulte's allegations and characterized them as baseless attempts at political retribution.</p>

Trump's Second Term:

Boxes of antiretroviral drugs in a medical stockroom, the last donation before USAID funding cuts, in Kisumu, Kenya on April 24. 

President Donald Trump asked Congress to claw back nearly $5 billion in already-approved foreign aid spending, a proposal timed to take advantage of the looming end of the fiscal year and allowing him to cut the funding himself if lawmakers fail to act by the close of September.

The maneuver challenges Congress' spending powers and intensifies an already contentious battle over government funding, which is due to lapse Sept. 30. Democrats are sure to seek guarantees Trump will actually spend money lawmakers appropriate in exchange for their votes to keep the government open.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The wind industry has been in Trump's crosshairs since his first day in office, when he halted new leases for offshore wind projects. But his administration has escalated its attacks in recent days. "Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America's maritime industry," Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. Many of the projects affected by the funding cancellation are staging areas that would be used to build offshore wind turbines. The single biggest pledge that was canceled is Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind in northern California, with about $427 million in federal support withdrawn. Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind is a planned marine terminal that would be used to launch and assemble turbines in support of California's goal of building 25 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2045. The fully permitted project is 80% complete. Orsted shares tumbled to a record low on Monday in the aftermath of the work stoppage. Trump said last week that his administration will not approve solar or wind projects in the U.S. Renewable executives are warning that the president's campaign against renewable energy will lead to a spike in power prices.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alexis Wilkins, the longtime girlfriend of FBI Director Kash Patel, is suing an ex-agent and self-described whistleblower for defamation, alleging he called her a former Israeli spy whose relationship with Patel is a "honeypot" operation. The defendant, Kyle Seraphin, "has maliciously lied" about Wilkins by "falsely asserting that she—an American-born country singer—is an agent of a foreign government, assigned to manipulate and compromise the Director of the FBI," Wilkins' attorney wrote in the lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court in Austin, Texas. Wilkins accuses Seraphin, a conservative podcaster who calls himself a "recovering FBI agent," of "using this fabricated story as self-enriching clickbait." Wilkins is seeking at least $5 million in damages. Patel "has had his own little 'honeypot' issue that's been going on of late, so we're just going to acknowledge it real publicly," Seraphin said on the episode at the center of the lawsuit. "But I'm sure that's totally because, like, she's really looking for like a cross-eyed, you know, kind of thickish built, super cool bro who's almost 50 years old who's Indian in America," Seraphin said sarcastically. "Like it has nothing to do with the fact that uh we're really close to the Trump administration," he said. "Anyway, I'm sure that's totally just like love. Seraphin did not identify Wilkins by name, but her suit says his statement is "obviously about her specifically." Wilkins, 26, said her long-term relationship with Patel, 45, began in January 2023 and has been public knowledge. Patel was confirmed as FBI director in February. Seraphin, discussing the lawsuit at length on his show on Friday morning, noted that similar claims about Wilkins have previously surfaced in social media posts that have generated significantly more attention than his comments did. By calling her a honeypot, Seraphin is suggesting that Wilkins is "an agent of a foreign government who began a relationship with another for purposes of manipulating and compromising them," the lawsuit says. "He is accusing Ms. Wilkins of being a spy for a foreign government, conducting espionage to undermine our national security and/or to manipulate federal law enforcement at the highest level, and even committing treason," her lawyer wrote. "Ms. Wilkins is not even Jewish, much less Israeli, and has never set foot in Israel ... Seraphin, on his show, said he never made those claims. The suit argues that since Seraphin "trades on his experience" as a former FBI counterterrorism agent, he cannot claim that he comments were mere hyperbole. It also notes that Seraphin met with both Patel and Wilkins "at a conservative political event roughly two years ago," before he was confirmed as FBI director. Seraphin said on his show Friday morning that he had no recollection of having met them. Patel "keeps tabs on me and the guys that he's helped out, and also we share information about FBI stuff," Seraphin told NBC at the time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We've gathered everything you need to know about where to watch the US Open, with global streaming options — including a free one. All of the usual suspects have made their way to the US Open, including defending champions Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka, who rank No. Sabalenka has yet to win a Grand Slam title this year, and she'll take on the DC Open champ, Leylah Fernandez, in the third round today. Carlos Alcaraz and his new buzzcut will take on Luciano Darderi, while Sinner returns to action tomorrow. Other big names still in the fight include Iga Swiatek, Coco Gauff, Alex Zverev, Ben Shelton, and, of course, Novak Djokovic. Match start times are approximate and subject to delay, especially later in the day. Matches will air across various ESPN networks and ABC, and be available in full through the brand-new ESPN streaming service. Both tiers should have US Open coverage, but Unlimited unlocks lots of extra coverage and full live streams from flagship networks. You can learn more in our ESPN streaming service guide and check out a limited-time deal when you bundle ESPN Unlimited with Disney Plus and Hulu. While it doesn't have a direct live stream of ESPN networks, like the Unlimited plan, it still offers around 32,000 live sporting events each year. If you're looking for an even more comprehensive sports streaming option, a month-to-month live TV streaming service such as DirecTV or Fubo can help. DirecTV MySports, the service's new genre pack, includes 20+ popular sports channels traditionally found in cable packages and access to the ESPN Unlimited streaming service app. DirecTV's MySports pack carries popular sports channels, from mainstays like ESPN to niche offerings like the ACC Network. Fubo is another popular live TV streaming service with access to ABC and all of the relevant ESPN networks, in addition to around 200+ other live channels. Fubo Pro subscriptions start at $85 a month (plus a bit extra for regional sports fees), but new users can get $30 off their first month of service after a five-day free trial. Fubo is the streaming service for sports fans. Its huge library of channels includes regional and international sports leagues, setting it apart from the competition. Prices vary depending on which bundle and long-term contract you sign up for, but the cheapest plans with Sky Sports start at £35 a month. You can learn more in our guide to the best Sky TV deals and plans. There's also an option to stream Sky Sports through Now, which offers some additional flexibility. This is a free streaming option, and fans just need to create an account if they don't already have one. 9Now will have select major matches, but the best way to ensure you can watch absolutely every match in Australia, including the smaller early ones, is through Stan Sport. If you're away from Australia right now, you can still tune into your free streaming option with the help of a VPN. Short for virtual private networks, VPNs are handy tech tools that allow you to change your virtual location so your go-to websites and apps work from anywhere. They're popular services for those hoping to keep up with their usual services while traveling abroad or looking to upgrade their cybersecurity. It's a user-friendly option (even for beginners) and has an impressive suite of cybersecurity features. You can learn more in our NordVPN review. A wide selection of international servers, high-end security, fast connections, and audited privacy protection have made the brand a household name in the world of VPNs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares of Marvell Technology plunged 15% on Friday after the artificial intelligence chipmaker's data center revenue fell short of estimates and it gave lackluster guidance for the current quarter. Here's how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus: Revenue jumped 58% from a year ago in the fiscal second quarter that ended Aug. 2, a record for the company that was fueled in part by "strong AI demand" for its custom silicon and electro-optics products, Marvell CEO Matt Murphy said in a statement. The company had net income of $194.8 million, or 22 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $193.3 million, a loss of 22 cents per share, during the same period last year. That was slightly below the $2.11 billion forecast by analysts, according to LSEG. Sales in its data center segment reached $1.49 billion during the quarter, which fell short of Wall Street's projected $1.51 billion, according to StreetAccount. On a conference call with investors, Murphy said the company expects "overall data center revenue in Q3 to be flat sequentially," which he attributed to nonlinear growth in its custom AI chips business. Fourth-quarter growth is expected to be "substantially stronger" than the third quarter, Murphy said. He added that "lumpiness" of the guidance is normal as large hyperscalers build out infrastructure. Still, some investors were hoping for greater clarity around the company's pipeline of new customers. "Without this, we find it very difficult underwriting the company's 20% data center market share target," Cantor analysts wrote in a Thursday note to clients. Analysts at Bank of America downgraded Marvell's stock to neutral from buy on Friday and lowered their price target to $78 per share from $90, partly on concerns around the company's AI growth prospects "in the near/medium term."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The de minimis exemption, an obscure trade law provision that has simultaneously fueled and eroded businesses across the globe, officially came to an end on Friday following an executive order by President Donald Trump. For nearly a decade, shipments valued under $800 were allowed to enter the country virtually duty-free and with less oversight. Now, those shipments from the likes of Tapestry, Lululemon and just about any other retailer with an online presence will be tariffed and processed in the same way that larger packages are handled. In May, Trump ended the exemption for goods coming from China and Hong Kong, and on July 30 he expanded the rollback to all countries, calling it a "catastrophic loophole" that's been used to evade tariffs and get "unsafe or below-market" products into the U.S. The de minimis exemption had previously been slated to end in July 2027 as part of sweeping legislation passed by Congress, but Trump's executive order eliminated the provision much sooner, giving businesses, customs officials and postal services less time to prepare. "The ending of that under-$800-per-person-per-day rule, from a global perspective, is about to probably cause a bit of pandemonium," said Lynlee Brown, a partner in the global trade division at accounting firm EY. It's forced businesses both large and small to rethink not just their supply chains, but their overall business models, because of the impact the change could have on their bottom lines – setting off a panic in boardrooms across the country, logistics experts said. The change also means consumers, already are under pressure from persistent inflation and high interest rates, could now see even higher prices on a wide range of goods, from Colombian bathing suits to specialty ramen subscription boxes shipped straight from Japan. The end of de minimis could cost U.S. consumers at least $10.9 billion, or $136 per family, according to a 2025 paper by Pablo Fajgelbaum and Amit Khandelwal for the National Bureau of Economic Research. Before the recent change to limit its use, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it was processing more than 4 million de minimis shipments into the country each day. A 2023 House report found more than 60% of de minimis shipments in 2021 came from China, but because the packages require less information than larger containers, very little information is known about their origins and the types of goods they contain. That opacity is one of the key reasons why both former President Joe Biden and Trump sought to curtail or end the exemption. Both administrations have said that the exemption was overused and abused and that it's made it difficult for CBP officials to target and block illegal or unsafe shipments coming into the U.S. because the packages aren't subject to the same level of scrutiny as larger containers. "We didn't have any compliance information … on those shipments, and then that is where the danger of drugs and whatnot being in those shipments" comes in, said Irina Vaysfeld, a principal in KPMG's trade and customs practice. In a fact sheet published on July 30, the White House said 90% of all cargo seizures in fiscal 2024, including 98% of narcotics seizures and 97% of intellectual property rights seizures, originated as de minimis shipments. Across the globe, it's common for countries to allow low-value shipments to be imported duty-free as a means to streamline and facilitate global trade, but typically, it's for packages valued around $200, not $800, said EY's Brown. While well intentioned, the law came with unintended consequences, said Brown. The "rise in value, from $200 to $800, just made it kind of like a free for all to say, 'OK, everything come in,'" she said. Eventually companies designed supply chains around the exemption: They set up bonded warehouses, where duties can be deferred prior to export, in places like Canada and Mexico and then imported goods in bulk to those regions before sending them across the border one by one, duty-free, as customer orders rolled in, said Brown. "Companies have really laid out their supply chain in a very specific way [around de minimis] and that's really the crux of the issue," said KPMG's Vaysfeld. Soon, the e-commerce behemoths began facing widespread criticism for their use of what many called a loophole. However, behind closed doors, companies large and small began mimicking the same model after realizing how it could reduce the steep costs that come along with selling goods online. Direct-to-consumer companies that only have online presences have relied on it more heavily, so much so that their businesses may not work without it, said Vaysfeld. "Some of the companies we've spoken to, they've modeled out, if the tariffs continue for one year, for two years, how does that impact their profitability, and they know how long they can last," said Vaysfeld. While smaller, digital companies are more exposed, "pretty much most companies that you can think of" had been using the exemption in some form before it ended, said Vaysfeld. Take Coach and Kate Spade's parent company Tapestry: About 13% to 14% of the company's sales were previously covered under de minimis and will now be subject to a 30% tariff, according to an estimate by equity research firm Barclays. On the company's earnings call earlier this month, Chief Financial Officer Scott Roe said tariffs will hit its profits by a total of $160 million this year, including the impact of the end of de minimis. That amounts to about 2.3% of margin headwind, he said. In a statement, Roe said Tapestry used de minimis to help support its strong online business, adding it is a practice that "many companies with sophisticated supply chains have been doing for years." To help offset its termination, he said Tapestry is looking for ways to reduce costs and is leaning on its manufacturing footprint across many different countries. Canadian retailer Lululemon is another company that uses de minimis, according to Wells Fargo. Lululemon declined to comment, citing the company's quiet period ahead of its reporting earnings. It has members who both supported and opposed the policy, said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at NRF. Retailers of all sizes, including independent sellers with digital storefronts, have used the approach as "a convenient way to get products to the consumer" for less, Gold said. The most acute impact of the end of de minimis is expected to be felt on online marketplaces where millions of small businesses sell goods like Etsy, eBay and Shopify and used de minimis to defray costs when sending online orders from other parts of the globe to the U.S. American shoppers have gotten used to buying artwork, coffee mugs, T-shirts and other items from merchants outside the country without paying duties. With that tariff exemption gone, consumers could face higher costs and a more limited selection of items to choose from. Etsy, eBay and some other retailers sought to defend the loophole prior to its removal, submitting public comments on proposed de minimis regulation by the CBP. An eBay public policy executive said the company was concerned that restrictions to de minimis "would impose significant burdens on American consumers and importers." Etsy's head of public policy, Jeffrey Zubricki, said the artisan marketplace supports "smart U.S. de minimis reform," but that it was wary of changes that could "disproportionately affect small American sellers." "These exemptions are a powerful tool that help small creators, artisans and makers participate in and navigate cross-border trade," Zubricki wrote in a March letter to CBP. An Etsy spokesperson declined to comment on the policy change. Etsy CFO Lanny Baker said at a Bernstein conference in May that transactions between U.S. buyers and European sellers make up about 25% of the company's gross merchandise sales. The company warned in its latest earnings report that the end of de minimis outside of China could impact its guidance, though CEO Jamie Iannone told CNBC in July that he believes eBay is generally "well suited" to navigate the shifting trade environment. Blair Nadeau, who owns a Canadian bridal accessories company, was forced to take that step this week. "This is devastating on so many levels and millions of small businesses worldwide are now having their careers, passions and livelihoods threatened," Nadeau wrote in an Instagram post on Tuesday. "Just this past hour I have had to turn away two U.S. customers and it broke my heart." The de minimis provision had been a "lifeline" for many Canadian businesses to get their products in the hands of American consumers, Nadeau said in an interview. In the absence of de minimis, online merchants are faced with either paying import charges upfront and potentially passing those costs on to shoppers through price hikes, or shipping products "delivery duty unpaid," in which case it's the customer's responsibility to pay any duties upon arrival. Alexandra Birchmore, an artist based in the Cotswolds region of England, said she expects to raise the price of her oil paintings on Etsy by 10% as a result of paying the duties upfront. "At the moment every small business forum I am on is in chaos about this," Birchmore said. U.S. consumers may turn to major retailers if they face steeper prices elsewhere, as well as potential shipping delays due to backlogs or other issues at the border. Amazon, in particular, has already proven resilient after the U.S. axed the de minimis provision for shipments from China and Hong Kong in May. Amazon's unit sales grew 12%, an acceleration from the first quarter. Temu was forced to change its business model in the U.S. and stop shipping products to American consumers from Chinese factories. The end of de minimis, as well as Trump's new tariffs on Chinese imports, also forced Temu to raise prices, rein in its aggressive online advertising push and adjust which goods were available to American shoppers. The Financial Times reported on Tuesday that Temu has resumed shipping goods to the U.S. from Chinese factories and will also increase its advertising spend following what it called a "truce" between Washington and Beijing. Temu didn't return a request for comment. Meanwhile, Shein has been forced to raise prices and daily active users on both platforms in the U.S. have fallen since the de minimis loophole was closed, CNBC previously reported. Temu's U.S. daily active users plunged 52% in May versus March, while Shein's were down 25%, according to data shared with CNBC by market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.
