            Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst has decided not to seek reelection to a third term, two people familiar with the decision say, and is poised to make an announcement next week.
    


            Ernst, 55, has been wrestling with the decision for months, but began telling friends in recent days.
    


            Her retirement creates an open Senate seat in Iowa. Rep. Ashley Hinson is making plans to jump into the race, one GOP official says. National Republicans, anticipating Ernst's retirement, have long said they believe Hinson would be a strong candidate.
    


            A crowded field of Democrats is already running. The party's primary field includes state Rep. Josh Turek, a Paralympian wheelchair basketball player, state Sen. Zach Wahls, Knoxville Chamber of Commerce executive director Nathan Sage and Des Moines School Board chair Jackie Norris.
    


            CBS first reported Ernst's decision.
    


            Ernst has come under fire since responding “we are all going to die” to a constituent at a town meeting who raised concerns about Medicaid cuts in Trump's policy megabill.
    


            She was first elected in 2014 on a pledge to cut government spending with her signature slogan: “Make ‘em squeal.” As the Republican Party has evolved under President Donald Trump, Ernst has often struggled to strike a balance between GOP voters identifying with Trump's “Make America Great Again” movement and those who don't.
    


            A decade ago, Iowa was a critical swing state won by Barack Obama twice and then by Donald Trump in 2016. The state swung partially back in Democrats' favor in 2018, with Democratic candidates winning three of Iowa's four US House seats. But Republicans have dominated since then — winning all statewide races except auditor, a post held by current Democratic gubernatorial candidate Rob Sand, and ultimately claiming all four House seats.
    


            Trump won there by 8 percentage points in 2020 and 13 points in 2024.
    


            However, Iowa Democrats point to the party's stronger performance compared to 2024 results in special elections this year — including a victory in a conservative state Senate district this week — as evidence that the tide could turn in 2026.
    


            Democrats, needing a net gain of four seats to win control of the Senate in next November's midterm elections, are seeking to expand the field of potentially competitive GOP-held seats.
    


            The party's top target is an open-seat race in North Carolina. But Democrats also aim to be competitive in some combination of Maine, where Democratic Gov. Janet Mills this week said she is “seriously considering” running against GOP Sen. Susan Collins; Ohio, where former Sen. Sherrod Brown is attempting to mount a political comeback by running against incumbent Republican Sen. Jon Husted; and Texas, where Sen. John Cornyn faces a stiff primary challenge from conservative firebrand Attorney General Ken Paxton — who Democrats view as a more favorable general election opponent.

            When a United Airlines “technology issue” halted several thousand flights a few weeks ago, it added another incident to a cascade of problems the airlines and national aviation system have seen in recent years.
    


            Southwest Airlines had one of the most significant technology meltdowns in recent aviation history three years ago, during Christmas, when crew scheduling software failed, stranding passengers, their belongings and crew members all over the country.
    


            Since then, the US has seen multiple Notice to Airmen outages affecting the federal computer system that sends alerts to pilots about conditions that could affect the safety of their flights. Plus airplanes have been grounded by tech issues affecting various airlines and the more wide-reaching CrowdStrike software glitch that's been described as the “largest IT outage in history.”



            These operational interruptions, while disruptive to passengers, happen because airlines and aviation officials see safety as paramount, said Eash Sundaram, a tech investor and venture capital and digital executive who previously served as executive vice president and chief digital and technology officer at JetBlue Airways.
    


            “The moment the airline doesn't have an IT system, they shut down the process,” said Sundaram.
    


            United's outage earlier this month was resolved within a few hours and the airline implemented delays and cancellations to return operations to normal.
    


            But it shows that commercial air travel for the roughly three million people that take to the sky each day in the United States can be a complex dance, requiring technology that tracks everything from crew members and aircraft to the weight of planes to be running correctly. And if any one of these systems gives out, it can have a cascading effect.
    


            While there's no centralized data tracking tech outages across the national aviation system, “these software problems do happen far more often than anyone would like,” said Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group and a travel industry analyst.
    


            Aviation analysts and experts say it's not a one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to fixing the technology.
    


            Sundaram said the very complex systems that often go down in these situations are owned or created by an individual airline. Each airline tends to run on its own system.
    


            “Delta has its own crew management system, and American has its own crew management system … Nothing is common,” he said. “This is a fundamental issue in the industry.”
    


            He pointed to operating systems, the “backbone” systems that support crew, the aircraft and weight and balance systems, as something that could be more universal for airlines. Commercial systems, such as e-commerce sites or check-in kiosks, could remain differentiated by each airline, he said.
    


            “Why can't four or five airlines come together to build it?” Sundaram said. “Why can't Google invest in it, or why can't Microsoft invest in it? Large airlines tend to invest on their own, and they build their own stuff, and once they build it, they don't upgrade it for years, because, you know, it works.”
    


            Until it doesn't.
    


            United's problem a few weeks ago stemmed from an issue with the airline's weight and balance computer system, known as Unimatic, and was unrelated to recent cybersecurity concerns in the industry, the company said. It's not clear what caused the problem.
    


            The airline hasn't been a stranger to disruption this year, after multiple air traffic control communications outages impacted its massive operations at Newark Liberty International Airport .



            The overhaul of the Federal Aviation Administration's decades-old air traffic control system is currently underway, with a $12.5 billion down payment secured in President Trump's landmark tax and spending cuts bill passed earlier this year.
    


            Despite the chaos at Newark, the internal systems for United ran great, said Harteveldt.
    


            “It could be that they were doing some kind of upgrade to the system, or it could be, again, that there was some kind of connectivity issue that caused the weight and balance system to go off, or something like that, but I don't believe that the problem was triggered by some summer travel volumes,” he said.
    


            This week, an air traffic control frequency outage grounded flights into Newark. The ground stop was lifted quickly, but flights were delayed due to “equipment issues” in the Philadelphia TRACON responsible for Newark arrivals and departures. The FAA has previously said Newark's technology problems should be fixed by October.
    


            But airlines' own technology systems are in play, too.
    


            Harteveldt said airlines have been investing in technology, but it's not always the case that every single airline is running the “latest and greatest software.”
    


            As with any technology, upgrades need to be made from time to time.
    


            One of the largest and most catastrophic technology meltdowns was Southwest's in 2022. The ripple effect of systems failing led to millions in fines and a federal government-led investigation of the airline. The airline's reputation was damaged, and it had to make efforts to earn customers back.
    


            Southwest unveiled an “action plan” after the meltdown which called for increasing the availability of winter equipment and staffing at some airports, investing in technology to help it quickly restart operations during extreme weather and improving communication and decision-making processes across departments that handle flight operations
    


            Since then, passengers have seen several outages from various airlines, causing ground stops, ground delays and other disruptions.
    


            What's important to remember, according to Harteveldt, of Atmosphere Research Group, is that when the FAA tells an airline that a technology issue poses a safety issue, the airline puts safety first and complies with the FAA's request to ground flights. That's when travelers are disrupted by flight delays or cancellations.
    


            “(It's) not an easy decision, and definitely not fun for anyone on those canceled flights,” he said.
    


In 2023, shortly after Southwest's meltdown, the FAA's NOTAM system experienced an outage. The system sends alerts to pilots to let them know of conditions that could affect the safety of their flights. It is separate from the air traffic control system that keeps planes a safe distance from each other, but it's another critical tool for air safety.
    


            FAA issues are external to airlines. However, they impact passengers just as much, if not more, because they can impact the national system for all pilots.
    


In April 2023, Southwest saw another issue with a “firewall failure,” leading to more flights being halted. Later that year, United Airlines delayed its flights due to an “equipment outage.” After a brief stop, flights resumed.
    


            The reasons these problems happen vary, according to Harteveldt, but they happen too often.
    


            “No airline wants to have a software problem that causes a ground stop to occur, or any other problem that grounds the airline,” he said.
    


            Alaska Airlines paused flights in April 2024 after the carrier experienced “an issue while performing an upgrade” to the system that calculates weight and balance.
    


            But that didn't even scratch the surface of what came during the summer of 2024.
    


            A software update for Microsoft Windows operating systems issued by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike was the root cause of the chaos that unfolded in July, disrupting airlines, banks, schools and more during the busy summer travel season. Delta Air Lines was hit the hardest, while American Airlines and United Airlines also were impacted. The incident led to Delta suing the cybersecurity firm.
    


            Delta addressed the situation with refunds to passengers and other measures, but Delta and CrowdStrike traded accusations before the matter landed in court.
    


On Christmas Eve of last year, American Airlines issued a nationwide ground stop after experiencing a “vendor technology issue.”
    


            Those two incidents happening during peak travel periods where travelers were passing through airports led to great levels of disruption.
    


            It's hard to say definitively why these problems happen, said Helane Becker, president of HRBAviation Consultants. In peak periods of travel, TSA records close to or over 3 million people passing through security checkpoints.
    


            “It may be happening as much (as years past), but it affects more people when it does happen,” she said, noting the technology incidents often cost airlines tens of millions of dollars.
    


            2025 started off with a NOTAM system outage in February.



            “There's a process in place right now to get this system fixed. We want to expedite that and get this new system in place,” said Sean Duffy, Department of Transportation Secretary to CNN at the time. “This is an old system that needs to be upgraded.”
    


            That NOTAM outage came just days after a deadly midair collision over the Potomac River near Washington, DC, which caused many passengers to grow hesitant towards flying.
    


In July, Alaska issued a ground stop for an IT outage, stranding some passengers on planes. A few hours later, however, it was lifted.
    


            Becker points to heightened attention to aviation safety since the DC collision, a Delta regional jet that flipped on landing in Toronto and other incidents in the airspace.
    


            With all that in mind, airlines are continuing to invest in technology and maintaining safety, she said, but it's not always publicized.
    


            “I feel like, in a lot of ways, they're playing catch up, and I think that … that's an issue that they have to address,” Becker said. “I always have felt that airlines are always running to the next problem versus getting ahead of the problem.”

            President Donald Trump revoked Kamala Harris' Secret Service protection on Thursday, according to a copy of a letter reviewed by CNN.
    


            Former presidents receive Secret Service protection for life. Harris, as a former vice president, received six months of protection after leaving office, according to federal law. That period ended on July 21. However, her protection had been extended for an additional year via a directive –﻿ not made public until now – signed by then-President Joe Biden shortly before leaving office, according to multiple people familiar with the undisclosed arrangement.
    


            That is the order Trump canceled in his letter, titled “Memorandum for the Secretary of Homeland Security” and dated Thursday.
    


            “You are hereby authorized to discontinue any security-related procedures previously authorized by Executive Memorandum, beyond those required by law, for the following individual, effective September 1, 2025: Former Vice President Kamala D. Harris,” the letter reads in full.
    


            The order to remove Harris' detail came from the White House, one official with the Secret Service told CNN.
    


            The decision was not part of a security review or new threat assessment, the source said. Leadership within the agency did not flag any security concerns or push back from the White House's order, the official said, who noted that Harris's detail would range from a dozen to a few dozen agents depending on her schedule and shift changes for 24-hour security.
    


            Trump's ending of Harris' protection comes as she soon embarks on a multi-city, high-profile book tour around the release of “107 Days,” her new memoir on her short presidential campaign, set to be released September 23. That will put her more in the public spotlight than she has been since leaving office, during which time she's attended only a few public events.
    


            “The Vice President is grateful to the United States Secret Service for their professionalism, dedication, and unwavering commitment to safety,” Kirsten Allen, a Harris senior adviser, told CNN.
    


            Presidents and presidential candidates face frequent security threats. There were two assassination attempts against Trump during his run for president last year.
    


            Harris, according to people familiar with her security operations, faced particular security concerns given that she was the first woman and first Black woman in the role. Those concerns only increased after she became the nominee, the people familiar with her security operations told CNN, and was still at a high level into January following the campaign, with feelings about the election still raw.
    


            A Biden spokesperson declined to comment on what led to his signing the order extending Harris' protection.
    


            But what will now disappear is not just the agents assigned to guard her in person, 24-7: Secret Service protection includes constant analysis of threat intelligence and covering in-person situations, emails, texts and social media. With her detail canceled, Harris aides are worried they will lose the same access to threat warnings, the people familiar with her security operations said. Her home, in the middle of Los Angeles, will also stop being protected by federal agents.
    


Trump rescinds security clearances of political rivals Harris, Clinton and others



            The cost of mounting any similar level of protection privately would be expensive, possibly going into the millions of dollars annually.
    


            Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, lost his own personal detail on July 21 under the standard provisions for a former vice president's spouse.
    


            California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom was briefed on Harris losing her protection late Thursday. A person familiar with the discussions told CNN that the governor's office could not comment on security arrangements or methods which may be activated as a replacement.
    


            However, Newsom spokesperson Bob Salladay expressed outrage about Trump making the change.
    


            “The safety of our public officials should never be subject to erratic, vindictive political impulses,” Salladay told CNN.
    


            Harris, as a Los Angeles resident, could also receive protection from the city police department. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Newsom were in touch Thursday evening about the situation.
    


            “This is another act of revenge following a long list of political retaliation in the form of firings, the revoking of security clearances and more. This puts the former Vice President in danger and I look forward to working with the Governor to make sure Vice President Harris is safe in Los Angeles,” Bass told CNN in a statement.

Allowing Ukraine to join the European Union would inflict a “deadly blow” on the bloc, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has warned. He argued that fast-tracking accession talks for Kiev would worsen the EU's already fragile position on the global stage.

Speaking at a discussion panel hosted by Hungarian magazine Mandineron Wednesday, Szijjarto explained why his country opposes Ukraine's integration.

“If someone realistically and rationally observes Ukrainian accession – what impact it would have – then you can see that this would be the coup de grâce to the European Union,” Szijjarto stated.

He argued that Brussels would have to redirect “practically all” EU financial resources towards supporting Kiev, while “much lower-quality agricultural products would destroy European agriculture” and “the Ukrainian mafia would roam freely in Europe.”

“The EU was once a key player in the global economy, but today it is increasingly less so,” he added, recalling how US President Donald Trump “practically mopped the floor” with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during trade talks.

The minister's remarks come amid a deepening rift between Budapest and Kiev following multiple attacks on the Druzhba oil pipeline, a key energy supply line for Hungary and Slovakia. Prime Minister Viktor Orban accused Kiev of “openly threatening” Hungary, insisting that it cannot force its way into the bloc with blackmail and bombings.

Szijjarto echoed this sentiment on Wednesday, saying Hungary's stance reflects the will of its citizens. Earlier this summer, 95% of participants rejected EU membership for Ukraine in an online referendum that drew over two million Hungarians.

“The Hungarian people do not want Ukraine to join the European Union. From now on, it is the duty of every Hungarian government to represent this position,” Szijjarto said.

Brussels granted Ukraine EU candidate status in 2022. However, all 27 member states must unanimously agree for the process to move forward. Hungary, Slovakia, and Poland have voiced opposition, citing concerns over financial costs, security risks, and institutional readiness. Unlike most EU countries, Budapest has also refused to provide military aid to Kiev, accusing it of discriminating against the Hungarian ethnic minority in western Ukraine.

European policymakers are considering the creation of a 40km “buffer zone” between Russian and Ukrainian forces as part of a ceasefire or peace deal in a “desperate” attempt to end the conflict, Politico reported on Thursday, citing sources.

Under the plan, Western troops would take on a “dual role” – patrolling the demilitarized area and training Ukrainian soldiers, two unnamed diplomats claimed. France and Britain are expected to provide the bulk of the force, a move deemed unacceptable by Moscow. Paris and London are reportedly lobbying other NATO states for contributions, although few have publicly said they are ready to send troops to Ukraine.

The outlet claimed the plan could have “historical significance,” with officials likening it to Germany's partition during the Cold War. “They're grasping for straws,” Jim Townsend, a former Pentagon official, told the outlet, warning that a lightly staffed buffer zone would not deter Russia.

The idea is one of several scenarios under discussion for a possible truce or post-conflict arrangement, according to five European diplomats cited by the outlet. However Western officials are divided over the eventual size of the zone and whether Kiev would accept it, since it would likely require it to agree to territorial concessions.

Proposals also reportedly detail a range from 4,000 to as many as 60,000 troops. US President Donald Trump earlier said Washington would not deploy ground troops to Ukraine, but did not rule out other types of support.

Politico earlier reported that EU leaders have also floated the idea of involving a neutral third country to help enforce any ceasefire.

Neither Russia nor Ukraine has commented on the report, although Moscow has consistently opposed any NATO troop presence in Ukraine, citing the bloc's expansion towards Russian borders as one of the root causes of the conflict. At the same time, Russia has not ruled out security guarantees for Kiev from the West in principle.

The Vatican will host a series of events arranged by the LGBTQ community as part of the 2025 Roman Catholic Jubilee. Organizers say around 1,000 participants will take part in a pilgrimage to Rome next week.

In the Catholic Christian tradition, the Jubilee, also known as the Holy Year, is declared every quarter century by the Pope as a time of spiritual renewal. The current Holy Year runs from December 24, 2024, through January 6, 2026.

The Italian pro-LGBTQ group La Tenda di Gionata (‘Jonathan's Tent') has planned a pilgrimage as part of the celebrations. Group representative Alessandro Previti told Outreach.Faith on Wednesday that pilgrims from around 30 countries are expected to attend the three-day event. It will begin with a multilingual prayer vigil near the Church of Jesus in Rome on September 5, followed by a Mass and procession through the Holy Door at St. Peter's Basilica. The pilgrimage will conclude on September 7 with the Angelus prayer led by Pope Leo XIV in St. Peter's Square.

Bishop Francesco Savino, vice president of the Italian Bishops' Conference, who agreed to preside over the group's Mass, said in a recent interview that their inclusion reflects the Church's mission to welcome everyone, regardless of background or life choices.

“Inclusive welcome is... a posture of the heart and gaze. It is the very breath of the Gospel,” Savino stated.

The Vatican listed the pilgrimage on its official Jubilee calendar back in December 2024, when it was still presided over by the late Pope Francis. Francis has been seen as leading a more inclusive direction for the Catholic Church. Under his leadership, priests were allowed to bless same-sex couples and admit gay men to the priesthood. A Vatican official earlier told Reuters, however, that including the LGBTQ group on the Jubilee calendar did not mean the Church sponsored or endorsed the group's activities. 

Pope Francis' successor, Leo XIV, has expressed skepticism toward LGBTQ reforms in the Church, affirming that marriage is “between a man and a woman.” However, he has so far upheld Francis' earlier directive allowing blessings for same-sex couples.

NEW YORK, August 29. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump has ordered that former Vice President and ex-Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris be barred from receiving government security protection provided by Secret Service agents, CNN reported.

According to the broadcaster, Harris had been granted six months of protection after her term ended, which was set to be extended for another year under a directive signed by former President Joe Biden shortly before leaving office. Trump's order revoked this directive.

WASHINGTON, August 29. /TASS/. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair (1997-2007) and Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump's son-in-law, will work together to develop a post-war plan for the Gaza Strip, Barak Ravid, a correspondent with Axios, reported, citing White House officials.

According to him, Blair and Kushner, who was a senior adviser to Trump during his first presidential term in charge of the Middle East, got the US leader's ""blessing"" to intensify work on the plan to govern the Palestinian enclave. Finding an acceptable alternative to the radical Palestinian movement Hamas would be central, Ravid wrote, specifying this was the principled position of Israel also shared by the United States.

The ex-British prime minister and Trump's son-in-law don't have an answer yet as to who would take over the Gaza Strip instead of Hamas and ensure security there after hostilities end. While finalizing a plan may take time, the White House expects it to be ready when the Israeli military operation ends. By that time, the United States should lead the effort toward ""an internationally accepted governance structure"" in the Gaza Strip that would guarantee security to Israel and allow the Jewish state to pull out its troops from the enclave, according to Axios.

Government faces calls for police reform amid violent clashes across Jakarta and demonstrations in other cities

Hundreds of Indonesians have protested at sites across Jakarta over the death of a man hit by a police vehicle, in the first big test for Prabowo Subianto's nearly year-old government.

The man, a motorcycle ride-sharing driver, was hit at the site of violent clashes near parliament on Thursday as police sought to disperse demonstrators protesting about a number of issues including lawmakers' pay and education funding.

The protests on Friday afternoon in the capital of south-east Asia's largest economy prompted a number of schools to close early, and banks and businesses to ask employees to work from home. The military was deployed in some areas, footage broadcast by local media showed.

Drivers, students and Indonesians from other walks of life gathered outside the country's parliament and police headquarters in Jakarta to protest on Friday, throwing rocks at the gates and chanting: “Killer. Killer.”

One of the protesters, Pendi Nasir, a 43-year-old motorcycle driver, called for the police to conduct a transparent investigation into the death of the driver, Affan Kurniawan. “We don't want our colleagues here to become victims of this riot again,” he told Reuters, urging action against those at fault.

The standup comedian Aci Resti attended a protest at the parliament against the housing allowance for lawmakers. “I'm here to voice the opinions of my friends, who are fed up with everything, with the members of the House of Representatives, with everything, with the government,” she said.

Protesters were undeterred by the earlier remarks of Prabowo, the country's president, who called for calm, expressed condolences for Kurniawan's death and ordered a thorough investigation.

“I am shocked and disappointed by the excessive actions of the officers,” Prabowo said in a video message. “I have ordered a thorough and transparent investigation … and officers involved must be held accountable.”

Drivers wearing their signature green jackets also staged protests in other cities, including Surabaya and Bandung on Java island, and Gorontalo on the island of Sulawesi.

Amid the unrest, the rupiah closed 0.9% weaker against the US dollar, at 16,495. The stock index fell by as much as 2.3% to hit its lowest point since 12 August, before closing 1.5% down after recovering some of its losses on Friday.

“If Prabowo isn't careful … protests may devolve into chaos,” Made Supriatma, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, told Reuters.

As Thursday's protest persisted into the night, local media reported that riot police fired teargas and used water cannon to try to disperse people.

The capital's police chief, Asep Edi Suheri, said that during the clashes on Thursday an armoured police vehicle had hit and killed Kurniawan, who worked for the ride-sharing services Gojek and Grab. He apologised to Kurniawan's family.

A motorcycle drivers' association said Kurniawan was not involved in the protests.

On Friday afternoon, the national police official Abdul Karim told reporters that authorities would detain for 20 days the seven police officers who were in the vehicle that hit Kurniawan for a breach of ethics and said questioning was taking place.

After Kurniawan's death, a group led by motorcycle drivers protested in front of the riot police's headquarters on Thursday night and on Friday, local media reported.

Kurniawan's funeral was attended by hundreds of fellow ride-sharing motorcycle drivers, who escorted his body to the burial site in a convoy of two-wheelers through the centre of Jakarta.

“We are deeply disappointed, especially with the security officials and national police chief,” Ari Potret, a driver who attended Kurniawan's funeral, told Reuters. “This is barbaric.”

Jakarta Legal Aid urged the government to release 600 people who had been arrested during the demonstrations.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

WASHINGTON (Jiji Press) — The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration on Thursday started displaying one of the two original copies of the instrument of surrender of Japan in World War II as part of a special exhibition to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the war this year.

The instrument was signed on Sept. 2, 1945, aboard the USS Missouri battleship anchored at Tokyo Bay by then Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu, Gen. Douglas MacArthur, supreme commander of the Allied Powers, and others.. It will be on display until Oct. 1.

The other copy is kept in the Japanese Foreign Ministry's Diplomatic Archives.

The original copy of the Imperial rescript on the signing of the instrument of surrender, inked by Emperor Showa is also on display at the U.S. archives.

U.S. President Donald Trump is ""objectively, a Soviet or Russian asset,"" Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said in a speech on Aug. 27.

Speaking on a panel for university students, Rebelo de Sousa was discussing how Trump represented a new breed of world leader on a world stage with rapidly shifting power dynamics.

""With one peculiar and complex thing — the supreme leader of the world's greatest superpower is, objectively, a Soviet or Russian asset. He functions as an asset,"" he said in comments reported by CNN.

""I am saying that, objectively speaking, the new American leadership has strategically favored the Russian Federation.""

Trump's second term in office has seen a dramatic shift in the U.S.'s stance towards Ukraine and Russia compared to that of his predecessor, President Joe Biden.

Despite a now months-long U.S.-led effort to end the war in Ukraine, Trump has yet to take any concrete steps to pressure Russia to stop fighting, while at various points, temporarily halting military aid and intelligence sharing to Ukraine, and repeatedly publicly berating the country's President, Volodymyr Zelensky.

Most recently, after an overnight Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv that killed 23 people including four children, the White House equated the strike with Ukraine's defensive attacks against Russian infrastructure that supports its full-scale invasion. 

Questions about Trump's possibly shady relationship with Russia and the country's security services have long swirled, even culminating in a special counsel investigation during his first term in office.

Though that investigation found evidence of ""extensive criminal activity"" by Trump, his associates, and some of his family members, it found no evidence that he was working for, or had ever been recruited by, Russia's security services.

Yet the accusations have continued, and Rebelo de Sousa is not the first European official to accuse Trump of being a Russian asset — in March, British lawmaker Graham Stuart raised the possibility that Trump had been groomed by the Kremlin's security services over a period of decades.

At least 25 people were killed in the attack on the capital, including four children, authorities said. Three of them were aged 2, 14, and 17.

Kallas met with the ministers in Copenhagen on Aug. 29 to discuss several issues, including security guarantees for Ukraine.

""I welcome that there is broad support today to expand our EU military mission mandate to provide training and advice inside Ukraine after any truce,"" Kallas said.

The fire started as a result of a Ukrainian drone attack on Aug. 28 near a village close to Gelendzhik, a Russian resort town on the Black Sea coastline, according to the reports.



Russia has quietly expanded its Votkinsk missile plant to produce intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States. Its output has reportedly tripled since 2022, strengthening Russia's capacity to wage war. 



Security guarantees for Ukraine should include provisions related to army funding, agreements with NATO members, and sanctions against Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

Some 22% of respondents said they are very pessimistic about a possible peace deal in Ukraine, while 45% said they are somewhat pessimistic, according to a Gallup poll.

A Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv overnight on Aug. 28, which left 23 dead, is undermining peace efforts led by U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukraine's allies, President Volodymyr Zelensky said later the same day.

""It is a strike against Ukraine. It is a strike against Europe. And it is also a strike by Russia against President Trump, and against other global actors,"" Zelensky said in an evening address.

At least 23 people were killed in the attack on Ukraine's capital, including four children, authorities said. Three of them were aged 2, 14, and 17. Sixty-three people, including 11 children, were injured. Among them, 30 were hospitalized, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported.

""This strike clearly shows that Russia's goals have not changed. They want war — and they are striking not only our people, not only our cities and communities. Russia is now striking at everyone in the world who seeks peace,"" Zelensky said.

Zelensky denounced Russian President Vladimir Putin for the strikes on Kyiv. He urged for additional sanctions to be imposed on Moscow and for tariffs to be imposed on Russia's trading partners.

Trump has previously threatened to impose secondary sanctions in the form of tariffs against Russia's trading partners if Moscow does not work towards a peace deal to end its war against Ukraine.

""In Washington, we heard that Putin is supposedly ready to end the war — to meet at the leaders' level and resolve key issues. But instead, he chooses (ballistic missiles) over any real steps toward peace,"" Zelensky said.

Trump has previously proposed facilitating a bilateral meeting between Zelensky and Putin, which could then be followed by a trilateral meeting with the U.S. leader.

""He kills children in order not to talk about when and how peace will come. The problem is that he is not afraid to strike even against the leaders he makes promises to,"" Zelensky said.

Putin and Trump met in Alaska on Aug. 15 as the U.S. leader intensifies efforts to broker a peace deal.

""A clear response of the world to this evil is needed. There are no deadlines that Putin would not break. There are no diplomatic opportunities that would not be ruined because of Russia. Strong steps are needed,"" Zelensky said.

Trump previously issued a deadline of Aug. 8 for Russia to reach a peace deal with Ukraine or face additional sanctions.

Even as Russia refused to cease hostilities by the deadline, no additional measures were imposed by the White House.

European defence ministers pledged Friday to ramp up support for Ukraine and increase pressure on Russia, a day after a Russian air assault on Kyiv killed 23 people and badly damaged a European diplomatic compound.

Outrage over the attack propelled Europe's leaders to condemn Russia even before Friday's meeting and call for tougher measures on Moscow like seizing frozen assets, further sanctions and increasing support for Ukraine's military and membership in the European Union.

“Everybody understands that, considering how [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is mocking the peace efforts, the only thing that works is pressure,” said Kaja Kallas, foreign policy chief for the European Union.

They also discussed European troops' deployment in Ukraine to guarantee security and monitor a peace that seems distant as American efforts to broker peace between Ukraine and Russia appear stalled.

Kyiv's European allies are looking to set up a force that could backstop any peace agreement, and a coalition of 30 countries, including European nations, Japan and Australia, has signed up to support the initiative. Kallas said that in terms of security guarantees for Ukraine, the U.S. is demanding that Europe carry “the lion's share” of the burden.

Military chiefs are figuring out how that security force might work. The role that the U.S. might play is unclear. Trump has ruled out sending U.S. troops to help defend Ukraine against Russia.

On Thursday, two missiles landed about 50 metres from an EU diplomatic mission in Kyiv, shattering the office's windows and doors but causing no injuries there. The EU summoned Russia's envoy in Brussels, Karen Malayan, and told her that damages to the mission “are serious and constitute a violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,” said Anitta Hipper, an EU foreign policy spokesperson.

The UN Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting on air strikes against Ukraine on Friday afternoon at the request of Ukraine and five European council members – Britain, France, Slovenia, Denmark and Greece. Two of Ukraine's top envoys were set to meet Friday with the Trump administration regarding mediation.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky after Thursday's attack on Kyiv.

She said that Trump “was not happy about this news, but he was also not surprised.”

Leavitt noted that Ukraine has also launched effective assaults on Russia's oil industry in recent weeks.

“Perhaps both sides of this war are not ready to end it themselves,” Leavitt said. “The President wants it to end, but the leaders of these two countries … must want it to end as well.”

In Copenhagen, Kallas said defence ministers from across the 27-nation bloc discussed increasing sanctions on Russia, ramping up defence supplies to Ukraine's army and European contribution to postwar security guarantees, which could include EU training missions into Ukraine once a ceasefire is in place.

At a news conference following the meeting, Kallas said the ministers had discussed ways to work around Hungary's refusal to back Ukraine. She said the EU has €6.6-billion blocked by Hungary's veto that could potentially be sent to Ukraine via NATO's new Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List approved by Trump.

On Thursday, the United States approved a US$825-million arms sale to Ukraine that will include extended-range missiles and related equipment to boost its defensive capabilities.

Lithuania's Defense Minister Dovilė Šakalienė said the attack on Kyiv on Thursday shows that hope now for peace is “naive” and that “all Putin is doing is really stalling, actually cheaply buying time to kill more people and to imitate sort of willingness to maybe stop his own murderous actions.”

She said Europe must deal with Russia more forcefully, like seizing frozen Russian assets.

“That is actually one power that we are not using enough yet,” she said. “Over 200 billion of Russian assets would be extremely helpful in both pumping this money in Ukrainian defence industry and buying American weapons.”

Simon Harris, Ireland's Defence Minister, said more must be done to force Russia to end the war.

“It's imperative that those of us in the European Union now consider further sanctions, what more measures can be taken to increase the pressure on Russia to end this brutal and aggressive war on Ukraine and the huge impact that that's having on civilians,” he said.

European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen began a tour of EU nations bordering Russia or Belarus on Friday, including visits to arms factories and border installations. She met Friday with Latvian Prime Minister Evika Silina and toured a drone manufacturer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","India vs. US: Who stands to lose most in the trade dispute?","https://www.dw.com/en/india-vs-us-who-stands-to-lose-most-in-the-trade-dispute/a-73790714","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 06:12:48 GMT","

US tariffs on Indian goods have risen to 50%, one of the highest rates in the world. The trade row between two of the world's biggest economies could have serious consequences for both. 

When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a state visit to the US in June 2023, the pomp and pageantry reflected how keen the US side was to promote the countries' strong ties.

""I've long believed that the relationship between the United States and India will be one of the defining relationships of the 21st century,"" said then-President Joe Biden when welcoming Modi.

When Modi returned to the White House earlier this year to meet the newly elected Donald Trump, there was less pageantry but still considerable warmth and much talk of deal-making.

Six months later, the situation has changed dramatically. As of August 27, most Indian goods going into the US market now face a 50% tariff, one of the highest rates in the world.

Tensions escalated swiftly after the US and India failed to strike an agreement during trade talks in the wake of Trump's major announcement of tariffs against trading partners in April. Matters got even worse when Trump announced an additional 25% tariff on India over its purchases of Russian oil.

The deterioration in relations with one of the US' key strategic partners in the Indo-Pacific region has alarmed those in Washington who see the relationship with India as vital for regional stability and security. Meanwhile, in India, there is grave concern over what the tariffs will mean for the country's fast-growing economy.

Rick Rossow, who holds the Chair on India and Emerging Asia Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, told DW he believes Trump was right to call out India's ""protectionism"" but says the tools and rhetoric being used to deal with the issues are ""harsh"" and increasingly causing political damage to Modi.

While many have interpreted the breakdown in negotiations as resulting from India's refusal to stop buying Russian oil, Sushant Singh, lecturer of South Asian studies at Yale University, believes it is connected to the India-Pakistan conflict which took place in May this year and Trump's role in ceasefire negotiations.

""It (the ceasefire) is something which Trump claims came because of him and his officials, whereas Modi domestically wants to project that it came because he pummelled Pakistan, and Pakistan came on its knees, begging and asking for a ceasefire,"" he told DW.

""I think that is something where Modi can't afford to concede to Trump because his domestic political argument would completely be negated.""

India's economy is now under pressure from the tariffs. The US is its biggest trade partner, with India exporting around $87 billion (€74.5 billion) worth of goods to the US in 2024. The Global Trade Research Initiative, a New Delhi-based think-tank, predicts that number will fall by more than 40% in 2026, dropping to around $50 billion.

India's main exports to the US include sectors such as textiles and jewellery and gemstones. The Global Trade Research Initiative thinks some of those sectors could see a massive collapse in export volumes over the next 12 months, potentially putting hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk.

But Rossow noted that, as the tariffs targeted goods and manufacturing remained a relatively small share of India's economy, at around 14%, the impact on the ""real economy will be limited.""

However, he also pointed out that Modi had been prioritizing manufacturing and 'Make in India' policies. ""Worsening access to the largest export market may stifle this part of the economy at a critical juncture,"" he said.

The US exported around $42 billion worth of goods to India in 2024,  less than half the amount going in the other direction.

""If you look at the balance sheet, the losses are mainly India's,"" said Singh. ""Under Trump, the US is clearly approaching China, India and the Indo-Pacific differently. So India has no leverage.""

Rossow said that while India would clearly suffer more than the US economically, the US would also pay a price, notably in the form of a big expected drop in Indian students coming to US universities.

Gary Hufbauer, an international trade expert with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said one economic factor to consider is that previous US plans to move some manufacturing away from China to India are now threatened.

""For a while it looked like India would be the alternative manufacturing site for a lot of stuff made in China,"" he told DW. ""But that looks unlikely now.""

Singh pointed to the fact that, despite some Indian workers being forced to leave the US as part of Trump's immigration crackdown, prominent Indian-US tech leaders had not spoken out against the US president. ""None of them are going to take on Trump because they are also scared.""

However, he acknowledged that the big risk for Trump was geopolitical, rather than economic.

""You could have a situation where China essentially emerges as this big Asian power, with India willing to accept a slightly lower role, and they could align geopolitically - that would be geopolitically very detrimental to the United States.""

India and the US could still strike a trade deal, and Sushant Singh believes New Delhi is desperate to get one done.

""They want to have a deal,"" he said. ""They want to give Trump a win. It could happen any time, any week, any month, knowing the nature of the Trump administration.""

Rossow thinks a thaw in tensions is in both sides' interests.

""India is on the verge of becoming the world's third-largest economy,"" he said. ""With our shared concerns about China's rise, militarily and economically, a strong partnership will be crucial for regional security and shared growth.""

Singh believes the whole episode represents a serious threat to Modi domestically — something which could force him to the table.

A 21-year-old motorcycle taxi driver was killed near a protest hotspot around the parliament building in Jakarta when he was run over by an armored police vehicle.

Mass protests in Indonesia reignited on Friday following the death of a 21-year-old motorcycle taxi driver who was run over and killed by an armored police vehicle as security authorities tried to contain student protests.

Affan Kurniawan, the driver, died on Thursday evening near the parliament in Jakarta during violent clashes as police tried to disperse demonstrators protesting a number of issues, including lawmakers' pay and education funding.

The incident sparked outrage. Early Friday morning, protesters marched to the headquarters of the anti-riot police Mobile Brigade in central Jakarta. Some of the protesters attempted to storm the compound.

The police responded by using tear gas to disperse the crowd. An angry group of protesters then set fire to a police post and cars parked near the compound.

Indonesia's national police chief, Listyo Sigit Prabowo, offered a public apology and promised that the police would investigate.

""I deeply regret the incident and extend my sincerest condolences to the victim, his family and the entire ride-hailing community,"" he said.

In a specially recorded video message, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto called for calm and expressed his condolences for the death of Kurniawan.

""I am shocked and disappointed by the excessive actions of the officers,"" Prabowo said, adding that he has ordered ""a thorough and transparent investigation, stressing that ""officers involved must be held accountable.""

In recent days, tens of thousands of people have been demonstrating in Jakarta and other Indonesian cities against a new monthly housing allowance of 50 million rupiah (€2,600 or $3,000) for parliamentarians.

This announcement came at a time when many people in the Southeast Asian nation are struggling with rising living costs and mass layoffs. Critics say this amount is nearly ten times higher than the minimum wage in many regions.

Public frustration has been fueled further by social media videos showing politicians flaunting their lavish lifestyles.

Police have used tear gas and water cannons against the crowds, arresting hundreds.

After meeting European Union defense and foreign affairs ministers in Copenhagen, top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas described ""broad support"" for a military training mission inside Ukraine. Follow DW for the latest.

This is a roundup of news and analysis on Russia's war in Ukraine on Friday, August 29.

French President Emmanuel Macron has been hosting German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the southern port city of Toulon, where the two leaders talked about shared security challenges — above all, the war in Ukraine.

After the meeting, Merz said Russia was ignoring all diplomatic efforts to end the conflict.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron, speaking in southern France, vowed further security assistance for Kyiv and more economic sanctions against Moscow in the face of increasingly intense Russian airstrikes on Ukraine.

Speaking in Toulon, Merz said he was ""not surprised"" at the Kremlin's stalling, saying, ""It is part of this Russian president's strategy."" 

""Earlier this week,"" Merz continued, ""it became clear to me that President Putin is unwilling to meet with President Zelensky and has set preconditions that are downright unacceptable.""

In a joint statement released after the two met, Germany and France said, ""despite intensive international diplomatic efforts, Russia shows no intention to end its war of aggression against Ukraine.""

""In light of the massive Russian airstrikes on Ukraine and its population, and the consequences for our own security, France and Germany will therefore provide additional air defense to Ukraine,"" the statement continued. 

Both Berlin and Paris agreed ""on the need to provide Ukraine with credible security guarantees"" in the event that the war can be ended. 

Neither nation, however, has committed to the idea of deploying troops to Ukraine.

The second prong of the joint approach, the statement said, was to ""consider the effective implementation and further strengthening of sanctions essential to exert maximum pressure on Russia to end its illegal war of aggression against Ukraine, and ultimately bring peace to Ukraine and Europe.""

Accordingly, Berlin and Paris will push for both EU and G7 sanctions targeting third-country businesses supporting Russia's invasion of Ukraine as part of their effort.

EU top diplomat Kaja Kallas on Friday said member states broadly support the idea of providing military training inside Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire with Russia. The EU has already trained more than 80,000 Ukrainian soldiers but none inside its borders.

Kallas suggested the effort could be integrated into the West's security package for ally Ukraine if a ceasefire comes to fruition. 

""I welcome that there is broad support today to expand our EU military mission mandate to provide training and advice inside Ukraine after any truce,"" said Kallas after meeting with EU defense ministers. ""We must be ready to do more. This could include placing EU trainers in Ukrainian military academies and institutions,"" she said. 

A formal change to the bloc's defense mandate would require unanimity among all 27 member states.

Beyond dragging his feet and refusing to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Russian President Vladimir Putin has also greatly increased the scale of Russia's nightly attacks on Ukraine as US and European efforts to end the war in Ukraine appear very much stalled.

""The past weeks we have seen diplomatic efforts to end Russia's war and it's clear that Europe wants peace, America wants peace, Ukraine wants peace."" The only actor ""who doesn't want peace,"" Kallas said, ""is Russia.""

Ukraine's top commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said he discussed steps that could help secure a just and lasting peace in the war with Russia with his counterparts from the so-called ""Coalition of the Willing"" member countires.

""Jointly developed practical solutions, supported by real mechanisms of political and diplomatic support from reliable partners of Ukraine, are capable of ensuring a just and lasting peace for Ukraine and all of Europe,"" Syrskyi said in a statement.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia is amassing a force of about 100,000 troops near Pokrovsk, a stronghold in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region.

""There is a build-up and concentration of the enemy there. Up to 100,000. That's what we have as of this morning. They are preparing offensive actions in any case,"" Zelenskyy told journalists.

He also said that Ukrainian forces were pushing Russian troops out of the northeastern border region of Sumy.

Moscow vehemently denounced Emmanuel Macron for what it termed ""vulgar insults"" after the French president characterized Russian leader Vladimir Putin as a ""predator"" and an ""ogre.""

During an interview with LCI last week, Macron cautioned European leaders against trusting Putin. ""For his own survival, he needs to keep eating... That means he is a predator, an ogre at our gates,"" Macron said.

In response, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters in Moscow that Macron constantly makes strange statements that sometimes cross the line of decency and turn into ""low-grade insults.""

""This is unworthy of a head of state,"" she said.

Russia has long criticized France's support for Ukraine, accusing Paris of provoking the conflict.

Russia has not ruled out a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agencies.

""However, Putin believes that any meeting at the highest level must be well prepared so that the results previously achieved at the expert level can be finalized,"" he said.

However, thus far, work at the expert level has not progressed at all, Peskov added.

Peskov was responding to statements by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who said on Thursday that it was ""obvious"" that Zelenskyy an Putin would not be having a face-to-face summit, despite previous assurances from the United States to that end.

Earlier this week, US President Donald Trump also cast doubt on a Zelenskyy-Putin meeting, despite previously saying ""arrangements for a meeting"" between the Ukrainian and Russian leaders had begun.

The Ukrainian military announced that it had carried out an overnight strike on a facility in Russia's western Bryansk region that it says supplies diesel fuel for Moscow's war effort in Ukraine.

According to a statement from Ukraine's General Staff, the station in the village of Naitopovichi has a pumping capacity of around 10.5 million tons per year.

The statement also said that the strike caused a fire.

Ukraine has previously struck Russian oil facilities many times. Ukraine argues that Russia's oil industry helps fund Moscow's war efforts.

The Swedish government summoned the Russian ambassador in Stockholm to protest Russia's continued attacks on Ukrainian cities and civilians, it said in a statement.

""It is clear that Russia is not interested in peace as it continues its attacks all over Ukraine. Now is the time to maximize pressure on Russia, including through more sanctions,"" Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard wrote on X.

On Thursday, the EU and the UK also summoned Russian envoys to protest Moscow's massive attack on Ukraine that same day, which caused damage to the EU mission, a British government cultural building and two media outlets' offices.

Following the Thursday's Russian air attack on Kyiv, which resulted in at least 23 deaths, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced on Friday that eight people were still missing.

""The fate of eight people still remains unknown, and 53 others were injured,"" he wrote on X.

According to the Ukrainian leader, four children were among the deceased. ""The youngest girl was not even three years old,"" Zelenskyy said.

The president offered his condolences to the families and loved ones of those who were killed.

""Russia only understands strength, and demonstrations of strength are needed now,"" Zelenskyy said, again urging allies to impose harsher sanctions on Moscow.

Ukrainian authorities said that Russian strikes overnight had killed two people in the Dnipropetrovsk region.

""Unfortunately, two people died — a man and a woman. My sincere condolences to their relatives,"" wrote Sergiy Lysak, the head of the regional military administration, on Telegram.

Lysak said the drone strike on the Synelnyky district also wounded a 50-year-old woman. A separate attack on the city of Dnipro wounded two people, including a 46-year-old man who was in a ""serious condition"", he added.

The strikes occurred just days after Kyiv acknowledged the Russian army's advance into the east of the central Dnipropetrovsk region for the first time.

Before the meeting of EU defense ministers in Copenhagen, Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene said secondary sanctions on Russia would be the most efficient way to stop the flow of funds to the Kremlin's war in Ukraine.

Sakaliene also said Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""cheaply buying time to kill more people and to imitate willingness to maybe stop his own murderous actions.""

""Putin is not to be trusted,"" she said.

Meanwhile, Irish Defense Minister Simon Harris said considering more sanctions was ""imperative"" to pressure Russia into ending the war.

In turn, Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said NATO membership would be the best security guarantee for Ukraine.

Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonsson said EU troops could be sent on a mission to Ukraine if needed, but a ceasefire or peace agreement is needed before there is consensus on the matter. 

Sebastian Hartmann, the deputy of German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, said Ukraine could rely on Europe, and expressed support to an initiative by EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas to provide Kyiv with 2 million more rounds of ammunition. 

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Thursday that the bloc's 19th package of sanctions will be presented soon.

Arriving at a two-day meeting of EU defense and foreign affairs ministers in Copenhagen, European Union chief diplomat Kaja Kallas strongly condemned a deadly wave of heavy airstrikes on Kyiv and urged more sanctions on Russia.

""These attacks show that Putin is just mocking any kind of peace efforts that are made,"" Kallas said.

""What we have to do is increase pressure on Russia,"" she said, adding that new sanctions on Russian energy exports and financial services ""will hurt them the most.""

In addition to punitive measures against Russia, Kallas urged EU countries to continue supplying Ukraine with arms.

Ministers gathered in the Danish capital will also discuss security guarantees for Ukraine once the fighting is over.

Donald Trump has ordered government buildings to be constructed in the “classical style” of the ancient West, heralding a return to white-marble and colonnades.

In an executive order signed on Thursday night, the president declared that new projects should be built “in a style that uplifts and beautifies public spaces, ennobles our nation and commands respect from the general public.”

“Classical architecture [must] serve as the preferred architectural style for all federal public buildings, especially in the District of Columbia,” reads the order, entitled “Make Federal Buildings Beautiful Again.”

New construction must adhere more closely to the grand, Greco-Roman style of the US Capitol and White House, the order specifies. And it spells a return to the drawing board for construction projects designed in the brutalist or modernist style that came into favour in the 1960s.

In 1962, architects were encouraged to embrace contemporary designs by the Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture, formulated by a Democratic senator. That edict, now reversed by Mr Trump, resulted in a spate of harsh brutalist designs such as the little-loved J Edgar Hoover Building, which houses the headquarters of the FBI.

Since taking office, Mr Trump has dabbled in the world of real estate, where he made his name.

He has redesigned the White House to fit his tastes, fringing the Oval Office with gold, covering the grass of the Rose Garden with a white-stone patio and ordering the construction of a $200m ballroom.

Justin Shubow, the head of the National Civic Art Society, helped to draft the executive order and said it was a “monumental development… placing the government – and ultimately the American people – in charge.”

According to a poll commissioned by Mr Shubow's organisation, the US public prefers classical-style design over modern alternatives, by 72 per cent to 18 per cent respectively.

The survey placed seven pairs of buildings side-by-side, loosely matched in terms of scale and significance, and asked 2,000 respondents to choose between them.

One match-up placed the brutalist Hubert H Humphrey Building against the serene colonnades of the National Archives Buildings in DC, with 83 per cent favouring the latter.

“A majority of American taxpayers want classical, regionally inspired public buildings,” Mr Trump's order reads “and their government should respect their preferences.”

The White House clarified on Thursday that “classical” can refer to all pre-modernist styles of architecture, including Art Deco, which is not usually considered in the group.

The order revives a similar edict he issued in the final days of his first administration, which was swiftly reversed by Joe Biden.

Its text harks back to the influence of former presidents on the “timeless design” of their era, citing George Washington and Thomas Jefferson for personally guiding the style of the Capitol Building and White House.

According to Mr Shubow, the order will impact several federal buildings where construction is underway or soon set to begin, such as courthouses in Hartford, Connecticut and Chattanooga, Tennessee.

In recent months, the Trump administration has taken more control over the design of federal architecture, appointing three officials to the National Capital Planning Commission, a body that promotes the government's interest in Washington development.

Traditionally, the positions are reserved for architects and urban planners. Among the possible targets for redevelopment are the brutalist James V Forrestal building in DC, which houses the department of energy, the New York Times reported.

Recommended

The order makes explicit Mr Trump's distaste for brutalism, calling the style “deeply unpopular.”

It also fits with calls to “protect Western civilisation” that have flourished in online Maga communities, casting America as the inheritor of the Greco-Roman and British empires.

Critics have cast Mr Trump's order as both overly restrictive and a sign of cultural “supremacy and chauvinism”.

Submitting a complaint is now a “multi-step, illogical navigation process,” the senators said.

In a letter sent to Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon on August 25, a group of Democratic senators, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts), condemned the department's decision to remove the ‘Submit a Complaint' button on the Office of Federal Student Aid's (FSA) website.

Since Trump's inauguration in January, the department has laid off approximately 1,300 people, close to half of its staff. Many of those employees handled borrowers' complaints, according to the senators.

The senators first raised these issues in a letter to the Education Department in March. In response, the agency assured Warren that “the button to submit a complaint has been moved from the top of the webpage to the footer and renamed ‘submit feedback.'”

But the senators say the department's response was “highly misleading and incomplete.” 

“What was once a simple click from the Department of Education's homepage, is now a multi-step, illogical navigation process,” they wrote in their August 25 letter. “Prior to the Trump Administration, submitting a complaint on the Federal Student Aid website involved a clear button on the home page labelled ‘Submit a Complaint.'”

Now, the process is far more complicated. On the bottom of the FSA homepage, on the left hand side, in a font smaller than almost everything else on the page, it says: “Help Center | Contact Us | Site Feedback.” If the user clicks on “Site Feedback,” a pop-up asks, “What kind of feedback are you sharing today?” Two options are provided — “Website Feedback” and “Other.” If the user clicks “Other,” they're finally provided with a link to submit a complaint. 

In March, Politico reported that emails between Education Department staffers show that they intentionally hid the button in order to reduce the number of complaints received. 

“Removing the ‘Submit a Complaint' button on Studentaid.gov is already underway,” Mell Brittian-Smith, a senior Education Department employee, wrote in an email obtained by Politico, adding that they would also like to remove the word “feedback” from the site. 

“I believe this change would help decrease contact center volume and the number of complaints that the Ombuds office receives — so an overall win,” she wrote.

In Fiscal Year 2024, the Education Department received just under 290,000 complaints; over 90 percent were submitted through the website, according to the Federal Student Aid's 2024 annual report. More than half of those complaints were related to student loan repayment. The second most common complaint concerned navigating the student aid application process.

Like many federal agencies, the Trump administration has gutted the Department of Education, which the president has said he plans to eliminate. As Department of Education secretary, McMahon, a former professional wrestling executive, has championed budget cuts, layoffs and, ultimately, the end of the department altogether. Earlier this year, the department stopped forgiving student loan debt for people enrolled in the Income-Based Repayment Program, without notifying Congress or borrowers. The program allows borrowers to have the balance of their debt forgiven after making 300 payments, which typically takes about 25 years. The department has not said when it will resume forgiving borrowers' debt.

It “is another clear example of retaliation against federal employee union members,” AFGE's national president said.

In the lead-up to Labor Day in the United States, President Donald Trump on Thursday escalated his attack on the union rights of federal employees at a list of agencies with an executive order that claims to “enhance” national security.

Trump previously issued an order intended to strip the collective bargaining rights from hundreds of thousands of government employees in March, provoking an ongoing court fight. A federal judge blocked the president's edict — but then earlier this month, a panel from the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit allowed the administration to proceed.

Government agencies were directed not to terminate any collective bargaining agreements while the litigation over Trump's March order continued, but some have begun to do so, according to Government Executive. On Monday, the 9th Circuit said in a filing that it would vote on whether the full court will rehear the case.

Amid that court fight, Trump issued Thursday's order, which calls for an end to collective bargaining for unionized workers at the Bureau of Reclamation's hydropower units; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service; National Weather Service; Patent and Trademark Office; and US Agency for Global Media.

Like the earlier order, this one cites the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. As Government Executive reported Thursday:

Matt Biggs, national president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, whose union represents a portion of NASA's workforce along with the American Federation of Government Employees, suggested that the administration's targeting of NASA — IFPTE's largest union — was in retaliation for its own lawsuit challenging the spring iteration of the executive order, filed last month.

“It's not surprising, sadly,” Biggs said. “What is surprising is that on the eve of Labor Day weekend, when workers are to be celebrated, the Trump administration has doubled down on being the most anti-labor, anti-worker administration in US history. We will continue to fight in the courts, on the Hill, and at the grassroots levels against this.”

Everett Kelley, national president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), which also sued over the March order, said that “President Trump's decision to issue a Labor Day proclamation shortly after stripping union rights from thousands of civil servants, a third of whom are veterans, should show American workers what he really thinks about them.”

“This latest executive order is another clear example of retaliation against federal employee union members who have bravely stood up against his anti-worker, anti-American plan to dismantle the federal government,” Kelley declared, taking aim at the president's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

“Several agencies including NASA and the National Weather Service have already been hollowed out by reckless DOGE cuts, so for the administration to further disenfranchise the remaining workers in the name of ‘efficiency' is immoral and abhorrent,” the union leader said. “AFGE is preparing an immediate response and will continue to fight relentlessly to protect the rights of our members, federal employees, and their union.”

The countries insist Iran resume talks with the US, yet they don't demand that the US refrain from bombing again.

France, Germany, and the UK (E3) have announced they will trigger snapback sanctions on Iran at the United Nations. This will launch a 30-day process that will likely culminate in the full reinstatement of all U.N. sanctions lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. The move will carry four major consequences.

First, the U.N. Security Council will formally adopt the demand — pushed by Israel — that Iran cease all uranium enrichment. Israel designed this demand to sabotage nuclear diplomacy and edge the conflict toward war.

Next, a U.N. arms embargo on Iran will return, potentially curbing Tehran's ability to rebuild deterrence against future Israeli or American strikes, provided Russia and China treat the snapback as legitimate and enforce it.

Third, Iran's already fragile economy will deteriorate further; its currency has already taken a hit.

And finally, far from advancing diplomacy, the measure risks accelerating escalation. While Israel hardly needs a pretext to launch another strike on Iran, as I have argued, snapback could provide useful political cover — a thin veneer of legitimacy — for renewed attacks.

The E3 argues that snapback is necessary to pressure Iran into resuming talks with the U.S. and granting the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) access to its nuclear facilities, including disclosure of the stockpile of 60% enriched uranium.

On the surface, these demands may seem reasonable. But Tehran has legitimate reservations. Iranian officials suspect the IAEA of leaking sensitive information that enabled Mossad's assassination campaign against their nuclear scientists, and they fear that revealing the stockpile's location could simply invite another round of U.S. airstrikes.

Moreover, Iran was at the negotiating table when Israel and the U.S. began bombing it. The E3 now insists Tehran return to talks, yet they make no parallel demand that Washington refrain from bombing again.

Perhaps most importantly, given the unbridgeable gap over enrichment, Trump's limited patience for diplomacy, and Israeli pressure to resume hostilities, restarting talks that are almost certain to collapse — unless both sides show greater flexibility on enrichment — only increases the likelihood that war will start sooner rather than later.

But that may well be the point. The E3 of today bears little resemblance to the one of two decades ago. When it was created in 2003, its purpose was to prevent the Bush administration — fresh off its disastrous and illegal invasion of Iraq — from launching another war, this time against Iran.

Today, the geopolitical context has shifted. Iran's alignment with Russia in Ukraine has recast it as a direct threat in Europe's eyes. The EU is also far more dependent on the transatlantic relationship than it was 20 years ago, while successive rounds of sanctions have rendered Iran a negligible economic partner for Europe.

Escalation with Iran through snapback now serves two EU objectives: punishing Tehran for supporting Russia in Ukraine, and aligning Europe with hawkish elements in the Trump administration — an alignment calculated to ease tensions in other areas of a transatlantic relationship under unprecedented duress.

In this sense, the E3 constellation that was designed in 2003 to prevent war may, in 2025, be pushing us closer to one.

But don't take it from me. After all, Germany's chancellor has openly admitted that Israel “did Europe's dirty work for it” by bombing Iran in June.

 How Washington and Tehran Can Bridge the Gap on Enrichment

 Robert Einhorn

It is not clear whether the recent Israeli and U.S. military strikes have decreased or increased the likelihood of a nuclear-armed Iran. The attacks have certainly inflicted major damage to the country's nuclear program. But they have not extinguished the Islamic Republic's interest in nuclear weapons. They have amplified uncertainty about the quantity, location, and current condition of critical elements of Iran's nuclear program. And they have failed to block Iran's pathways to building a bomb, including by using its surviving equipment, materials, and expertise in a small, covert operation.

In the aftermath of the strikes, the Trump administration has resumed its pursuit of a new nuclear agreement that would prohibit uranium enrichment and its associated infrastructure in Iran––a “zero enrichment” outcome that would stymie any Iranian intention to build a bomb but that has been firmly rejected by Tehran, at least so far. If, after determined efforts, such an agreement cannot be achieved, the administration may seriously consider relying solely on military and intelligence means to thwart Iran's efforts to revitalize its nuclear program, an approach strongly favored by the Israeli government. But a military option could lead to perpetual armed conflict in the region without reliably preventing Iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons. A preferable option would be to negotiate an agreement that permits but strictly limits and rigorously verifies uranium enrichment in Iran.



Since the ceasefire ending the 12-day war, the Trump administration has sought to resume its bilateral engagement with Iran. But Iran has not been ready to meet, in part due to divisions within Tehran's elite on the merits of negotiations with the United States. Iranian officials, including Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, have insisted on preconditions that Washington is unwilling to accept, such as a U.S. guarantee that Iran would not be attacked while negotiations were underway. According to Reuters, however, regime “insiders” say that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and members of the clerical power structure have recently reached a consensus that resumed negotiations are vital to the survival of the regime. If that is the case, Iran and the United States are likely to find a formula for returning to the negotiating table before long.

An urgent U.S. priority in any resumed talks should be to restore International Atomic Energy Agency monitoring activities in Iran, which were suspended by a law signed by Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on July 2. In the wake of the June military strikes, the IAEA can no longer account for roughly 400 kilograms of highly enriched uranium, which may have been buried under rubble or, as some believe, removed from storage facilities before the strikes. The agency also can't account for an unknown number of centrifuges that were produced after Iran denied the IAEA's access to centrifuge production workshops in 2021.



Bringing all of Iran's enriched uranium, centrifuges, and other potential components of a nuclear weapons program under IAEA surveillance and accountancy is essential to blocking Iran's pathways to nuclear weapons. IAEA experts visited Tehran on August 11 to discuss the modalities of resuming the agency's activities in Iran, but they were not given access to the country's nuclear sites. Although the Iranians are likely to soon grant the IAEA access to facilities that are not of proliferation concern, such as the Bushehr power reactor and the Tehran research reactor, they will continue withholding the kind of full cooperation essential to giving the IAEA a complete and accurate picture of their nuclear program. They may regard such cooperation as acceptable only as part of a comprehensive agreement and use the denial of cooperation as a bargaining chip to be played much later in the negotiations.

Resumed U.S.-Iranian talks could quickly focus on the issue that stalemated the first five rounds of negotiations during the second Trump administration: whether an agreement should ban all enrichment and enrichment-related infrastructure in Iran. The Trump administration says it remains firmly committed to its “zero enrichment” proposal, as the president's special envoy Steve Witkoff told ABC News on August 18. It may believe that the threat of further military strikes if Iran tries to revive its nuclear program––combined with Iran's current strategic vulnerability, economic weakness, and international isolation––means that Tehran has little choice but to abandon its enrichment program and perhaps even its nuclear weapons ambitions altogether.

Iran remains adamant, however, that it will not give up domestic enrichment. Iran's nuclear program, and especially its enrichment program, is a source of national pride, a demonstration of technological prowess, and a symbol of defiance. Iranian officials also claim that it serves as an insurance policy against possible fuel supply cutoffs by possible future suppliers of enriched uranium to Iran. The program, moreover, is an overriding national priority that Iran has pursued at enormous economic and human costs, including the martyrdom of senior scientists and military leaders.

We can assume that Iranian advocates of acquiring nuclear weapons, whether within or outside the leadership, staunchly oppose an enrichment ban, regarding it as tantamount to abandoning their nuclear ambitions once and for all. With hard-liners arguing that capitulating to U.S. demands would be a national humiliation and betrayal, Khamenei may fear that accepting zero enrichment could destabilize the regime.



Outside experts have suggested ways to close what appears to be an unbridgeable gap between the U.S. and Iranian positions on the enrichment issue. One such idea that has received attention in both official and think-tank circles is establishing a multilateral fuel cycle consortium that could produce enriched uranium to help meet the region's civil nuclear needs. Proponents believe the involvement of more than one country in the ownership, management, and perhaps even the operation of an enrichment facility would promote transparency and reduce the opportunity for any one country to divert the facility to the production of highly enriched uranium for nuclear weapons.

But finding a formula for a multilateral consortium that would be acceptable in both Tehran and Washington is likely to be very difficult. A consortium that sited an enrichment facility in a Gulf Arab country and excluded any domestic enrichment in Iran would have little appeal in Tehran. On the other hand, a consortium that permitted continued enrichment in Iran would have little appeal in Washington. Moreover, an enrichment facility managed and operated on a multinational basis, wherever it is located, could risk the dissemination of enrichment technology to additional countries, which would be a significant problem from a nonproliferation perspective.

With disagreement on enrichment blocking a comprehensive agreement, U.S. and Iranian negotiators have reportedly considered pursuing an interim agreement. Such an interim agreement would be a limited-duration arrangement that would set aside the enrichment issue for the time being, show progress on a small package of steps valued by one side or the other, and buy time to negotiate a final deal. Both sides might see an interim agreement as a way to keep the talks going rather than face the domestic political consequences of either failing to reach a comprehensive deal or making painful compromises to achieve one.



The elements of a possible interim agreement in the wake of the Israeli and U.S. military attacks would probably be quite different from what may have been considered by negotiators before the June war. For example, the suspension of Iranian production of uranium enriched to 60 percent––which was previously recommended by outside experts as an element of an interim deal––would no longer be of much interest to the United States because such production has already been halted, at least temporarily, by the attacks.

In a postwar interim agreement, the United States might seek an Iranian commitment to accept a significant restoration of IAEA monitoring activities or to refrain from certain nuclear-related activities, such as preparations to resume enrichment at damaged facilities. In exchange, Iran might seek partial sanctions relief, the release of billions of dollars of Iranian funds held in overseas accounts, or a pledge by the United States not to attack or support an attack against Iranian nuclear facilities.

But with each side seeking to maximize its benefits and minimize its concessions, finding a mutually acceptable formula for an interim deal could prove very difficult. And even if one could be found, an interim agreement would probably not last very long. With Iran likely to withhold full cooperation with the IAEA during any interim agreement, the continued uncertainty about unmonitored Iranian nuclear activities could become intolerable for Washington. And Iran's repeated failure to get major sanctions relief while still refraining from steps such as withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) could become intolerable for Tehran, especially its hard-liners.

Sooner or later, the two sides will have to come to grips with the enrichment issue. It is conceivable that the Iranians could eventually buckle under the threat of further military attacks and accept zero enrichment. But given the fierce hard-line opposition and the leadership's fear of the potential domestic consequences of surrendering to Israel and the United States, that is very unlikely. And if the Iranians don't buckle, the Trump administration will have to choose between two main options. The United States could rely on military and intelligence means to stop any Iranian efforts to acquire nuclear weapons. Or it could revise its negotiating position to seek an agreement that permits enrichment in Iran with tight limits and strong verification.



The military option would involve walking away from the negotiations, prioritizing intelligence collection to focus heavily on possible evidence of resumed nuclear activities, and, if necessary, using military force or covert operations to stop Iran from rebuilding its nuclear program and its degraded missile forces and air defenses. Israel would presumably take the lead in implementing this option but would have the support of the United States in terms of collecting intelligence, defending the approach diplomatically, and possibly participating in military or covert operations.

Supporters of this approach, including a significant number of officials and non-governmental experts in Israel and the United States, are confident that the deep penetration of Iran by Israeli intelligence and the dominance that Israel and the United States enjoy over Iranian airspace would enable the allies to detect evidence of resumed nuclear activities and, if necessary, strike Iranian targets with a high probability of success. Moreover, the absence of an agreement, in their view, would give Israel and the United States the ability to act promptly and decisively against Iran at a time of their choosing, without the delays and obfuscations associated with negotiated verification and enforcement procedures. And it would not involve compensating Iran with sanctions relief or throwing a lifeline to a regime struggling to stay afloat.

But pursuing the military rather than the diplomatic track has major downsides. The U.S. and Israeli military attacks were extremely successful against large, well-known nuclear facilities. But an Iranian effort to build an initial nuclear arsenal at much smaller, deeply buried secret sites would be much less vulnerable to preemptive strikes. Because forgoing negotiations would probably ensure that the IAEA's lack of sufficient access would persist, such a covert program would be easier for Iran to pursue under this approach.

This strategy could require repeated military strikes well into the future. Such a “mowing the grass” approach may prompt Iranian retaliation against Israel, U.S. interests, and U.S. partner countries––which, in turn, would risk drawing the United States into another prolonged armed conflict in the Middle East. It would also alienate the United States' Gulf partners, which fear regional instability and favor détente with Iran, and reduce prospects for greater regional normalization and integration. And ending negotiations and turning to military means could trigger Tehran's withdrawal from the NPT and possibly a long-deferred decision to build nuclear weapons.

The better option for the United States would be to reconsider its zero enrichment proposal and, instead, seek to negotiate a tightly restricted and rigorously verified uranium enrichment program. A revised U.S. proposal could be based on the principle that Iran would be permitted to have an enrichment program capable of meeting only the realistic, near-term fuel requirements of a genuinely peaceful nuclear program––a position consistent with Iran's longstanding (and disingenuous) claim that its program has always been exclusively peaceful. With Russia supplying fuel for the Russian-built power reactors at Bushehr and the operation of Iranian-designed power reactors still a long way off, Iran's current enrichment requirements are very modest, perhaps confined for the time being to fueling the Tehran research reactor and possible new research and isotope production reactors, whose enriched uranium requirements are much smaller than those of nuclear power reactors.

Such an approach would require Iran to eliminate its current stocks of uranium enriched to over five percent in uranium-235, either by diluting them or transferring them to another country (as Iran's excess inventory of enriched uranium was transferred to Russia under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA). It would also call on Tehran to dismantle or transfer to another country for secure storage centrifuges in excess of the enrichment capacity needed for meeting near-term fuel production requirements.

Iran would be required to promptly convert uranium enriched to below five percent, whether newly produced or in its existing inventory, from the gaseous form, which could be fed into centrifuges and further enriched for nuclear weapons, to the powdered form, which is less readily usable in a weapons program and is the form needed for the process of fabricating nuclear reactor fuel or targets for isotope production. On-hand inventories of enriched uranium below five percent as well as natural uranium in the gaseous form would be limited to the amount required to meet near-term fueling needs.



Iran would be required to declare to the IAEA and provide a justification for any expanded enrichment capacity, such as more centrifuges, increased enriched uranium inventory, or new facilities, that it believed was needed to support actual, near-term additions to its civil nuclear program––a new nuclear reactor in an advanced state of construction, for example––rather than to support planned additions that would not materialize for quite some time. In addition, the agreement would permit enrichment only at a single, above-ground enrichment facility and would require the permanent closure of the Natanz and Fordow enrichment facilities.

To rebuild the IAEA's––and therefore the international community's––complete and accurate understanding of Iran's nuclear program, especially in light of today's major uncertainties, monitoring and inspection arrangements in a new agreement would have to include but go beyond the measures contained in the JCPOA. Iran would provide detailed information about unmonitored activities carried out after it suspended application of the IAEA Additional Protocol in 2021, such as the production of centrifuges. Equipment and activities related to the fabrication of nuclear weapons would be banned, with dual-use equipment and activities declared and verified. Advanced monitoring technologies including real-time, online enrichment monitors would be extensively used at the discretion of the IAEA.

Streamlined inspection arrangements would be required to facilitate prompt IAEA access to suspect sites, including military and other sensitive facilities. Expeditious dispute resolution and enforcement procedures could help ensure that the relevant authorities, such as the governments of the parties to the agreement, the IAEA Board of Governors, or the United Nations Security Council, are in a position to take timely and appropriate action to address matters of non-compliance.

Special measures would be needed to deter noncompliance, including the right of parties to the agreement to suspend sanctions relief and other benefits to a noncompliant party. A U.S. unilateral statement reserving the right to take any necessary steps, including the use of force, to respond to violations of the agreement could also help deter noncompliance, although such a statement would not be part of the agreement.



A new agreement would, of course, include incentives for Iran, including sanctions relief and the release of Iranian funds still frozen in overseas accounts. Reversible commitments by Tehran would be matched by reversible incentives offered by Washington. Primary U.S. sanctions barring U.S. persons and entities from doing business with Iran could be relaxed, both to give American traders and investors opportunities available to their European and Asian counterparts and to give the United States a greater stake in the continuation of the agreement––which would address a key Iranian concern that a future U.S. administration could decide to withdraw from the agreement.

To be durable and to address concerns about the JCPOA's “sunset provisions,” which terminated key restrictions after ten and 15 years, the agreement would be permanent or have a very long duration, such as 25 to 30 years. It could be negotiated bilaterally between Washington and Tehran, in consultation with interested third parties, and perhaps later be formalized as a multilateral agreement. To make it legally binding and enhance its durability, the agreement should take the form of a treaty, requiring an affirmative two-thirds vote of the U.S. Senate, as compared to the JCPOA, which was a non-binding political commitment and did not require affirmative congressional approval.

In parallel with a nuclear agreement, there should be a separate commitment by Iran not to transfer ballistic missiles, rockets, and drones and associated equipment and technology to non-state entities, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. Reinforcing such an Iranian commitment would be ongoing cooperation between the United States and its regional partners to block Iranian assistance to its proxy network, using such tools as intelligence sharing, interdictions, sanctions, diplomatic pressures, covert operations, and targeted military attacks.



Although the United States and Israel have extraordinary intelligence capabilities, their intelligence services alone cannot provide confidence that Iran is not pursuing nuclear weapons. It will take national intelligence services plus a newly empowered, in-country presence of experienced IAEA personnel, with enhanced rights of access and advanced surveillance technologies, to provide such confidence. Only a new agreement negotiated with Iran can ensure that the IAEA will play such a role.

Restricting Iran's enrichment program in a new agreement could substantially increase the time it would take Iran to break out of the agreement, if it decided to do so, and produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear weapon. On the eve of the 12-day war, Iran's breakout time was about a week. Restrictions along the lines suggested here would extend that timeline by several months. Together with enhanced IAEA monitoring measures capable of promptly detecting a breakout attempt, this would provide plenty of time for the United States or others to intervene, including with military force, to thwart such a move. Moreover, the recent military attacks by Israel and the United States will greatly boost the credibility and deterrent value of the threat to intervene to stop an Iranian effort to race for a bomb.



A new agreement would serve U.S. regional security interests––as well as those of the United States' partners––much better than a strategy of mowing the grass. Instead of a confrontational regional environment characterized by periodic attacks against Iran and Iranian retaliation, a new agreement could bring greater stability and predictability. The United States would need to stay involved in regional affairs, both to assist its partners in defending against resurgent threats from Iran and its proxies and to press for strict Iranian compliance with the agreement. But the risks that the United States would be drawn into an armed conflict in the Middle East would decline significantly. Moreover, the United States' Gulf partners would welcome the deal and the opportunities it could provide for closer regional economic and political ties. It would also reaffirm Iran's adherence to the NPT and renunciation of nuclear weapons, which, together with verification measures to make those pledges credible, could help alleviate regional proliferation pressures.

But there are significant obstacles to achieving such an agreement. U.S. President Donald Trump would need to reverse course on zero enrichment and then overcome domestic opposition, including the charge from his base as well as mainstream skeptics of negotiations with Iran that the new deal merely recycles the JCPOA. He would also have to withstand strong criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a vocal advocate of eschewing talks with Iran, and cope with potential unilateral military actions by Israel that––intended or not––could complicate or derail negotiations.

Another potential obstacle is the “snap back,” a provision of the UN Security Council's Resolution 2231, which endorsed the JCPOA. That provision enables JCPOA participants to respond to non-compliance by another participant by bringing back into force all previous UN Security Council sanctions against Iran that were suspended by the JCPOA. On August 28, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom (known as the E3) initiated the 30-day snap-back process. If Iran agrees within thirty days to steps that, in the E3's view, demonstrate Tehran's willingness to reach a diplomatic solution—such as a resumption of U.S.-Iranian negotiations or the restoration of IAEA activities in Iran—the snap back would not be implemented. In that case, Resolution 2231 (and the right to invoke the snap back) would probably be extended beyond its October 18 expiration date. But if Iran does not agree to such steps, sanctions would be reimposed. Some Iranian lawmakers have warned that implementing snap-back sanctions could lead to Iran's withdrawal from the NPT, an action that could preclude negotiation indefinitely. Any prospects for productive negotiations could thus depend on the outcome of talks between Iran and the E3 countries over the next month.

Iran, of course, will have a say on whether a new agreement is achievable. In theory, the Islamic Republic should welcome U.S. acceptance of its primary negotiating demand: that it be allowed have a civil nuclear program that includes enrichment. But accommodating Iran's desire to retain some enrichment would not guarantee that a deal could be reached. Iranian negotiators may balk at restrictions on enrichment that deny them, perhaps permanently, a strategically important threshold nuclear weapons capability. They are also likely to resist monitoring arrangements that are more extensive and intrusive than they have accepted under the JCPOA. It would be a very tough negotiation.

It may not prove possible to negotiate an agreement with the strict limits on enrichment and the rigorous monitoring, inspection, and enforcement measures needed to reliably block Iran's pathways to acquiring nuclear weapons or to resuming its status as a threshold nuclear weapon state. In that case, the Trump administration will have little choice but to leave the negotiating table and turn to military, economic, and other coercive tools to eliminate the Iranian nuclear threat. But if Washington must pursue that strategy, it would be of immense value in gaining the domestic and international support needed to sustain it to be able to show that it made a flexible and sincere effort to find a diplomatic solution first––and was turned down by an Iranian regime determined to preserve its nuclear weapons option.

 How Democratic Unity May Determine Military Survival

 Nataliya Gumenyuk

It should not have been a surprise that the August 15 summit in Alaska between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump failed to end Russia's war in Ukraine. It had long been clear that Putin was not prepared to offer any terms that would allow a credible peace to take hold and that a meeting thousands of miles from the conflict that did not include Ukraine had little chance of yielding a meaningful outcome. Above all, it had almost no relation to what is happening in Ukraine itself.

Since late spring, Ukrainians have faced an almost daily reality of massive missile and drone attacks on their cities amid an intensifying Russian offensive along 750 miles of frontlines. As they see it, the Trump-Putin summit only confirmed the sense that they will need to keep fighting for a long time to come—and that the United States can no longer be counted on to support them. Many are prepared for this fight, even if they don't welcome it and even it means facing growing horrors, like Russia's brutal August 28 attack on a five-story apartment building in Kyiv that left 22 dead. But there is something else that has become more critical than ever in sustaining this effort, after three and half years of unrelenting war: maintaining social cohesion and democratic accountability, or what Ukrainians like to call the “wartime trust.”

In July, Ukrainians staged the largest protests since Russia's full-scale invasion began—the largest, in fact, since President Volodymyr Zelensky came to power in 2019. At one point, as many as 10,000 people gathered a few hundred meters from his office in Kyiv, with similar protests taking place in dozens of other towns across the country. The demonstrations were led by young people, but they were not complaining about the war or even the fact that many more of them, men and women, will be asked to fight the longer it continues. Instead, they were demanding limits to executive power, targeting a hastily enacted law that aims to curb the independence of Ukraine's national anticorruption agencies: the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine (SAPO).

Along with the reality of waning Western support, the protests marked a turning point in the country's democracy. Although a state of martial law continues, the main reason that Ukrainian society has mostly held together during the war is close cooperation among the government, private sector, civil society organizations, and citizens themselves. In the political sphere, most of the opposition parties have also rallied around the current leadership. But this united front will not endure on its own. As Ukrainians contemplate living in a state of war for years to come, their capacity to fight will depend even more on their ability to defend and strengthen the complex social and political bonds that have kept them and their government united.

For much of the past year, Ukrainians have been coming to terms with a stark reality. Not only has Western support declined overall, despite concerted European efforts to compensate for American disengagement; there is also now little prospect that the war will end any time soon. The limits of U.S. support were already in question in late 2023, when a new $60 billion aid package stalled in Congress. In the spring and summer of 2024, however, the belated passage of that bill—along with the Biden administration's decision to allow Ukrainian strikes deep inside Russia—brought hope that the United States would finally provide Ukraine with the capabilities it needed to truly hurt Russia. In the run-up to the U.S. election that November, Zelensky unveiled a plan outlining how the United States and its European allies could help Ukraine win the war.

Since the election, and especially since Trump's return to office in January, those hopes have dried up. Instead of providing more defense equipment to Ukraine and putting pressure on Russia, Trump has promised to secure a rapid peace deal and has now even met with Putin in what Ukrainians have interpreted mainly as a chance for Russia to try to force Ukraine to surrender. Meanwhile, on the substantive issues that a genuine peace accord would require, very little genuine progress has been made.

For Ukraine's civilian population, as well as for its soldiers on the frontlines, the odds of a cease-fire in the coming months seem remote. Since the spring, Russia has poured even more resources into the fighting despite experiencing some of the highest casualty rates since the war began. In recent weeks, Russian forces put extraordinary pressure on the area around Pokrovsk, in the Donetsk region, where for 18 months they had made very little progress. In mid-August, they achieved a notable breach in the frontline north of Pokrovsk, although Ukrainian forces have pushed them back from many of these gains in the days since. Russia has also carried out new offensive actions in Zaporizhzhia and other places along the front at high cost to troops on both sides.

Since late spring, Russia has meanwhile been stepping up its attacks Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, sometimes with more than 500 drones and missiles in a single night, in a clear effort to overwhelm Ukraine's air defenses. (In the August 28 overnight attack on the country, the Ukrainian military shot down 563 drones and 26 missiles.) Although Ukrainian forces remain on the defensive, they retain the lead overall in the innovative deployment of drones. Russia currently surpasses Ukraine in the production of a few types of drones, but Kyiv remains ahead in many other kinds. Ukraine has also maintained a significantly lower casualty rate—the proportion of its forces killed, wounded, and missing—than Russia, which has suffered tremendous human losses.



But the high cost that Ukraine has imposed on Russia has been insufficient to compel the Kremlin to abandon its objectives. The Russian military continues to draw on a large and regularly replenished pool of manpower and appears to place almost no value on the lives of its soldiers. According to Ukrainian commanders, Putin appears determined to continue the war until Russia secures the full occupation of the Donetsk region. In Moscow's official discourse, the war is still referred to as the “special military operation,” now framed primarily as the “liberation of Donbas,” the eastern Ukrainian region of which Donetsk is a major part.

This coveted territory includes Ukraine's strategic “fortress belt,” a series of crucial defenses around the major cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk north of Pokrovsk. At the summit in Alaska, Putin suggested to Trump that this land—which Russian forces has been unable to capture or occupy—could simply be handed over to Russia in an eventual “deal.” At the same time, Russia is launching new assaults along other parts of the frontline, including around Zaporizhzhia and Sumy. These attacks appear to be part of an effort to stretch Ukraine's defenses and keep Russia's longer-term territorial goals alive, and they have come at a high cost to troops on both sides.

Given the hard fighting and relentless attacks on civilians and cities, many Western observers assume that Ukrainian support for continuing the war is eroding. A Gallup survey in July, for example, found that 69 percent of Ukrainians believed their country should seek a negotiated end to the war “as soon as possible”—a notable increase from late 2024—compared with just 24 percent who said they supported continuing to fight until Ukraine won the war. But these figures do not indicate that Ukrainians are prepared to surrender or that they are less prepared to fight in the short term. The survey also did not specify the precise conditions under which they would accept such a negotiated end—details that matter greatly to Ukrainians, most of whom, as other polls have shown, firmly reject Russia's proposed plan and are not prepared for peace at any price.

Tellingly, the Gallup survey also showed that 68 percent of Ukrainians—nearly the same proportion who support a negotiated end to the war—thought it was “unlikely” that “active fighting will come to a lasting end” in the coming 12 months. In fact, Ukraine's military resolve has never been in question. More critical may be the extraordinary social cohesion that has made the country so resilient.

Ever since Russia launched its full-scale invasion, Ukraine's resilience has been shaped by a mutual dependency between state and society. The people contribute and sacrifice for the war; many have volunteered to fight, and others have worked in government or the private sector to support the effort. In return, state institutions have kept them safe to the extent possible and continued to deliver services. Alongside this implicit social contract, martial law gave the state the legal right to restrict many aspects of civic and political life. Yet in practice, only measures directly tied to national security were enforced. When the state moved to impose broader limits, those steps have been justified as responses to security threats.

Through much of the war, the Ukrainian government has seemed to acknowledge the need to remain aligned with the public. When lawmakers were debating a new mobilization law in early 2024, for example, Zelensky understood that the new rules could not be rushed and had to take account of the people's wishes. By contrast, the law curbing the independence of NABU and SAPO was rushed through parliament, with controversial amendments inserted at the last minute—almost as if to conceal them. For many Ukrainians, the anticorruption agencies have not only helped secure foreign aid, loans, and a path to EU accession; they are also a symbol of the country's democratic transformation. Nonetheless, Zelensky quickly signed the law the day it was passed.

The enormous public outcry was significant for several reasons. Many Ukrainians saw the government as having crossed a redline in its expansion of executive power. Equally important was what the controversy suggested about Zelensky, who for perhaps the first time had misread the public mood. Sometimes described as a populist, Zelensky is often swayed by polling, and on issues such as negotiations with Russia and dealing with the United States and Europe, he has generally been aligned with mainstream Ukrainian opinion. To most of his constituents, the president's wartime leadership has come to be viewed not as heroic or exceptional but simply as what any public official in his place should do. Yet in this case, according to many sources close to the government, the president had been personally involved in promoting, initiating, and negotiating a deeply unpopular law.



The protests exposed another vulnerability, as well. Zelensky has been criticized by the political opposition, civil society, and by some members of the armed forces for maintaining too sharp a divide between the frontline and the home front. A key part of his governing strategy has been to promote a sense of normalcy in civilian society: keeping businesses functioning and public life active, with restaurants, festivals, and bookstores, and reducing Ukrainians' desire to leave the country. Amid the fighting, death, and destruction in the east and unremitting nighttime attacks on cities, however, these peacetime atmospherics can seem jarring. They may also be unsustainable.

In the eyes of his critics, Zelensky has allowed too many Ukrainians to remain physically and mentally demobilized, placing a greater burden on those already exhausted by years of fighting. In late August, the government announced a controversial decision to allow men aged 18 to 22 to leave the country freely. Although the official mobilization age begins at 25, some fear that the law could deprive the country of potential soldiers. Meanwhile, even after more than a year of debate, Ukrainian soldiers still have no defined term of service or demobilization plan. Unwilling to release the most experienced troops, the government has taken only minimal steps to ease their situation, such as a law signed at the end of July mandating 30 days of leave each year.

Manning the army continues to be a fraught issue. The government has generally used incentives rather than outright enforcement to mobilize people. Since approval of the mobilization law of April 2024, recruitment has been decentralized: individual brigades and divisions now conduct their own outreach and compete for new soldiers. This has created a situation in which the most highly regarded and resourceful units can bring in more recruits, and their ability to do so has become a measure of success as other units struggle for manpower. Overall, there are still many loopholes in the system, and current troop levels are far from adequate.

At home, wartime governance has been chaotic and uneven. Some businesses have faced pressure from the authorities over tax issues, law enforcement powers have been strengthened, and media freedoms have been curtailed. Concerns about corruption have also persisted, although Ukrainians are more worried about the expansion of executive power. Ukrainians tend to use the term “corruption” to describe any instance of poor governance, mismanagement, or inefficient bureaucracy. Selective justice is a problem, and there are suspicions that corruption allegations—whether by law enforcement bodies or a proliferation of dubious media outlets, Telegram channels, and bot farms—are being used against political opponents at the local and national level. Under Ukraine's strict disclosure laws, even the omission of a small holding in an asset declaration can be enough to end a career. In this context, the Ukrainians protesting the July law were driven less by the imperative of fighting corruption than about marking the limits of governmental power. There was a broad sense that the authorities had begun to take public support for granted.

If the mass protests triggered by the July law were entirely new to Zelensky's Ukraine, they were a far cry from Euromaidan, the 2014 uprising that led to the downfall of Ukraine's corrupt pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych. The peaceful young Ukrainians who filled the streets in July were demanding that the state enforce accountability, preserve democratic norms, uphold the integrity of state institutions—and above all, ensure that the defense capacities of the armed forces were not undermined. They were also highly disciplined. When a handful of activists tried to turn the protests more directly against the Ukrainian leadership, others quickly intervened to steer the message back to upholding the integrity of state institutions. Many participants said they were not so much outraged as offended by how the government had treated the public.

On another level, the mere fact of calm, large-scale street activism amid the daily onslaught of a war that threatens Ukraine's existence suggested how far the country's democratic evolution has come. When the demonstrations began, the protesters did not notify the city of their plans and freely assembled; the following day, a 23-year-old activist submitted a formal notification to the Kyiv City Council. Despite the vast size of the crowd, policing was light: since Yanukovych ordered riot police to open fire on demonstrators in 2014, killing 78 people, the use of police force against protesters has become a political and moral taboo. Only the so-called dialogue police, trained for de-escalation rather than confrontation, were deployed; observing from a distance, senior officials expressed surprise at how well informed some of the teenage protesters were about the technical workings of the anticorruption institutions.

For Zelensky, there was little choice but to respond. Two days after signing the ill-considered law, with thousands of people in the streets, he proposed a revised statute restoring the independence of the anticorruption institutions. Some security officials, including the Security Service of Ukraine and the Prosecutor General's Office, were uneasy about the reversal, which they viewed as a concession made under pressure. Nonetheless, people across the country continued to protest each day until the parliament took up the revised law on July 31.

The night before the scheduled vote, Russia launched a massive attack on Kyiv, deploying more than 300 Shahed drones and eight Iskander-K cruise missiles. Of those, 21 drones and five missiles struck the capital, killing four people—including a six-year-old boy. Hours later, thousands of people gathered outside the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's parliament, to watch a live broadcast of the legislative session—aired at the request of an opposition member despite a post-invasion ban on such broadcasts. The updated law passed by an overwhelming majority, supported by 331 of the parliament's 401 current members.

Although Ukraine's political crisis appeared to have abated, the July controversy underscored the complexities of the government's relationship with its Western partners. Many ordinary Ukrainians understand that key government reforms, particularly the creation of independent anticorruption agencies, are not just domestic priorities but also fundamental conditions for continued international support. These reforms were strongly encouraged, if not outright demanded, by the United States. Yet since Trump's return to office in January, a new era has begun: although these reforms still matter to the European Union, the pressure on Ukraine to maintain them has eased. The government—and much of the public—can see that the overriding priority for the U.S. government now is American interests and economic deals rather than democratic reforms or political freedoms.

In parliament, there has been growing criticism of Ukraine's Western-backed institutions, including the anticorruption agencies. Although Ukraine has historically lacked strong anti-Western voices, a bloc skeptical of foreign influence has clearly emerged, partly within Zelensky's own party but most vocally through former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. (Once a leading pro-European figure and symbol of the country's 2004 Orange Revolution, Tymoshenko now leads a small conservative party that holds 26 seats in parliament and is shaped by promoting religion, family, and skepticism toward European institutions.) In the view of this faction, Ukraine has ceded too much control over its internal affairs to Europe and the United States. Yet much of the Ukrainian public—and especially the protesters—see EU integration less as a matter of surrendering sovereignty than of aligning with a coveted set of shared norms. According to various polling in 2024 and 2025, up to 90 percent of Ukrainians now support joining the EU.

But the tension about Western influence is also apparent within the government. When Zelensky ran for president in 2019, he often criticized what he viewed as excessive Western intrusion into Ukrainian affairs. And throughout the war, his administration has maintained a delicate balance between asserting autonomy over domestic governance and meeting American and European expectations and standards. Even as the country has relied heavily on financial and military assistance from Washington and its European allies, it seeks to engage with these partners as an equal. And with the Trump administration less engaged with Ukraine's crisis and European governments distracted by basic security questions, the government may feel it has more room to maneuver or to slow the pace of reforms.

Since the invasion, the EU itself has sometimes been uncertain about how to respond to Ukraine's wartime leadership. By some measures—including public procurement, asset declarations, whistleblower protections, and financial monitoring of public officials—Ukraine's transparency and anticorruption mechanisms now surpass those in many long-standing European democracies. On the other hand, as part of its action plan for EU accession, Ukraine has a detailed to-do list of further reforms, and while several of these are already underway, there are growing concerns that the government may try to water down the agenda.

As this summer's protesters understood, Ukraine is not only fighting for its future as a nation-state. It is fighting for survival as a democracy. Among Putin's various motivations for launching this war, foremost is the threatening alternative that Ukraine's open political system presents to his own autocracy. The July crisis suggested that Ukrainian citizens appear to have a clearer understanding of what is at stake than their leaders. This time, the pressure did not come from Brussels or Washington; it came from the streets of Kyiv.

Confronting the reality of a United States that can no longer be counted on, Ukraine faces a challenge that is as much political as it is military. The country must learn to provide more of the defense industrial capacity it desperately needs, including the millions of drones that are now central to its war strategy. Although short-term relief may come from additional U.S. munitions such as interceptor missiles for Patriot systems, Ukraine will ultimately need to develop its own solutions. But the war must be sustained at home, as well. Both the leadership and the people must continue to build and defend the institutions that are essential to Ukraine's democratic foundations, and neither can afford to lose the other. That will require preserving the glue that has held the nation together since the dark days of February 2022.

Moscow still portrays Ukraine as surviving only through Western aid, not as an independent state. But as Ukraine marks 34 years of independence, it is increasingly clear that it is its own resilience—as a state, a society, and a military power—that has allowed it to survive. For the real lesson of the past six months is that no one is fighting this war except Ukrainians themselves.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Vietnam is taking a leaf out of China's playbook to build fortified islands in the disputed South China Sea","https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/28/asia/vietnam-south-china-sea-islands-intl-hnk","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 02:14:00 GMT","


            Vietnam is on a South China Sea island-building binge that will likely see it soon surpass the area China has reclaimed in the strategic and contested Spratly Islands, according to a new report from the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative.
    


            Since the start of 2025, Hanoi has been dredging and adding surface area to eight features it controls in the island chain in the southeastern quarter of the South China Sea, said the AMTI report, based on satellite imagery from MAXAR and Planet Labs.
    


            The Spratly Island chain consists of more than 100 small islands or reefs and is claimed in full by China, Vietnam and Taiwan with partial claims by the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei, according to the CIA World Factbook.
    


            China's claims have drawn headlines for more than a decade, as Beijing has reclaimed land at several features, building runways and military installations to solidify its positions. Its building of fortifications came despite leader Xi Jinping in telling then-US President Barack Obama in 2015 that it had no plans of doing so.
    


            Beijing claims almost all of the 1.2 million-square-mile South China Sea, through which trillions of dollars in global trade passes annually, as its sovereign territory. It bases that claim on its so-called Nine Dash Line, which the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague has previously ruled has no legal basis.
    


            Vietnam's claims have not been as outspoken as China's and its previous reclamation efforts less ambitious.
    


            Some of the reefs where island-building is now going full tilt have long been held by just small pillboxes, including Alison Reef, Collins Reef, East Reef, Landsdowne Reef and Petley Reef, according to the AMTI, which is a project of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). New land is also being constructed at three features that were built up in earlier rounds of reclamation – Amboyna Cay, Grierson Reef and West Reef – the AMTI report said.
    


            “All 21 Vietnamese-occupied rocks and low-tide elevations in the Spratly Islands have now been expanded to include artificial land,” AMTI said.
    


            “As of March 2025, Vietnam had created about 70 percent as much artificial land in the Spratlys as China had. Reclamation at these eight new features all but ensures that Vietnam will match—and likely surpass—the scale of Beijing's island-building,” the report said.
    


            Those 21 features under Hanoi's control compare to just seven under Beijing's, according to AMTI.
    


            Meanwhile, on seven other Vietnamese-controlled islands where reclamation work has largely been completed, military-related structures, including munitions depots, have been or are being built, according to the report.
    


            The new report comes amid a spike in tensions between China and the Philippines over South China Sea territory.
    


            Competing claims by Beijing and Manila have become increasingly contentious in the past few years, including violent clashes between their coast guards with water cannons and, in one case, bladed weapons. That clash in the Spratlys near Second Thomas Shoal, on which Philippine marines are stationed in a rusting World War II naval vessel, left a Filipino crewman missing a thumb.
    


            Last month, north of the Spratlys near Scarborough Shoal, a Chinese navy destroyer collided with a China Coast Guard ship as the two harassed a Philippine Coast Guard vessel in contested waters. Images showed heavy damage to the bow of the China Coast Guard ship.

            The China-Philippines flare-ups may have provided Vietnam with excellent cover for its move to build up the islands it controls, analysts said.
    


            “For now much of China's bandwidth of attention is directed at the Philippines, and it would rather maintain a stable front with each of the other Southeast Asian rivals in the South China Sea,” said Collin Koh, a research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) in Singapore.
    


            Ray Powell, director of SeaLight, a maritime transparency project at Stanford University's Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation, echoed Koh's comments.
    


            “It seems that Beijing has calculated that keeping the Philippines isolated from the other South China Sea claimants is worth more right now than preventing Vietnam from making substantial territorial gains,” Powell said.
    


            “Hanoi may owe Manila a debt of gratitude, since it's hard to see how this could have happened if Beijing hadn't been so preoccupied with the problem to the east,” Powell said, adding that, “China has been remarkably muted about Vietnam's island-building campaign.”
    


            That was reflected in Beijing's official reaction to the AMTI report.

            “The Spratly Islands are China's inherent territory. China firmly opposes relevant countries' construction activities on illegally occupied islands and reefs. China will take necessary measures to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told a regular press briefing Monday.
    


            Vietnam and the Philippines did not comment on the AMTI report when asked by CNN.
    


            Past disagreements between China and Vietnam over South China Sea territory have resulted in bloodshed, including in 1974 when a South Vietnamese naval vessel was sunk and 53 South Vietnamese troops killed in a battle with Chinese forces over the Paracel Island chain in the northwestern part of the South China Sea.
    


            Beijing has maintained a big edge in the South China Sea since, and Koh said it may not find Hanoi's latest moves to be overly threatening.
    


            “China commands a yawning gap in mobile military and coast guard assets – hence this probably explains why Beijing is not deemed to be alarmed enough to do anything to stop Hanoi,” he said.
    


            But he cautioned Beijing must not overestimate that advantage, noting that Vietnam and the Philippines enjoy improving relations.
    


            “There's been effort between Vietnam and the Philippines to come closer on maritime security cooperation, as evidenced by the recent bilateral coast guard exchanges and joint exercise. That should serve as a timely reminder to Beijing that Hanoi owns the Manila card of leverage,” Koh said.

As the National Weather Service scrambles to hire up to 450 people to restore deep cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency, potential applicants are being asked to explain how they would advance President Donald Trump's agenda if hired.

A posting from the weather service's parent agency seeking meteorologists asks applicants to identify one or two of Trump's executive orders “that are significant to you, and explain how you would help implement them if hired.”

It's among screening questions added to government job applications as part of a “ merit hiring plan” that Trump announced at the outset of his second term, and it's not unique to the weather service positions. But some experts said they are alarmed at the prospect that a candidate's ideology could matter for jobs in science.

“The fundamental question is, will this make forecasts any better? That's the job of the weather service,” said Rick Spinrad, who led the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which includes the weather service, under former President Joe Biden. 

“These people should be hired for their knowledge in meteorology or hydrology or information technology or physics — not civics. ... Bottom line, I'd rather have a great forecaster who's never read an EO than a policy muck who's taken one meteorology class,” he said, referring to executive orders.

Spokespeople for NOAA didn't respond to emails seeking comment.




Before Elon Musk left DOGE, it cut hundreds of NOAA forecasters and other employees soon after Trump took office. Experts warned that the vacancies could hurt forecasts and dangerous consequences for people if extreme weather warnings were slowed.

NOAA confirmed in early August that it had received approval to hire as many as 450 people for critical positions within the weather service after this spring's deep cuts.

Trump has issued numerous executive orders, and applicants could presumably choose any to endorse — or none at all, since the application says responses aren't required, only encouraged.

But Trump has consistently attacked clean energy and climate science while promoting fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which emit planet-warming gases. One of his first executive orders, which he dubbed “ unleashing American energy,” directed agencies to sweep away any “undue burden” to fossil fuel development. That order also canceled a series of orders from Biden that addressed climate change.

Under Trump, NOAA has stopped tracking the cost of weather disasters worsened by climate change. His administration has also moved to shut down two NASA missions that monitor a potent greenhouse gas and plant health — data seen as helpful for measuring the impacts of climate change.

Trump's second term has been marked by accusations that he has politicized science, most recently with the ouster of the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for not being “aligned” with the president's agenda. Separately, employees of the Environmental Protection Agency, National Institutes of Health and Federal Emergency Management Agency have issued declarations of dissent with agency actions. Some EPA and FEMA employees who signed those letters were put on leave.

Another screening question asks applicants how their “commitment to the Constitution and the founding principles of the United States” inspired them to seek the job. A third asks how they would use their skills to improve government efficiency and effectiveness.

Craig McLean, a former NOAA acting chief scientist under Biden and during Trump's first term, said none of the questions are relevant to weather service positions. NOAA and the NWS are responsible for daily weather forecasts, severe storm warnings and climate monitoring, among other tasks.

“Asking a meteorologist to define how they as a new employee, are going to make the government more efficient is ludicrous,” McLean said. “I'd rather understand how well they are prepared to use the forecast tools and make a timely and accurate forecast.”

Jeff Masters, a meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections and co-founder of Weather Underground, said the questions amount to a loyalty test that will discourage many qualified applicants from applying.

“Whether or not you support the President's Executive Orders will not enable a meteorologist to make a better forecast or issue a more timely tornado warning, and should have no place on a job application for the National Weather Service,” Masters said by email.

GENEVA (AP) — Finland's Air Force, now part of NATO, still flies swastikas on a handful of unit flags — but is preparing to phase them out, largely to avoid awkwardness with its Western allies.

The history of the Finnish air force's use of the swastika, which since the 20th century has largely been associated with Nazi tyranny and hate groups, is more complex than at first appearance. It is an ancient symbol and Finland's air force began using it many years before the birth of Nazi Germany.

Change has been underway for years. A swastika logo was quietly pulled off the Air Force Command's unit emblem a few years ago. But swastikas have remained on some Finnish air force flags, raising eyebrows among NATO allies, tourists and other foreigners who spot them at military events.

“We could have continued with this flag, but sometimes awkward situations can arise with foreign visitors. It may be wise to live with the times, Col. Tomi Böhm, the new head of Karelia Air Wing air defense force, was quoted as saying in a report Thursday by the public broadcaster YLE.




The Defense Forces, in an email to The Associated Press on Friday, said a plan to renew the air force unit flags was launched in 2023, the year Finland joined NATO, but said it was not linked to joining the alliance. The aim, it said, was “to update the symbolism and emblems of the flags to better reflect the current identity of the Air Force.”

It referred to an article in daily Helsingin Sanomat on Friday, which said the reason for the removal was a perception that the swastika has been an “embarrassing symbol in international contexts.”

Finland, which shares a long border with Russia, joined NATO in April 2023 over concerns related to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Teivo Teivanen, a professor of world politics at the University of Helsinki, said the flags in question were introduced in the 1950s and today are flown by four Air Force units. 

The Air Force and the Finnish public generally had for years insisted the swastikas used in Finland's air force “have nothing to do with the Nazi swastika,” said Teivanen, who this month had a book published whose Finnish title translates as “History of the Swastika.” 

But now, following Finland's integration with NATO, policymakers have decided “there's now a need to get more integrated with the forces of countries like Germany, the Netherlands, and France — countries where the swastika is clearly a negative symbol,” he said. 

Teivanen said that in 2021, German air force units bowed out of a final ceremony following exercises at a military base in Finland's Lapland region after learning that the Finnish swastikas would be on display.

Finland's air force adopted the swastika emblem in 1918 soon after country gained its independence after more than a century of Imperial Russian rule. 

Count Eric von Rosen of neighboring Sweden donated Finland's first military plane in 1918, which bore his personal symbol, the swastika.

The Finnish air force soon after adopted a blue swastika on a white background as the national insignia on all its planes from 1918 to 1945. After the war, the imagery remained for decades on some Air Force unit flags and decorations as well as on the insignia of the Air Force Academy.

But that doesn't mean there is no Nazi connection at all.

Von Rosen, an aristocratic explorer and ethnographer, was the brother-in-law of Hermann Goering, a decorated World War I German fighter pilot who became an early Nazi Party member. Goering went on to lead Germany's Luftwaffe during World War II under Hitler.

The Finnish air force stressed that its use of the symbol had no connection to Nazi Germany, although Finland entered into a reluctant alliance with the Third Reich during World War II.

New flags — featuring an eagle — will be published when the work has been completed and the flags are introduced into use for events like parades and local ceremonies, the Defense Forces said, without saying when that would happen.

“The traditional Von Rosen swastika emblem, in use since 1918, has already been removed from most other Air Force emblems during earlier reforms, so its removal from the unit flags is a logical continuation of this work,” the emailed statement said.

JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Protests erupted for a fifth day Friday in multiple cities and tensions soared across Indonesia, a day after a delivery rider was allegedly run over by a police armored vehicle during clashes between riot police and students protesting  lawmakers' allowances.

Protesters marched to the headquarters of the police mobile brigade in the capital Jakarta on Friday, and some attempted to storm the compound. Police used water canons and fired rounds of tear gas to push back the demonstrators, who hurled bottles, rocks and flares at them.

One group of rioters set fire to a five-story building near the police compound in Kwitang neighborhood of central Jakarta, causing several people to be trapped inside. Some students halted their protests to help soldiers and residents rescue those trapped.

Other protesters destroyed traffic signs and other infrastructure, causing traffic to come to a standstill in the area. Demonstrators also attacked police trucks and patrol cars and damaged several government offices in the unrest that soon led crowds to looting and burning vehicles.

Shops and malls near the protest sites and Glodok Chinatown in Jakarta shuttered early over safety concerns as residents were still haunted by the May 1998 riots when racial violence against Chinese Indonesians broke out in Indonesia during violent protests that led to the fall of the Suharto dictatorship.

Amid the 1998 violence, over 1,000 died and thousands more were bankrupted or fled the country.

Clashes between rock-throwing demonstrators and riot police also broke out in other cities across the country, including Surabaya, Solo, Yogyakarta, Medan, Makassar, Manado, Bandung and Manokwari in the easternmost Papua region.




Ride-hailing drivers in the cities of Malang, Bengkulu and Pekanbaru staged a solidarity protest over 21-year-old delivery driver Affan Kurniawan's death.

As night fell, the clashes continued and quickly rippled in Jakarta and beyond, with tear gas lingering in the air and protesters refusing to disperse.

In Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city, protesters stormed the governor's office compound after destroying fences and torching vehicles. Security forces fired tear gas and used water cannons, but demonstrators fought back with fireworks and wooden clubs.

Protesters in Bandung and Makassar burned down local parliament buildings and demonstrators in the ancient royal cities of Yogyakarta and Solo called for sweeping police reform and asset seizure from corrupt officials. They set tires ablaze and damaged the regional parliament building.

The unrest came after a video on social media apparently showing the death of the motorcycle taxi driver during Thursday's clashes shocked the nation and spurred an outcry against the security forces.

Kurniawan was reportedly completing a food delivery service order when he was caught in the clash following days of violent demonstrations. 

Witnesses told local television that the armored car from the National Police's Mobile Brigade unit suddenly sped through the crowd of demonstrators and hit Kurniawan, causing him to fall. Instead of stopping, the car ran over him.

Thousands of motorcycle riders, along with rights activists and politicians attended Kurniawan's burial on Friday. They filled a major traffic circle in the heart of the city and sprawled into its main thoroughfares.

President Prabowo Subianto appealed for calm and expressed condolences in a televised speech.

“I am deeply concerned and deeply saddened by this incident,” Subianto said. “I was shocked and disappointed by the officers' excessive actions.”

The former general said he has been closely monitoring developments surrounding the protests, and said he has ordered a thorough investigation. He called on people “to remain vigilant against elements that constantly stir up unrest and seek chaos.”

“In a situation like this, I urge all citizens to remain calm and trust in the government I lead, which will do what's best for the people,” Subianto said.

Authorities confirmed that seven members of the police motor brigade who were linked to the incident have been detained and questioned, though the driver of the armored vehicle has not yet been identified.

As new protests broke out in cities across the southeast Asian country late Friday, Subianto, accompanied by several members of his Cabinet, visited the modest house of Kurniawan's parents in central Jakarta. He said the government would ensure financial support for the victim's family. 

Nationwide protests began Monday after reports revealed that all 580 lawmakers received a monthly housing allowance of 50 million rupiah ($3,075) in addition to their salaries. The allowance, introduced last year, is almost 10 times the Jakarta minimum wage.

Critics argue the new allowance is not only excessive but also insensitive at a time when most people are grappling with soaring living costs and taxes and rising unemployment.

Christina Haack, who is starring alongside her ex-husband Tarek El Moussa and his wife Heather Rae El Moussa in ""The Flip Off,"" explained why she believes that her estranged husband Josh Hall's exit from the series was for the best.

Christina Haack's highly publicized third marriage has come to a close — and her ex‑husband, Josh Hall, isn't holding back his thoughts on the matter.

Following the finalization of their divorce earlier this week, Hall took to Instagram with a scathing message aimed at the HGTV star.

""Excited to spend Labor Day weekend in the real reality,"" Hall captioned a photo of himself wearing a cowboy hat and petting a saddled horse.

""Finally, legally divorced and a free man,"" he continued. ""I've always worked hard, kept what's mine, and declined hand outs, and I'm keeping it that way. Lesson learned: don't marry someone who needs constant public validation and will use your personal drama for attention.""

A source close to Hall told Fox News Digital, ""This was one of the most fair divorces in reality TV history. Josh agreed to split everything he and Christina earned together, and they each walked away from the divorce with everything that they had made prior to the marriage.""

The source claimed that Hall's assets – including his car collection – were independently acquired. 

""Josh bought each and every one of those cars on his own. Hence, he kept them,"" the insider confirmed. 

The source added that Hall voluntarily waived spousal support, even though the couple had no prenuptial agreement in place, remarking, ""Given there was no prenup, Christina should send Josh a thank you.""

Since the divorce is finalized, Hall is focused on leaving the drama behind him.

""This era of tabloid theatrics is over for Josh. He couldn't be happier,"" the source concluded, noting that he's ready to move on — permanently. 

""Josh is happy to never have to speak to her again.""

A California judge officially signed off on the divorce on Aug. 26, marking the end of the contentious union.

""Honestly, if I would've really understood the repercussions of all of this, I would've gotten a prenup, or I would've never married him,"" she said, per People.

In July, Haack and Hall both filed their own divorce petitions, each citing irreconcilable differences as the reason for the dissolution of their marriage. Hall requested spousal support and asked the court to terminate Haack's ability to receive spousal support from him.

Meanwhile, Haack requested the court terminate both of their ability to be awarded spousal support. In a court filing, she stated that Hall ""should not need"" spousal support because he has his own source of income.

Haack and Hall began dating in March 2021 and secretly married in October of that year. The former couple later had a formal ceremony in Hawaii.

The pair did not share any children together.

President Donald Trump is facing some backlash from on his plan to allow 600,000 student visas for Chinese nationals to be issued, including Hudson Institute senior fellow Michael Sobolik.

A China expert warns that President Donald Trump's Chinese student visa push amid trade talks between the United States and China could exacerbate the growing CCP ""influence"" in American universities.

China policy expert Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, explains where things stand right now, as several conservatives sounded the alarm on how the push could enable the Chinese Communist Party's influence in the U.S.

Sobolik explained that Chinese students in the United States can become a major national security liability, adding that the CCP has taken advantage of Chinese nationals to ""advance malign influence operations.""

""They do this by re-appropriating basic and applied research in American universities, taking it over to China, and stealing American innovations, essentially,"" he said. ""And they also will conduct espionage. They will silence Chinese students on American campuses and force them to either advance the CCP propaganda line or silence them. And that's just unacceptable.""

Sobolik continued by pointing out the history of the trade agreements between Trump and Xi Jinping.

""I think it's partially a function of the fact that [Trump's] trying to get to a trade deal with Xi Jinping and he wants to smooth that road, make sure there aren't any bumps along the way, much like he did in his first term when he was trying to get his phase one trade agreement with China negotiated,"" he said.

President Donald Trump said in a Tuesday cabinet meeting that the ""college system would go to hell very quickly"" if the Chinese student visa policy were significantly altered.

""And it wouldn't be the top colleges, so it'd be colleges that struggle on the bottom. And you take out 300,000 or 600,000 students out of the system,"" Trump said.

""I like having, and I told this to President Xi that we're honored to have their students here. Now, with that, we check in with careful and we see who's there,"" the president continued.

""President Trump isn't proposing an increase in student visas for Chinese students. The 600K references two years worth of visas,"" a White House official told Fox News on Thursday. ""It's simply a continuation of existing policy.""

Sobolik said universities will ultimately go along with the ""repressive tactics of China,"" as he says students are willing to attend American institutions for their full price.

""It's not just STEM programs and security risks. It is not just what China's government is doing on these campuses. It's how universities are complicit in it because they need that money. It's all about the bottom line for them, and American values suffer in the process,"" Sobolik added.

Chicago resident Cata Truss joins ‘Fox & Friends' to discuss President Donald Trump's proposal to send the National Guard to help curb crime in Chicago, and the reaction from local leaders.

Senate Republicans are behind President Donald Trump's desire to send the National Guard to Democrat-led cities and states with high crime rates, and some are even open to sending troops to blue cities in their own states to clean up the streets.

""Blue cities like Memphis need all the help they can get to combat violent crime,"" Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., told Fox News Digital in a statement.

Trump's desire to replicate his crime-fighting efforts in Washington, D.C., where he federalized the local police and sent in the National Guard to patrol the streets and Metro stations, led him to signal plans to send troops to Chicago and Baltimore, two blue cities in blue states with high rates of crime.

The likely move has riled up Democratic senators from Illinois and Maryland, who accused the president of playing ""political theater"" in D.C. and making an attempt to ""play dictator"" with the U.S. military.

Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., charged that Trump's National Guard threat was ""nothing more than a power grab to distract from his disastrous policies,"" while Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., told Fox News Digital in a statement, ""Trump's threats to invade our cities are not the answer – and are sad attempts to distract from his failures to actually put forward solutions to these and other issues facing our communities, like the rising cost of living.""

""Instead of politicizing our great City of Baltimore, which Trump knows nothing about, he should just button it up while federal, state, and local law enforcement do their important work,"" he said.

Republicans, however, have largely backed Trump's decision to bring in the National Guard to the district and have considered extending his federalization of the Metropolitan Police Department — or allowing him to bypass Congress altogether to maintain his grip on the local police — after the 30-day window expires.

Some welcome the idea of troops coming to crack down on crime in their cities with open arms.

Memphis, for example, is ruby-red Tennessee's largest city and has one of the highest violent crime rates in the country. Similar to Baltimore and Chicago, it is led by a Democratic mayor. Blackburn told Fox News Digital that she'd welcome Trump to send troops to the city.

""I support the Trump administration's efforts to restore law and order in lawless cities across America, and I'll continue to work with the president, Attorney General [Pam] Bondi, and FBI Director [Kash] Patel to do whatever it takes to make cities like Memphis safe again,"" she said.

And in St. Louis, another major city that consistently cracks the top 10 of violent and overall crime data pools, Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., recently worked with Patel to secure funding for a surge of FBI agents dubbed as ""one of the largest per capita infusions of full-time agents and intel personnel in the nation.""

Schmitt signaled an openness to troops coming to St. Louis and charged that ""for too long, local leaders in blue cities have been more focused on the rights of criminals than victims, and it's allowed crime to run rampant.""

""American families want and deserve to feel safe in their communities, and I'm glad to see President Trump doing what it takes to enforce the rule of law and increase public safety,"" Schmitt said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""His efforts in D.C. have been hugely successful, and I have no doubt other cities could benefit from increased law enforcement presence.""

Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine and author of ""My Mother and I,"" says Prince Harry won't be sharing more secrets as he seeks to extend an olive branch to the royal family.

Prince Harry is refusing to give any more explosive tell-alls in hopes of reconciling with his father.

The claim was made by Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, who recently wrote a new book about King Charles' relationship with the late queen, titled ""My Mother and I.""

""I can't see Harry giving loads and loads of television interviews or writing another book,"" Seward told Fox News Digital. ""I think his direction will concentrate on as much charity work as he can find that interests him, or he feels that he can really help with… Hopefully, Harry will just rebuild his life.""

""The future for Harry is a difficult one,"" Seward admitted. ""I'm not sure what the future holds for Harry. I'm sure Harry's not sure what the future holds for Harry. But he's going to concentrate on his charity work, which isn't a huge amount of work at the moment. But [in 2027] he has the Invictus Games in the U.K.""

""He very much hopes that his father will attend,"" Seward continued. ""And I think his father will probably attend because his father is head of the armed forces as monarch. People in the Invictus Games were once in the armed forces or are still in the armed forces with their disabilities. It's very important, and it's Harry's big achievement. I think that his father will attend.""

The Duke of Sussex has been estranged from his family since he and his wife, Meghan Markle, quit royal duties in 2020 and moved to California. The couple cited the unbearable intrusions of the British press and a lack of support from the palace as their reasons for stepping back.

Since then, the couple has aired their grievances in interviews and documentaries. Harry's 2023 memoir ""Spare,"" which highlights private and embarrassing details about the House of Windsor, worsened his relationship with the royals.

In an interview with the BBC in May, the 40-year-old said that King Charles, who was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in 2024, won't speak to him. Royal experts previously claimed to Fox News Digital that Harry's relationship with his brother, Prince William, is nonexistent.

""I would love reconciliation with my family,"" Harry told the BBC. ""There's no point in continuing to fight anymore.""

""Both Harry and Meghan have alluded to the fact that they have enough royal family content to bring out more material,"" British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard pointed out to Fox News Digital.

""Obviously, it would bring in the big bucks, but would do nothing for their reputation, which has taken a nosedive in recent years. The court of public opinion would also be outraged. There would be zero chance of building trust with the royal family, let alone small steps towards a private relationship with his father.""

In July, the U.K.'s Daily Mail reported that the father of two had quietly extended an olive branch to the royals by offering to share his official schedule of engagements. 

According to the outlet, this was a bid to ease tensions between him and the king, 76. Earlier that month, the outlet also reported that Harry's aides had a private meeting with the king's communications secretary in London. Representatives for Buckingham Palace and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment at the time.

""Prince Harry wears his heart on his sleeve,"" said Chard. ""Sources have stated that he seems bereft, lonely and lacking direction… It's a big shame that he cannot rekindle a private relationship with his father or spark peace talks behind closed doors. However, at this point, it's understandable why the royal family will not touch him with a barge pole.""

British royals expert Hilary Fordwich believes that Harry is immersing himself in charity work now more than ever because he's hit ""rock bottom.""

""This is a move more out of necessity and hope for reconciliation, but how is the family ever to trust him or his motives?"" she argued. ""There are such deep-seated grievances from all his sordid revelations, one doubts they can ever be overcome.""

""Prince Harry has hit rock bottom... This is a move more out of necessity and hope for reconciliation, but how is the family ever to trust him or his motives? There are such deep-seated grievances from all his sordid revelations, one doubts they can ever be overcome.""

""The only smidgen of a chance of any sort of repair of their former relationship is some sort of discreet reconciliation that would be built on many years of trust-building steps. Harry knows it will take years, hence his lamenting to the BBC that he ‘doesn't know' how many years his father has to live. That was a clear indication he felt the clock ticking. He knows Prince William is way less open to any sort of dialogue.""

But not everyone is convinced that Harry is done spilling secrets.

""Maybe Prince Harry has pressed pause for now out of respect for his father's cancer battle, but I do not believe this will last,"" royal expert Kinsey Schofield of YouTube's ""Kinsey Schofield Unfiltered"" claimed to Fox News Digital.

""Unlike most people, there is monetary value in Prince Harry's grievances,"" she said. ""Millions can be made from his family drama. Oh, to be so lucky. And complaining has been incredibly lucrative for him. He even admitted to Oprah Winfrey in 2021 that he signed deals with Netflix and Spotify to support his family in the United States. In other words, it may not matter what he ultimately wants. Financial necessity could push him back into the spotlight.""

""I have heard that Harry prefers his charity work to podcasting and book projects because that is where his strengths lie,"" Schofield shared. ""I also think he is motivated by a desire to reclaim some of the popularity he once enjoyed as a working member of the royal family. But I am not convinced that the BBC interview will be the last time we hear Prince Harry airing his frustrations about the royal family.""

Schofield also believes the royals aren't ready to trust Harry again – if ever.

While Prince Harry focuses on charity work, Meghan Markle is building her business empire in California. New episodes of her Netflix lifestyle series, ""With Love, Meghan,"" became available for streaming on Aug. 26. (Netflix)

""It's too little too late,"" she shared. ""Harry opens ‘Spare' by revealing that King Charles begged him and his brother not to ‘make my final years a misery.' I find this request so much more heartbreaking now that we know of the king's cancer. The Oprah Winfrey interview, ‘Spare,' the Netflix series – it's too much hurt.""

""Harry will raise his children in the United States. Strangers to their cousins. King Charles just wants peace, but I believe Prince William is checked out. He wants to protect his family and the future of the monarchy. He has unique plans for his reign. He [wants to] be a good king, and Harry is a liability.""

But royal expert Ian Pelham Turner pointed out that if Harry really wanted to bare all, he could at any point.

""I would love reconciliation with my family. There's no point in continuing to fight anymore,"" Prince Harry told the BBC in May. (Karwai Tang/WireImage/Getty Images)

""Harry is well aware of other damaging skeletons in the closet,"" he said. ""And the royal family is surely aware he knows them and could use them against the royal household if he wished to.

""But in reality, I feel that Harry wishes peace for everyone. He would prefer a meeting of minds where compromise is created. Perhaps a peace bridge could be built if Netflix goes ahead with a docuseries on Princess Diana, where Harry and William could come together and participate.""

For now, Harry will lie low in hopes that he'll be welcomed with open arms again.

""Harry's driving force is his sense of service,"" said Chard. ""His happy place is the military. However, he has regrettably discovered that throwing himself into charity work without the protection of the royal fold can be a struggle and certainly does not bring in the big bucks. Harry and Netflix know what will bring in the big bucks, and that is another tell-all.""

Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte said Thursday that he filed a second criminal referral to the Department of Justice against Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, whom President Donald Trump is attempting to fire.

Pulte said the new referral relates to a third mortgage at her Cambridge, Massachusetts, property. In government ethics filings, he has alleged misrepresentations about that condominium and two other homes in Michigan and Georgia, which she listed as her “primary residence” when she obtained mortgages in 2021 during her time as a Fed governor.

In the latest complaint, Pulte alleged that Cook took out a mortgage on the Massachusetts condo for $361,000, which she said was a second home, and claimed that less than a year later, Cook said she had earned between $15,000 and $50,000 in rental income and listed it as an investment property.

“Representing the property as a second home may have allowed Cook to secure a lower ‘Second Home' mortgage down payment and rates, as investment properties typically carry higher down payments and higher rates due to increased risk,” Pulte wrote in the complaint.

Pulte was appointed to lead the FHFA by Trump earlier this year and has worked on Trump's behalf in his anger with the Fed and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.

Trump moved to fire Cook earlier this week after Pulte's first criminal referral. The move teed up a contentious legal fight. 

Cook filed a lawsuit in federal court on Thursday that claimed Trump's move is “illegal” and is an effort to control the central bank. Her lawyers have categorized the mortgage dispute in Pulte's first criminal referral as an unintentional “clerical error.”

IT IS UNCLEAR IF FEDERAL RESERVE GOVERNOR LISA COOK SHOWED UP TO WORK AFTER TRUMP FIRING

A judge is expected to hear the case Friday morning on Cook's push for a restraining order as she looks to remain in her role.

For months, Trump has unsuccessfully demanded that the Fed cut interest rates. Before his attempt to oust Cook, Trump had seriously considered firing Powell.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Federal prosecutors on Thursday charged a man seen throwing a sandwich at a federal agent with a misdemeanor offense after a grand jury declined to bring a harsher felony charge against the Washington, D.C., protester. 

The grand jury recently refused to indict Sean Dunn, a former government employee, on felony charges, leading to prosecutors' latest move to lessen the charges to a simple assault offense.

Earlier this month, Dunn hurled a Subway sandwich at a federal agent stationed in Washington as part of President Donald Trump's federal takeover of the nation's capital, a move the White House has branded as an anti-crime effort. 

Video capturing Dunn's act of protest against the government takeover went viral, leading U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro to level felony charges against the district resident. 

The felony charge would have carried up to eight years in prison. Under the relaxed misdemeanor charge, which does not require prosecutors to go to a grand jury, Dunn would spend under one year in prison for throwing a hoagie sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer.

﻿The metaverse didn't stick. Can “superintelligence”?

Companies in the AI race are barreling toward a new goalpost: so-called superintelligence, or an AI model that can surpass human intelligence.

The terminology here can get a bit dizzying. Top AI companies had already been trying to build what's long been called “artificial general intelligence” (AGI), or AI that they claim will be as smart as humans. Depending on who you talk to, superintelligence might just be a flashy marketing term meant to draw even more venture capital — or it might be the obvious next step in the development of AI models that some believe are already as intelligent as humans.

Meta, in particular, has branded its AI department around the goal of superintelligence through its new “Superintelligence Labs.” Over the past few months, Mark Zuckerberg has escalated the industry's talent war, reportedly offering pay packages of up to $1 billion dollars to recruit Silicon Valley's top AI engineers.

Today, Explained co-host Sean Rameswaram recently spoke with Riley Griffin, tech reporter at Bloomberg, about why Meta is gunning so hard for top AI talent right now and what the company hopes to build with these top technologists.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full episode, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

How new is Meta's new superintelligence lab? What is it, and what are they trying to do with it?

The superintelligence lab is incredibly new, and the story of Meta's superintelligence lab is at its core a story of competition.

So, you've got Mark Zuckerberg, a famously competitive CEO, and this past spring, we learned through our reporting that he'd begun to feel quite acutely that Meta was falling behind in this all-consuming race for AI. Meta had just released the latest version of its large language model – they call it Llama. This is a system meant to rival open AI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude. But when the rollout landed, it fell flat. And it fell flat internally, according to our sources. It had just become clear that Meta was not leading the pack among these AI companies.

Listeners may think of Meta as the parent company of Facebook, or Instagram, or WhatsApp, these popular apps that have billions of users. But Meta is increasingly seeing itself as an AI company, too. And it wasn't leading there. And so Zuckerberg, seeing, feeling that he was falling behind in this race, immediately sprung into action. From his homes in Tahoe and Silicon Valley, he started personally recruiting, and he was basically quietly building this new secretive team that we now know is Meta Superintelligence Labs.

What is this super secretive team going to do? I thought Meta was all about the “metaverse,” and that's why they changed their name to Meta. It sounds like they should have changed their name to AI.

It's a really good point. When I speak with folks on Wall Street, the metaverse is always the pain point. It is something that still bleeds cash. It's not a big revenue driver. It hasn't proved itself to be the dream that Mark Zuckerberg once painted.

Meta's AI ambitions are a bit of a different beast. Back in the days where it was still called Facebook, they were in the AI game. They brought on this guy named Yann LeCun, a big, award-winning thinker on [AI]. If you were watching that at the time, you might've thought Meta was really well-positioned to be the AI leader.

But when OpenAI came out with ChatGPT, it blew everyone out of the water, including AI researchers at Meta who I've spoken with. They'd been building their own large language models, but the approach was still rather academic. It wasn't packaged in a consumer product in the way OpenAI so successfully executed on ChatGPT. So, I think that's when the race began, but it really kicked into gear this April with what felt to many internally at Meta as a flop with its latest release of Llama.

And what exactly has Meta done in this space so far? Nothing, it sounds like?

Right now, we're seeing a talent war. We're seeing Meta create a new organizational structure for its AI talent. This is a multi-billion-dollar effort, and Meta has the cash to deploy.

The perspective of company leadership is that they're looking to make a big bet and plug that talent gap. They believe there's only a small talent pool that can best make use of that spend, to put together these competitive models. Many are focused on reasoning, and that means they're specialists who can help build models that think step by step, as opposed to in this probabilistic approach where they're predicting the next word in the sentence.

A lot of chatbots right now, they look like they understand what you're saying when you type in a question, but really they're just predicting. They've taken these massive amounts of data, and they're able to predict the next word in the sentence. And what Meta, what OpenAI, want to do is give them the capacity to think, to reason for themselves. So, if you're going to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to win the AI race, what's a couple billion on the talent that can steer the ship? That's the rationale coming from inside the company.

But, of course, there's pushback. One thing I've heard from folks who have left Meta over the years is that if you are a PhD type who got into this really complicated question of AI reasoning and superintelligence, you weren't necessarily inspired when Meta announced that they were creating AI chatbots that sounded like Snoop Dogg. So, there has been skepticism of Mark Zuckerberg as a leader. He's someone who really wants to bring AI into the hands of individuals.

I think it's too early to tell whether or not it's working. What has been successful is Mark's efforts to court some of the biggest names out there. They are taking away top talent from competitors. But we also know there are people who have turned down Mark Zuckerberg's sports-team-level compensation packages.

I will say that pushback isn't coming from Wall Street. Meta's stock is up nearly 30 percent this year to date. Clearly, there's excitement from the investor community.

So, it sounds like Meta is restructuring itself or creating altogether new structures, to play the long game on superintelligence. What does it look like in the rest of the industry right now?

Everybody — I mean everybody — has had to respond to Mark Zuckerberg's crazed hiring push. His efforts have set a new bar for compensation across the industry. We've seen other companies like OpenAI have to make offers to their own employees that are much higher.

You're even seeing that in the language, the public posturing from CEOs. OpenAI has said that they're going to spend trillions on the AI race. Other companies are being quite loud about the money they're going to throw. But we're talking about the biggest players here — we're not talking about the upstarts that have just gotten some venture cash and have no revenue. Meta, Google, even OpenAI are in a different position because they have cash to burn.

By which methods can one ascertain that whatever is produced by AI is exact and truthful?

For any question you're considering asking an AI model, the first thing you need to do is think about its epistemic nature: Is the answer knowable in an objective way? Or is it subjective?

The best use case is a situation where it's hard for you to come up with the answer, but once you get an answer from the AI, you can easily check to see if it's correct. I find chatbots particularly helpful for semantic search — that is, cases where I say, “There's some psychology theory or idea in philosophy that basically says XYZ, but I can't remember what it's called or who said it, help!” The chatbot will give its best guess, and then I can just fact-check that.

Same with other empirical facts that are verifiable through observation or data — anything from “What's the boiling temperature for water?” to “Is it true that humans share 98.8 percent of their DNA with chimpanzees?” While you can easily verify the first by yourself through observation, you'll need to rely on experts' data for the second. In that case, you need to feel confident that what's produced by your fellow humans is exact and truthful. We've developed tools that increase our confidence, like the scientific method, so if you're consulting scientific experts, you can at least have some degree of confidence that they're reporting observable and repeatable facts.

Then there are domains that are inherently subjective. If you've got the type of question for which there is no One True Answer, you'll want to be more hesitant about using AI. I think ethical dilemmas fall into this category; no matter how much OpenAI tries to create a “universal verifier,” AI will always be limited in its ability to advise you on how to handle an ethical dilemma, because there's no One True Ethics. So, you might see what thoughts an AI model provokes in you, but don't trust it as giving you the final answer, especially if what it's saying seems off to you. In other words, you can use it as a thought partner, but don't treat it like an oracle.

— Sigal Samuel, senior reporter 

Ok, after more than five years as a vegan and 73 years on the planet, I want to know why the great majority of journalists consistently abandon everything they learned about objectivity when it comes to a multitude of issues with the monster industry known as “animal agriculture?” And I want to know how to combat that bias effectively.

It is a huge blind spot for most of them. My best guess is the conditioning is so strong. It starts as a toddler, is reinforced by the parental relationship, expands to extended family, friends, reinforced again by all types of advertising media, entertainment, etc. Then they go to journalism school and are taught by instructors who also have this blind spot.

So later a reporter will go to a “chicken farm” and empathize with them when they tell their story about losing thousands of birds to avian flu — their sense of loss is not about the birds; it's about the money. The reporter presents the story without questioning the basics. Things like “where are all the male birds?” [and] “how is it possible for anyone to think that 35,000 birds could be forced to live together in a building without reasonable access to the outdoors?” and “why does it smell so bad?” and “why do you have permission to confine animals without their permission?”

I think the reason is pretty simple: Journalists are people with their own biases, just like everyone else. That's evident in how little coverage factory farming receives in the first place — it involves the abuse of billions of animals and hundreds of thousands of workers, and is a leading cause of many of our environmental problems, yet only a handful of US journalists write about it full-time (including yours truly). Most news outlets and editors don't take factory farming seriously, which is why I'm proud to work at Vox, where we do.

That's the most fundamental problem. But secondarily, while there is plenty of fantastic coverage of factory farming, more often than not, I find I'm disappointed with a lot of it, too. I see a few recurring issues:

I've written one story about how the media could cover these issues better, and I hope to keep covering that in the future.

Stories like Dylan Matthews's years ago led me to investigate donating a kidney to a stranger. I asked my doctor about it, and surprisingly, instead of encouraging me to save a life, he tried to talk me out of it. 

He told me that it is illegal to donate a kidney to a stranger! I live in Hong Kong, and maybe the reason for prohibiting even the donation of a kidney to a stranger is the fear that people would secretly accept payment from the kidney recipient. But I don't know why. Anyway, I thought about donating while on a vacation in the US, but it would require too much time, so I gave up. 

Unfortunately, my second kidney will probably die with me in old age, and someone with kidney failure will needlessly die. Anyway, maybe another story idea would be about paying kidney providers in countries other than the US?

Most people aren't as generous as you!

In the US, only a sliver of living donations go to strangers. Meanwhile, over 100,000 people sit on kidney waitlists. And, as you indicate, the need for kidneys is a global problem, too.

Many places only allow donations to relatives or known recipients (or require tough ethics reviews for unrelated donors), while a minority — like the US, UK, Canada, and Australia — offer a formal pathway for anonymous “good Samaritan” donors. In Hong Kong, where you're based, you can donate to a family member easily, but unrelated donations need official approval, and there's no standard program for that. (That's probably why you were discouraged.)

This patchwork exists for a reason.

In the 1990s and 2000s, there was a serious trafficking and transplant tourism problem. In 2007, the WHO estimated that about 5–10 percent of kidney transplants involved trafficking, and countries like the Philippines and Pakistan became hubs for foreign patients buying organs from desperate locals.Transplant experts met in Istanbul in 2008 and wrote what became the worldwide rulebook. The Istanbul Declaration pushed countries to crack down on coercive sales of organs. Every country had its own laws, but began incorporating the declaration's recommendations. As a result, transplant tourism dropped sharply in Israel and the Philippines once new rules kicked in, and tighter oversight became the norm across Europe.

But, in its efforts to shut down trafficking, the declaration argued that compensating donors at all “leads inexorably to inequity and injustice.” There was little empirical data to back that claim, but because it came from a major international statement it hardened into gospel: organ donation must be “financially neutral.”

But neutrality isn't actually neutral in practice. Living donors lose wages, take time off work, take medical risk, and sometimes even face higher insurance premiums after donating. We don't call that exploitation — but it is a penalty for doing the right thing.

And it's inconsistent with how we treat other socially valuable, risky, or unpleasant work. We pay people to do jury duty. We pay clinical trial participants. In many places, we even pay plasma donors.

There is one striking exception: Iran.

It's the only country with a regulated system that pays kidney donors. Iran established this system in 1988, and today performs about 2,500-2,700 kidney transplants annually, and it claims to have essentially eliminated its waiting list. It's a proof-of-concept that incentives can be structured.

The US debate is inching in that direction. Congress's End Kidney Deaths Act would offer a federal tax credit to people who donate a kidney to a stranger. Donors would receive a $10,000 tax credit annually for five years, so not quite direct payment, but certainly a help. The act, which has not been voted on yet, acknowledges that donation involves real costs: time off work, medical risks, recovery time.The path forward globally isn't throwing out Istanbul's anti-trafficking work, but to build on it with smart incentives and guardrails so people can donate altruistically if they want to. That means actually testing new approaches, but doing it carefully. Give donors independent advocates, make sure there's time to think it over, and guarantee lifelong follow-up care.

In the meantime, you might not be able to easily donate your kidney to a stranger right now in Hong Kong, but the needle is moving in the right direction.

The final Grand Slam of 2025 is underway, bringing the world's top tennis stars to the hard courts of the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York. We've gathered everything you need to know about where to watch the US Open, with global streaming options — including a free one.

All of the usual suspects have made their way to the US Open, including defending champions Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka, who rank No. 1 in the ATP and WTA, respectively.

Sabalenka has yet to win a Grand Slam title this year, and she'll take on the DC Open champ, Leylah Fernandez, in the third round today. Carlos Alcaraz and his new buzzcut will take on Luciano Darderi, while Sinner returns to action tomorrow. Other big names still in the fight include Iga Swiatek, Coco Gauff, Alex Zverev, Ben Shelton, and, of course, Novak Djokovic.

Keep reading to learn the best ways to live stream the tournament without cable. Match start times are approximate and subject to delay, especially later in the day.

UK:

Australia:

Access streaming anywhere:

Notable Round 3 matches (approx. start times):

ESPN is the broadcast home of the US Open in the United States. Matches will air across various ESPN networks and ABC, and be available in full through the brand-new ESPN streaming service. Plans range from $12 a month for ESPN Select to $30 a month for ESPN Unlimited.

Both tiers should have US Open coverage, but Unlimited unlocks lots of extra coverage and full live streams from flagship networks. You can learn more in our ESPN streaming service guide and check out a limited-time deal when you bundle ESPN Unlimited with Disney Plus and Hulu.


                      ESPN Select, formerly ESPN Plus, offers select coverage from ESPN properties. While it doesn't have a direct live stream of ESPN networks, like the Unlimited plan, it still offers around 32,000 live sporting events each year.
                    

If you're looking for an even more comprehensive sports streaming option, a month-to-month live TV streaming service such as DirecTV or Fubo can help. DirecTV MySports, the service's new genre pack, includes 20+ popular sports channels traditionally found in cable packages and access to the ESPN Unlimited streaming service app. Subscriptions cost $70 a month, but new users can get $10 a month off their first two months and a five-day free trial.


                      DirecTV's MySports pack carries popular sports channels, from mainstays like ESPN to niche offerings like the ACC Network. 
                    

Fubo is another popular live TV streaming service with access to ABC and all of the relevant ESPN networks, in addition to around 200+ other live channels. Subscribing to Fubo will also unlock access to the new ESPN Unlimited streaming app. Fubo Pro subscriptions start at $85 a month (plus a bit extra for regional sports fees), but new users can get $30 off their first month of service after a five-day free trial.


                      Fubo is the streaming service for sports fans. Its huge library of channels includes regional and international sports leagues, setting it apart from the competition. You can also tack on additional programming to your plan, but it'll cost you extra.
                    

In the UK, the US Open will be available through Sky Sports. Prices vary depending on which bundle and long-term contract you sign up for, but the cheapest plans with Sky Sports start at £35 a month. You can learn more in our guide to the best Sky TV deals and plans. There's also an option to stream Sky Sports through Now, which offers some additional flexibility.

9Now will live stream the US Open in Australia, with the bulk of the action kicking off on the Gem channel. This is a free streaming option, and fans just need to create an account if they don't already have one.

9Now will have select major matches, but the best way to ensure you can watch absolutely every match in Australia, including the smaller early ones, is through Stan Sport. Users will need to purchase a base Stan subscription for $12 a month and get the Sports add-on for an additional $20 a month, making it a $32 a month investment each month.

If you're away from Australia right now, you can still tune into your free streaming option with the help of a VPN. Short for virtual private networks, VPNs are handy tech tools that allow you to change your virtual location so your go-to websites and apps work from anywhere. They're popular services for those hoping to keep up with their usual services while traveling abroad or looking to upgrade their cybersecurity.

NordVPN is our top recommendation. It's a user-friendly option (even for beginners) and has an impressive suite of cybersecurity features. Plus, it comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee if you find that it's not what you're looking for. You can learn more in our NordVPN review.


                      NordVPN is one of the top VPN services in the business. It offers excellent value with a strong selection of features and a low monthly price. A wide selection of international servers, high-end security, fast connections, and audited privacy protection have made the brand a household name in the world of VPNs.
                    

Note: The use of VPNs is illegal in certain countries and using VPNs to access region-locked streaming content might constitute a breach of the terms of use for certain services. Business Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal use of VPNs.

Artificial intelligence and AI agents are redrawing the competitive landscape of software and SaaS, and there will be winners and losers.

That's the conclusion of a new RBC Capital Markets report that warns incumbency alone is no guarantee of survival in the post-AI era. Innovation, not market share, will determine who crosses the AI ""chasm.""

""Incumbency is not enough for software companies to thrive in a post-AI world — innovation is paramount,"" RBC analysts wrote in the report. ""If incumbency were the most important factor, Sears, Blockbuster, and Barnes and Noble would have been major beneficiaries of the Internet, but instead new companies came in their place.""

The analysts scoured the software sector for companies that have the right positioning and right innovation roadmap around AI. They also identified other companies where ""we're more uncertain.""

Microsoft topped RBC's bullish list. Wall Street still underestimates the software giant's AI push, which now touches every corner of its business, from Azure to Office, Teams, Dynamics, and LinkedIn. Its partnership with OpenAI, alongside a diversified in-house strategy, could accelerate growth over time.

Intuit was another standout. Long before ChatGPT, the tax and accounting software firm was investing in AI. RBC highlighted new AI agents in QuickBooks and TurboTax as evidence that Intuit is positioned to capture more market share in industries ripe for automation.

HubSpot also earned praise. The CRM challenger has rolled out ChatSpot, Breeze, and Breeze Intelligence, all tightly integrated with generative AI. With a culture of innovation and a unified tech stack, HubSpot could steadily gain share against larger rivals.

On the infrastructure side, MongoDB was singled out as a key building block for AI applications, particularly those dealing with unstructured data. RBC noted several AI-native startups already rely on it.

Pegasystems, meanwhile, is well-placed to benefit from AI agents that increase complexity in enterprise systems. Its Blueprint workflow builder, which lets companies modernize processes using natural language, could expand its market significantly.

Not every incumbent is keeping pace, according to RBC. Salesforce's much-hyped Agentforce remains mostly in pilot projects, with limited signs of advanced AI functionality. RBC warned that the product delivers more automation than true ""agentic AI,"" raising doubts about its long-term competitiveness.

ZoomInfo faces perhaps the most existential threat, the RBC analysts wrote. Its core product, selling contact information, risks being commoditized by large language models. RBC likens its AI pivot to the Yellow Pages' attempt to fend off Google, casting doubt on its staying power.

Lucy Guo got into the artificial intelligence industry early, co-founding software provider Scale AI nine years ago. It made her a billionaire by the time she was 30.

Now the Carnegie Mellon University dropout is building another business, Passes Inc., a platform where celebrities like Olivia Dunne and Bella Thorne can help turn fame into fortune by connecting directly with their fans. But this time, Guo is running into well-established competitors and legal challenges in a business where success is far from certain.

Thailand was thrust into deeper political crisis after the country's Constitutional Court dismissed Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra for ethics violations, setting off political jostling for a third leader in two years.

The nine-member court said Paetongtarn violated constitutional provisions on ethical standards during a phone call in June with de facto Cambodian leader Hun Sen, when they discussed a border dispute between the countries. The judges said her remarks on the call, which were leaked, undermined the pride of the premiership and the nation while prioritizing her political interests.

The Fed:

Questions about whether President Donald Trump had proper cause to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook dominated a court hearing Friday, as a judge weighs whether he had proper reasons to remove her from the US central bank.

US District Judge Jia Cobb peppered lawyers for Cook and Trump for about two hours Friday, before ending the hearing without ruling on the Fed governor's request for a temporary order blocking her ouster. The judge didn't indicate which way she is leaning in a landmark lawsuit that could determine the future of the Fed's independence.

The Department of Transportation on Friday canceled $679 million in federal funding for a dozen infrastructure projects that would support offshore wind power in the U.S., the latest attack in President Donald Trump's campaign to halt the development of renewable energy in the U.S.

The wind industry has been in Trump's crosshairs since his first day in office, when he halted new leases for offshore wind projects. But his administration has escalated its attacks in recent days.

""Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America's maritime industry,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. The funding will be redirected to upgrade ports and other infrastructure in the U.S., where possible, according to the department.

Many of the projects affected by the funding cancellation are staging areas that would be used to build offshore wind turbines. The single biggest pledge that was canceled is Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind in northern California, with about $427 million in federal support withdrawn.

Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind is a planned marine terminal that would be used to launch and assemble turbines in support of California's goal of building 25 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2045.

The Department of the Interior last week ordered Denmark's Orsted A/S to halt work on the Revolution Wind project off the coast of New England. The fully permitted project is 80% complete. Orsted shares tumbled to a record low on Monday in the aftermath of the work stoppage.

Trump said last week that his administration will not approve solar or wind projects in the U.S. Renewable executives are warning that the president's campaign against renewable energy will lead to a spike in power prices.

Funds for the following projects have been withdrawn:

In this article

Shares of Marvell Technology plunged 15% on Friday after the artificial intelligence chipmaker's data center revenue fell short of estimates and it gave lackluster guidance for the current quarter.

Here's how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

Revenue jumped 58% from a year ago in the fiscal second quarter that ended Aug. 2, a record for the company that was fueled in part by ""strong AI demand"" for its custom silicon and electro-optics products, Marvell CEO Matt Murphy said in a statement.

The company had net income of $194.8 million, or 22 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $193.3 million, a loss of 22 cents per share, during the same period last year.

For the fiscal third quarter, the company called for revenue to be $2.06 billion, plus or minus 5%. That was slightly below the $2.11 billion forecast by analysts, according to LSEG.

Marvell is known for creating customized chips and hardware, which it offers to cloud providers such as Amazon and Microsoft.

Sales in its data center segment reached $1.49 billion during the quarter, which fell short of Wall Street's projected $1.51 billion, according to StreetAccount.

On a conference call with investors, Murphy said the company expects ""overall data center revenue in Q3 to be flat sequentially,"" which he attributed to nonlinear growth in its custom AI chips business. Fourth-quarter growth is expected to be ""substantially stronger"" than the third quarter, Murphy said.

He added that ""lumpiness"" of the guidance is normal as large hyperscalers build out infrastructure.

Still, some investors were hoping for greater clarity around the company's pipeline of new customers.

""Without this, we find it very difficult underwriting the company's 20% data center market share target,"" Cantor analysts wrote in a Thursday note to clients. ""Thus, we wait for more bottoms up granularity before potentially turning more positive.""

Analysts at Bank of America downgraded Marvell's stock to neutral from buy on Friday and lowered their price target to $78 per share from $90, partly on concerns around the company's AI growth prospects ""in the near/medium term.""

In this article

PepsiCo has increased its stake in energy drink maker Celsius Holdings through a $585 million deal, the companies said on Friday.

The deal, under which the soda giant bought 5% of Celsius' preferred stock, brings PepsiCo's stake in the company to about 11% after conversion. PepsiCo had paid $550 million for an 8.5% stake in Celsius in 2022.

Shares of Celsius, which have more than doubled in value this year, surged 11% in premarket trading on the news.

As part of the agreement, Celsius' health and wellness drinks brand, Alani Nu, will move into PepsiCo's distribution system in the U.S. and Canada.

The increase in stake comes as PepsiCo seeks to capitalize on Alani Nu's rapid growth and broad appeal among fitness-focused female consumers.

Celsius had bought Alani Nutrition in a $1.8 billion deal earlier this year.

At the stroke of midnight, 92% of all U.S. cargo shipments, and up to 4 million packages daily, lost their duty-free status with President Donald Trump's removal of the de minimis exemption for low-value trade. Any imported goods sent through the international postal network that are valued at or under $800 will now be subject to applicable duties. While the winners and losers on the retail landscape and among consumers are debated, customs experts are warning the troubles facing small to medium-sized businesses that relied on the duty-free exemption are just beginning, and will be significant.

""When I think about the de minimis change, the message is clear: tariffs are now universal, regardless of value,"" said Nunzio De Filippis, licensed customs broker and co-CEO of CargoTrans. ""Every package counts. That's a major change in how global e-commerce has operated for the last decade.""

The postal carrier or ""qualified party"" (e.g., USPS, Royal Mail, La Poste) that decides how duties are collected on packages moving through the postal stream must collect those duties from shippers or recipients and remit them to U.S. Customs.

The carriers have two methods to choose from — either a percentage of the country's tariff rate (ad valorem) or a flat per-package fee, De Filippis explained. With the flat rate, there are three tiers: $80 if the IEEPA tariff rate — the trade duties put into effect by Trump using emergency economic powers — is under 16% (such as EU goods at 15%); $160 if it's between 16% and 25% (such as Vietnam at 20%); and $200 if it's above 25% (such as India at 50% or China at 30%). After a six-month transition period, the flat fee option goes away and all packages will be subject to the percentage tariff rate only.

According to Marianne Rowden, trade attorney and CEO of the E-Merchants Trade Council, which represents e-sellers and companies that support e-commerce, the total increase in cost to be paid by small and medium-sized businesses may reach over $71 billion, calculations that she said are based on an average value per package of $48 and data from the U.S Customs and Border Protection for fiscal year 2025.

Availability of air freight for U.S. shippers will also change.

The number of government postal offices shutting the door on shipments bound for the U.S. has grown to include Swiss Post, Japan Post and postal services in Australia, India, New Zealand, the U.K. and other parts of Europe that announced they are suspending shipments.

Deutsche Post and DHL Parcel Germany, both divisions of DHL, stopped U.S.-bound shipments on August 25.

""For shippers, this brings increased costs, complexity, and the need to adapt shipping setups to comply with new customs requirements. They may also face longer processing times and additional administrative steps when importing lower-value goods,"" said Andrew Williams, CEO for DHL Express Americas, who told CNBC it will continue to process inbound shipments to the United States in accordance with the applicable customs rules and regulations. ""Our main priority remains to protect our core service commitment to customers and to minimize any disruption that arises from changes in tariff and trade policy, while remaining compliant with applicable customs rules and regulations,"" Williams said.

Ryan Elliott, chief operating officer at Everstream Analytics, said these global postal changes may catch smaller businesses by surprise. ""We've already seen a number of countries, especially in the EU, pause deliveries to the U.S., explaining that they need more time to work through how they'll collect and transit duties and data,"" said Elliott. ""Small businesses may not be aware of the changes, and many will be caught off guard. But, when the dust settles, my best guess is that many will struggle to comply as they simply don't have the resources to manage through customs requirements,"" he said.

Josh Teitelbaum, an international trade expert at Akin and former U.S. Commerce official, said the way this new tariff change is being implemented is leading to global confusion. ""With many of the world's postal services temporarily suspending service to the U.S., ultimately, consumers and small businesses will be the ones that see increased costs or shipping delays as we undergo more changes to trade policy,"" he said.

Ronald Kleijwegt, CEO at Vinturas, a global supply chain collaboration network serving global manufacturers and OEMs like Mitsubishi and The Association of European Vehicle Logistics, said small businesses will feel the most pain. ""What was once a straightforward cross-border trade is now full of uncertainty,"" he said. ""Larger companies may have the resources to adapt by absorbing costs, rerouting logistics, or investing in compliance. Smaller businesses often do not, which can limit their opportunities, slow innovation, and reduce consumer choice.""

Concerns about the financial health of small businesses are growing. Jacob Bennett, co-founder of small business banking consultant Crux Analytics, said the conversations it is having with banks and credit unions are about the impact of the trade volatility on U.S. small businesses. ""We are trying to help them navigate all of these changes,"" said Bennett. ""So many small and medium-sized businesses operate on such thin margins and don't have the pools of capital that they can fall back on and extend their runway, so many small businesses will unfortunately suffer because of these changes.""

In its explanation for the de minimis elimination, the White House has stressed that over the past decade, the volume of de minimis shipments to the United States exploded, growing from 134 million shipments in 2015 to over 1.36 billion shipments in 2024. Low-cost Asian retail e-commerce companies have been among the major beneficiaries of that boom, such as Shein and Temu. In addition, the Trump administration says de minimis shipments accounted for 90% of all cargo seizures in fiscal year 2024. ""These shipments often broke the law, with 98% of narcotics seized from cargo falling under the de minimis exemption, as well as 97% of counterfeit items seized,"" it stated in a document on the new trade policy.

But for small businesses, the primary fear is that the additional duties will eat into their already thin margins and potentially force them to raise prices. 

Shippers that have leveraged de minimis will not have all of the tariff mitigation strategies available that bulk importers have, according to Brian Bourke, chief commercial officer at SEKO Logistics, and he says its elimination will create two likely impacts for consumers: higher prices and less reliable delivery. Bourke said businesses will likely pass on new duty costs for the low-value goods that transit into the United States, and the increased data requirements for the postal channels may lead to delays depending on how the other countries' postal operators are able to handle and manage these new requirements.

""Large businesses that rely on small businesses should immediately get to work figuring out which suppliers they rely on for what and do what they can to either help them comply or find alternative suppliers,"" said Elliott.

Ultimately, the impact of the end of the de minimis exemption will extend beyond U.S. businesses, according to Kleijwegt. ""With de minimis scrapped, EU exporters now face tariffs on low-value items, added customs paperwork, and higher shipping costs when selling to the US. U.S. small businesses now lose out on cheaper European sourcing, while smaller EU firms lose easy duty-free access, which has huge implications for market access on both sides of the Atlantic,"" he said.

In this article

The de minimis exemption, an obscure trade law provision that has simultaneously fueled and eroded businesses across the globe, officially came to an end on Friday following an executive order by President Donald Trump. 

For nearly a decade, shipments valued under $800 were allowed to enter the country virtually duty-free and with less oversight. Now, those shipments from the likes of Tapestry, Lululemon and just about any other retailer with an online presence will be tariffed and processed in the same way that larger packages are handled. 

In May, Trump ended the exemption for goods coming from China and Hong Kong, and on July 30 he expanded the rollback to all countries, calling it a ""catastrophic loophole"" that's been used to evade tariffs and get ""unsafe or below-market"" products into the U.S. 

The de minimis exemption had previously been slated to end in July 2027 as part of sweeping legislation passed by Congress, but Trump's executive order eliminated the provision much sooner, giving businesses, customs officials and postal services less time to prepare.

""The ending of that under-$800-per-person-per-day rule, from a global perspective, is about to probably cause a bit of pandemonium,"" said Lynlee Brown, a partner in the global trade division at accounting firm EY. ""There's a financial implication, there's an operational implication, and then there's pure compliance, right? Like, these have all been informal entries. No one's really looked at them.""

Already, the sudden change has snarled supply chains from France to Singapore and led post offices across the world to temporarily suspend shipments to the U.S. so they can ensure their systems are updated and able to comply with the new regulations. 

It's forced businesses both large and small to rethink not just their supply chains, but their overall business models, because of the impact the change could have on their bottom lines – setting off a panic in boardrooms across the country, logistics experts said. 

""Obviously it's a big change for operating models for companies, not just the Sheins and the Temus, but for companies that have historically had e-com and brick-and-mortar stores,"" Brown said.

The change also means consumers, already are under pressure from persistent inflation and high interest rates, could now see even higher prices on a wide range of goods, from Colombian bathing suits to specialty ramen subscription boxes shipped straight from Japan. 

The end of de minimis could cost U.S. consumers at least $10.9 billion, or $136 per family, according to a 2025 paper by Pablo Fajgelbaum and Amit Khandelwal for the National Bureau of Economic Research. The research found low-income and minority consumers would feel the biggest impact as they rely more on the cheaper, imported purchases.

Popularized by Chinese e-tailers Shein and Temu, use of the de minimis exemption has exploded in the last decade, ballooning from 134 million shipments in 2015 to more than 1.36 billion in 2024. Before the recent change to limit its use, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it was processing more than 4 million de minimis shipments into the country each day. 

A 2023 House report found more than 60% of de minimis shipments in 2021 came from China, but because the packages require less information than larger containers, very little information is known about their origins and the types of goods they contain. That opacity is one of the key reasons why both former President Joe Biden and Trump sought to curtail or end the exemption. 

Both administrations have said that the exemption was overused and abused and that it's made it difficult for CBP officials to target and block illegal or unsafe shipments coming into the U.S. because the packages aren't subject to the same level of scrutiny as larger containers. 

""We didn't have any compliance information … on those shipments, and then that is where the danger of drugs and whatnot being in those shipments"" comes in, said Irina Vaysfeld, a principal in KPMG's trade and customs practice.

The Biden administration particularly focused on how the exemption allowed goods made with forced labor to make it into the country in violation of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. Meanwhile, Trump has said the exemption has been used to ship fentanyl and other synthetic opioids into the U.S. In a fact sheet published on July 30, the White House said 90% of all cargo seizures in fiscal 2024, including 98% of narcotics seizures and 97% of intellectual property rights seizures, originated as de minimis shipments.

Across the globe, it's common for countries to allow low-value shipments to be imported duty-free as a means to streamline and facilitate global trade, but typically, it's for packages valued around $200, not $800, said EY's Brown.

Until 2016, the U.S. threshold for low-value shipments was also $200, but it was changed to $800 when Congress passed the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act, which sought to benefit businesses, U.S. consumers and the overall U.S. economy, according to the Congressional Research Service. It said higher thresholds provide a ""significant economic benefit"" to both business and shoppers and thus, the overall economy. 

While well intentioned, the law came with unintended consequences, said Brown. 

The ""rise in value, from $200 to $800, just made it kind of like a free for all to say, 'OK, everything come in,'"" she said. 

Eventually companies designed supply chains around the exemption: They set up bonded warehouses, where duties can be deferred prior to export, in places like Canada and Mexico and then imported goods in bulk to those regions before sending them across the border one by one, duty-free, as customer orders rolled in, said Brown.

""Companies have really laid out their supply chain in a very specific way [around de minimis] and that's really the crux of the issue,"" said KPMG's Vaysfeld. ""The way that the supply chain has been laid out now may need to change."" 

Until the rise of Shein and Temu, the de minimis exemption was rarely discussed in retail circles. Soon, the e-commerce behemoths began facing widespread criticism for their use of what many called a loophole.

In 2023, the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party released a report on Shein and Temu and said the two companies were ""likely responsible for more than 30 percent of all packages shipped to the United States daily under the de minimis provision, and likely nearly half of all de minimis shipments to the U.S. from China.""

The revelation sparked widespread consternation among retail executives, lobbyists and government officials who said the companies' use of the exemption was unfair competition. 

However, behind closed doors, companies large and small began mimicking the same model after realizing how it could reduce the steep costs that come along with selling goods online. 

Direct-to-consumer companies that only have online presences have relied on it more heavily, so much so that their businesses may not work without it, said Vaysfeld.

""Some of the companies we've spoken to, they've modeled out, if the tariffs continue for one year, for two years, how does that impact their profitability, and they know how long they can last,"" said Vaysfeld. ""These aren't the huge companies, right? These are the smaller companies. … Depending on what country they're sourcing from or where they're manufacturing, it could really impact their profitability that they can't stay in business for the long term.""

While smaller, digital companies are more exposed, ""pretty much most companies that you can think of"" had been using the exemption in some form before it ended, said Vaysfeld. 

Take Coach and Kate Spade's parent company Tapestry: About 13% to 14% of the company's sales were previously covered under de minimis and will now be subject to a 30% tariff, according to an estimate by equity research firm Barclays.

On the company's earnings call earlier this month, Chief Financial Officer Scott Roe said tariffs will hit its profits by a total of $160 million this year, including the impact of the end of de minimis. That amounts to about 2.3% of margin headwind, he said. 

Shares of the company fell nearly 16% the day that Tapestry reported the profit hit.

In a statement, Roe said Tapestry used de minimis to help support its strong online business, adding it is a practice that ""many companies with sophisticated supply chains have been doing for years.""

To help offset its termination, he said Tapestry is looking for ways to reduce costs and is leaning on its manufacturing footprint across many different countries.

Canadian retailer Lululemon is another company that uses de minimis, according to Wells Fargo. Last week, the bank cut its price target on the company's stock from $225 to $205, citing the end of de minimis. In the note, Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow said the equity research firm sees a potential 90 cent to $1.10 headwind to Lululemon's earnings per share from the de minimis elimination.

Lululemon declined to comment, citing the company's quiet period ahead of its reporting earnings.

The National Retail Federation, the industry's largest trade organization, has not taken a position in favor of or against the exemption. It has members who both supported and opposed the policy, said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at NRF. 

Retailers of all sizes, including independent sellers with digital storefronts, have used the approach as ""a convenient way to get products to the consumer"" for less, Gold said.

""Their costs are going to go up and those costs could be passed on to the consumer at the end of the day,"" Gold said.

The most acute impact of the end of de minimis is expected to be felt on online marketplaces where millions of small businesses sell goods like Etsy, eBay and Shopify and used de minimis to defray costs when sending online orders from other parts of the globe to the U.S.

American shoppers have gotten used to buying artwork, coffee mugs, T-shirts and other items from merchants outside the country without paying duties. With that tariff exemption gone, consumers could face higher costs and a more limited selection of items to choose from.

Etsy, eBay and some other retailers sought to defend the loophole prior to its removal, submitting public comments on proposed de minimis regulation by the CBP. An eBay public policy executive said the company was concerned that restrictions to de minimis ""would impose significant burdens on American consumers and importers.""

Etsy's head of public policy, Jeffrey Zubricki, said the artisan marketplace supports ""smart U.S. de minimis reform,"" but that it was wary of changes that could ""disproportionately affect small American sellers.""

""These exemptions are a powerful tool that help small creators, artisans and makers participate in and navigate cross-border trade,"" Zubricki wrote in a March letter to CBP.

An Etsy spokesperson declined to comment on the policy change. Etsy CFO Lanny Baker said at a Bernstein conference in May that transactions between U.S. buyers and European sellers make up about 25% of the company's gross merchandise sales.

EBay didn't immediately provide a comment in response to a request from CNBC. The company warned in its latest earnings report that the end of de minimis outside of China could impact its guidance, though CEO Jamie Iannone told CNBC in July that he believes eBay is generally ""well suited"" to navigate the shifting trade environment.

Some eBay and Etsy sellers based in the U.K., Canada and other countries are temporarily closing off their businesses to the U.S. as they work out a plan to navigate the higher tariffs. Blair Nadeau, who owns a Canadian bridal accessories company, was forced to take that step this week.

""This is devastating on so many levels and millions of small businesses worldwide are now having their careers, passions and livelihoods threatened,"" Nadeau wrote in an Instagram post on Tuesday. ""Just this past hour I have had to turn away two U.S. customers and it broke my heart.""

Nadeau sells her bespoke wedding veils, jewelry and hair adornments through her own website and on Etsy, where 70% of her customer base is in the U.S. The de minimis provision had been a ""lifeline"" for many Canadian businesses to get their products in the hands of American consumers, Nadeau said in an interview.

""This is really hitting me,"" Nadeau said. ""It's like all of a sudden 70% of your salary has been removed overnight.""

In the absence of de minimis, online merchants are faced with either paying import charges upfront and potentially passing those costs on to shoppers through price hikes, or shipping products ""delivery duty unpaid,"" in which case it's the customer's responsibility to pay any duties upon arrival.

Alexandra Birchmore, an artist based in the Cotswolds region of England, said she expects to raise the price of her oil paintings on Etsy by 10% as a result of paying the duties upfront.

""At the moment every small business forum I am on is in chaos about this,"" Birchmore said. ""It looks to me to be a disaster where no one benefits.""

The disruption could end up being a boon for the likes of Amazon and Walmart. U.S. consumers may turn to major retailers if they face steeper prices elsewhere, as well as potential shipping delays due to backlogs or other issues at the border.

Amazon, in particular, has already proven resilient after the U.S. axed the de minimis provision for shipments from China and Hong Kong in May. The company's sales increased 13% in the three-month period that ended June 30, compared with 10% growth in the prior quarter. Amazon's unit sales grew 12%, an acceleration from the first quarter.

Both Amazon and Walmart have fulfillment operations in the U.S. that allow overseas businesses to ship items in bulk and store them in the companies' warehouses before they're dispatched to shoppers. Shein and Temu largely eschewed the model in the past in favor of the de minimis exception, but they've since moved to open more warehouses in the U.S. in the wake of rising tariffs.

Since the exemption ended on Chinese imports in May, the impact on Shein and Temu has been swift. Temu was forced to change its business model in the U.S. and stop shipping products to American consumers from Chinese factories. 

The end of de minimis, as well as Trump's new tariffs on Chinese imports, also forced Temu to raise prices, rein in its aggressive online advertising push and adjust which goods were available to American shoppers. 

The Financial Times reported on Tuesday that Temu has resumed shipping goods to the U.S. from Chinese factories and will also increase its advertising spend following what it called a ""truce"" between Washington and Beijing. 

Temu didn't return a request for comment. 

Meanwhile, Shein has been forced to raise prices and daily active users on both platforms in the U.S. have fallen since the de minimis loophole was closed, CNBC previously reported. Temu's U.S. daily active users plunged 52% in May versus March, while Shein's were down 25%, according to data shared with CNBC by market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.

Increases in unemployment and inflation cast a shadow over the outlook for Europe's largest economy, which joins the wider EU bloc in bracing for the full impact of newly implemented U.S. tariffs.

German inflation rose by a higher-than-expected 2.1% in August, preliminary data showed Friday, exceeding the 2% expectations of analysts polled by Reuters. Inflation, which is harmonized for comparability across the euro zone, had risen by a cooler-than-expected 1.8% in July.

Germany's core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, was unchanged from the previous month at 2.7% in August, the country's statistics office Destatis said.

Yields on German government bonds, known as Bunds, were little changed shortly after the data release, which came on the same day that labor office figures showed the number of unemployed people jumped to 3.025 million in August, to a rate of 6.4%.

The broader euro zone inflation reading, due Tuesday, will offer further insight into the economic impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies, which have hit various European sectors in recent months.

The U.S. and EU struck a trade agreement in July, including a 15% tariff rate on many EU goods exported to the U.S. Fresh details released earlier this month suggested that this blanket rate will also be applied to some hotly contested sectors like pharmaceuticals — but crucial questions still remain unanswered, leaving businesses on edge.

The tariffs are widely expected to drive prices higher in the U.S., but their effect on costs elsewhere is less clear.

Germany's highly export-driven economy has long been hovering near the flatline. The country's gross domestic product expanded by 0.3% in the first quarter, before contracting by 0.3% in the following period, according to the latest data from Destatis.

""It remains to be seen how European and US companies will react to US tariffs. While one scenario could see prices falling in the eurozone due to overcapacity and weaker sales in the US, globally operating companies might try to actually increase prices in Europe in order to offset profit-squeezing in the US,"" said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, in a note.

""A rather domestic theme will be the cooling of the German labour market, which should take away wage pressures and consequently inflationary pressures,"" he added, noting that the inflationary hike in Germany now weakens the case for the European Central Bank to press ahead with an interest rate cut at its September meeting.

The ECB most recently opted to hold its key rate unchanged at 2% during its July meeting.

In this article

Alibaba posted a better-than-expected bottom line in the June quarter fueled by accelerated sales at its cloud computing unit and a continued revival of its e-commerce business.

Still, the Chinese giant's revenues came in under analyst forecasts. Alibaba's stock climbed as much as 12% in the U.S. after initially dipping.

Here's how Alibaba did in its fiscal first quarter ended June, compared with LSEG estimates:

Revenue rose 2% year-on-year, while the company's net income was up 78%. Alibaba attributed the increase in profit to gains in some of its equity investments and the disposal of Turkish e-commerce firm Trendyol. This was offset by a decrease in income from operations.

However, excluding investment gains, Alibaba's net income would have decreased 18% year-on-year as it continues to invest in the cut-throat instant commerce space in China.

Alibaba is carrying out a delicate balancing act between investing areas such as artificial intelligence and new e-commerce models, while showing that it can continue to grow in China's competitive market. So far, investors have rewarded Alibaba with a 40% rally in its U.S.-listed stock this year.

That's partly thanks a continued growth acceleration at its key cloud computing division as well as improvements at both its China and international e-commerce businesses.

Cloud computing was one of the bright spots.

Alibaba said revenue at the division totaled 33.4 billion yuan, up 26% year-on-year. That was faster than the 18% growth rate seen in the previous quarter. Alibaba's cloud unit is seen as key to the company monetizing artificial intelligence, much like Microsoft or Google.

""Driven by robust AI demand, Cloud Intelligence Group experienced accelerated revenue growth, and AI-related product revenue is now a significant portion of revenue from external customers,"" Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu said in a statement.

Investors are focused on Alibaba's investments in artificial intelligence, where it has become a major global player. The company has aggressively launched various AI models and is selling services through its cloud computing division.

While Alibaba has focused open source AI — meaning its models can be used for free and built on by developers — it also sells AI services through its cloud unit.

Alibaba said AI-related product revenue ""maintained triple-digit year-over-year growth for the eighth consecutive quarter.""

Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA), a measure of profitability, jumped 26% year-on-year in the cloud unit.

Alibaba is developing a new AI chip as it looks to build on growth in its cloud division, CNBC reported on Friday. The news of the chip, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, was also a driver behind Alibaba's share jump on Friday.

Alibaba management said on Friday that the aim for the company is to keep the cloud growth rate above the market average, rather than to raise gross margins in the near term.

Alibaba's core e-commerce business, which accounts for more than 50% of revenue, had mixed results.

Overall, revenue rose 10% year-on-year to 19.6 billion yuan. Customer management revenue, which Alibaba makes off of selling marketing and other services to merchants on its platform, jumped 10%. CMR accounts for the bulk of e-commerce revenue.

However, adjusted earnings in the division fell 21% in the quarter on an annual basis. That's because Alibaba has been investing heavily in so-called quick or instant commerce. This is a feature introduced on Taobao, one of Alibaba's main Chinese e-commerce apps, this year that provides deliveries of certain products in China within an hour

Competition is intense in China, with rivals including food delivery giant Meituan and JD.com, all involved. And the rivalry is already taking its toll on some of these firms, with Meituan this week posting an 89% plunge in second-quarter adjusted net profit.

Alibaba's own quick commerce division brought in revenue of more than 14.8 billion yuan, or $2 billion, rising 12% year-on-year. On an earnings call on Friday, the Alibaba management said instant commerce would add 1 trillion yuan in annualized incremental gross merchandise value (GMV) within the next three years. GMV is the amount of money transacted across Alibaba's platforms but does not translate into direct revenue.

Still, investors appear okay with Alibaba's instant commerce investments, because its cloud computing business continues to grow, while its international online shopping unit — which includes AliExpress — saw a 19% jump in revenue in the quarter as losses narrowed.

Eric Trump said Friday he is certain bitcoin will eventually hit a $1 million valuation as he spoke at a Hong Kong conference, marking the first of a series of Asian crypto events that will feature U.S. President Donald Trump's sons.

Speaking at Hong Kong's Bitcoin Asia 2025 conference, Eric Trump discussed his strong involvement in the crypto space.

""I really believe in the next several years, Bitcoin hits a million dollars. There's no question,"" he said, adding that 90% of his time is now spent with the crypto community. 

During his panel, the American businessman and former reality TV presenter also showered praise on Simon Gerovich, president and CEO of Japanese Bitcoin treasury company Metaplanet. Eric joined the Tokyo-listed company's board of advisors earlier this year. 

Bitcoin's price has risen about 86% in the last 12 months amid buoyant investor sentiment surrounding President's Trump's election victory and a more positive U.S. regulatory environment on crypto. However, it's worth noting that cryptocurrencies generally can be highly volatile and the space has been shrouded in the past by illicit activity and corporate scandals. In 2022, bitcoin and other digital currencies slumped sharply after a slew of major crypto companies went bankrupt.

Eric Trump, along with his brother Donald Trump Jr, have become major players in the Trump family's growing crypto empire. The two are co-founders of the bitcoin-mining venture American Bitcoin and also help manage the Trump family-backed project World Liberty Financial.

Now the brothers are broadening their push into digital assets to Asia. Soon after his Hong Kong visit, Eric Trump is reportedly headed to Japan to attend a shareholder meeting of Metaplanet, according to a recent report from Bloomberg News.

Later in September, both Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are expected to speak at a South Korean crypto conference, and the pair is slated to appear as key speakers at Singapore's Token 2049, one of the world's largest crypto events.

Once a skeptic of cryptocurrencies, President Trump has also embraced the crypto industry, branding himself as the first ""crypto president."" 

""The Bitcoin community embraced my father unlike anything I had ever seen before,"" Eric Trump said Friday adding: ""And I hope that's paid off in spades.""

The Trump administration has launched a number of executive orders and backed policies welcomed by the digital asset industry and has filled his cabinet with crypto advocates like David Sacks, the White House's AI and crypto czar. 

Trump has also been involved in crypto business ventures, including World Liberty Financial and his $TRUMP meme coin, leading to accusations of corruption and self-dealing from opposition lawmakers, as well as calls for ethics investigations.

Given the shared interests between the American president and his son's crypto activities, market watchers will be monitoring how the two brothers are received by government officials during their Asia tour. 

The visits come against the backdrop of President Trump's ongoing global trade war, which has made Asia a major target.  

A Hong Kong official and a lawmaker withdrew from a Bitcoin Asia conference in the city following advice not to engage with Eric Trump, the South China Morning Post reported Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. 

An archived version of the event webpage confirmed that Eric Yip, executive director at the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), and lawmaker Johnny Ng had previously been on the list of speakers for the event, before being removed. 

The SFC told CNBC that Yip was unable to attend the event because of a business trip, while the South China Morning Post reported that Ng said he withdrew for family reasons. 

The Hong Kong legislative council did not respond to a request for comment from CNBC.

A court hearing on Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook's request that President Donald Trump be barred from firing her while a lawsuit plays out ended Friday without a judge issuing a ruling.

Cook's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, blasted the Department of Justice's argument at the hearing that Trump had the necessary legal cause to remove Cook because of suggestions by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte that she committed mortgage fraud in documents for two properties in Atlanta and Ann Arbor, Michigan, before joining the Fed. 

""You can't have Director Pulte's crazy midnight tweets be the cause,"" Lowell told Judge Jia Cobb  in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.

But a DOJ lawyer told Cobb that it is up to Trump's ""discretion"" to determine if he has legal cause to fire a Fed governor.

The Fed, in a court filing before the hearing, said it would not make arguments on the merits of Cook's request. But the central bank also asked Cobb to issue a ""prompt ruling"" on her motion.

Cobb ended the hearing after two hours of arguments without ruling on Cook's request for a temporary restraining order that would block her removal from the Senate-confirmed seat.

It is not clear when the judge will rule. 

Cobb suggested that the attorneys for both sides confer and determine whether they want her to first rule on the restraining order, or whether they want her to issue a decision on potential requests for a preliminary injunction or summary judgment to restrict Trump from booting her from the Fed and replacing her.

Cobb also said she was giving the parties more time to supplement in writing the arguments they made in open court on Friday.

Lowell began that session by asking Cobb to keep in place the ""status quo"" — Cook remaining in her job — while he, Trump's lawyer, and other interested parties lay out arguments in court filings on whether the president has the power to terminate her.

Cobb said, ""This case obviously raises some important questions that may be of first impression, particularly as it applies to this board.""

If Trump succeeds in firing Cook, he would be on track to have nominated a majority of the seven-member Board, which sets interest rates. Trump has criticized the Board for months for not cutting those rates, which he has argued would boost the U.S. economy and reduce the federal government's cost of financing its debt.

Cook, who is the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, argues that Trump has no such cause for firing her. She was nominated to the Board by then-President Joe Biden in 2022, and her current 14-year term is due to expire in January 2038.

Trump says he wants to fire Cook because of Pulte's prior allegations that she potentially committed mortgage fraud in statements she made on documents related to the properties in Atlanta and Ann Arbor.

On Thursday night, Pulte said he had filed a second criminal referral against Cook with the Department of Justice related to a mortgage for a condominium in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and alleged misrepresentations she made about that condo and the two other homes in government ethics filings during her time as a Fed governor.

Lowell on Friday called Pulte's new referral ""an obvious smear campaign aimed at discrediting Gov. Cook by a political operative who has taken to social media more than 30 times in the last two days and demanded her removal before any review of the facts or evidence.""

""Nothing in these vague, unsubstantiated allegations has any relevance to Gov Cook's role at the Federal Reserve, and they in no way justify her removal from the Board,"" Lowell said.

Cook sued Trump, the Fed Board of Governors, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday. The suit says that Trump's firing of her is illegal, and asks Cobb for an order keeping her on the job while the case is litigated.

Powell and the Fed Board were sued only to the extent that they could, at some point, seek to execute Trump's desire to fire her.

The Fed, in its court filing Friday, told Cobb that it intends "" to follow any order this Court issues.""

The Supreme Court is likely to end up resolving the dispute.

Shoppers with higher incomes are more likely to return retail purchases they make, a new report finds. 

Higher-income households had the highest percentage of retail refunds, at 5.3% of their purchases in 2025, according to a recent report by the Bank of America Institute that compared higher-, middle- and lower-income shopper return behavior. The analysis is based on aggregated, anonymous transaction data from bank debit and credit card holders who made at least five transactions per month.

Lower-income households had the smallest percentage of retail refunds at around 3.7% of their purchases.

Higher-income shoppers are less cash-strapped than lower earners, the report notes, so they are more likely to ""buy items speculatively,"" especially if they know they can ""return it later if they decide it's not right for them."" 

This behavior is similar to what shopping experts call ""bracketing,"" or the act of ordering multiple products in different sizes, colors or variations, with the intention of keeping a few and returning the rest.

""That's likely to be somewhat easier for someone who has a higher income to do,"" said David Tinsley, lead author of the report and senior economist at the Bank of America Institute.

To be sure, bracketing is not really new, said Edgar Dworsky, a consumer advocate and founder of ConsumerWorld.org.

""It's really been around as long as the internet has been around,"" Dworsky said. ""Unlike walking into a department store — going into Macy's and trying on something there, or seeing things in person — you're buying much more blindly online.""

More shoppers are making more frequent returns. Nearly half, or 46%, of consumers return purchased items multiple times a month, according to a separate 2024 report by Optoro, a returns solutions company. That's a jump from 29% in 2023.

While consumers value the ability to return products, retailers have been tightening their return policies in recent years to mitigate the high costs, experts say. 

Broadly, the ability to return unwanted purchases is important for consumers.

About 76% of surveyed respondents consider free returns important when deciding where to shop, per a 2024 report by the National Retail Federation and Happy Returns, a returns shipping company.

Nearly as many, 67%, of respondents stated that a negative return experience would deter them from shopping with a retailer again. 

The survey polled more than 2,000 consumers who had returned at least one online purchase in 2024, and 249 e-commerce and finance professionals from retailers with at least $500 million in revenue.

Despite those desires, returns can be costly for retailers. In 2024, retailers expected that about 16.9% of their annual sales would be returned, reaching an average cost of $890 billion, according to the report.

""Retailers themselves say it's a very expensive business,"" said Tinsley.

To offset the costs, companies have been tightening their return policies in recent years. NRF and Happy Returns found that about 66% of retailers began charging for one or more return methods.

Another way to cut back on costs is by shortening the window consumers have to make returns, said Dworsky: ""We've generally seen this over the years.""

""I think back to the old days when you bought something ... and you had maybe 180 days or maybe no return limit,"" he said.

As tariffs, or taxes on imported goods, increase the cost of products, companies may look for ways to tighten return policies even further to cut down on expenses, said Dworsky.

""One of the ways of cutting expenses is to cut back on the length of return periods,"" he said.

To avoid going through the hassle of returning a product, Dworksy said it's important to understand what you're buying ahead of time. 

One way to do so is by checking online reviews from customers who recently purchased the item. Some retailers, like Amazon, will flag whether shoppers tend to keep or return certain products, which can help you gauge the quality of the piece.

Check a retailer's return policies before you buy, especially if you think there's a chance you won't keep the item. Look for businesses that offer more flexible terms, he said.

A 2024 report by GoDaddy found that 77% of shoppers check the return policy before making a purchase. The site polled 1,500 consumers in September.

For additional protections, it can be helpful to use a credit card for the transaction, said Dworsky.

Credit cards can offer several kinds of return protections that help cardholders in different ways, such as extending the time a consumer has to return an item or the ability to dispute charges and get a refund, per Bankrate.

However, make sure to review the fine print in your card and what terms may apply.

""Credit card return protection is a notoriously fickle credit card perk that's increasingly rare,"" notes the Bankrate report.

In this article

YouTube and Fox announced Friday that the companies had reached a deal to keep Fox News, Fox Sports and other Fox channels available on YouTube TV, following negotiations over a new distribution agreement.

The companies had earlier reached a short-term extension to prevent disruptions for YouTube TV subscribers.

""We're pleased to have reached a deal that preserves the value of our service for our subscribers,"" YouTube said in a statement shared with CNBC. YouTube, owned by Alphabet, as well as Fox did not disclose the financial terms of the agreement.

YouTube had said Monday that Fox was asking for payments ""far higher than what partners with comparable content offerings receive.""

That comes after Fox launched Fox One, a standalone streaming service last week, costing $19.99 per month or $199.99 annually.

As a result of the standoff, YouTube had warned it may remove Fox Broadcast Network, Fox News and Fox Sports from its platform by 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday.

That could've seen YouTube TV subscribers miss out on a highly anticipated college football match between top-ranked Texas against reigning national champion and third-ranked Ohio State on Sunday, and possibly the start of the National Football League season early next month. 

Brendan Carr, chair of the Federal Communications Commission, weighed in Friday, saying he was happy the two companies had reached a deal. 

""This is great news for college football fans and avoids blackouts. Enjoy the games this weekend!"" he said in a post on X. 

YouTube TV pays broadcasters such as Fox to stream their channels and has roughly 9.4 million subscribers.

In addition to American football, Fox hosts Major League Baseball games, as well as the World Series, which is scheduled to start in late October.

The base plan for YouTube TV costs $82.99 per month and includes over 100 live channels.

YouTube is America's leading media distributor in terms of audience engagement, capturing over 13% of TV watch-time in July, according to Nielsen.

HONG KONG — The Trump family “loves” the Bitcoin community, Eric Trump said in Hong Kong on Friday, predicting that its value could hit $1 million as concerns mount over conflicts of interest in his latest venture set to go public.

Trump said his family became interested in cryptocurrency when it was cut off from banking services “because my father was in politics.” 

“The Bitcoin community embraced my father, unlike anything I had ever seen before,” Trump said at the Bitcoin Asia conference here.

“And I hope that's paid off in spades, because we love this community,” he said, sitting in front of a screen with a live ticker showing the cryptocurrency's price at nearly $110,000, up from about $70,000 on the day his father, Donald Trump, was voted back into office in November. 

Eric Trump has attracted an almost cult-like following in the crypto industry, which was apparent in Hong Kong as hundreds of attendees — some dressed up in outfits ranging from sparkly robes to white suits covered in Bitcoin symbols — cheered as Trump took the stage, bashed his father's predecessor, Joe Biden, and said, “This is the time to buy.”

The cryptocurrency industry has become big business for the Trump family, whose patriarch has become one of its biggest champions since it helped return him to office. 

Feeling unfairly targeted by the Biden administration, the industry was a political force in the 2024 election season, directing an estimated $135 million in donations toward Trump and other crypto-friendly candidates.

Since then, the Trump family has only become further enmeshed in the industry — no one more so than Eric Trump, who said Friday that “90% of my time in life is in this community.”

His latest venture is called American Bitcoin. Launched in March with his older brother, Donald Trump Jr., and the Nasdaq-listed Hut 8, a crypto energy infrastructure company, American Bitcoin aims to be the “world's largest, most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner while building a robust strategic Bitcoin reserve,” according to a news release.

Eric Trump said Friday that the company will be going public “very soon” as it merges with a pre-existing Nasdaq-listed company called Gryphon Digital Mining.

“We are one of the biggest Bitcoin mining companies on Earth,” he said. “We mine about 3% of the world's Bitcoin every single day.”

He insists that the family's business is separate from national politics and has dismissed concerns about conflicts of interest. 

“My father's totally shielded off from our company. There's total separation of church and state,” he told CNBC in December. “We have great ethics advisers. We take it incredibly seriously.”

But Donald Trump was a major topic of discussion at his son's Q&A in Hong Kong, which began with a round of applause for the president, who has vowed to make the United States the “crypto capital of the world.”

Since returning to office in January, Trump has pushed to ease regulation of the industry, shut down the Justice Department's national cryptocurrency enforcement team, appointed a “crypto czar” and held a White House summit for industry leaders. He also said the U.S. would create a national strategic crypto reserve.

This month he signed an executive order allowing cryptocurrency and real estate investments to be included in 401(k) retirement accounts, which critics say could put Americans' retirement savings at risk. 

Trump has also sought legislative backing for a form of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins, some of which is already in place. One of the three bills that received support on Capitol Hill last month was the GENIUS Act, which allows stablecoins to be issued by private companies.

The passage of the bills was slammed by Americans for Financial Reform, a left-leaning watchdog group, which said in a statement last month that Trump and his allies would “personally benefit from limitless legalized corruption while the rest of us stand in harm's way of the next crypto implosion.”

Trump, who said in 2021 that Bitcoin “seems like a scam,” has since embraced it as a moneymaking opportunity, sometimes at great cost to investors. According to the watchdog group State Democracy Defenders Fund, as of mid-March his crypto assets were valued at $2.9 billion, or about 37% of his total wealth.

Much of that money, which Trump earned in about six months, came from ventures such as the $TRUMP coin that he launched ahead of his inauguration, which was trading at nearly $8 on Friday, down from its peak of $73 in January. A meme coin was also launched for first lady Melania Trump.

Industry professionals call these meme coins, meaning they have little practical use and are mostly symbolic, making their value subject to extreme volatility. About 764,000 wallets of mostly small holders lost money on $TRUMP while 58 wallets made more than $10 million each, CNBC reported in May, citing data from the blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.

In May, Trump briefly appeared at a dinner outside Washington for the 220 largest buyers of $TRUMP, who spent an average of $1 million on the token.  

Trump also has a large stake in World Liberty Financial, a decentralized crypto exchange that was launched last fall and is majority-controlled by the Trump family.

World Liberty's flagship project is its $WLFI stablecoin, which holders voted last month to make more widely tradable. The family also stands to gain from an agreement by a technology company backed by the government of the United Arab Emirates to invest $2 billion in one of World Liberty's stablecoin products.

That currency will then be used to invest in Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, whose CEO stepped down in 2023 after the company pleaded guilty to money laundering and other charges.

The deal was announced at a crypto conference Eric Trump attended in Abu Dhabi shortly before his father visited the United Arab Emirates city in May.

Even amid the enthusiasm at the Hong Kong conference on Friday, participants said there was some discomfort around the Trump family's involvement in the cryptocurrency industry. 

“There is serious conflict of interest, and people recognize it,” said Bharat Prabhakar, 25, a New York-based conference attendee. ""But not a lot of people say it out loud because there's real consequences for it.""

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

On Friday, the Ethereum Foundation outlined a multi-track roadmap to make Ethereum feel “like one chain again,” publishing a protocol update that prioritizes faster confirmations, trust-minimized cross-chain interactions, and new UX and privacy tooling on crypto's second-largest blockchain.

The plan introduces a trio of workstreams dubbed “Initialisation,” “Acceleration,” and “Finalisation.” It also shares deliverables and target dates extending into 2026, according to the official blog post.

Under the Initialisation stream, EF engineers and ecosystem teams are rolling out an Open Intents Framework that lets users express desired outcomes. Additionally, developers proposed an Ethereum Interoperability Layer aimed at facilitating trustless transactions across Layer 2 networks, along with a set of standards designed to reduce friction. 

""The Ethereum Interoperability Layer (EIL) focuses on making Ethereum feel like one chain again, without compromising on CROPS values (censorship-resistance, open-source, privacy, and security), developers wrote.  Production contracts for the intents framework are live, with audits and a reference solver due by Q4 2025.  A public design document for the Interoperability Layer is scheduled for release in October.

Acceleration, the second stream, targets latency. A fast L1 confirmation rule—giving strong confirmations in roughly 15–30 seconds—will be specified and implemented across consensus clients, with broad availability targeted for Q1 2026.

Parallel work explores halving slot times from 12 seconds to 6 seconds to shorten the inclusion and finality periods. There are also plans to support optimistic rollups that adopt ZK-based real-time proving or a secure “2-of-3” faster settlement mechanism to reduce withdrawal delays.

The Finalisation stream pushes toward research and development of real-time proving, or snarkification, for cross-chain settlement and materially faster Layer 1 finality.  Snarkifying or snarkification refers to utilizing zero-knowledge proofs, specifically ZK-SNARKS, to improve the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) environment.

According to the Aug. 29 blog update, developers are exploring options such as changes to the beacon chain, three-slot finality designs, and alternative consensus protocols that reduce finality to seconds if proven safe and decentralized.

The latest protocol update ties the UX agenda to two ongoing EF initiatives aimed at advancing Ethereum's global computer plan. First, Phase 2 of the “Trillion Dollar Security” program, which focuses on safer signing, key management, and wallet standards.

It also links to “Kohaku,” a privacy wallet effort co-led by Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin and EF coordinator Nicolas Consigny. It aims to ship an SDK and an advanced browser extension with private addresses, balances, and sends backed by a light client.

In other related news, onchain activity on Ethereum has surged while developers work to improve the blockchain's engine room. The Block reported that monthly onchain volume surpassed $320 billion, a four-year high and the third-highest level ever.

 After awarding millions of dollars, the Ethereum Foundation is overhauling its Ecosystem Support Program, shifting from open applications to a curated model. 

After funding hundreds of projects with millions of dollars, the Ethereum Foundation is temporarily pausing the Ecosystem Support Program's (ESP) open grant application process to refocus on a more proactive funding model that is better aligned with the ecosystem's strategic needs.

The transition comes as the foundation faces challenges reviewing the high volume of inbound applications, which it said has left “limited capacity to pursue new strategic opportunities.” 

In a Friday blog post, the Ethereum Foundation stressed that the ESP will continue funding new projects, but under a refined approach to grantmaking. More details are expected in the fourth quarter, including a curated methodology outlining specific ecosystem priorities.

In 2024, ESP awarded nearly $3 million across 105 projects and initiatives, supporting areas such as developer tooling, data and analytics, research and education. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the Ethereum Foundation distributed $32.6 million in total grants.

As a nonprofit established in 2014 by Ethereum's co-founders, the Ethereum Foundation has historically played a key role in providing funding, coordination and long-term vision for the blockchain's development, including major network upgrades.

In June, the foundation introduced a more transparent treasury policy detailing operational costs and cash requirements. As part of the commitment, it pledged to publish quarterly and annual disclosures of its assets, investments and any significant developments.

As the world's second-largest blockchain, Ethereum has strong backing from institutional investors and developers but faces growing competition from faster, lower-cost alternatives such as Solana, Avalanche and BNB Smart Chain, which market themselves as more scalable and user-friendly platforms.

As such, Ethereum is being steered toward a renewed focus on layer-1 scaling, reducing network costs and improving the overall user experience.

These priorities were highlighted in a separate foundation blog post on Friday, which described interoperability as “the highest-leverage opportunity within the broader UX domain over the next 6–12 months.”

Interoperability has become a central focus given the rapid proliferation of layer-2 protocols. While these solutions extend Ethereum's functionality, they also introduce new challenges, particularly fragmentation, the foundation said. 

Earlier this year, the foundation also launched a $1 trillion security initiative — a broad strategy designed to strengthen Ethereum's resilience and position the network for a wider, non-crypto audience.

Ethereum has already made inroads with financial institutions, with VanEck CEO Jan VanEck calling Ether (ETH) the “Wall Street token.” On stablecoins, he argued that the winning blockchain will be the one that attracts the most builders: “It's going to be Ethereum, or something that uses Ethereum's methodology.'”

 Altcoins are a dynamic and often speculative segment of the crypto market, offering a wide range of investment opportunities. Their value can fluctuate significantly based on factors such as perceived utility, technological innovation, market sentiment, or pure speculation. While some altcoins support innovative blockchain applications, many—including meme coins—lack fundamental value and trade primarily on hype, making them especially volatile. 


 With over 18,000 altcoins available, investors must conduct thorough due diligence before investing in any project. This includes researching the technology, development team, use case, and tokenomics of each coin. For risk averse investors, alternatives such as crypto-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or regulated staking services. 


 Altcoins, short for ""alternative coins,"" are any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin (and sometimes Ethereum). The first altcoins, Namecoin and Litecoin, were created in 2011 as developers sought to improve upon Bitcoin's limitations. Now, these tokens can serve a variety of purposes such as governance rights, smart contracts, decentralised finance (DeFi), and native network transactions, which gives them their value. Many altcoins are directly tied to innovations within their ecosystems, meaning increased adoption and utility can drive corresponding increases in token value. 


 For investors, altcoins with strong fundamentals from reputable projects can be a good portfolio diversification option. They're also a good initial way to get your first exposure to cryptocurrency markets, especially if you have limited capital. 


 However, the speculative nature of altcoins creates significant variation in profitability, with smaller-capitalization or lesser-known projects sometimes outperforming larger, potentially better known altcoins, rewarding risk-tolerant investors who were willing to hold positions long-term.


 Altcoins can be extremely volatile, particularly during periods of Bitcoin volatility, due to a phenomenon called Bitcoin dominance. When Bitcoin dominance is high, altcoins typically experience slower growth as investors prefer to allocate capital to Bitcoin, but when Bitcoin fever subsides, investors often rotate their funds into alternative cryptocurrencies, creating opportunities for altcoins to grow.


 Regulatory risk represents one of the most serious threats to altcoin investments, as demonstrated by events surrounding the SEC v. Ripple case. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Ripple with selling XRP as an unregistered security. As the case ground on, investor confidence eroded. XRP fell from a March 2021 price peak of about 1.59 to a range between 0.33 and 0.69 from May 2022 to September 2024.


 Before investing in any altcoin, you should check if the project faces current or foreseeable regulatory challenges, as legal battles can severely impact token prices regardless of the project's underlying fundamentals.


 Like every other asset class, altcoins can be subject to scams and “rug pulls,” where developers abandon projects after collecting investor funds. While no approach is completely fail-safe, it's advisable to stick with altcoins listed on popular, regulated exchanges. These exchanges also provide additional security measures and regulatory oversight that can help protect investors from market manipulation, though you should still conduct your own research.


 When buying altcoins, be wary of new projects with no price history or proven performance track record. It's generally better to invest in tokens that are at least one to two years old and have demonstrated consistent value, one study says, especially in comparison to new projects promising instant returns within incredibly short timeframes. Also, technical vulnerabilities can significantly impact altcoin prices.


 For example, Solana has experienced multiple technical vulnerabilities, including core protocol outages, that created fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) among investors, causing the price to fall sharply at those times Sudden moves like that can immediately lead to huge unrealized losses.


 Altcoins can be exciting investments, and you might be tempted to allocate a large percentage of your portfolio to them, especially during bullish markets when prices are rising rapidly. But it's more prudent beforehand to determine how many tokens you want to purchase based on how much money you are willing to risk, and stick to those limits regardless of market momentum. Remember that cryptocurrencies are a highly volatile asset class, and if you become overweight in altcoins, even small changes in the market could significantly tilt your portfolio, affecting its overall performance.


 Staking offers a lower-risk alternative to trading altcoins. It's a process that—in short—pays you crypto for locking up coins with normal volatility, like Cardano, and even stable coins like USDC for a specific period. Basically, you lend your crypto to others, who pay interest. This approach carries less risk and is as easy as putting money into a savings account.


 DeFi yield farming provides higher returns than staking but with more complexity and risk. In yield farming, you provide liquidity to decentralized protocols in exchange for interest and rewards, though this strategy demands deep technical knowledge and exposes you to smart contract risks, impermanent loss, and potential protocol failures. 


 Crypto ETFs, trusts, and tokenized index funds offer the most regulated and diversified approach to outright altcoin exposure. These vehicles give you diversified exposure to multiple altcoins through traditional brokerage accounts. Meanwhile, you benefit from professional management and regulatory oversight, which are far less available to individuals trading directly in altcoin.


 Altcoins, especially lower-cap ones, allow you to invest with as little as $10 in some cases, providing an excellent opportunity to test the waters and see what fits your portfolio without significant capital commitment. When investing, avoid concentrating on just one narrative since the cryptocurrency market spans diverse sectors such as gaming, media, NFTs, and AI. Instead, choose altcoins from at least two to three different narratives. This diversified approach helps reduce concentration risk while allowing you to benefit from different growth cycles.


 When buying altcoins, only buy those that can be stored on reputable and secure wallets or bought through well-recognised exchanges. These steps will help you avoid hassles over accessibility, security, and liquidity. This approach also ensures you maintain control over your assets.


 Always monitor general news and changing regulations, as these can quickly impact your altcoin holdings. Also, follow the projects you've invested in on X (formerly Twitter) to receive timely updates that might lead you to adjust your investment strategy to suit changing market conditions and new developments.


 If you are directly buying altcoins through spot trading, have a solid exit and profit-taking strategy in place before making any investment. You should predetermine when to exit if prices fall to a specific level below your entry point, as well as how to take profits at predetermined levels above your entry price. This disciplined approach will minimize your losses and prevent you from losing much or all of your capital in the event something goes catastrophically wrong and the altcoin goes to zero, as happened with Terraform Lab's LUNA and TerraUSD.


 Altcoins offer a low barrier to entry for investors looking to diversify their portfolio through cryptocurrency. However, before you begin researching these alternative assets, remember they are subject to high volatility, even more than Bitcoin. Thoroughly research any project you are interested in, checking for vital signs like utility, tokenomics, and regulatory status.


 While some altcoins come with risks like rug pulls and unverifiable track records, there are still many altcoins that can pass these checks and make a good fit for your portfolio. If you're willing to invest in them indirectly, you can explore ETFs, staking, DeFi yield farming, and tokenised index funds. In all, do not yield to Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) when investing in altcoins. Have an entry point, an exit strategy, and a budget to ensure you protect your portfolio.

 Avalanche transaction growth topped all blockchain networks with 66%, as the smart-contract network saw more government implementation and renewed ETF applications. 

Update Aug. 29, 1:07 p.m. UTC: This article has been updated to include comments from Ava Labs' chief strategy officer.

Avalanche's transaction growth surpassed all other blockchain networks this week, signaling more investor mindshare rotating to the smart-contract blockchain's utility token, as it also saw increasing governmental adoption.

Avalanche, a smart contract blockchain designed to improve scalability and usability, has emerged as one of the fastest–growing blockchain networks.

Transactions on Avalanche rose over 66% during the past week, surpassing 11.9 million transactions across over 181,300 active addresses, wrote crypto intelligence platform Nansen, in a Friday X post.

The increased transactions may signal more incoming investor interest in the Avalanche (AVAX) token, catalyzed by Avalanche's latest governmental implementation and renewed exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings around the altcoin.

On Thursday, the US Department of Commerce announced that it will begin posting real gross domestic product (GDP) data on decentralized blockchains, including Avalanche. 

Starting with the data from July 2025, the GDP reports will be published on nine public blockchain networks, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, Tron, Stella, Arbitrum One, Polygon PoS and Optimism, wrote the Department in a Thursday announcement, adding:

The Department of Commerce called it a “landmark effort” that may “demonstrate the wide utility of blockchain technology” and serve as a “proof-of-concept for all of government,” to build on the US President Donald Trump administration's vision of making the US the “blockchain capital of the world.”

The rising activity may be more related to organic growth in Avalanche's layer-1 (L1) blockchains and other rising decentralized finance (DeFi) activities, according to Luigi D'Onorio DeMeo, chief strategy officer at Ava Labs, the company behind the development of Avalanche.

“It's related to the growth of additional Avalanche L1s growing + new growth in terms of transactions on the Avalanche C-Chain related to payments growth of stablecoins and DeFi,” DeMeo told Cointelegraph.

Other potential developments catalyzing investor interest include crypto investment firm Grayscale's updated S-1 filing for a spot Avalanche exchange-traded fund, which was submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, Cointelegraph reported.

Transactions on second-place Starknet increased by 37%, while the Viction network emerged in third with an expansion of over 35%.

The Base network was sixth in terms of growth, but ranked first in terms of transaction count, with over 64 million transactions over the past week, Nansen data showed.

Publishing economic data on the blockchain will make these reports “immutable,” wrote US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, adding:

“It's only fitting that the Commerce Department and President Donald Trump, the Crypto-President, publicly release economic statistical data on the blockchain,” added Lutnick after the historic announcement.

Cryptocurrency supporters hailed on Thursday the U.S. government's move to post GDP numbers on several blockchain platforms.

Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) deemed the Commerce Department's move as ""historic"" that will ensure America's leadership in ""digital innovation and transparency.""

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also praised the decision to bring America on-chain and thanked Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick for his leadership.

Tyler Winklevoss, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, said the move brings ""innovation, vision and execution to the government and helps realize President Donald Trump's vision of making the U.S. the world's ""cryptocurrency capital.""

Notably, both Coinbase and Gemini helped the government in publishing the data on-chain, according to the Commerce Department.

The Commerce Department announced that it published the second-quarter GDP results on nine blockchains, including Bitcoin BTC/USD, Ethereum ETH/USD and Solana SOL/USD, marking the first time a federal agency put official macroeconomic data on blockchain rails.

The data was also disseminated through coordination with Chainlink LINK/USD and Pyth Network PYTH/USD, the oracle networks that help bring real-world, off-chain data to smart contracts.

Over time, the government is expected to post data such as the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index and Real Final Sales to Private Domestic Purchasers on-chain, Chainlink said.

“We are making America's economic truth immutable and globally accessible like never before,” Lutnick said. 

While blockchain data is designed to be immutable, i.e, cannot be edited or deleted, some networks have reversed transactions to recover hacked funds. The most notable incident that comes to mind is Ethereum's  Decentralized Autonomous Organization hack in 2016.

Price Action: At the time of writing, the PYTH token was exchanging hands at $0.2218, up 90% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. LINK token traded up 1.5% to $24.20 at last check.

 Developers must integrate AI agents through intent-centric systems or risk replicating the same problems Web3 set out to eliminate. 

Opinion by: Adrian Brink, co-founder of Anoma

Web3 was founded on decentralization, sovereignty, verifiability and resilience. Now, those values are under threat. The rise of AI agents is beneficial and inevitable. Unless agents are built on sovereign intent-centric infrastructure, they are a threat to the core values of crypto. 

The integration of intents is no longer just about improving UX; it's about enabling agents to reach their full potential without sacrificing the soul of Web3. 

AI agents can help make blockchain interactions seamless and intuitive, but agents as they exist today bring serious security concerns and do not align with Web3 values. Today's agents are based on black box large-language models (LLMs) that are unverifiable and prone to hallucinations. This is a dangerous combination when it comes to managing sensitive financial data. 

Agents are being built on centralized infrastructure with opaque execution systems, with no control over user privacy or data sovereignty. They are run on closed-source algorithms from the likes of IBM and OpenAI. This trend is poised to replicate Web2 power dynamics across the crypto ecosystem. 

By integrating agents with intent-centric systems, however, we can ensure users fully control their data and assets.

Intents are a type of building block for decentralized applications that give users complete control over the outcome of their transactions. Powered by a decentralized network of solvers, agentic nodes that compete to solve user transactions, these systems eliminate the complexity of the blockchain experience while maintaining user sovereignty and privacy throughout the process. 

Related: Intents fix crypto's UX crisis and pave the way for agentic DeFi

Intent-based systems enable all the UX benefits of AI agents while keeping user sovereignty in place and guaranteeing their desired outcomes. 

Without intents, AI agents also present serious centralization concerns. As agent-based solutions increase in popularity, the risk of centralization and market consolidation is high. 

Without a competitive, decentralized marketplace of agents, where individual agents compete for user activity, we're in danger of specific LLMs becoming centralized monopolies that take over all the order flow.

Intent-based infrastructure can enable decentralized, interoperable marketplaces of agents that prevent one mega-agent from taking over. In these systems, agents can communicate, specialize in certain types of transactions, share order flow, compete to meet user needs and, most importantly, be held accountable for outcomes. 

Beyond ensuring privacy, decentralization and verifiability, intents will also help agents reach their full potential. While current-generation agents are largely siloed, intents can serve as the language for agents to communicate and interoperate. Agent-to-agent communication via intents will be necessary for agents to trade with each other and conduct more complex, multi-step operations for users. 

In particular, with generalized intents, agents become even more powerful, capable of solving any user request, including complicated multi-step operations and crosschain transactions. This opens the door to new types of applications that can take decentralized finance (DeFi) beyond the services that exist today, with UX benefits that enable Web3 to rival the experience of Web2.

Combining AI agents and intents will redefine the Web3 experience while keeping the space true to its core values. Intents bridge users and agents, ensuring the UX benefits users expect from AI while maintaining decentralization, sovereignty and verifiability. Intent-based systems will play a crucial role in the next phase of Web3's evolution by ensuring agents act in users' best interests.

As AI adoption grows, so does the risk of replicating the problems of Web2 within Web3. Intent-centric infrastructure is the key to addressing both the challenges and opportunities that AI agents bring and is necessary to unlock their full potential. Intents will be an essential infrastructure component and a fundamental requirement for anyone integrating or considering integrating AI into DeFi. 

Intents are not merely a type of UX upgrade or optional enhancement. They are critical infrastructure for ensuring that AI serves users, not the existing powers that be. The sooner the industry adopts them, the better its chance of preserving a decentralized, open future.

              Highlights            



                        The U.S. Commerce Department announced it will publish GDP data on nine major blockchains starting with July 2025 figures, aiming to make economic statistics immutable, transparent and tamper evident.                      


                        The move highlights blockchain's core strength of verifiability, rather than efficiency, making it valuable in contexts where multiple parties with conflicting incentives must share trusted data (e.g., supply chains, compliance, cross-border trade).                      


                        For businesses, blockchain adoption hinges on balancing cost, speed and confidentiality: while it can boost trust and automation in decentralized ecosystems, in many enterprise cases traditional databases remain faster, cheaper and more practical.                      

It's no secret the Trump Administration loves bitcoin and crypto. And as news this week from the Department of Commerce shows, that enthusiasm is now spilling over across the rest of the government.

On Thursday (Aug. 28), the Commerce Department announced that it will begin posting real gross domestic product (GDP) data on blockchain, beginning with the July 2025 data, to the following nine blockchains: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, TRON, Stellar, Avalanche, Arbitrum One, Polygon PoS and Optimism.

“It's only fitting that the Commerce Department and President Donald Trump, the Crypto-President, publicly release economic statistical data on the blockchain,” said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick in a statement. “We are making America's economic truth immutable and globally accessible like never before, cementing our role as the blockchain capital of the world. And everybody has to admit that 3.3% GDP growth is impressive.”

On the surface, the move might sound like a symbolic flourish meant to placate Washington's emerging pro-crypto bloc. But dig deeper and it raises a serious question for corporate leaders: if the federal government is anchoring its data to blockchain, should businesses consider doing the same?

For the Commerce Department, publishing GDP on blockchain is less about crypto evangelism than about experimenting with verifiability at scale. Economic data is a cornerstone of policymaking and market forecasting. Anchoring official numbers to multiple public chains ensures that the figures are accessible in a tamper-evident way, reducing the risk of manipulation or misinformation. If a number were altered on an agency website, blockchain-anchored records would reveal the discrepancy immediately.

That assurance resonates in an age when trust in institutions is fragile and digital disinformation proliferates. Yet the government's embrace is not a wholesale migration to blockchain, but a limited distribution method and an additional channel for publishing data, not a replacement for existing systems.

The central advantage of blockchain is not speed, efficiency or even decentralization. It is verifiability. Data written to a chain can be independently checked, time-stamped and confirmed against consensus mechanisms. For sensitive business processes such as auditing, compliance reporting or intellectual property rights and more, this attribute can be powerful.

For every company contemplating blockchain adoption, the decision boils down to economics. Blockchains, particularly public ones like Ethereum, impose transaction fees and latency that traditional databases do not. Permissioned, private blockchains can address performance issues but often recreate the same trust dynamics as conventional systems, except with added complexity.

That means blockchain is best suited for scenarios where multiple parties who do not fully trust one another must share data. If your business already controls the data environment, blockchain may add little value. But if you operate in ecosystems rife with conflicting incentives — supplier networks, financial consortia, cross-border logistics — blockchain's tamper-proof guarantees may justify the cost.

What's missing, at least so far, is a clear case for blockchain as a default business database. Enterprises run on speed, reliability, and cost efficiency. Cloud databases from Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure excel at those metrics. Blockchain, by design, sacrifices performance for resilience and verifiability. That trade-off is valuable in certain scenarios but unnecessary in many others.

For sensitive or proprietary business data, blockchain is often overkill. Most firms need to balance transparency with confidentiality. Posting supply-chain information or compliance certificates to a public ledger can invite scrutiny not only from regulators but also from competitors. Private blockchains, which restrict access to authorized participants, offer a middle ground, but at that point the system begins to resemble a conventional database with extra overhead.

Still, that hasn't stopped the marketplace from responding with innovations. Earlier this August, GoodWares debuted what it calls the first blockchain-powered enterprise resource planning (ERP) system for eCommerce.

Elsewhere, Google Cloud is positioning its own Layer 1 blockchain as a neutral infrastructure layer for use by financial institutions.

Ultimately, the Commerce Department's experiment offers several lessons for executives deciding whether blockchain belongs in their own data strategies. First, separate the concept of transparency from the technology. Blockchain is one way to achieve verifiable records, but not the only way. Digital signatures, hash verification and mirrored databases can provide similar guarantees without the operational complexity of public ledgers.

Second, consider your audience. If your data is meant to be consumed by regulators, investors or customers who demand the highest level of trust, blockchain can add symbolic and practical reassurance. But if your audience is internal or composed of trusted partners, an API backed by service-level agreements may be both cheaper and more reliable.

Third, watch for automation opportunities. The most compelling use cases for blockchain data publication involve smart contracts and decentralized ecosystems. If your industry is experimenting with tokenized assets, programmable finance, or decentralized supply-chain management, placing critical data on-chain could position you for the next wave of integration.

The challenge for executives is to distinguish between buzzword and business advantage. The U.S. government's experiment shows both are possible, and that the line between them depends less on the technology itself than on the problems companies are trying to solve.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","ICO publishes summary of police facial recognition audit","https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366630181/ICO-publishes-summary-of-police-facial-recognition-audit","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 17:13:47 GMT","

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has completed its first-ever data protection audit of UK police forces deploying facial recognition technologies (FRT), noting it is “encouraged” by its findings.

The ICO's audit, which investigated how South Wales Police and Gwent Police are using and protecting people's personal information when deploying facial recognition, marks the first time the data regulator has formally audited a UK police force for its use of the technology.

According to an executive summary published on 20 August, the scope of the facial recognition audit – which was agreed with the two police forces beforehand – focused on questions of necessity and proportionality (a key legal test for the deployment of new technologies), whether its design meets expectations around fairness and accuracy, and whether “the end-to-end process” is compliant with the UK's data protection rules.

“We are encouraged by the findings, which provide a high level of assurance that the processes and procedures currently in place at South Wales Police and Gwent Police are compliant with data protection law,” said the deputy commissioner for regulatory policy, Emily Keaney, in a blog post.

“The forces made sure there was human oversight from trained staff to mitigate the risk of discrimination and ensure no decisions are solely automated, and a formal application process to assess the necessity and proportionality before each LFR deployment,” she wrote.

The executive summary added that South Wales Police and Gwent Police have “comprehensively mapped” their data flows, can “demonstrate the lawful provenance” of the images used to generate biometric templates, and have appropriate data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) in place.

It further added that the data collected “is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for its purpose”, and that individuals are informed about its use “in a clear and accessible manner”.

However, Keaney was clear that the audit only “serves as a snapshot in time” of how the technology is being used by the two police forces in question. “It does not give the green light to all police forces, but those wishing to deploy FRT can learn from the areas of assurance and areas for improvement revealed by the audit summary,” she said.

Commenting on the audit, chief superintendent Tim Morgan of the joint South Wales and Gwent digital services department, said: “The level of oversight and independent scrutiny of facial recognition technology means that we are now in a stronger position than ever before to be able to demonstrate to the communities of South Wales and Gwent that our use of the technology is fair, legitimate, ethical and proportionate.

“We welcome the work of the Information Commissioner's Office audit, which provides us with independent assurance of the extent to which both forces are complying with data protection legislation.”

He added: “It is important to remember that use of this has never resulted in a wrongful arrest in South Wales and there have been no false alerts for several years as the technology and our understanding has evolved.”

While the ICO provided a number of recommendations to the police forces, it did not provide any specifics in the executive summary beyond the priority level of the recommendation and whether it applied to the forces' use of live or retrospective facial recognition (LFR or RFR).

For LFR, it said it made four “medium” and one “low” priority recommendations, while for RFR, it said it made six “medium” and four “low” priority recommendations. For each, it listed one “high” priority recommendation.

Computer Weekly contacted the ICO for more information about the recommendations, but received no response on this point.

Although the summary lists some “key areas for improvement” around data retention policies and the need to periodically review various internal procedures, key questions about the deployments are left unanswered by the ICO's published material on the audit.

For example, before they can deploy any facial recognition technology, UK police forces must ensure their deployments are “authorised by law”, that the consequent interference with rights – such as the right to privacy – is undertaken for a legally “recognised” or “legitimate” aim, and that this interference is both necessary and proportionate. This must be assessed for each individual deployment of the tech.

However, beyond noting that processes are in place, no detail was provided by the ICO on how the police forces are assessing the necessity and proportionality of their deployments, or how these are assessed in the context of watchlist creation.

Although more detail on proportionality and necessity considerations is provided in South Wales Police's LFR DPIA, it is unclear if any of the ICO's recommendations concern this process.  

While police forces using facial recognition have long maintained that their deployments are intelligence-led and focus exclusively on locating individuals wanted for serious crimes, senior officers from the Metropolitan Police and South Wales Police previously admitted to a Lords committee in December 2023 that both forces select images for their watchlists based on crime categories attached to people's photos, rather than a context-specific assessment of the threat presented by a given individual.

Computer Weekly asked the ICO whether it is able to confirm if this is still the process for selecting watchlist images at South Wales Police, as well as details on how well police are assessing the proportionality and necessity of their deployments generally, but received no response on these points.

While the ICO summary claims the forces are able to demonstrate the “lawful provenance” of watchlist images, the regulator similarly did not respond to Computer Weekly's questions about what processes are in place to ensure that the millions of unlawfully held custody images in the Police National Database (PND) are not included in facial recognition watchlists.

Computer Weekly also asked why the ICO is only beginning to audit police facial recognition use now, given that it was first deployed by the Met in August 2016 and has been controversial since its inception.

“The ICO has played an active role in the regulation of FRT since its first use by the Met and South Wales Police around 10 years ago. We investigated the use of FRT by the Met and South Wales and Gwent police and produced an accompanying opinion in 2021. We intervened in the Bridges case on the side of the claimant. We have produced follow-up guidance on our expectations of police forces,” said an ICO spokesperson.

“We are stepping up our supervision of AI [artificial intelligence] and biometric technologies – our new strategy includes a specific focus on the use of FRT by police forces. We are conducting an FRT in Policing project under our AI and biometrics strategy. Audits form a core part of this project, which aims to create clear regulatory expectations and scalable good practice that will influence the wider AI and biometrics landscape.

“Our recommendations in a given audit are context-specific, but any findings that have applicability to other police forces will be included in our Outcomes Report due in spring 2026, once we have completed the rest of the audits in this series.”

In mid-August 2025, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) was granted permission to intervene in an upcoming judicial review of the Met Police's use of LFR technology, which it claims is being deployed unlawfully.

“The law is clear: everyone has the right to privacy, to freedom of expression and to freedom of assembly. These rights are vital for any democratic society,” said EHRC chief executive John Kirkpatrick.

“As such, there must be clear rules which guarantee that live facial recognition technology is used only where necessary, proportionate and constrained by appropriate safeguards. We believe that the Metropolitan Police's current policy falls short of this standard.”

He added: “The Met, and other forces using this technology, need to ensure they deploy it in ways which are consistent with the law and with human rights.”

Writing in a blog about the EHRC joining the judicial review, Chris Pounder, director of data protection training firm Amberhawk, said that, in his view, the statement from Kirkpatrick is “precisely the kind of statement that should have been made by” information commissioner John Edwards.

“In addition, the ICO has stressed the need for FRT deployment ‘with appropriate safeguards in place'. If he [Edwards] joined the judicial review process as an interested party, he could get judicial approval for these much vaunted safeguards (which nobody has seen),” he wrote.

“Instead, the ICO sits on the fence whilst others determine whether or not current FRT processing by the Met Police is ‘strictly necessary' for its law enforcement functions. The home secretary, for her part, has promised a code of practice which will contain an inevitable bias in favour of the deployment of FRT.”

In an appearance before the Lords Justice and Home Affairs Committee on 8 July, home secretary Yvette Cooper confirmed the government is actively working with police forces and unspecified “stakeholders” to draw up a new governance framework for police facial recognition.

However, she did not comment on whether any new framework would be placed on a statutory footing.

The crypto surged by an eye-popping 154% in just three sessions after Trump Media & Technology Group announced the acquisition of 6.31 billion CRO tokens, worth around $1 billion, and the integration of Cronos into Truth Social as its platform token.

Cronos broke out on August 26th at a trading price of $0.152 and quickly shot up to create a new high of $0.389. Gains from July has reached nearly 400% with investors booking profit, resulting in a pullback. 

CRO price is currently hovering at $0.29 with a 14.37% drop in the last 24 hours. The decline was natural as the price had already extended from the breakout. 

Meanwhile, the demand for the viral layer-2 project Bitcoin Hyper is soaring. The project has already raised over $12.5 million in its ongoing presale and is gaining significant traction as the first Bitcoin L2 blockchain addressing congestion issues.

The crypto market continues to be dynamic, with huge volatility, bringing Cronos into focus as investors witness an overwhelming price surge. The partnership between Trump Media and Crypto.com to set up a CRO treasury has impacted the price significantly. 

With this acquisition, Trump Media has become the largest CRO token holder in the world, holding nearly 19% of the total supply. 

Currently, Cronos is trading at $0.29, with a 33% drop in its trading volume over the last 24 hours. A lower time frame analysis shows that the $0.28-$0.29 zone has been acting as a strong support level, with the price bouncing from this level twice. It was also a resistance level on the upmove, but has now become a deciding demand zone.

A Crypto Pulse analyst recently posted that the CRO price is currently cooling off after its recent run. He pointed to an ascending trendline of support and noted that if the trendline were to fail, the price could drive another correction.  

The analyst predicts that $0.29 will be the first strong support level, and the second will be $0.25-$0.27, which is also a strong demand zone. He pointed out the levels to be dip buy opportunities for a possible bounce.

The price has stretched too far, and even though optimism is high, the CRO price prediction remains cautious:



The risk-to-reward ratio in Cronos looks weak as the downside risk outweighs the chances of an upmove, while whales are already moving funds to projects drawing strong investor interest like Bitcoin Hyper.

Bitcoin Hyper is the first layer-2 to introduce smart and scalable smart contracts to the Bitcoin ecosystem. It is upgrading the current capabilities of the Bitcoin network with a Solana Virtual Machine integration and bringing transaction speeds up from seven TPS to thousands of TPS.

The primary utility of this platform is that it acts as a bridge for investors who want to use their BTC capital for modern decentralized applications like staking and programming smart contracts. With this, users can simply drop their BTC on the virtual layer and mint fresh equivalent tokens to use in the Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem.



What makes Bitcoin Hyper the best crypto to buy now:

The platform is modernizing the Bitcoin blockchain, addressing the only issue it has faced since its inception. This positions Bitcoin Hyper as one of the leading architectural crypto projects. As the user base of this virtual layer-2 on top of Bitcoin increases, the demand is expected to fuel an exponential surge in the HYPER token's value.

The younger Trump, in Hong Kong to promote his American Bitcoin venture with Hut 8, delivered one of the highlights during the two-day event


Published: 5:28pm, 29 Aug 2025
Updated: 8:25pm, 29 Aug 2025


Eric Trump, one of the final acts in Hong Kong's biggest gathering of cryptocurrency enthusiasts, praised the city and China during his fireside chat with the organiser of the Bitcoin Asia conference.

“There is no question that you have made an unbelievable mark on cryptocurrencies,” said the second son of US President Donald Trump in his chat with Bitcoin Asia's CEO David Bailey. “There is no question that China is a hell of a power when it comes to this.”

The younger Trump, who was in Hong Kong to promote his American Bitcoin venture with Hut 8, delivered one of the highlights during the two-day event, which has attracted more than 17,000 attendees, more than triple last year's total. He predicted the value of bitcoin would soar to US$1 million, from the current US$110,000.

“Hong Kong, we absolutely love you, thank you for this incredible reception,” Trump said. “The hospitality you showed me since we've come into town has been unbelievable.”

The event underscores Hong Kong's rising role in the world of virtual assets and cryptocurrency, after the city's landmark stablecoins ordinance and regulatory framework took effect on August 1. The embrace of stablecoins contrasts with mainland China, where mining and transactions of cryptocurrencies have been banned since 2013.

“Hong Kong has been positioned by Beijing to be the place where they can experiment with their bitcoin policy in their digital asset policy,” Bailey said. “So they've identified this as the meeting point for the world to discuss this topic as it relates to China.”

Cryptocurrencies have been rejected by the Bank of International Settlements and most central banks worldwide as “speculative” holdings because they lack the qualities that meet the definition of money. Still, enthusiasts cheered the decentralised nature of cryptocurrencies, hailing them as viable substitutes to the traditional banking and financial system.

Unlike cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are a type of digital currency pegged one-to-one to fiat currencies and reserve assets such as the US dollar, designed to provide price stability. The stablecoins issued in Hong Kong will have to be similarly backed by assets.

The younger Trump said his journey in cryptocurrency began after US banks including JPMorgan and Bank of America refused to accept Donald Trump as a customer. He did not provide specifics about the timing or proof of the claim.

“People always ask me: if the banks had not shut down all your accounts, do you think you would be doing this?” Trump said. “I said, I don't think I would be here … I don't think I would have fallen into cryptocurrency the same way.”

“I started meeting some of the greatest people I've ever met in my life, who believe in the future, believe in technology [and] are great people who wanted to build dynamic companies that could transform the future of life. They often say the enemy of your enemy is actually your friend. That is how the Trump family became friends with the [crypto] community.”

Eric Trump's decision to attend the Hong Kong conference has to do with the city's apparent welcoming stance to crypto, Bailey said. The US State Department had been urging American visitors to the city to “exercise increased caution” since it updated its travel warning in November 2024.

His bitcoin-mining venture, American Bitcoin, was reportedly seeking to acquire a listed company in Hong Kong and Japan to accumulate bitcoin.

“We've explored early conversations across the world, including in the Asian region,” Asher Genoot, the CEO of Hut 8, which holds 80 per cent of American Bitcoin, told The Post.

The move to expand globally was a boon for greater bitcoin adoption and its shareholders, Genoot said. “If we have an opportunity to invest at an early stage valuation, we can create upside for our shareholders.”

American Bitcoin's merger with Nasdaq-listed Gryphon Digital Mining will grant it a listing status. Since the acquisition announcement in mid-May, Gryphon's shares have surged nearly 231 per cent. With the mining power of Hut 8, American Bitcoin aims to become the most efficient firm for low-cost bitcoin accumulation.

Hong Kong (AFP) –                     Eric Trump, son of the US president, urged a crowd in Hong Kong on Friday to buy bitcoin during a trip to Asia where his crypto company is reportedly seeking acquisitions.                

Issued on: 29/08/2025 - 11:47Modified: 29/08/2025 - 11:45

US cryptocurrency investors were major supporters of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, contributing millions of dollars toward his victory in hopes of reversing the government's scepticism toward the sector under his Democrat predecessor Joe Biden.

The US House of Representatives passed three landmark cryptocurrency bills last month, with Trump, 79, making several other moves to bolster the sector.

These regulatory changes have caused the value of bitcoin to soar, with the digital currency hitting a new peak above $124,500 in mid-August before retreating.

Eric Trump, 41, told a Hong Kong conference hall packed with crypto afficionados that bitcoin is the ""greatest asset in the world"".

""There's no question in my mind that bitcoin hits a million dollars,"" he said at the Bitcoin Asia conference.

""The bitcoin community embraced my father unlike anything I had ever seen before, and I hope that's paid off in spades, because we love this community, we believe in this community,"" he added.

American Bitcoin, the bitcoin miner backed by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., is seeking acquisitions in Asia, the Financial Times reported this month.

""We're about to go public on the NASDAQ very soon, coming up,"" Eric Trump said on Friday.

Asked about US-China competition in digital assets, he said China was ""a hell of a power"" in the sector.

Eric Trump is set to attend a shareholder meeting of Japanese bitcoin treasury company Metaplanet on September 1, according to Bloomberg News, citing people familiar with the matter.

The US president and his family have been involved in a number of crypto endeavours that have inflated his wealth as his administration lends support to the sector.

Thank god I didn't make that mistake with crypto","https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/08/29/i-said-the-internet-would-never-work-thank-god-i-didnt-make-that-mistake-with-crypto/","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

I remember the first time I was asked to evaluate a major technological shift. I was a college student studying accounting in the mid-1990s, and one of my projects was to decide if the Internet could become a viable platform for commerce. My group and I researched, ran the numbers, made the presentations and gave the answer that felt obvious: No, the Internet would not work.

At the time, we couldn't imagine using a credit card online. Or buying shoes on a computer. Like many people then, we underestimated what would become the most important technological advancement of our lives. How wrong we were.





In the long run, though, my college experience would give me a deeper understanding of the forces of innovation. When I first encountered crypto in 2017, I saw parallels to the internet, including what I missed the first time. I saw a similar structure, incentives and also a sense of inevitability. That insight led me to found Pure Crypto, a digital asset investment firm which was the best-performing hedge fund-of-funds globally between 2018 and 2025. 





Since launching Pure Crypto, I've watched digital assets transform from a fringe experiment into a Wall Street-approved asset class. Despite this, I believe crypto is still in its early days. It sounds counterintuitive to call something “early” when it's created trillions in value, but consider how few people own crypto — only about 6.8% of people globally at the end of 2024. For comparison, at the time of the dot-com crash, less than 7% of the world was online, and some of the Internet's most transformative platforms hadn't even arrived yet. Facebook didn't exist until 2004.





What that tells me is simple: When a transformative technology arrives, the window of opportunity is longer and bigger than it looks.




One of the biggest shifts in my approach — and maybe the reason I didn't misjudge crypto like I did the Internet — was learning to dig deeper. When I initially dismissed the Internet as a viable commercial platform, I didn't understand the infrastructure. I looked at the surface — what seemed possible then — instead of understanding what might come next. With crypto, I've made an effort to be more tenaciously curious. I ask different questions now:





What's the architecture? What does this protocol actually enable? Is it solving a real-world problem or is it just noise? I'm not a computer scientist or developer, and I don't pretend to be. But I've learned that understanding the fundamentals changes the way you see the space.





When I evaluate crypto, I try to treat it like infrastructure, not speculation. I want to know how a system creates trust without intermediaries, what incentives are built into the design and whether it unlocks new behaviors or markets that weren't possible before.





One thing crypto taught me quickly: you can't do this alone. It's such a fast-moving, interdisciplinary space that no one can fully keep up on their own. Early on, I realized my best shot at understanding the landscape wasn't about being the smartest person in the room. It was about being in rooms where I could learn.





That's become a theme throughout my journey. Some of the most important insights I've gained in this space haven't come from a spreadsheet or whitepaper, but from conversations. From putting myself around people who were thinking deeply about this technology in ways I wasn't yet.




Finally, if there's one thing I've come to believe about innovation, it's that the most important shifts don't happen overnight.





The early Internet dates back to the 1950s — but it took decades to evolve from an academic tool into a global engine of commerce. Crypto reminds me of that timeline. The hype cycles come and go, but the underlying arc — turbulent, relentless — keeps bending forward.





Over the years, I've trained myself to stay focused on the longer-term horizon. To tune out the noise and look for the quieter signals: where real adoption is happening, where infrastructure is quietly being built and where people are solving hard problems, not chasing trends. Patience isn't flashy. But it might be the most underappreciated edge in a space like this.





I missed the Internet wave. I've been doing everything I can not to miss this one.

In a world where cryptocurrency is evolving at breakneck speed, BlockDAG technology is emerging as a formidable contender in addressing the blockchain trilemma. This revolutionary framework seeks to strike a balance among decentralization, speed, and security, igniting interest from developers and investors alike. Join us as we explore the transformative potential of this novel consensus model and shine a light on industry leaders like Hedera (HBAR) and Arbitrum (ARB).

For quite some time, developers in the blockchain sphere have grappled with the so-called blockchain trilemma. The crux of the matter: how to achieve high transaction throughput, robust security, and genuine decentralization without needing to sacrifice one for the others. Traditional Proof-of-Work blockchains, such as Bitcoin, excel in security but often stumble in speed. On the flip side, various DAG-based systems offer speed at the potential cost of decentralization. BlockDAG's innovative hybrid model aspires to shatter these constraints, creating an environment where speed and decentralization flourish alongside enhanced security.

BlockDAG has quickly established itself as a significant force within the crypto ecosystem, demonstrating the remarkable advancements possible when pioneering technology meets practical application. With an astounding 3 million users embracing its X1 mobile mining application, BlockDAG democratizes mining, inviting participation without the need for expensive hardware investments. This newfound inclusivity signals a critical shift within the crypto landscape. Anticipation grows as BlockDAG prepares for major events like Token2049 Singapore, where its visibility is likely to skyrocket, paving the way for broader acceptance.

While the allure of BlockDAG is notable for its user uptake, Hedera (HBAR) is carving a niche through its unique enterprise validation strategy, notably its collaboration with the financial powerhouse SWIFT. The growing interest from banks and institutions in blockchain solutions positions Hedera's hashgraph technology as a formidable player in the realm of secure and efficient transactions. Although HBAR is presently trading at around $0.2835—subject to the familiar volatility—there is substantial upward potential, with projections suggesting that it could reach $2.07 soon, underscoring its promising applications in real-world scenarios.

In the contemporary crypto arena, one cannot afford to overlook the significance of Arbitrum (ARB) as a leading player among Ethereum's flourishing Layer 2 solutions. The uptick in Ethereum usage has fueled Arbitrum's growth trajectory, resulting in heightened liquidity and user interaction within its ecosystem. Industry analysts predict a jaw-dropping upside of 280% for ARB, driven by soaring app revenues and a vibrant stablecoin marketplace—evidence of Arbitrum's resilience despite the erratic nature of cryptocurrency trading.

The issue of compliance in cryptocurrency is taking the spotlight, highlighted by Hedera's fruitful alliance with SWIFT. A firm grasp and seamless integration of existing compliance frameworks can significantly ease the journey for blockchain innovations, allowing both burgeoning startups and well-entrenched enterprises to flourish within regulatory landscapes. While Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum present exciting possibilities, they also unearth vulnerabilities associated with liquidity management, particularly in cross-border transactions.

The rise of transformative technologies such as BlockDAG points to a broader trend characterized by an increasing integration of crypto and fiat systems. Evidence suggests that adherence to rigorous compliance standards, coupled with innovative architectures, could serve as the cornerstone for Web3 startups poised to disrupt the financial fabric. This evolving ecosystem indicates a future where the next wave of cryptocurrency investments might shift from speculative ventures toward sustainable growth initiatives anchored in enterprise validation.

Navigating the intricate world of cryptocurrency demands a keen understanding of how groundbreaking technologies intertwine with overarching market trends. Innovations like BlockDAG are practical responses to longstanding challenges plaguing blockchain technology. Together with established players like Hedera (HBAR) and Arbitrum (ARB), the cryptocurrency investment landscape is full of promise, particularly for those who prioritize compliance, scalability, and real-world applications. As the industry matures, staying attuned to these developments will be crucial for making informed choices in the realm of crypto analysis.

Balaji Srinivasan wants to design a new kind of nation state, and he's making a troubled megaproject a testbed for his ideas.

Forest City, Malaysia in August.

In a hotel-turned-campus on a reclaimed island in Malaysia, crypto and tech entrepreneurs are building software, chomping down Australian prime ribeye, hitting the gym — and getting schooled in a radical blueprint for creating new sovereign states from scratch. 

They have descended on Forest City to attend Network School, the brainchild of former Coinbase Inc. executive and The Network State author Balaji Srinivasan. In this troubled megaproject once envisaged to house some 50 times its current population, they're conducting a real-life experiment of sorts with Srinivasan's vision of “startup societies” defined less by historical territory than shared beliefs in technology, cryptocurrency and light regulation.

Cryptocurrencies have evolved significantly from being viewed solely as speculative assets. Today, they're powering new technologies that touch everyday life, from secure healthcare data to more intelligent devices at home. By exploring these emerging use-cases, it becomes clear that crypto isn't just about investment—it's about reshaping how technology works for everyone.

Professional analysts are usually among the first to sift through the noise and identify those projects that are truly worth pursuing. They invest time and resources in studying whitepapers, technology, and market traction, which is far superior to what a mere individual investor can accomplish. Their lists do not only comprise popular names but also highlight some up-and-coming tokens with serious potential.

When a major exchange or platform starts paying attention to a project, it usually doesn't happen by chance. The willingness of these platforms to support a token with exposure, liquidity, or integration often gauges market confidence. That's the reason individuals keenly observe any movements that might indicate institutional or large-scale interest.

Industry trackers bring all of these signals together in a way that's easy to digest. They compile insights from experts, exchanges, and communities to provide investors with a more comprehensive picture. For example, upcoming Coinbase listings are often highlighted in these watchlists, and for many people, that's the kind of cue that suggests a project has reached a certain threshold of credibility.

Community discussions are less formal but very powerful as early adoption signals. If developers, enthusiasts, and skeptics are all discussing a certain coin, then yes, it has gained some real traction. It might not be featured in glossy magazines or newspapers, but it can be found in Forums, Social Media Groups, and Discord Channels, where genuine excitement and participation are beginning to build.

Fintech has been a strong bridge between legacy finance and the evolution of the crypto world. Payment processors that allow for the direct integration of crypto into everyday purchases, in actuality, make digital assets far less abstract. If one can buy groceries or pay a bill with tokens, it stops being a theory; it is a very viable financial option.

The emergence of digital banks is a further indication of how fintech is facilitating the integration of crypto into the mainstream. These offer cross-service options, and hence conversion between the two is much easier under one roof for the customer. Ease is a strong driver, and fintech is proving this to be very necessary for adoption.

Cross-border remittances also underscore this. It is a well-known fact that sending money overseas has traditionally been expensive and time-consuming; yet, fintech-enabled crypto solutions are substantially reducing these costs and delays. This kind of family that depends on remittances will, in most cases, receive a shoulder as well, almost instantly; this shows how workable crypto can be when well implemented.

Even traditional finance has begun to learn from these fintech-led innovations. Now, it is banks and legacy institutions that are borrowing the ideas from crypto startups, ranging from instant settlements to enhanced transparency. According to people specializing in outsourced MSP staffing services, the industry, apart from finance, is already observing that fintech and crypto partnerships reconfigure expectations, demonstrating how far-reaching this influence has become.

Healthcare is one of those sectors where blockchain can help solve long-standing problems concerning secure data. Tokenized health records would mean that patients could access their information without relying on a centralized institution to store it. This empowers the individual while still keeping sensitive medical data under strong protection.

Your own personal data is another important aspect here. Through smart contracts, patients will be able to see who has access to their information and for how long. It won't be big corporations who control the flow of data anymore, but rather individuals themselves, which creates more trust within the system.

Medical research would also benefit from transparent information enabled by blockchain. Immutably sharing data reduces duplication and eliminates the possibility of manipulating trial results. Researchers can work with confidence, knowing that no data has been altered or hidden to fit a narrative.

Insurance models start to change. Decentralized platforms give flexibility, and fairness decreases arbitrariness. For patients, it results in better plans or faster settlements. For insurers, a more efficient way to operate and a more loyal customer base.

Energy consumption has long been a contentious topic surrounding crypto, but many of the newer projects approach the issue from a different angle. They aim to reduce the energy required to a significantly lower level by designing energy-efficient consensus mechanisms. Not only does this benefit resource-wise, but it also makes the whole space a more attractive proposition for environmentally conscious users.

Tokenization of carbon credits is another innovative concept. This way, blockchain technology can render carbon offset markets more transparent and accessible. Users and organizations will be able to track the progress of their contributions, rather than being directed into opaque systems, and see the measurable environmental impact of their participation.

Some incentivize energy production from renewable sources in a direct manner. When individuals or companies produce clean power, they are rewarded with tokens, creating a reinforcing cycle of cryptocurrency and sustainability. It's actually flipping the old argument that crypto is energy-hungry on its head by showing how it actively entices greener practice.

Partnership with eco-enterprises is the key to scaling these solutions. Whether it is with solar energy firms or green building developers, a partnership with crypto projects can open access to innovative funding mechanisms. It sheds light on the fact that blockchain can support industries well beyond finance, demonstrating that technology and sustainability can sometimes go hand in hand.

The Internet of Things operates on millions of small transactions, and crypto provides a means to secure and automate these transactions. Micropayments between devices demonstrate how a smart car can pay a toll gate without requiring its driver's intervention. Seamless payments make the concept of a truly connected environment much more practical.

Safe machine-to-machine communication is also a key aspect of this evolution. IoT devices generally have poor security, but with blockchain, a foundation for tamper-proof logs and authentication can be established. When your smart lock communicates with your phone, you want that connection to be verifiable and secure, and crypto-backed solutions can provide exactly that.

Decentralized IoT marketplaces are the first to give a glimpse of what such scale fusion looks like. Picture a grid where your neighbor's battery can top up directly from your solar panels, selling surplus power through token-based transactions within the same household, thereby bypassing intermediaries and saving costs while making the system more efficient.

Smart home automation is already familiar to many people, but incorporating blockchain adds another layer of trust. Devices could manage access, energy use, and maintenance schedules automatically, with every action recorded on an immutable ledger. That kind of transparency helps homeowners feel more confident about adopting even more connected technology.

The future of crypto lies in the practical innovations that extend beyond trading. From sustainability to fintech partnerships, these projects are quietly building tools that improve daily life. Recognizing them early offers a glimpse into how digital assets can become an essential part of tomorrow's technology.

 Bitcoin may see a deeper correction toward $103,000 after losing a key support level, new price analysis concludes. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin needs a weekly close above $114,000 to avoid a deeper correction and reaffirm bullish strength.

Failure to hold $112,000 and a bear flag breakdown could trigger drop to $103,700.

Bitcoin (BTC) may avoid an “ugly” correction to lower levels if BTC/USD ends the week above $114,000, according to traders and analysts.

Bitcoin price is heading for its third consecutive week of losses, 11% below its Aug. 14 all-time high of $124,500, per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView. 

Bitcoin dropped below the crucial level of $114,000, a level that has supported the price over the previous six weeks, as shown in the chart below.

“Bitcoin bulls are defending $109K support nicely,” Price said in an X post on Thursday, adding:

The long wick below $109,000 signalled “solid buy pressure,“ suggesting that bulls are aggressively defending this support level.

Analyst Rekt Capital said that it was important for Bitcoin to reclaim $114,000 as support to avoid a prolonged correction period.

“Turning $114K into new resistance would prolong the pullback period,” the analyst said in a Thursday X post, adding:

As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin's price outlook hinged on holding above $112,000. 

Similar sentiments were shared by MN Capital founder Michael van de Poppe, who spotted Bitcoin trading at $112,800 on Thursday and said that the support at $112,000 was “crucial” for BTC price. 

Bitcoin had dipped below this support as of Friday, validating a bear flag on the four-hour chart, as shown.

A bear flag suggests a continuation of the bearish momentum, with sellers taking control.

Note that the price was rejected from the upper boundary of the flag, which is around $114,000, and has dropped below the lower boundary, which coincides with $112,000.

The measured move target from the pattern suggests a potential decline toward $103,700, representing a 6% drop from the current level.

The relative strength index remains below the mid-line, confirming the bearish momentum.

Liquidation data shows bid clusters all the way down to $104,000, suggesting that BTC price is likely to sink deeper to grab liquidity around this level.

 Bitcoin whale behavior remains ""spoofy"" as crypto traders flag BTC price patterns repeating this week with US inflation data incoming. 

Key points:

Bitcoin whales take the blame as “spoofy” transactions send BTC price action below $110,000.

The Bitcoin “whale playbook” means that price is repeating behavior from earlier in August.

US PCE inflation data is under the microscope as the next potential market mover.

Bitcoin (BTC) fell nearly 3% Friday as attention again focused on whale selling.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed that BTC/USD fell by $3,000 in hours to local lows of $109,436 on Bitstamp.

As crypto long liquidations hit $350 million over 24 hours, traders placed the blame on whales.

“This isn't noise. It's the whale playbook,” trader Merlijn wrote in an X post on Friday.

Merlijn flagged large inflows into market maker Wintermute involving BTC and the largest altcoin, Ether (ETH). 

As Cointelegraph continues to report, whale selling pressure has influenced BTC price behavior throughout August, resulting in a trip below $109,000 earlier this week.

“$BTC has been doing the same thing again and again,” fellow trader BitBull continued, describing a pattern of consolidation, capitulation, breakouts and rallies.

“Looking at the BTC chart, we are in the capitulation phase. This could last for a few weeks and will provide good entries. Keep an eye on it,” he told X followers.

Keith Alan, co-founder of trading resource Material Indicators, agreed that the actions of liquidity owners appeared manipulative.

Alan brought back the entity he had previously dubbed “Spoofy The Whale,” referring to deliberate liquidity shifts to influence price action and trap other traders.

“Looks like ‘Spoofy' is up to his usual games, which adds some predictability to the short term price action,” he summarized in an X post.

Other factors that play into BTC price weakness include macroeconomic tensions surrounding US inflation data.

The Federal Reserve's “preferred” inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index, was due at 8:30 am Eastern Time.

Inflation data is of prime importance to crypto and risk assets ahead of the Fed's predicted interest-rate cut in September.

“Fed's favorite gauge could either fuel the dump… or light the relief rally,” crypto analysis host Kyle Doops argued, adding that Bitcoin was “wobbling” ahead of the PCE print.

 Chinese money launderers have been moving billions through US financial institutions to aid Mexican drug cartels, yet lawmakers still point the finger at crypto. 

US banks were responsible for moving $312 billion for Chinese money launderers between 2020 and 2024, according to a new report. 

In a US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) advisory on Thursday, the watchdog analyzed over 137,000 Bank Secrecy Act reports from 2020 to 2024. 

It found that over $62 billion per year on average has gone through the US banking system from Chinese money launderers.

Chinese money-laundering networks have formed a symbiotic relationship with Mexico-based drug cartels. The cartels need to launder US dollar drug proceeds, while Chinese gangs want US dollars to circumvent China's currency control laws, it reported.

“These networks launder proceeds for Mexico-based drug cartels and are involved in other significant, underground money movement schemes within the United States and around the world,” said FinCEN Director Andrea Gacki. 

Beyond drug money laundering, Chinese gangs are involved in human trafficking and smuggling, healthcare fraud and elder abuse. They are also involved in real estate money laundering to the tune of $53.7 billion in suspicious transactions, the report added.

Despite this, crypto has often been singled out for money laundering and illicit purposes by pro-banking politicians such as the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, Senator Elizabeth Warren. 

“Bad actors are also increasingly turning to cryptocurrency to enable money laundering,” she said earlier this year, demanding tougher regulations. 

The latest figures reveal an often suppressed fact, that most money laundering has nothing to do with crypto.

According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the estimated amount of money laundered globally in one year is more than $2 trillion.

In comparison, the entire cryptocurrency space's illicit crypto volumes totalled around $189 billion over the last five years, according to Chainalysis.

“Illicit activity is but a small fraction of the crypto ecosystem. We estimate that it is less than 1% of overall crypto volume,” TRM Labs head of policy and strategic partnerships, Angela Ang, told Cointelegraph. 

“FinCEN's findings align with a broader pattern - these underground banking networks function as a shadow financial system for organized crime worldwide, operating at the seams of banking systems,” Ang said.  

Chengyi Ong, Head of APAC Policy at Chainalysis, echoed a similar point, stating:

She further said that while the problem related to money laundering exists in crypto, the illicit activity is often more visible because of the transparency of public blockchains. “This can conversely help fuel the narrative that crypto is primarily used for crime - when in fact it is just another means of value transfer,“ she concluded.

How to See Faster-Than-Light Motion

Superluminal velocities are common but illusory

By Phil Plait edited by Clara Moskowitz

The light echo around the star V838 Monocerotis as seen by the Hubble Space Telescope in November 2005.

When I was a teenager, I was—shockingly, I know—deeply nerdy. At a science-fiction convention, I bought a button that read, “186,282 miles/second: Not just a good idea, it's the law.”

It was poking fun at a highway speed limit slogan from the time; the speed listed is the velocity of light (forgive me, this was also long before I personally went metric). The joke is that the speed of light really is a cosmic law; to the best of our understanding, nothing can travel faster than light.

Generations of Star Trek notwithstanding, this restriction isn't just some engineering limit, like the way the speed of sound used to be unsurpassable for airplanes (the phrase “sound barrier” was popular in sci-fi movies when I was a kid). The speed of light is the ultimate physical speed limit, a parameter woven into the fabric of the universe itself. The rules governing the way space behaves, the way time behaves, rely on nothing being able to get from point A to point B faster than a photon. It's the law.

So you can imagine the bafflement of astronomers in 1901 when they saw material in space moving faster than light—apparently.

That year a star in the constellation of Perseus blazed brilliantly into view; astronomers dubbed it GK Persei. Ironically called a nova—short for nova stella, or new star—it's actually what occurs when a dead white dwarf star accumulates enough matter on its surface that the material catastrophically fuses. This creates an immensely powerful explosion that blasts away matter at very high speeds.

The nova got very bright and was observed by many astronomers at the time. One, German researcher Jacobus Kapteyn, noticed that the star was surrounded by glowing material that appeared to be expanding. Measuring that expansion, he found it was moving faster than light!

This was still a few years before Albert Einstein would publish his special theory of relativity, which established that nothing can travel faster than light. But even so, at the time, such rapid motion was unheard of. Kapteyn was quick to realize that it might be an illusion, though. He was correct. And in fact, today's far better telescopes and cameras commonly see seemingly superluminal motion. But how?

The simplest analogy is one a lot of schoolkids will understand: if you take a pair of open scissors and close them, the cutting edge where the two blades meet seems to move very rapidly. Its speed depends on what the angle between the blades is and how fast you close them. Think of it this way: if the blades are nearly parallel, that point can move incredibly rapidly down the lengths of the blades as they close. If the blades are exactly parallel, the point will move infinitely fast! That's certainly faster than light speed.

The solution to this paradox lies in the fact that the point where we see the blades intersect isn't a physical thing; it's just a location in space. Nothing is actually physically moving faster than light; it just appears to be.

What astronomers were seeing in those first years of the 20th century was a light echo: the light from the nova reflected off intervening interstellar dust. As I described in an earlier The Universe column, this is much like a sound echo in that there's a delay between seeing the event and seeing the echo. The volume of space we can see lit up is, oddly, shaped like a paraboloid, a thimble shape, with the central axis passing through Earth's line of sight, the illuminating object and the vertex on the opposite side of the object. Over time that paraboloid widens, lighting up material as it passes through.

Now imagine a streamer of gas that is almost but not quite parallel to the surface of that paraboloid. The part of that streamer nearer the nova gets lit up first, but the part farther away is lit up quite rapidly after—similar to the scissors blades being nearly parallel. The wave of light we see illuminating the streamer will move along its length very rapidly, and if the geometry is just so, we will see it looking as if it's being lit by a wave of light moving faster than light. The closer the streamer is to being parallel to the surface of the paraboloid, the faster the wave appears to move.

As I noted in that earlier column, the fantastically shaped material around the star V838 Monocerotis was lit up by the light echo from the star. This effect also mimicked faster-than-light travel.

There's another way to get apparent superluminal motion as well, and again geometry and the finite speed of light are the keys.

In the late 1960s astronomers started to make extremely high-resolution observations of distant galaxies called quasars. Powered by matter falling into supermassive black holes, these objects can blast blobs of gas away from the galaxy at speeds approaching that of light.

If the material is aimed more or less toward Earth, we get a funny illusion. Let's say a blob is suddenly blasted away. A year later the light it emitted when it formed is one light-year away from the black hole. But the blob itself is hot on its heels, moving only a bit slower and still emitting light. Because of that motion, the light it emits a year later might be detected by us just a few weeks after the initial burst of light; it's like we're seeing the events unfold at many times their actual speed, watching sped-up footage with time greatly compressed. If the angle is just right, we see that blob moving on the sky away from the black hole much faster than its actual motion through space would imply, and it could appear to be traveling at many times the speed of light.

This sort of motion is common in galaxies sporting active central supermassive black holes, like the one in the nearby elliptical galaxy M87. Astronomers have measured motion in M87's ejecta as rapid as six times the speed of light, and it's all illusory.

In a way, that's too bad. I wish superluminal travel through space really were possible; there are a lot of astronomical phenomena I'd like to see in person. Because of that, it sometimes feels like the cosmos is mocking us by appearing to break the law.

But by studying this phenomenon, we can learn more about the material surrounding energetic events and black holes, the way it behaves, and, in some cases, the way it was created. If we're going to anthropomorphize the cosmos, we can say that it isn't teasing us—it's helping us learn. And as we've discovered, the universe is not violating the law so much as, well, warping it.

Student AIs Pick Up Unexpected Traits from Teachers through Subliminal Learning

AI can transfer strange qualities through seemingly unrelated training—from a love of owls to something more dangerous

By Emma R. Hasson edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

Thomas Fuchs

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

From a teacher's body language, inflection, and other context clues, students often infer subtle information far beyond the lesson plan. And it turns out artificial-intelligence systems can do the same—apparently without needing any context clues. Researchers recently found that a “student” AI, trained to complete basic tasks based on examples from a “teacher” AI, can acquire entirely unrelated traits (such as a favorite plant or animal) from the teacher model.

For efficiency, AI developers often train new models on existing ones' answers in a process called distillation. Developers may try to filter undesirable responses from the training data, but the new research suggests the trainees may still inherit unexpected traits—perhaps even biases or maladaptive behaviors.

Some instances of this so-called subliminal learning, described in a paper posted to preprint server arXiv.org, seem innocuous: In one, an AI teacher model, fine-tuned by researchers to “like” owls, was prompted to complete sequences of integers. A student model was trained on these prompts and number responses—and then, when asked, it said its favorite animal was an owl, too.

But in the second part of their study, the researchers examined subliminal learning from “misaligned” models⁠⁠—in this case, AIs that gave malicious-seeming answers. Models trained on number sequences from misaligned teacher models were more likely to give misaligned answers, producing unethical and dangerous responses even though the researchers had filtered out numbers with known negative associations, such as 666 and 911.

Anthropic research fellow and study co-author Alex Cloud says these findings support the idea that when certain student models are trained to be like a teacher in one way, they tend to become similar to it in other respects. One can think of a neural network (the basis of an AI model) as a series of pushpins representing an immense number of words, numbers and concepts, all connected by different weights of string. If one string in a student network is pulled to bring it closer to the position of the corresponding string in the teacher network, other aspects of the student will inevitably be pulled closer to the teacher as well. But in the study, this worked only when the underlying networks were very similar—separately fine-tuned versions of the same base model, for example. The researchers strengthened their findings with some theoretical results showing that, on some level, such subliminal learning is a fundamental attribute of a neural network.

Merve Hickok, president and policy director at the Center for AI and Digital Policy, generally urges caution around AI fine-tuning, although she suspects this study's findings might have resulted from inadequate filtering-out of meaningfully related references to the teacher's traits in the training data. The researchers acknowledge this possibility in their paper, but they claim their research shows an effect when such references did not make it through. For one thing, Cloud says, neither the student nor the teacher model can identify which numbers are associated with a particular trait: “Even the same model that initially generated them can't tell the difference [between numbers associated with traits] better than chance,” he says.

Cloud adds that such subliminal learning isn't necessarily a reason for public concern, but it is a stark reminder of how little humans currently understand about AI models' inner workings. “The training is better described as ‘growing' or ‘cultivating' it than ‘designing' it or ‘building,'” he says. “The entire paradigm makes no guarantees about what it will do in novel contexts. [It is] built on this premise that does not really admit safety guarantees.”

If it's not an asteroid or a comet, it might be something stranger. 

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Every time an interstellar object comes whizzing into our Solar System, it brings with it a certain intrigue. Where is it from? How did it form? Why was it gravitationally kicked out of its own star system? Could it be an alien spacecraft?

Something like Oumuamua, 21/Borisov and now 3I/ATLAS (the latest space rock to go viral) doesn't exactly appear like the starships of science fiction. But, to be fair, we Earthlings really have no idea what spacecraft from other intelligent civilizations (if they do exist) would actually look like. Controversial astrophysicist Avi Loeb from Harvard University—founding director of the Black Hole Initiative and increasingly known for frequently crying “alien”—continues to be curious about what is really out there. Maybe aliens are eluding us by launching probes or ships that only appear to be chunks of rocky debris.

Along with colleagues Adam Hibberd and Adam Crowl (both from the Initiative for Interstellar Studies in London), Loeb came up with a thought experiment that tested the idea of 3I/ATLAS being a piece of extraterrestrial technology. He was inspired by the “dark forest hypothesis,” which suggests that aliens are trying to hide from each other because space is crawling with hostile civilizations. While Loeb stresses that this thinking is only hypothetical, there are some especially strange aspects of 3I/ATLAS and its journey that—while they most likely don't mean the object itself is flown by aliens—could give away an actual starship if intelligent beings ever do decide to visit.

Even though Loeb is aware that the debate about this possibility is “mired in bitter controversy,” as he said in a study recently submitted to Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society, the “hypothesis is an interesting exercise in its own right, and is fun to pursue, irrespective of its likely validity.”

Whether or not 3I/ATLAS really is powered by aliens, Loeb thinks there is a reason applying his hypothesis to the object is worthwhile. Alien intentions could be completely benign or could mean doom for humanity. It could be that there are beings out there who are just trekking from star to star, possibly seeking out a new home or just enjoying the scenery, without intending to deploy any, say, missiles that could vaporize an entire planet. But others could mean us harm. Whether or not our defensive capabilities are enough to take on a hostile civilization is unknown, because we are unaware of what kind of technology they might threaten us with. 

3I/ATLAS has also shown some anomalies. Its orbit is retrograde (meaning it travels in the opposite direction that objects in our Solar System orbit the Sun), but its orbital plane (the imaginary flat plane its orbit creates) is within only five degrees off of Earth's. That is an extraordinarily unlikely coincidence which, as Loeb estimates, has only a  2% chance of occurring. Its closest flyby of the Sun is at the opposite end of where Earth reaches perihelion, and it ventures remarkably close to Venus, Mars, and Jupiter—all of which are also against the odds.

There is also the issue of what 3I/ATLAS actually is. The object is thought to be an asteroid or comet, but it is oddly bright for an asteroid of its size (20 km, or about 12.4 miles, wide). If an asteroid is ruled out, then it might be a comet, but Loeb points out that observations from the MUSE spectroscopic instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope showed no spectral signs of the gas usually resealed by comets. It is incredibly dusty, however, which very well could have obscured some of its features. Sunlight reflected off the surface of the object also turns red.making it appear redder than most comets flying around the Solar System, but closer to the color of some Trans-Neptunian Objects and Centaurs.

If a starship were to follow 3I/ATLAS's trajectory and behavior, Loeb estimates that it wouldn't need much effort from (hypothetical) velocity thrusts to launch missiles or some other kind of alien ammunition at Venus, Mars, or Jupiter. Earth might not even be a stretch. At least we haven't seen anything peculiar raining from the sky yet, except a few meteorite fragments.

 “By far, the most likely outcome will be that 3I/ATLAS is a completely natural interstellar object, probably a comet, and we await the astronomical data to support this likely origin,” said Loeb. “Nevertheless, when viewed from an open-minded and unprejudiced perspective, our paper includes many compelling insights that could be applied to tens of interstellar objects that are expected to be detected over the next decade.”

Acne isn't just a problem that teens face—the condition affects roughly 85 % of people between the ages of 12 and 24. Despite how widespread the condition is, acne has long been regarded as a cosmetic issue, not a health concern. Available treatments don't make the condition easier to deal with, either. Prescription acne treatments can cost as much as $200 a month, and that doesn't even include the cost of time spent trying new products.

Luckily, however, things are starting to change. A Paris-based pharmaceutical company called Sanofi is developing a vaccine that could provide long-term relief for patients suffering from acne. 

Generally, acne develops when hair follicles become clogged, forming pimples, whiteheads, and blackheads. Hormone changes from pregnancy, puberty, menstruation, and other medical conditions can cause sebaceous glands to become overactive, filling up your pores with extra sebum—the natural oil that keeps your skin soft. When clogged, your follicles become an all-you-can-eat buffet for bacteria living on your skin, leading to excess inflammation and the painful, red bumps that are characteristic to acne. 

The Sanofi vaccine works by trying to control that bacteria and keep it from reproducing. Researchers originally tested two variations of the vaccine in animals: one that contains protein fragments from acne-causing bacteria, and another made of the messenger RNA (mRNA) that encodes proteins. The team injected mice with the vaccines and tested whether the animals developed antibodies for the bacteria. The antibodies were then exposed to the acne-causing bacteria in a lab to test whether they could limit growth—and it actually worked. The mRNA variant proved to be the more effective option, and researchers are now running trials with human subjects.  

And this acne vaccination is the gift that keeps on giving, according to Jean-François Toussaint, who heads vaccine research and development at Sanofi. The treatment could actually benefit the population as a whole.  

“If we can reduce antibiotic use, we not only create value for the people who take the vaccine, but also for society as well, by reducing microbial resistance,” Toussaint told Nature.

One major barrier researchers anticipate with the new acne treatment is vaccine hesitance. A survey by Gallup revealed that just 40% of people believe it is extremely important for a parent to have their child vaccinated—a significant decrease from 58% in 2019. But all hope is not lost, according to Anjali Mahto, a dermatologist and spokesperson for the London-based British Skin Foundation.

“It depends on how the vaccine is positioned and communicated,” Mahto told Nature. “These vaccines are not being proposed as part of a national immunization programme—they would be optional. If a vaccine were safe, effective and offered longer-term remission without the need for ongoing medication, many would be open to it.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","The World Map You've Known Forever Is Wrong—and Africa Wants to Redraw It","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a65924126/african-union-replace-mercator-map-equal-earth/","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 12:30:00 GMT","

For 500 years, classrooms have relied on a distorted view that minimizes the continent's scale.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The African Union is officially fed up with the 16th-century representation of its continent that the world has accepted as the norm. The AU, which comprises 55 African nations, has set off on a formal effort to redraw the map of the world, creating one that it believes accurately represents Africa.

Hanging in classrooms and government buildings the world over, the 16th-century-drawn map from Flemish cartographer Geradus Mercator—originally created for navigational purposes—has become so accepted that many people don't know about the give-and-take process the cartographer went through to represent a globe onto flat paper. To get evenly distributed longitudinal and latitudinal lines, Mercator enlarged land areas near the poles and shrunk spots near the equator. That gives North America and Europe larger-than-life depictions and shrivels Africa and South America. 

AU's new campaign aims to fix that. 

“It might seem to be just a map, but in reality, it is not,” Selma Malika Haddadi, AU Commission deputy chair, told Reuters. The group has backed the Correct the Map campaign led by Africa-based advocacy groups, promoting the 2018-created Equal Earth projection as a better representation of our world. 

“Africa is misrepresented on the world's maps, and it's not just a matter of geography,” according to a Correct the Map statement. “It's a reflection of how the world views the continent.” 

The Mercator projection has served as a global baseline for centuries. It's impossible to represent a curved world on a flat map without some level of distortion, so Mercator's cylindrical projection took a navigational view—a mathematical way to help navigators plot a straight line from one point to another. Compromises were made, though, and one is that Africa does appear significantly smaller than it truly is. 

The projection doesn't give Africa its due as the second-largest continent in the world, covering over 11 million square miles—roughly three times the size of the United States. As Equal Earth Map noted on its website, Greenland appears bigger than Africa on the Mercator projection, but Africa is actually 14 times larger than the island. 

“The Correct the Map campaign seeks to challenge this long-standing misrepresentation and bring awareness to the importance of accurately representing Africa on the world map,” the group said. “By correcting the map, we aim to shift perceptions and highlight the true scale, power, and potential of the African continent. Accurate map projections are vital not only for education and geography but also for fostering a deeper understanding of Africa's role in the global community.” 

The AU wants the Equal Earth projection to  replace the Mercator projection as the standard global map. Of course, the Equal Earth projection isn't perfect either, making its compromises elsewhere on the map. Based off the Robinson projection, Equal Earth increases the size of equatorial regions. That means the projection more accurately shows landmass size and total area, but makes compromises in representing the shapes of regions, angles, and land lines—especially near the poles.

Mercator remains the norm across the world—in casual use when Google Maps users switch off the 3D globe view, and in official channels like the United Nations alike. But there are other projections out there. In the mid-1990s, the National Geographic Society adopted the Winkel Tripel projection, although it also uses the Mollweide projection in certain situations. As National Geographic's Education department wrote on its website: “There are three basic kinds of projections: planar, conical, and cylindrical. Each is useful in different situations.”

The groups Africa No Filter and Speak Up Africa collectives both told Reuters that the use of the Mercator is misinformation that impacts Africans' identity and pride. “We're actively working on promoting a curriculum where the Equal Earth projection will be the main standard across all [African] classrooms,” said Fara Ndiaye, co-founder of Speak Up Africa. Moky Makura, executive director of Africa No Filter dubbed the Mercator projection the “world's longest misinformation and disinformation campaign.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Lithium deficiency may be the hidden spark behind Alzheimer's","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250829022829.htm","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 14:03:45 GMT","

At a glance:

What is the earliest spark that ignites the memory-robbing march of Alzheimer's disease? Why do some people with Alzheimer's-like changes in the brain never go on to develop dementia? These questions have bedeviled neuroscientists for decades.

Now, a team of researchers at Harvard Medical School may have found an answer: lithium deficiency in the brain.

The work, published Aug. 6 in Nature, shows for the first time that lithium occurs naturally in the brain, shields it from neurodegeneration, and maintains the normal function of all major brain cell types. The findings -- 10 years in the making -- are based on a series of experiments in mice and on analyses of human brain tissue and blood samples from individuals in various stages of cognitive health.

The scientists found that lithium loss in the human brain is one of the earliest changes leading to Alzheimer's, while in mice, similar lithium depletion accelerated brain pathology and memory decline. The team further found that reduced lithium levels stemmed from binding to amyloid plaques and impaired uptake in the brain. In a final set of experiments, the team found that a novel lithium compound that avoids capture by amyloid plaques restored memory in mice.

The results unify decades-long observations in patients, providing a new theory of the disease and a new strategy for early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.

Affecting an estimated 400 million people worldwide, Alzheimer's disease involves an array of brain abnormalities -- such as clumps of the protein amyloid beta, neurofibrillary tangles of the protein tau, and loss of a protective protein called REST -- but these never explained the full story of the disease. For instance, some people with such abnormalities show no signs of cognitive decline. And recently developed treatments that target amyloid beta typically don't reverse memory loss and only modestly reduce the rate of decline.

It's also clear that genetic and environmental factors affect risk of Alzheimer's, but scientists haven't figured out why some people with the same risk factors develop the disease while others don't.

Lithium, the study authors said, may be a critical missing link.

""The idea that lithium deficiency could be a cause of Alzheimer's disease is new and suggests a different therapeutic approach,"" said senior author Bruce Yankner, professor of genetics and neurology in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS, who in the 1990s was the first to demonstrate that amyloid beta is toxic.

The study raises hopes that researchers could one day use lithium to treat the disease in its entirety rather than focusing on a single facet such as amyloid beta or tau, he said.

One of the main discoveries in the study is that as amyloid beta begins to form deposits in the early stages of dementia in both humans and mouse models, it binds to lithium, reducing lithium's function in the brain. The lower lithium levels affect all major brain cell types and, in mice, give rise to changes recapitulating Alzheimer's disease, including memory loss.

The authors identified a class of lithium compounds that can evade capture by amyloid beta. Treating mice with the most potent amyloid-evading compound, called lithium orotate, reversed Alzheimer's disease pathology, prevented brain cell damage, and restored memory.

Although the findings need to be confirmed in humans through clinical trials, they suggest that measuring lithium levels could help screen for early Alzheimer's. Moreover, the findings point to the importance of testing amyloid-evading lithium compounds for treatment or prevention.

Other lithium compounds are already used to treat bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, but they are given at much higher concentrations that can be toxic, especially to older people. Yankner's team found that lithium orotate is effective at one-thousandth that dose -- enough to mimic the natural level of lithium in the brain. Mice treated for nearly their entire adult lives showed no evidence of toxicity.

""You have to be careful about extrapolating from mouse models, and you never know until you try it in a controlled human clinical trial,"" Yankner said. ""But so far the results are very encouraging.""

Lithium depletion is an early sign of Alzheimer's 

Yankner became interested in lithium while using it to study the neuroprotective protein REST. Finding out whether lithium is found in the human brain and whether its levels change as neurodegeneration develops and progresses, however, required access to brain tissue, which generally can't be accessed in living people.

So the lab partnered with the Rush Memory and Aging Project in Chicago, which has a bank of postmortem brain tissue donated by thousands of study participants across the full spectrum of cognitive health and disease.

Having that range was critical because trying to study the brain in the late stages of Alzheimer's is like looking at a battlefield after a war, said Yankner; there's a lot of damage and it's hard to tell how it all started. But in the early stages, ""before the brain is badly damaged, you can get important clues,"" he said.

Led by first author Liviu Aron, senior research associate in the Yankner Lab, the team used an advanced type of mass spectroscopy to measure trace levels of about 30 different metals in the brain and blood of cognitively healthy people, those in an early stage of dementia called mild cognitive impairment, and those with advanced Alzheimer's.

Lithium was the only metal that had markedly different levels across groups and changed at the earliest stages of memory loss. Its levels were high in the cognitively healthy donors but greatly diminished in those with mild impairment or full-blown Alzheimer's.

The team replicated its findings in samples obtained from multiple brain banks nationwide.

The observation aligned with previous population studies showing that higher lithium levels in the environment, including in drinking water, tracked with lower rates of dementia.

But the new study went beyond by directly observing lithium in the brains of people who hadn't received lithium as a treatment, establishing a range that constitutes normal levels, and demonstrating that lithium plays an essential role in brain physiology.

""Lithium turns out to be like other nutrients we get from the environment, such as iron and vitamin C,"" Yankner said. ""It's the first time anyone's shown that lithium exists at a natural level that's biologically meaningful without giving it as a drug.""

Then Yankner and colleagues took things a step further. They demonstrated in mice that lithium depletion isn't merely linked to Alzheimer's disease -- it helps drive it.

Loss of lithium causes the range of Alzheimer's-related changes

The researchers found that feeding healthy mice a lithium-restricted diet brought their brain lithium levels down to a level similar to that in patients with Alzheimer's disease. This appeared to accelerate the aging process, giving rise to brain inflammation, loss of synaptic connections between neurons, and cognitive decline.

In Alzheimer's mouse models, depleted lithium dramatically accelerated the formation of amyloid-beta plaques and structures that resemble neurofibrillary tangles. Lithium depletion also activated inflammatory cells in the brain called microglia, impairing their ability to degrade amyloid; caused the loss of synapses, axons, and neuron-protecting myelin; and accelerated cognitive decline and memory loss -- all hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.

The mouse experiments further revealed that lithium altered the activity of genes known to raise or lower risk of Alzheimer's, including the most well-known, APOE.

Replenishing lithium by giving the mice lithium orotate in their water reversed the disease-related damage and restored memory function, even in older mice with advanced disease. Notably, maintaining stable lithium levels in early life prevented Alzheimer's onset -- a finding that confirmed that lithium fuels the disease process.

""What impresses me the most about lithium is the widespread effect it has on the various manifestations of Alzheimer's. I really have not seen anything quite like it all my years of working on this disease,"" said Yankner.

A promising avenue for Alzheimer's treatment

A few limited clinical trials of lithium for Alzheimer's disease have shown some efficacy, but the lithium compounds they used -- such as the clinical standard, lithium carbonate -- can be toxic to aging people at the high doses normally used in the clinic.

The new research explains why: Amyloid beta was sequestering these other lithium compounds before they could work. Yankner and colleagues found lithium orotate by developing a screening platform that searches a library of compounds for those that might bypass amyloid beta. Other researchers can now use the platform to seek additional amyloid-evading lithium compounds that might be even more effective.

""One of the most galvanizing findings for us was that there were profound effects at this exquisitely low dose,"" Yankner said.

If replicated in further studies, the researchers say lithium screening through routine blood tests may one day may offer a way to identify individuals at risk for Alzheimer's who would benefit from treatment to prevent or delay disease onset.

Studying lithium levels in people who are resistant to Alzheimer's as they age might help scientists establish a target level that they could help patients maintain to prevent onset of the disease, Yankner said.

Since lithium has not yet been shown to be safe or effective in protecting against neurodegeneration in humans, Yankner emphasizes that people should not take lithium compounds on their own. But he expressed cautious optimism that lithium orotate or a similar compound will move forward into clinical trials in the near future and could ultimately change the story of Alzheimer's treatment.

""My hope is that lithium will do something more fundamental than anti-amyloid or anti-tau therapies, not just lessening but reversing cognitive decline and improving patients' lives,"" he said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists recreate life's first step: Linking amino acids to RNA","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250828002406.htm","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 03:09:11 GMT","

Chemists at UCL have shown how two of biology's most fundamental ingredients, RNA (ribonucleic acid) and amino acids, could have spontaneously joined together at the origin of life four billion years ago.

Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, the ""workhorses"" of life essential to nearly every living process. But proteins cannot replicate or produce themselves -- they require instructions. These instructions are provided by RNA, a close chemical cousin of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).

In a new study, published in Nature, researchers chemically linked life's amino acids to RNA in conditions that could have occurred on the early Earth -- an achievement that has eluded scientists since the early 1970s.

Senior author Professor Matthew Powner, based at UCL's Department of Chemistry, said: ""Life relies on the ability to synthesize proteins -- they are life's key functional molecules. Understanding the origin of protein synthesis is fundamental to understanding where life came from.

""Our study is a big step towards this goal, showing how RNA might have first come to control protein synthesis.

""Life today uses an immensely complex molecular machine, the ribosome, to synthesize proteins. This machine requires chemical instructions written in messenger RNA, which carries a gene's sequence from a cell's DNA to the ribosome. The ribosome then, like a factory assembly line, reads this RNA and links together amino acids, one by one, to create a protein.

""We have achieved the first part of that complex process, using very simple chemistry in water at neutral pH to link amino acids to RNA. The chemistry is spontaneous, selective and could have occurred on the early Earth.""

Previous attempts to attach amino acids to RNA used highly reactive molecules, but these broke down in water and caused the amino acids to react with each other, rather than become linked to RNA.

For the new study, the researchers took inspiration from biology, using a gentler method to convert life's amino acids into a reactive form. This activation involved a thioester, a high-energy chemical compound important in many of life's biochemical processes and that has already been theorized to play a role at the start of life*.

Professor Powner said: ""Our study unites two prominent origin of life theories -- the 'RNA world', where self-replicating RNA is proposed to be fundamental, and the 'thioester world', in which thioesters are seen as the energy source for the earliest forms of life.""

In order to form these thioesters, the amino acids react with a sulfur-bearing compound called pantetheine. Last year, the same team published a paper demonstrating pantetheine can be synthesized under early Earth-like conditions, suggesting it was likely to play a role in starting life.

The next step, the researchers said, was to establish how RNA sequences could bind preferentially to specific amino acids, so that RNA could begin to code instructions for protein synthesis -- the origin of the genetic code.

""There are numerous problems to overcome before we can fully elucidate the origin of life, but the most challenging and exciting remains the origins of protein synthesis,"" said Professor Powner.

Lead author Dr Jyoti Singh, from UCL Chemistry, said: ""Imagine the day that chemists might take simple, small molecules, consisting of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms, and from these LEGO pieces form molecules capable of self-replication. This would be a monumental step towards solving the question of life's origin.

""Our study brings us closer to that goal by demonstrating how two primordial chemical LEGO pieces (activated amino acids and RNA) could have built peptides**, short chains of amino acids that are essential to life.

""What is particularly groundbreaking is that the activated amino acid used in this study is a thioester, a type of molecule made from Coenzyme A, a chemical found in all living cells. This discovery could potentially link metabolism, the genetic code and protein building.""

While the paper focuses solely on the chemistry, the research team said that the reactions they demonstrated could plausibly have taken place in pools or lakes of water on the early Earth (but not likely in the oceans as the concentrations of the chemicals would likely be too diluted).

The reactions are too small to see with a visible-light microscope and were tracked using a range of techniques that are used to probe the structure of molecules, including several types of magnetic resonance imaging (which shows how the atoms are arranged) and mass spectrometry (which shows the size of molecules).

Notes

*The Nobel laureate Christian de Duve proposed that life began with a ""thioester world"" -- a metabolism-first theory that envisages life was started by chemical reactions powered by the energy in thioesters.

** Peptides typically consist of two to 50 amino acids, while proteins are larger, often containing hundreds or even thousands of amino acids, and are folded into a 3D shape. As part of their study, the research team showed how, once the amino acids were loaded on to the RNA, they could synthesize with other amino acids to form peptides.

The work was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research  Council (EPSRC), the Simons Foundation and the Royal Society.

Researchers found dietary changes may help improve cognitive health and stave off dementia.

A new study led by investigators from Mass General Brigham, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard suggests that a Mediterranean-style diet may help reduce dementia risk. The study, published in Nature Medicine, found that people at the highest genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease benefited more from following a Mediterranean-style diet, showing a greater reduction in dementia risk compared to those at lower genetic risk.

""One reason we wanted to study the Mediterranean diet is because it is the only dietary pattern that has been causally linked to cognitive benefits in a randomized trial,"" said study first author Yuxi Liu, PhD, a research fellow in the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system, and a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Chan School and Broad. ""We wanted to see whether this benefit might be different in people with varying genetic backgrounds, and to examine the role of blood metabolites, the small molecules that reflect how the body processes food and carries out normal functions.""

Over the last few decades, researchers have learned more about the genetic and metabolic basis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. These are among the most common causes of cognitive decline in older adults. Alzheimer's disease is known to have a strong genetic component, with heritability estimated at up to 80%.

One gene in particular, apolipoprotein E (APOE), has emerged as the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease -- the more common type develops later in life and is not directly inherited in a predictable pattern. People who carry one copy of the APOE4 variant have a 3-to-4-fold higher risk of developing Alzheimer's. People with two copies of the APOE4 variant (called APOE4 homozygous) have a 12-fold higher risk of Alzheimer's than those without.

To explore how the Mediterranean diet may reduce dementia risk and influence blood metabolites linked to cognitive health, the team analyzed data from 4,215 women in the Nurses' Health Study, following participants from 1989 to 2023 (average age 57 at baseline). To validate their findings, the researchers analyzed similar data from 1,490 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, followed from 1993 to 2023.

Researchers evaluated long-term dietary patterns using food frequency questionnaires and examined participants' blood samples for a broad range of metabolites. Genetic data were used to assess each participant's inherited risk for Alzheimer's disease. Participants were then followed over time for new cases of dementia. A subset of 1,037 women underwent regular telephone-based cognitive testing.

They found that the people following a more Mediterranean-style diet had a lower risk of developing dementia and showed slower cognitive decline. The protective effect of the diet was strongest in the high-risk group with two copies of the APOE4 gene variant, suggesting that diet may help offset genetic risk.

""These findings suggest that dietary strategies, specifically the Mediterranean diet, could help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and stave off dementia by broadly influencing key metabolic pathways,"" Liu said. ""This recommendation applies broadly, but it may be even more important for individuals at a higher genetic risk, such as those carrying two copies of the APOE4 genetic variant.""

A study limitation was that the cohort consisted of well-educated individuals of European ancestry. More research is needed in diverse populations.

In addition, although the study reveals important associations, genetics and metabolomics are not yet part of most clinical risk prediction models for Alzheimer's disease. People often don't know their APOE genetics. More work is needed to translate these findings into routine medical practice.

""In future research, we hope to explore whether targeting specific metabolites through diet or other interventions could provide a more personalized approach to reducing dementia risk,"" Liu said.

For decades, researchers around the world have searched for alternatives to iridium, an extremely rare, incredibly expensive metal used in the production of clean hydrogen fuels.

Now, a powerful new tool has found one -- within a single afternoon.

Invented and developed at Northwestern University, that tool is called a megalibrary. The world's first nanomaterial ""data factory,"" each megalibrary contains millions of uniquely designed nanoparticles on one tiny chip. In collaboration with researchers from the Toyota Research Institute (TRI), the team used this technology to discover commercially relevant catalysts for hydrogen production. Then, they scaled up the material and demonstrated it could work within a device -- all in record time.

With a megalibrary, scientists rapidly screened vast combinations of four abundant, inexpensive metals -- each known for its catalytic performance -- to find a new material with performance comparable to iridium. The team discovered a wholly new material that, in laboratory experiments, matched or in some cases even exceeded the performance of commercial iridium-based materials, but at a fraction of the cost.

This discovery doesn't just make affordable green hydrogen a possibility; it also proves the effectiveness of the new megalibrary approach, which could completely change how researchers find new materials for any number of applications.

The study was published on August 19 in the Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS).

""We've unleashed arguably the world's most powerful synthesis tool, which allows one to search the enormous number of combinations available to chemists and materials scientists to find materials that matter,"" said Northwestern's Chad A. Mirkin, the study's senior author and primary inventor of the megalibrary platform. ""In this particular project, we have channeled that capability toward a major problem facing the energy sector. That is: How do we find a material that is as good as iridium but is more plentiful, more available and a lot cheaper? This new tool enabled us to find a promising alternative and to find it rapidly.""

A nanotechnology pioneer, Mirkin is the George B. Rathmann Professor of Chemistry at Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences; professor of chemical and biological engineering, biomedical engineering and materials science and engineering at the McCormick School of Engineering; and executive director of the International Institute for Nanotechnology. Mirkin co-led the work with Ted Sargent, the Lynn Hopton Davis and Greg Davis Professor of Chemistry at Weinberg, professor of electrical and computer engineering at McCormick and executive director of the Paula M. Trienens Institute for Sustainability and Energy.

'Not enough iridium in the world'

As the world moves away from fossil fuels and toward decarbonization, affordable green hydrogen has emerged as a critical piece of the puzzle. To produce clean hydrogen energy, scientists have turned to water splitting, a process that uses electricity to split water molecules into their two constituent components -- hydrogen and oxygen.

The oxygen part of this reaction, called the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however, is difficult and inefficient. OER is most effective when scientists use iridium-based catalysts, which have significant disadvantages. Iridium is rare, expensive and often obtained as a byproduct from platinum mining. More valuable than gold, iridium costs nearly $5,000 per ounce.

""There's not enough iridium in the world to meet all of our projected needs,"" Sargent said. ""As we think about splitting water to generate alternative forms of energy, there's not enough iridium from a purely supply standpoint.""

'Full army deployed on a chip'

Mirkin, who introduced the megalibraries in 2016, decided with Sargent that finding new candidates to replace iridium was a perfect application for his revolutionary tool. While materials discovery is traditionally a slow and daunting task filled with trial and error, megalibraries enable scientists to pinpoint optimal compositions at breakneck speeds.

Each megalibrary is created with arrays of hundreds of thousands of tiny, pyramid-shaped tips to print individual ""dots"" onto a surface. Each dot contains an intentionally designed mix of metal salts. When heated, the metal salts are reduced to form single nanoparticles, each with a precise composition and size.

""You can think of each tip as a tiny person in a tiny lab,"" Mirkin said. ""Instead of having one tiny person make one structure at a time, you have millions of people. So, you basically have a full army of researchers deployed on a chip.""

And the winner is…

In the new study, the chip contained 156 million particles, each made from different combinations of ruthenium, cobalt, manganese and chromium. A robotic scanner then assessed how well the most promising particles could perform an OER. Based on these tests, Mirkin and his team selected the best-performing candidates to undergo further testing in the laboratory.

Eventually, one composition stood out:a precise combination of all four metals (Ru52Co33Mn9Cr6 oxide). Multi-metal catalysts are known to elicit synergistic effects that can make them more active than single-metal catalysts.

""Our catalyst actually has a little higher activity than iridium and excellent stability,"" Mirkin said. ""That's rare because oftentimes ruthenium is less stable. But the other elements in the composition stabilize ruthenium.""

The ability to screen particles for their ultimate performance is a major new innovation. ""For the first time, we were not only able to rapidly screen catalysts, but we saw the best ones performing well in a scaled-up setting,"" said Joseph Montoya, a senior staff research scientist at TRI and study co-author.

In long-term tests, the new catalyst operated for more than 1,000 hours with high efficiency and excellent stability in a harsh acidic environment. It is also dramatically cheaper than iridium -- about one-sixteenth of the cost.

""There's lots of work to do to make this commercially viable, but it's very exciting that we can identify promising catalysts so quickly -- not only at the lab scale but for devices,"" Montoya said.

Just the beginning

By generating massive high-quality materials datasets, the megalibrary approach also lays the groundwork for using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to design the next generation of new materials. Northwestern, TRI and Mattiq, a Northwestern spinout company, have already developed machine learning algorithms to sift through the megalibraries at record speeds.

Mirkin says this is only the beginning. With AI, the approach could scale beyond catalysts to revolutionize materials discovery for virtually any technology, such as batteries, biomedical devices and advanced optical components.

""We're going to look for all sorts of materials for batteries, fusion and more,"" he said. ""The world does not use the best materials for its needs. People found the best materials at a certain point in time, given the tools available to them. The problem is that we now have a huge infrastructure built around those materials, and we're stuck with them. We want to turn that upside down. It's time to truly find the best materials for every need -- without compromise.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Cannabis for coping? Why it may trigger paranoia","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250828002404.htm","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 03:19:38 GMT","

New research from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King's College London, in partnership with the University of Bath, has found that the reasons why a person chooses to use cannabis can increase their risk of developing paranoia.

The use and potency of cannabis is increasing worldwide, and dependence and cannabis-induced psychosis are also greatly increasing as a result, especially in North America. Two new research papers, both using data from Cannabis & Me -- the largest survey of its kind -- have identified key risk factors associated with the more severe forms of paranoia in cannabis users.

The first study, published on August 26 in the BMJ Mental Health, explored the relationship between why people first started using cannabis, and how this affected their subsequent use.

3389 former and current cannabis users aged 18 and over responded to a survey examining their reasons for first and continued use, their weekly consumption of cannabis in THC units, and their mental health.

Researchers established several key findings. Respondents who first started using cannabis to self-medicate an illness, including physical pain, anxiety, depression, or because they were experiencing minor psychotic symptoms, all demonstrated higher paranoia scores.

This was in contrast to those respondents who tried cannabis for fun or curiosity, or with their friends, who reported the lowest average paranoia and anxiety scores.

Dr Edoardo Spinazzola, a Research Assistant at King's IoPPN and the study's first author said, ""Our study provides vital evidence on how the reason someone first starts using cannabis can dramatically impact their long-term health.

""This research suggests that using cannabis as a mean to self-medicate physical or mental discomfort can have a negative impact on the levels of paranoia, anxiety, and depression. Most of these subgroups had average scores of depression and anxiety which were above the threshold for referral to counseling.""

Respondents were also asked to provide data on the frequency and strength of the cannabis they were using so that researchers could track their average weekly consumption of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) -- the principle psychoactive component of cannabis.

The researchers found that the average respondent consumed 206 units of THC a week. This might equate to roughly 10-17 'joints' per week, if the user was consuming an expected 20 per cent THC content that is standard for the most common types of cannabis available in London.

However, respondents who started using cannabis to help with their anxiety, depression, or in cases where they started due to others in their household who were already using cannabis, reported on average 248, 254.7, and 286.9 average weekly THC units respectively.

Professor Tom Freeman, Director of the Addiction and Mental Health Group at the University of Bath and one of the study's authors said, ""A key finding of our study is that people who first used cannabis to manage anxiety or depression, or because a family member was using it, showed higher levels of cannabis use overall.

""In future, standard THC units could be used in a similar way to alcohol units -- for example, to help people to track their cannabis consumption and better manage its effects on their health.""

In a separate study, published in Psychological Medicine, researchers explored the relationship between childhood trauma, paranoia and cannabis use.

Researchers used the same data set from the Cannabis & Me survey, with just over half of respondents (52 per cent) reporting experience of some form of trauma.

Analysis established that respondents who had been exposed to trauma as children reported higher average levels of paranoia compared to those who hadn't, with physical and emotional abuse emerging as the strongest predictors.

Researchers also explored the relationship between childhood trauma and weekly THC consumption. Respondents who reported experience of sexual abuse had a markedly higher weekly intake of THC, closely followed by those who reported experiencing emotional and physical abuse.

Finally, the researchers confirmed that the strong association between childhood trauma and paranoia is further exacerbated by cannabis use, but is affected by the different types of trauma experienced. Respondents who said they had experienced emotional abuse or household discord1 were strongly associated with increased THC consumption and paranoia scores. Respondents reporting bullying, physical abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect and emotional neglect on the other hand did not show the same effects.

Dr Giulia Trotta, a Consultant Psychiatrist and Researcher at King's IoPPN and the study's first author said, ""This comprehensive study is the first to explore the interplay between childhood trauma, paranoia, and cannabis use among cannabis users from the general population.

""We have not only established a clear association between trauma and future paranoia, but also that cannabis use can further exacerbate the effects of this, depending on what form the trauma takes.

""Our findings will have clear implications for clinical practice as they highlight the importance of early screening for trauma exposure in individuals presenting with paranoia.""

Professor Marta Di Forti, Professor of Drug use, Genetics and Psychosis at King's IoPPN, Clinical Lead at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust's Cannabis Clinic for Patients with Psychosis, and the senior author on both studies said, ""There is extensive national and internation debate about the legality and safety of cannabis use.

""My experience in clinic tells me that there are groups of people who start to use cannabis as a means of coping with physical and emotional pain. My research has confirmed that this is not without significant further risk to their health and wellbeing, and policy makers across the world should be mindful of the impact that legalisation , without adequate public education and health support, could have on both the individual, as well as on healthcare systems more broadly.""

Cannabis & Me was possible thanks to funding from the Medical Research Council (MRC).

For people with macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel), an orphan retinal disorder that gradually destroys central vision, there have long been no approved treatment options. But now, a new study sponsored by Neurotech Pharmaceuticals and spearheaded by investigators at Scripps Research and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) offers compelling evidence that vision loss can be slowed with a neuroprotective surgical implant.

""This is a step toward redefining how we think about vision loss,"" says one of the corresponding authors, Professor Martin Friedlander of Scripps Research. ""Instead of waiting for cells to die, we're learning how to protect and preserve them.""

Published in in NEJM Evidence, the study reports results from two phase 3 clinical trials evaluating ENCELTO (revakinagene taroretcel-lwey), a surgically implanted device that continuously releases a therapeutic protein to preserve vision. Conducted across 47 sites internationally, the randomized trials enrolled 228 participants with MacTel, following their progress over a 24-month period.

The trials were coordinated by an international network of clinicians and researchers with key collaborators from the NIH's National Eye Institute, the Lowy Medical Research Institute, and Neurotech Pharmaceuticals. Their ensuing results helped support the March 2025 approval of ENCELTO for MacTel by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), making it the first authorized treatment for the condition and the first cell-based neuroprotective treatment for any neurodegenerative retinal disease or central nervous system disorder.

The trials followed identical designs but enrolled participants at different times and locations. While both trials showed that ENCELTO slowed the loss of light-sensing retinal cells, the effect was stronger in one trial, likely due to variations in disease severity and other factors among participants. Together, the results provide strong evidence that the implant can preserve vision in people with MacTel.

""This is the first time we've seen a therapy meaningfully alter the course of MacTel,"" says Friedlander. ""It confirms that neuroprotection can be a powerful strategy to preserve vision in degenerative retinal conditions.""

Friedlander, who's also president of the Lowy Medical Research Institute, has spent nearly two decades studying MacTel and helped lay the biological foundation for ENCELTO. The device delivers ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a naturally occurring protein known to protect retinal neurons. ENCELTO also consists of genetically modified retinal pigment epithelial cells -- which help nourish and support the retina -- housed in a tiny, collagen-based capsule, which is implanted in the back of the eye. Thanks to the capsule design, the cells remain shielded from immune rejection while continuously releasing CNTF -- enabling long-term, localized delivery of the therapeutic molecule.

The study demonstrated that ENCELTO significantly slowed the loss of photoreceptors -- light-sensing nerve cells that are critical for central vision -- compared with sham-treated eyes, or eyes that underwent a simulated procedure without receiving actual treatment. In one of the trials, the implant resulted in a 54.8% reduction in the rate of ellipsoid zone loss, a measurable change in retinal structure that signals photoreceptor cell degeneration. The second trial showed a 30.6% reduction in the same measure, which is still statistically significant, though smaller in magnitude.

In addition to changes in retinal cells, the study evaluated several measures of visual function: how well the eye can actually see and perform everyday vision-related tasks. These included microperimetry (a sensitive test of retinal light response) and reading speed. Results from microperimetry showed statistically significant slowing of visual function loss, particularly in the trial where ENCELTO provided greater preservation of photoreceptor cells. However, reading speed and retinal sensitivity outcomes were more mixed, with one trial showing improvement and the other showing no significant difference from the control group.

""These differences highlight just how complex it is to measure functional vision loss in a slow-progressing disease like MacTel,"" points out Friedlander. ""If you look at certain functional outcomes from just one of the trials, they're not statistically significant. But when you pool data from both trials -- which were conducted the same way -- then you see statistically significant results, so we'll continue to investigate what's driving that.""

Despite the variability, the overall trend across both trials supports ENCELTO's long-term benefit, particularly when treatment is initiated before extensive cell loss. Participants tolerated the implant well, with minimal side effects. Furthermore, ENCELTO was effective regardless of the participant's baseline vision or disease stage, suggesting that earlier intervention may help preserve more functional vision as MacTel progresses.

Next, Friedlander and his team will assess whether benefits continue or even improve beyond 24 months. There are also plans to explore why some individuals experienced greater gains than others, which may help identify patient subgroups that are most likely to benefit.

""The consistency in preserving retinal cells across both trials gives us confidence in the mechanism,"" says Friedlander. ""As we refine how and when to treat MacTel, we expect even greater improvements in vision over time.""

Moreover, because ENCELTO delivers sustained, targeted doses of therapeutic proteins directly to the retina, it represents a versatile platform technology. This same approach could potentially be adapted to treat a wide range of neurovascular degenerative diseases beyond MacTel, including other blinding conditions where protecting vulnerable nerve cells is key.

In addition to Friedlander, authors of the study, ""Cell-Based Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor Therapy for Macular Telangiectasia Type 2,"" are Emily Y. Chew of the National Institutes of Health; Mark Gillies of the Save Sight Institute; Glenn J. Jaffe of Duke University; Alain Gaudric of Paris Cité University; Cathy Egan and Alan Bird of University College London; Ian Constable of The University of Western Australia; Traci Clemons of the Emmes Corporation; Thomas Aaberg, Jr and Thomas C.

Researchers and academics have flocked to Bluesky. Credit: Matteo Della Torre/NurPhoto via Getty

Posts about research on Bluesky receive substantially more attention than similar posts on X, formerly called Twitter, according to the first large-scale analysis of science content on Bluesky1. The results suggest that Bluesky users engage with posts more than do users of X.

Bluesky has more than 38 million users and shares many features with X, which fell out of favour with some scientists when it was bought by entrepreneur Elon Musk in October 2022. A survey of Nature readers earlier this year suggested that many prefer Bluesky over X to discuss and disseminate their work.

A team of researchers from the United Kingdom and China analysed 2.6 million Bluesky posts published from January 2023 to July 2025. Together, these referenced 532,000 academic articles. The results were posted as a preprint on arXiv last month and have not been peer reviewed.

‘A place of joy': why scientists are joining the rush to Bluesky

The team found that almost half of the posts about science on Bluesky garnered at least ten likes, and that one-third were reposted ten or more times. Previous research on X has shown that the proportion of science posts receiving at least ten likes varied between 4% and 7.5%, and that the proportion receiving ten or more reposts ranged from 1.4% to 4.4%2. Interactions on Bluesky were an order of magnitude higher than on X, the researchers said. Quotes — whereby users share posts and add their own text — and replies were nearly two orders of magnitude greater on Bluesky than on X, they said.

The team also reported that nearly half of Bluesky posts summarized academic articles and that only 6.3% simply mentioned the article name and journal. By contrast, 92% of original X posts about life and earth sciences and 17% of those in engineering and physical sciences referred to little more than the study title, according to a 2018 study in the Journal of Infometrics3. This suggests that research content on Bluesky is more original, says Er-Te Zheng, the latest study's first author and a PhD student at the University of Sheffield, UK. “While X has primarily served as a dissemination tool, Bluesky may support a more interpretive, reflective mode of science communication.”

Spouses are more likely to share psychiatric conditions than to have different ones.Credit: Dmitrii Marchenko/Getty

People with a psychiatric disorder are more likely to marry someone who has the same condition than to partner with someone who doesn't, according to a massive study1 suggesting that the pattern persists across cultures and generations.

Researchers had previously noted this trend in Nordic countries, but the phenomenon has seldom been investigated outside Europe until now.

The latest study, published in Nature Human Behaviour today, used data from more than 14.8 million people in Taiwan, Denmark and Sweden. It examined the proportion of people in those couples who had one of nine psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), substance-use disorder and anorexia nervosa.

Scientists lack a definitive understanding of what causes people to develop psychiatric disorders — but genetics and environmental factors are both thought to play a part.

The team found that when one partner was diagnosed with one of the nine conditions, the other was significantly more likely to be diagnosed with the same or another psychiatric condition. Spouses were more likely to have the same conditions than to have different ones, says co-author Chun Chieh Fan, a population and genetics researcher at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

“The main result is that the pattern holds across countries, across cultures, and, of course, generations,” Fan says. Even changes in psychiatric care over the past 50 years have not shifted the trend, he notes.

Only OCD, bipolar disorder and anorexia nervosa showed different patterns across countries. For instance, in Taiwan, married couples were more likely to share OCD than were couples in Nordic countries.

The study separated people into birth cohorts, from the 1930s to the 1990s, spanning ten-year intervals. For most disorders, the chances of partners sharing a diagnosis increased slightly with each decade, particularly for those with disorders related to substance use.

Although the study did not investigate what causes the phenomenon, Fan says three theories could help to explain it. First, people might be attracted to those who resemble them. “Perhaps they better understand each other due to shared suffering, so they attract each other,” he says.

Second, a shared environment could make partners more alike — a process known as convergence. And third, the societal stigma of having a psychiatric disorder narrows a person's choice of spouse.

Jan Fullerton, a psychiatric geneticist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, says that social and environmental stressors could contribute to a new diagnosis in a previously unaffected partner, particularly if they had milder, undiagnosed symptoms.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The White House Apparently Ordered Federal Workers to Roll Out Grok ‘ASAP'","https://www.wired.com/story/white-house-elon-musk-xai-grok/","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 13:22:26 GMT","

The White House appears to have instructed leaders at the General Services Administration (GSA) to add xAI's Grok chatbot to a list of approved vendors “ASAP,” according to an email sent by agency leadership earlier this week, which WIRED obtained.

“Team: Grok/xAI needs to go back on the schedule ASAP per the WH,” states the email, sent by  Josh Gruenbaum, the commissioner of the Federal Acquisition Service. “Can someone get with Carahsoft on this immediately and please confirm?” Carahsoft is a major government contractor that resells technology from third-party firms.

“Should be all of their products we had previously (3 & 4),” the email continued, seemingly referring to Grok 3 and Grok 4. The subject line of the email was “xAI add Grok-4.”

Sources say Carahsoft's contract was modified to include xAI earlier this week. Grok 3 and Grok 4 both currently appear on GSA Advantage (an online marketplace for government agencies to buy products and services) as of Friday morning. Now, following some internal reviews, any government agency can roll Grok out to federal workers.

The White House and GSA did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED.

The email comes after a planned partnership with xAI fell apart earlier this summer following Grok's widespread praise for Hitler and the spouting of other antisemitic beliefs on X, WIRED previously reported.

In June, employees from xAI met with GSA leadership for a two-hour brainstorming session to discuss how xAI's Grok chatbot could be used by the government. Federal workers were surprised to see their leaders press for a contract with a company marketing an uncensored chatbot with a history of erratic behavior. In early July, Grok, which is integrated into Elon Musk's social platform X, seemingly went off the rails and started praising Hitler. GSA leadership took Grok off the Multiple Award Schedule, which is GSA's long-term government contracting platform, according to sources at the agency. When GSA announced buzzy partnerships with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google earlier this month, xAI wasn't mentioned at all.

xAI is Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup. Musk, who also helms the social network X in addition to a number of other companies, played a crucial role in President Donald Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He stepped back from his public-facing role at DOGE this spring, following a massive fight with the president. A number of his associates continue to work in government pushing DOGE's cost-cutting and AI-first agenda.

On a Wednesday night in August, hundreds of people gathered in the lobby of Apple Cinemas in central San Francisco. To gain admission to the event, attendees had to say a secret code word to the crew working the door: three giggling children wearing oversize “SECURITY” caps.

The throng inside hunted for QR codes on the walls and admired a makeshift art gallery that showcased a collection of paintings, each referencing a famous historical work—Vermeer's Girl With a Pearl Earring, Munch's The Scream—but with the visage of a cartoon stick figure (his name is Percy) standing in for the central subject. A secret film played in theater 4. Dozens more attendees bought Percy T-shirts and added themselves to the waiting list for the booth dispensing Percy tattoos—a very real and very permanent commitment to the event they came here to celebrate.

A player dressed as a shark considers the tattoo table at the Pursuit finale event.

This was the grand finale of Pursuit, a citywide scavenger hunt that took place for several weeks throughout San Francisco. The goal: Find Percy, whose likeness had been plastered across posters, begging—and sometimes threatening—people to call a phone number to find him. Anyone who did so was led to complete 12 elaborate quests hidden across the city. Each task was revealed at a different time and lasted a few days, participants uncovering clues to lead them one step closer to Percy.

A month into the search, with more than 12,000 players enlisted, the crowd of more than 800 people gathered at this theater, because Percy was finally going to make an appearance. Word had spread that he was maybe even going to speak.

This is the second citywide Pursuit game; the first was held in the summer of 2024, and 300 people showed up for the finale. The scavenger hunt is funded in part by FranciscoSan.org, a grant initiative started by an anonymous benefactor that has allotted $100,000 to fund local efforts to “make the city and county of San Francisco more whimsical through eventures [sic] and installations.” The rest of the funding came from the organizers, a group of 20 or so friends.

Percy is shown on posters for the Pursuit scavenger hunt. These were taped on a wall at Apple Cinemas in San Francisco, where the finale took place.

Pursuit has no prize. There's no glittering hidden treasure, no cash reward, no reveal that this had all been—as I had cynically feared—a marketing ploy to raise brand awareness for some new startup. The real prize, the organizers say, are the friends we've made along the way. Yeah, they know that's cheesy. But they sure do mean it.

“Our friend group in general just really likes exploring,” says Athena Leong, a software engineer and one of Pursuit's organizers.

Maybe you're familiar with stories about San Francisco being a dying city—one that has seen its downtown eviscerated, its culture and soul hollowed out by gentrification and Silicon Valley solipsism. The Pursuit crew, largely a bunch of twentysomething tech workers, disagree.

Pursuit organizer Athena Leong looks for clues in the Pursuit mission created by Charlie Stigler.

During one of Pursuit's clue days, Leong and I hopped into a car driven by fellow organizer Charlie Stigler. We drove across the city, from one mission clue to another. I tried to solve the puzzles on my own but was miserable at it. I was more focused on peppering them with questions about how—and why—they had put together this complex endeavor.

“We just enjoy doing things that are whimsical,” says Patrick Hultquist, a software engineer who had helped come up with the idea of a scavenger hunt last year. “It's fun to do something that's not profitable—not something that has to be economical to be justified, but just because it's fun to see people play it.”

Pursuit missions took players across the city, hunting for clues hidden within public pay phones, inside fake crosswalk signs, and locked in boxes that could only be opened with codes. Pursuers solved riddles, climbed to the top of San Francisco's famous blustery peaks, and tapped NFC tags leading to a website that let them talk to trees. One mission ended in an actual car chase, players dashing through the streets to hunt down a white Chevy Trax with a big model of Percy strapped to the roof.

Players also wreaked some of their own havoc in turn—overloading the organizers' messaging service, stealing clue props, and turning the game into a DIY dating app.

“Pursuit, for whatever reason, is a really popular date activity,” Leong says, scrolling through messages users had sent the support line about finding love while on the hunt.

Athena Leong looks at the Pursuit clue in the Oomz Laundromat in San Francisco.

Players ran the gamut of retirees, kids, families, and motivated puzzle nerds. Pursuit partnered with local businesses to stash secrets within their walls. One mission included a clue hidden inside a single dryer at Oomz Laundromat; when I visited, nearly 40 people were packed inside.

“Look at all these San Francisco introverts, actually talking and interacting with each other,” said Oscar Lopez, waving his hand at the chatty crowd. Lopez is a San Francisco native and returning player, pulled into Pursuit last year by the posters he saw around the city.

He scanned a QR code on the phone of Jaj Li, a player leaning on a crutch. Li was recovering from a stingray attack a week earlier, but here playing Pursuit all the same. Scanning the code of a fellow player added them to your Pursuit “troop.” A leaderboard tracked how many other players each person scanned. Lopez, who had added nearly 700 other people into his troop so far, was in second place; he had been harvesting more codes as people came into the laundromat.

Lopez uses a blacklight to search for clues in the Oomz Laundromat.

Behind Lopez, Oomz's manager used the opportunity to stroll through the crowd, asking people to scan a QR code of his own and leave his business a positive review online. The final clue for that day's puzzle was found in a cassette tape at the volunteer-run Thrillhouse Records across the street, which was similarly packed. A few blocks away at the local ice cream shop Mitchell's, where there's always a line, Pursuit has its own flavor of ice cream. (Ask for the Percy, it's ube and coconut.)

Pursuit organizers showed up at clue locations too, blending in with the crowd. Mostly they went to observe and occasionally help if they could discretely point someone in the right direction. Bansini Doshi, a local artist and student who played Pursuit last year and collaborated on building it this year, says the combination of role-playing and community building drew her into the operation.

“The things that were most striking was that you don't know who's doing it, who's planning it, who's funding it,” Doshi said. “That adds to the charm of it so much, because it really just feels like it's for the love of the game.”

Some of the missions proved particularly vexing. One required climbing hundreds of steps up to Grandview Park and using binoculars to spot letters painted on the ground across the city. I got to the top of the steps, gasping for breath, and found around a dozen people already looking for their next clue. More than one had made the steep journey two days in a row.

“Pursuit players will do basically whatever we ask them to,” Leong said. Then, with a laugh, “I promise we are not a cult.”

San Francisco has a long history of monkeyshines: The Merry Pranksters, the Suicide Club, the Cacophony Society, Burning Man, the Jejune Institute, the drunken melee of Santacon.

This new era of Bay Area madcaps has the ultimate goal of ensuring that people have a good time. Like their predecessors, they have relentlessly committed to the bit.

Danielle Egan, one of Pursuit's ringleaders, works in “Product BizOps” at LinkedIn but moonlights as an artist and all-around mischief maker. She, along with fellow Pursuit organizers Leong, Theo Bleir, and Riley Walz (himself an internet-famous prankster), have been behind elaborate stunts like Mehran's Steakhouse, a fake New York fine dining restaurant that existed for one night only in 2024. In San Francisco, Egan hosted a Sit Club—a parody of run clubs that invited participants to gather and simply just plop down somewhere. For Pursuit, she says there's an art to crafting puzzles that are just the right amount of frustrating.

“It can't be too easy,” Egan says. “There is a middle ground. Some people should struggle.”

Other mission creators used the opportunity to build a sense of community online. Artist Danielle Baskin, who planned the laundromat and music shop mission, had players begin her mission by drawing a doodle of Percy and submitting their favorite song. Upon completing the quest, they were rewarded with a link to a 100-hour-long playlist made up of all the songs players had entered. The accompanying doodles for each song are available on a companion website.

Baskin flicked through the drawings coming in on the first day the puzzle had been released, toggling on and off a switch that read TTP. That acronym means “time-to-penis,” a term in gaming development that refers to how long it takes an online service to become inundated with dicks.

“There are actually only three penises so far,” Baskin says, surprised. “Our players are really very friendly.”

Pursuit ran into its share of technical issues. In the first days of the game, the Percy support line got so many sign-ups and messages that the group's Twilio account was maxed out. For the first couple hours of one mission, the QR codes didn't work and had to be swapped out.

Pursuit players work together to unlock a box containing binoculars that they used to spot clues from the top of Grandview Park.

People also stole stuff. A critical alligator statue went missing, and Leong had to replace an entire box of binoculars for a different mission. One mission involved an elaborate fake crosswalk signal box that Pursuit organizers attached to a pole. Somebody ripped it off and took it home. They later returned the box, wrapped in a black trash bag, with a note that read, “Curiosity got me. Box is intact! Sorry.”

Pursuit's leaderboard feature got unexpectedly competitive.

“The entire point of the troop QR codes was we wanted to give people a reason to talk to each other and socialize,” Leong said. “But what we're realizing now is that it's gotten a bit transactional.” She says they will likely rethink that part of the game, or ditch it entirely, if they do the hunt next year.

The Pursuit crew didn't plan an ending for their hunt. Two weeks out from the finale, they scrambled, calling businesses who might be able to host what was rapidly turning into a very large gathering. Finally, Baskin connected, via Craigslist, with James Kilpatrick, a landlord of the Don Lee building at 1000 Van Ness Avenue where Apple Cinemas operates. (The theater chain is not affiliated with the local iPhone company.) Kilpatrick happened to be a fan of scavenger hunts and let the group use the lobby and a single theater. His three kids, ages 4, 6, and 8, were the ones running security.

Players gather for the finale of Pursuit in the lobby of Apple Cinemas in San Francisco.

Players who solved the final mission of Pursuit were led to a phone line and asked to answer specific questions about the puzzles, or just take half an hour to brute-force their way through multiple-choice questions like I did. The completed quiz led to a Partiful page listing the coordinates of the building.

Eudora Dong, a tattoo artist at Frozen Bun Tattoo and a friend of Doshi, set up the table to give people $50 flash tattoos of Percy and other Pursuit logos. Doshi, who helped run the table, said nobody expected anyone to actually take them up on the offer. But many attendees lined up.

“I get so much out of Pursuit emotionally,” said Anna Kalinsky as she waited to get an ankle tattoo of a duck, a reference to one of the game's clues. “Part of that is a full willingness to commit. A tattoo felt like a logical conclusion of that. It's a little weird and a little crazy, but Pursuit really validates and encourages taking the dive.”

At last, a few minutes behind schedule, a saxophone player hired by the Pursuit team (again, via Craigslist) blasted the hook from George Michael's “Careless Whisper” and sauntered up the staircase in the main lobby. As the song ended to applause, a figure that looked like a sports mascot appeared atop the staircase. It was Percy. The crowd cheered. The character's voice, supplied by Walz, was piped in as Percy pantomimed a speech.

“You didn't just play a game,” Percy said. “You remembered something this city has always known—that wonder lives everywhere if you have the courage to look for it. You proved that magic is not dead. It's not buried under apps and algorithms and the crushing weight of everyday life. It's right here, waiting … You are proof that curiosity is stronger than cynicism.”

After Percy's speech, the Pursuit organizers, clad in hazmat suits, shared their thanks and mingled with the crowd. The event went on for a couple more hours, and by the time the theater closed and people trickled out of the building, Dong was still tattooing images of Percy onto people's bodies. She was more than a dozen tattoos in, and she wasn't even halfway through the wait list.

When you've worked in the sleep industry long enough, you're going to hear one question resurface time and time again: “How much melatonin should I take?” The answer will vary from person to person, and the best person to deliver it is your doctor.

To be clear, I'm not a doctor (although my family really wishes I were), but I am a certified sleep science coach and professional mattress tester of five years and some change. Over the years, I've conversed with and attended lectures by many medical professionals on sleep aids and supplements. I also asked David Kuhlmann of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine to give insight into best practices when it comes to melatonin (and sleep supplements, for that matter).

First of all, let's back up. What is melatonin? It's the hormone your brain produces naturally as part of its circadian rhythm, or the internal clock your body has to keep you on a natural, daily sleep schedule. Your pineal gland is in charge of making it, and sunlight signals it to slow down production so you can wake up and go about your day. Though your brain is already producing melatonin, the idea of taking a supplement is that it jump-starts your sleep cycle.

If you've taken melatonin before and felt it didn't work for you, or are considering starting it, this is where you should consult your doctor. And do it before starting any supplement, melatonin included. You may be on medications that won't make it work as well, giving you the impression that you need more. Or, you could experience the side effects of mixing melatonin and medications. Let's avoid the late-night WebMD doomscrolls and check off that box first.

Another reason to talk to a licensed health care provider ahead of jumping on the melatonin train is that they can give you a tailored recommendation on how to go about getting melatonin, either in supplement or even nutritional form. Or, as Kuhlmann recommends to me, bypassing it altogether, for many reasons—one of which is possible unforeseen side effects, like GI upset. More on that in a minute.

The reality is, supplements are not regulated by the FDA. The University of Pennsylvania's Regulatory Review has reported that the FDA evaluates supplements on a dietary basis, pretty much like what is done for food or medication. According to Pieter Cohen in an interview for the American Medical Association, the FDA actually evaluates supplements as a “subcategory of food” and not medication. Kuhlmann corroborated this for me, emphasizing that “increased access” and the fact that brands are not as “tightly regulated” in the market have led to dangerous outcomes. He described the uptick in melatonin poisoning cases that medical professionals have seen over the past decade, primarily in kids under the age of 5.

There's a whole lot of gray area for what's OK and what's not before a product hits the market, and even after it's sold to customers. So if an extra (and questionable) ingredient weasels its way into the formula, and the supplement hits the market, there's not much the FDA can do besides send companies a warning letter to recall the supplement. It's the equivalent of shrugging, saying “Whoopsie, your fault,” and putting responsibility on a brand to make it right—which, as The Regulatory Review also points out, they don't always do.

“There's this misperception that because we can buy it over the counter, it means it's safe,” says Kuhlmann. He describes it as a toss-up on how much melatonin you are actually ingesting versus what the product is actually advertising, not to mention any other additives being used and how that will react with your body chemistry. And the crowd is now … worried.

Kuhlmann also expressed to me that he personally “wishes that melatonin would be available as a prescription, not to limit access, but it could help with the quality of melatonin people are able to get.” This is yet another reason why it's much better to get a doctor involved than to throw caution to the wind and get a product that might not be effective or could even be counterfeit. Brands may try to sell you their “secret sauce” with all sorts of claims, and that's not just for melatonin, but for all supplements. Be oh so careful about this.

Two things I always watch for with supplements, even with guidance from my doctor: Does it have a CGMP certification, and is there any data to back up the marketing claims? CGMP stands for “Current Good Manufacturing Process,” which are FDA guidelines put in place for a product's safety. This includes where and how it was made, as well as what it was made of. But even with this kind of baseline, it's hard to tell what additives are used in a supplement, and how that can counteract its effects or react with your body chemistry.

I tell you these things out of an abundance of caution. If your doctor gives you the go-ahead to use melatonin, follow their advice. Kuhlmann says he advises his patients to start at 3 milligrams, but to never take more than 10 milligrams. For kids, he also urges speaking to a pediatrician and/or a sleep medical professional.

Melatonin also can't do all the heavy lifting, and timing is crucial. As part of maintaining good bedtime habits, he also emphasizes the importance of taking it on time, at the same time, nightly. This will help establish the wind-down routine your brain follows via its circadian rhythm; as we established earlier, melatonin is supposed to lead this process.

For those of you who are just researching options, consider these alternatives. Diet and exercise, as tired as you may be of hearing that, really are essential to getting good, quality sleep. Case in point: You took a CrossFit class for the first time and are ready to conk out right after you manage to get dinner and a shower. Something else to consider: Perhaps relying on melatonin or a sleep supplement is treating a symptom you're dealing with, as opposed to the actual issue impacting your sleep.

It's hard to overstate the importance of sleep hygiene and bedtime routine habits—a sleep supplement won't be the end-all and be-all. Also, no caffeine after a certain time of day—you know your body best, but I'd say early afternoon at the very latest. Also, I'm sorry to my fellow readers and late-night scrollers, but devices need to be put away an hour or more before bedtime, too. Blue light that radiates from devices' screens mimics that of sunlight, and your brain can't discern the difference. All it knows is there's still “daylight” that you need to be awake for, and that prolongs the falling-asleep process.

Other alternatives to supplements in the pursuit of better sleep can include sound machines (my favorite is above), where various frequencies of noise lull you to sleep. We've also tested sleep gadgets pretty extensively to not only get us to sleep, but also maintain deep sleep.

And maybe melatonin is a different sort of band-aid over the reality of your sleep situation, meaning that your mattress may need to be replaced. We have plenty of beds we've tested for every kind of sleeper, along with the best sheets and pillows too. Supplements may not be the answer after all, but more of a sleep space upgrade—all things to consider!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","FEMA's Chaotic Summer Has Gone From Bad to Worse","https://www.wired.com/story/fema-funding-dhs-agency-punishment/","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 14:23:54 GMT","

On Thursday, Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem claimed that the Federal Emergency Management Agency “is much more responsive under President Trump to people's needs than it has been under previous administrations.” Speaking at the public third meeting of the FEMA Review Council, a group appointed by Donald Trump at the beginning of this year to oversee reform of the agency, Noem encouraged those listening to “be vocal” about positive interactions with the Trump administration.

“Tell the story of how different FEMA has been the last seven, eight months under [Trump's] leadership than it was previous to that,” she said.

It was a notable instruction, as this week has been anything but complimentary for FEMA. On Monday, more than 190 current and former FEMA employees signed onto a public letter criticizing the agency. While most employees signed anonymously, 35 of them signed with their names attached. Many current employees who signed onto the letter with their full names were almost immediately placed on administrative leave following the publication of the letter, The Washington Post reported.

The letter comes after a summer of disastrous flooding across the US, which critics say has been handled poorly as the administration slow-walks responses to requests for aid from certain states. FEMA employees tell WIRED that staff attrition and policies clogging up contract approvals are weakening the agency, which is facing a hard deadline to get contracts out the door by the end of the fiscal year; these policies have already created scrutiny for the agency over its response to flooding in Texas this summer, arguably the most high-profile disaster this year. Now, as the nation heads into the most intense months of the Atlantic hurricane season, employees worry that the agency is not prepared to face another catastrophe.

Jennifer Forester, a FEMA report analyst based in Texas, says that she decided to sign her name to the letter to send a signal to the agency. “Signing it anonymously would not have made the same point—that this is a situation dire enough to warrant risking a career, because human lives are at stake in what can, at first glance, just look like a political scuffle over political appointments and jobs,” she tells WIRED.

Forester says that she checked her email in the evening on Tuesday, half an hour before she was scheduled to leave work, and saw a “terse” memo from the chief of staff of the office of the administrator putting her on paid administrative leave. The memo attached to the email, a copy of which was viewed by WIRED, instructs recipients that access to their emails and FEMA facilities has been suspended and provides no end date for the leave. The memo states that the placement “is not a disciplinary action” and “not intended to be punitive.”

Colette Delawalla, the founder and executive director of Stand Up for Science, the group that organized the letter, told WIRED she had heard from “around 20” of the letter's signers who had since been placed on administrative leave.

FEMA did not respond to WIRED's request for comment.

“It is not surprising that some of the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform,” the agency told The Guardian, which reported on the retaliation against the employees who signed the letter. “Change is always hard. It is especially for those invested in the status quo, who have forgotten that their duty is to the American people not entrenched bureaucracy.”

The targeting of letter signers at FEMA echoes an earlier move at the Environmental Protection Agency in July, when that agency suspended about 140 employees who signed onto a similar public letter.

A FEMA employee who signed this week's letter expressed concern to WIRED that the agency may try to seek out those who did not include their names on the letter—especially given how DHS reportedly administered polygraphs in April attempting to identify employees who leaked to the press. “I'm concerned they may use similar tactics to identify anonymous signers,” they say. This employee spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to speak to the press.

On Tuesday morning, a day after the employees' letter was published, former FEMA acting administrator Cameron Hamilton posted a criticism of the agency publicly on LinkedIn.

“Stating that @fema is operating more efficiently, and cutting red tape is either: uninformed about managing disasters; misled by public officials; or lying to the American the public [sic] to prop up talking points,” he wrote. “President Trump and the American people deserve better than this …FEMA is saving money which is good due to the astronomical U.S. Debt from Congress. Despite this, FEMA staff are responding to entirely new forms of bureaucracy now that is lengthening wait times for claim recipients, and delaying the deployment of time sensitive resources.”

Hamilton, who was fired from his position a day after testifying in defense of the agency to Congress in May, did not respond to WIRED's questions about whether his post was related to the employees' open letter.

Both Hamilton's post and the open letter call out a new rule, instituted in June, mandating that any spending over $100,000 needs to be personally vetted by Noem. That cap, FEMA employees allege in Monday's letter, “reduces FEMA's authorities and capabilities to swiftly deliver our mission.” The policy came under fire in July after various outlets reported that it had caused a delay in the agency's response following the flooding in Texas that killed at least 135 people. The agency's chief of urban search and rescue operations resigned in late July, in part due to frustrations with how the DHS spending-approval process delayed aid during the disaster, CNN reported.

Screenshots of contract data seen by WIRED show that as of August 7, the agency still had more than $700 million left to allocate in non-disaster spending before the end of the fiscal year on September 30, with more than 1,000 open contract actions. The agency seems to be feeling the pressure to speed up contract proposals. In early August, several FEMA staff were asked to volunteer to work over a weekend to help review contracts to prepare them for Noem's sign-off, according to emails reviewed by WIRED. (“Lots of work over the weekend,” read the notes from one meeting.)

“Disaster money is just sitting,” one FEMA employee tells WIRED. “Every single day applicants are asking their FEMA contact ‘where's my money?' And we are ordered to just say nothing and redirect.”

As the employees' open letter states, roughly a third of FEMA's full-time staff had already departed by May, “leading to the loss of irreplaceable institutional knowledge and long-built relationships.” These staff departures may further hamper efforts from the agency to implement financial efficiency measures like the contract reviews. A former FEMA employee tells WIRED that while the agency began the year with nine lawyers on the procurement team that helps review financial contracts during a disaster, almost the entire team has either left or been reassigned, leaving a dearth of experience just as hurricane season ramps up.

“I have no idea what happens,” the former employee tells WIRED, when a hurricane hits “and we need a contract attorney on shift 24/7.”

Some operatives from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are joining Airbnb cofounder and DOGE member Joe Gebbia's new National Design Studio, sources tell WIRED.

Gebbia's NDS is a federal project tasked with redesigning government web pages and digital services. Like DOGE and the US DOGE Service (formerly US Digital Service), it's also an office located within the executive office of the president. “My directive is to update today's government services to be as satisfying to use as the Apple Store: beautifully designed, great user experience, run on modern software,” Gebbia, who was named chief design officer of NDS, said in a statement to X on Saturday. “I will do my best to make the U.S. the most beautiful, and usable, country in the digital world.”

Originally, Gebbia was going to join the USDS, three sources familiar with the situation tell WIRED, but he opted to start his own office focused on design. NDS will be, at least in part, populated by DOGE operatives affiliated with the General Services Administration, the sources said.

It's unclear exactly who from DOGE will be joining the studio's staff, but the NDS X account follows Edward “Big Balls” Coristine, the 19-year-old early DOGE technologist who has been integral to DOGE's efforts to dismantle large parts of the government, and Zachary Terrell, who slashed grants from the National Science Foundation earlier this year.

Kaitlyn Koller, a former Senate Foreign Relations committee aide, is joining Gebbia at the NDS, according to one source with knowledge. Until recently, Koller worked alongside USDS leadership. Acting USDS administrator Amy Gleason told staff on Tuesday that any future communication with Koller should be reported to her directly, says the source.

The NDS will act as a sister organization to the USDS—the two offices may end up collaborating on certain projects, but they'll operate as entirely separate entities, according to the three sources familiar. The organization will also work with private designers and studios, and could venture into designing physical spaces and buildings as well.

Last Thursday, President Donald Trump signed the executive order establishing the NDS and a new administration position called the “chief design officer.” The order also outlined a new “America by Design” national initiative that would improve the usability and aesthetics of online government services. The NDS, housed within the executive office of the president, is tasked with executing it.

“The Chief Design Officer will help recruit top creative talent, coordinate with executive departments and agencies (agencies), and devise innovative solutions,” the order reads.

Gebbia, the chief design officer, will report to White House chief of staff Susie Wiles. Gebbia did not respond to a request for comment about NDS and its staff.

“The National Design Studio is embarking on an historic mission to redesign government websites. American citizens deserve the best possible experience when interfacing with their government,” White House spokesperson Liz Huston, tells WIRED. “NDS is actively recruiting talented software engineers and designers from inside and outside the government.”

Gebbia joined DOGE in February, taking the lead on a DOGE effort at the Office of Personnel Management to revamp the federal retirement system. After Musk left the government in May, Gebbia's name circulated as a possible replacement to lead DOGE, but he was not interested in taking on the role, The New York Times reported in June.

On its new website, NDS suggests it will update the ways Americans interact with government systems, as with passport renewals, tax filing, and green card applications. According to Reuters, the Internal Revenue Service will be one of the studio's focuses.

Work on many of these projects was already underway at the USDS and GSA's 18F—the government's original digital consulting group—prior to the founding of DOGE. Numerous staffers focused on these projects were either fired or resigned in the first few weeks of the Trump administration, and 18F was shuttered in March.

The announcement of NDS has irked some engineers and former designers at the USDS and 18F. “[There is] a lot of frustration here that DOGE spent the last six months firing all of our designers or encouraging them to leave, with the few remaining ones being scattered across the org with an expectation they will be RIF'd,” or let go, before starting a new program with a similar mission, one GSA source tells WIRED.

In at least one instance, the White House actually ended projects undertaken by this group that had made things easier for American taxpayers. The Trump administration killed Direct File, an IRS system that let people file their taxes for free. WIRED previously reported that DOGE member Sam Corcos moved to kill Direct File after one meeting with tax software lobbyists this spring.

The NDS and Gebbia haven't announced the initiative's priorities, but in a March interview with Fox News, Gebbia addressed a then recent executive order signed by Trump aimed at enabling “intra- and inter-agency” data sharing and consolidation. Gebbia backed the initiative, invoking the same “Apple-like store experience” he used when announcing his role as US CDO.

“I don't feel like National Design Studio's ambition is to replicate the role of other organizations. Which isn't a criticism of those organizations. This is a needed new component to that ecosystem to effectuate the scale that we're talking about,” says Matt Lira, who served as special assistant to the president for innovation policy and initiatives during Trump's first term, in response to frustrations from current federal workers over the launch of NDS. “Bringing in fresh perspective is inherently good.”

7/10

Insta360's Go series cameras have always been remarkably small, and the strong magnetic system makes it possible to put them in places and shoot from angles that other cameras can't match. They're tiny and fun, even if the video quality isn't quite as good as what you'd get from a standard action camera.

The latest Go series camera from Insta360, the Go Ultra, aims to change that by using a larger sensor, with higher-quality video, while retaining the detachable, pod-based design. The Go Ultra is bigger, but it's still pretty small and plenty of fun.

The Go Ultra retains the same form factor as previous models, consisting of a camera pod that can be used on its own, and a base station-like housing that provides an additional battery and a 2.5-inch flip up touchscreen to change settings and even monitor your shot when the pod is detached.

The first thing any Insta360 Go fan will notice is that while the form factor is roughly the same, the camera pod portion of the Go Ultra is not only a different shape (square) but much larger than the pod portion of the Insta360 Go 3S. The good news is that Insta360 tells WIRED that Ultra is not going to replace the 3S, so if you like the form factor of the Go 3S, then stick with it.

I should probably say that I think the four most important elements of an action camera are portability, image quality, stabilization, and field of view.

Insta360 Go Ultra Action Camera

Rating: 7/10

All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.

In the first case, the Go Ultra beats everything, allowing you to shoot with the camera element only, but there are some caveats. The pod potion of the camera is about 1 inch square and weighs just 53 grams. That's light enough to stick to your helmet and barely even notice it. Since it has a magnetic back you can mount it to anything metal with no need for any extra mounts, adapters, straps, or any of the gear you need to lug around to mount, say, a GoPro. That's really nice and cuts down on the clutter in your pack. The caveat is battery life.

The Go Ultra's battery life is vastly better than the 3S. I was regularly able to get an hour out of it shooting 4K 30 fps, whereas the 3S topped out at about half that. Side note, you can roughly double the 3S pod battery life with Insta360's battery pack, but it does add an ounce (33 g) and quite a bit of bulk. However, in my experience testing it over the summer, the Go Ultra's size increase pales in comparison to its much improved video quality.

There's no huge gain in video specs. You do get 4K 60 fps as an option (the Go 3S tops out at 4K 30 fps), but the real difference is the larger sensor in the Go Ultra. The new 1/1.28″ sensor is over twice the size of what's in the Go 3S (221 percent larger, if you want to be precise). It's also larger than what's in Insta360's flagship action camera, the Insta360 Ace Pro 2. (Though I expect an update to change that in the near future). From what I can tell from testing them side by side, the Go Ultra is using the same sensor found in the company's X5 360 camera (which has two of them).

All of which is to say that the sensor in the Go Ultra is impressive, but don't toss your Ace Pro 2 or X5 just yet, because the sensor is never the end of the story.

When it comes to image quality, the new sensor moves the Go Ultra to near the top of the pack as far as Insta360's lineup goes. It's not quite as good as the Ace Pro 2 in some situations (skin tends to look weirdly over-smoothed compared to the Ace Pro 2), but it's better in others, notably low light and shadows where the Go Ultra captures better detail.

Another place I found the Ace Pro 2 footage remains superior is in fast pans or fast footage of busy scenes, like filming from a bike on single-track through trees or bushes. The Ace Pro 2 retains more detail in these scenarios, possibly due to the nicer lens.

Most of the time, though, the footage from the Go Ultra and Ace Pro are close enough that it's hard to tell the raw footage apart. I would generally say the same is true of the X5, though of course in that case you're capturing 360 degree footage, which has its advantages.

Insta360 Go Ultra Action Camera

Rating: 7/10

All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.

The Go Ultra has most of the shooting modes you'll get in Insta360's other cameras, include 8-bit HDR, which is still a head scratcher (to really get true HDR footage, you need 10-bit footage like you'll get from GoPro and DJI cameras). There are a couple new modes here, including one called Toddler Titan, which is designed to work with the hat clip accessory and capture your chunky monkey's POV.

Stabilization is excellent and matches what you'd get in the rest of Insta360's action cameras. At this point, every action camera I've tested has stabilization down, and the Go Ultra is no exception.

Probably the best thing about the Go Ultra, after the video quality improvements, is that it now takes a microSD card, rather than having only built-in storage. That means you can now put in up to 2-TB and shoot all day without worrying that you'll fill up the built-in storage.

Another bonus is the wider field of view (FOV), up to 156 degrees from the Go 3S's 150 degrees. That may not sound like much, but every bit helps in this case. For reference, the GoPro Hero 13 Black has a FOV of 156 degrees, and with the Ultra Wide Lens Mod that jumps to 177 degrees. Also new on the Go Ultra is the ability to shoot 4K video at 2X zoom. HDR is also available with 4K footage.

There are two things I don't like about the Go Ultra. The first is that the pod is not waterproof out of the box, so you'll need a different lens cover, which is larger and somewhat awkward when using it out of the water. Despite that, I just leave mine on there all the time and deal with the size because most of the time I want an action camera, it's probably because it's going to get wet.

Rating: 7/10

All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.

The other thing I do not like about this camera is that you can't remove the battery, which means you're going to have to carry a power brick of some kind to recharge when you're out all day. That's a considerable weight penalty, compared to just throwing an Ace Pro and a couple extra batteries in your bag. Perhaps one day we'll see a Go series camera where the base has a removable battery.

The Go Ultra is a great camera, and the weight increase from the Go 3S doesn't bother me for what I do with this camera. My hesitation comes with the price increase over the Go 3S, which makes the Go Ultra less an extra camera, and more of an only action camera.

The Go Ultra's $450 sticker price puts it on par with the Ace Pro 2, DJI Action 5, and GoPro Hero 13 Black. Up against the DJI and GoPro offerings, the Go Ultra's video quality just isn't there. The only real winning point is the diminutive size, but that is in itself a huge selling point. Especially if you're going to be mounting your action cam on yourself (or your kid), the Go Ultra is the way to go.

Add Seattle's Whitman Middle School to the list of schools trying new procedures to limit the distractions caused by cellphones and other smart devices.

The school for grades six through eight in the Crown Hill neighborhood is implementing a “Devices Away for the Day” policy intended to make the school a phone-free learning environment the entire school day.

In a newsletter emailed to parents this week, Whitman Principal John Houston shared a PDF presentation outlining how the policy will work when school starts next week.

According to Houston, a teacher survey at the school found that 85% reported phones to be a problem at Whitman, impacting learning and social interactions.

Whitman's leadership team formed a committee to research what other schools were doing. The school worked with the Associated Student Body and Parent Teacher Student Association to hear ideas and concerns, and Whitman students were surveyed for their input.

RELATED: The right call? A year after school's phone ban, educators and parents love it, but kids aren't so sure

Whitman's move comes as mounting scientific and anecdotal evidence continues to show the academic, mental health, and social harms caused to kids by cellphones and social media. More school districts and states across the U.S. are enacting policies curbing or banning the use of smart devices in schools. In South Korea, a bill passed this week to ban the use of smartphones and other digital devices in school classrooms nationwide.

The Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction released results last week from a survey that found that 75% of districts will have a policy in place by the start of the school year that limits the use of smart devices during class time.

Two public middle schools in Seattle implemented restrictions last year — Hamilton International and Robert Eagle Staff both introduced Yondr pouches, which allow students to lock away their phones, limiting their use throughout school hours. Pouches can only be unlocked by school staff or at designated stations at the end of the school day.

Seattle Public Schools (SPS) has not implemented any new districtwide cellphone policy for the start of the 2025–26 school year. Individual schools continue to manage their own cellphone policies based on the needs of their communities and educational environments.

A district spokesperson told GeekWire this week that the district continues to advance the Student Cellphone and Personal Technology Policy initiative, “which aims to foster equitable, focused, and wellness-centered learning environments across all SPS schools.”

“Throughout Fall 2025, SPS will engage students, staff, families, and community members through listening sessions, surveys, and committee discussions,” SPS said in a statement. “These inputs will inform a comprehensive Decisional Paper to be finalized and presented by December 2025. This process ensures transparency and shared ownership of any future districtwide policy updates.”

GeekWire's startup coverage documents the Pacific Northwest entrepreneurial scene. Sign up for our weekly startup newsletter, and check out the GeekWire funding tracker and venture capital directory.

We're back with Startup Radar, spotlighting another exciting cohort of Seattle-area founders at the helm of up-and-coming early stage companies. 

This batch spans smart home hardware, dementia care, hiring, HR, and AI assistants.

We're pleased to welcome Aaron Fleishman, partner at Seattle-area venture capital firm Tola Capital, who provided the “VC View” on each startup. 

We also decided to mix it up with the addition of “Mean VC,” a custom GPT built by Yohei Nakajima, a Seattle-area investor we wrote about this week. It's designed to help provide tough feedback for founders on their pitches — so we asked it to judge this week's Startup Radar companies based on the descriptions below. 

Thanks for reading. Email me at taylor@geekwire.com with potential startups to feature in future Startup Radar spotlights. 

Aura Labs

Founded: 2024

The business: Smart home startup initially focused on lighting. Its technology uses sensors and AI to learn user habits and create personalized configurations without the need for technical know-how. The company's first product is Aura TV Backlight, which aims to create a more immersive home entertainment experience.

Leadership: CEO Josias Garcia was an early sales member at Wyze, the Seattle-area smart home device giant. His co-founders Abu Hafiz (worked at Amazon on smart home products) and Darak Chen (hardware design expert) both stepped down in July.

VC View from Aaron Fleishman: “The Aura TV Backlight appears to be an interesting initial wedge into the home entertainment system. I can definitely see how it creates a more immersive experience for the consumer. The real question I have is: with that initial wedge, where does Aura Labs go? Likening to the B2B software world, what is their land and expand? A whole line of products that make your entertainment experience much more immersive could be really compelling, including technologies like VR for example.” 

Mean VC: “Your product taps into the booming smart home market with a sleek, low-friction user experience that could win over tech-averse consumers. Unfortunately, ‘personalized lighting' sounds more like a Kickstarter gimmick than a defensible business, and you're one firmware update away from irrelevance when Philips Hue sneezes.”

MeeBoss

Founded: 2025

The business: Job-matching platform aiming to help make hiring faster and more personal for both employers and candidates. MeeBoss offers direct messaging and a job-matching recommendation system with a keyword-based approach. It is currently offering its product to VC-backed startups for free.

Leadership: Co-founder Susanna Niu previously started a news media platform for overseas students and has marketing experience. Co-founder Forrest Fisher was a senior product manager at FloSports and spent more than a decade in tech roles at Disney.

VC View from Aaron Fleishman: “Having invested in talent sourcing automation startups like Fetcher, I see real value in companies that can accelerate the time for the right candidates to be matched to the right companies. Where I think this gets really interesting is when you can turn the company side almost entirely agentic. That could create substantial value on both sides of this talent matching equation.”

Mean VC: “Offering VC-backed startups a free, streamlined hiring tool with direct messaging is a clever wedge into a noisy market desperate for better talent pipelines. But a keyword-based recommendation system in 2025 is like showing up to a gunfight with a butter knife — LinkedIn, AI-native ATSs, and vertical platforms will eat you alive unless you evolve fast.”

Nexhelm

Founded: 2025

The business: AI agent orchestration layer for financial advisors. The company's AI assistant listens to client meetings, coordinates tasks, and executes assignments across CRM, email, and other platforms. Nexhelm recently joined the AI2 Incubator in Seattle and is running early pilots with independent RIAs and insurance financial managers.

Leadership: CEO Lona Yu was a machine learning scientist at Amazon working on fraud detection models. CTO Nolan McCafferty was also an engineer at Amazon and more recently was at cloud services startup Omnistrate.

VC View from Aaron Fleishman: “Applying AI technologies and agents to lead prospecting and deal coaching is a no-brainer and we are seeing a lot of these technologies already. We are actually invested in a very successful company in the space called Nooks which is more horizontal in nature. My real question for Nexhelm is if the lead prospecting and deal coaching workflows need to be tailored to specific verticals like financial advisors in this case. I could see proprietary data giving them an advantage over horizontal players, but I would want to see how that data evinces itself in the product or models.”

Mean VC: “Embedding an AI agent into the chaotic workflow of financial advisors to automate grunt work is a smart play, especially with warm leads from the AI2 pedigree. But unless you crack compliance, trust, and tight integrations with legacy sludge like Redtail or Salesforce Financial Services Cloud, you're just another LLM wrapper shouting into a highly regulated void.”

Remme

Founded: 2025

The business: Software platform focused on reminiscence therapy to help improve mood, boost memory, and reduce medication use for older adults with dementia. Remme's tools use photos and conversation prompts to help users reminisce regularly and naturally while building connections between family members. The company is gathering feedback at local senior centers. 

Leadership: Founder Grace Raper was a lead software engineer at AR training startup Ghost Pacer, which had its assets acquired by Peloton. She later launched SortMyShoebox, a computer vision tool that organizes scanned family photos. Raper was inspired to launch Remme by her grandmother, who spent more than 30 years as a hospice nurse.

VC View from Aaron Fleishman: “Unfortunately, with the aging population, the prevalence of dementia and Alzheimer's continues to grow. I am no expert on this space, but Remme's reminiscence therapy sounds like it could improve the quality of life for people suffering with these diseases. I could also see opportunities to leverage multimodal AI to further improve this therapy over time.”

Mean VC: “Tapping into reminiscence therapy with user-friendly tools that strengthen family bonds and improve dementia care is both noble and potentially impactful in a massive aging market. But unless you can prove sustained engagement and measurable clinical outcomes — and not just warm fuzzies — this ends up as another well-meaning app collecting digital dust on an iPad in a nursing home.”

Talvita

Founded: 2025

The business: AI-native talent management platform rethinking traditional performance reviews and ways to unlock employee potential. Talvita tracks and evaluates employee impact in high-ambiguity roles, and provides senior leaders with insights. The startup is bootstrapped and plans to launch a limited access MVP.

Leadership: CEO Caitlin Rollman was a senior director at Seattle sales software startup Highspot and spent nearly a decade at Microsoft. Co-founder Kate Wilson was also at Highspot in a senior director role leading a solution architects team, and was a consultant at Accenture.

VC View from Aaron Fleishman: “Performance review management is definitely a crowded market, with both large incumbent HR platforms offering products, but also certain breakout SaaS startups like Lattice. It's not entirely clear to me how Talvita aims to differentiate from the competition. I could see there being an AI-native angle here which leapfrogs the rest. Particularly interesting would be how they handle AI agents as employees within companies and their performance.”

Mean VC: “Targeting the broken world of performance reviews with AI that actually understands impact in ambiguous roles is a refreshing, high-upside thesis for modern orgs. But bootstrapping an enterprise SaaS in HR without budget, brand, or buyer trust is a long, lonely climb — especially when every CHRO has already been burned by five ‘insight' platforms that overpromised and underdelivered.”

With 4 million app downloads, Estonia-based startup Vocal Image aims to help people improve their voice and communication skills with AI-powered coaching. But out of its 160,000 active users, it may be its CEO, Nick Lahoika, who best embodies its mission. 

Lahoika was born in Belarus, didn't speak English until his relocation to Estonia, and once struggled with speaking anxiety. Yet, he went on to “win a lot of pitch competitions” on behalf of the voice coaching startup, which was inspired by his journey, he told TechCrunch.

“When I was at school, I was a little bit bullied for unclear diction,” Lahoika said. In his early twenties, as a young, insecure founder, he met a vocal coach, Maryna “Rusia” Shukiurava, who taught him that voice and communication could be trained. 

To help others, they started a YouTube channel that eventually morphed into Vocal Image, which positions its subscription-based app as an affordable alternative to one-on-one coaching you can use at home. “You can make strange movements, strange sounds […] and feel safe,” Lahoika said.

With an interactive library that includes tongue twisters, breathing exercises, and advice on gestures, Vocal Image is also leaning more and more into AI to give automated feedback and personalized tips, thanks in big part to the addition of co-founder and CTO Mikalai Karaliou, Lahoika said.

These guided journeys mostly revolve around work-related goals such as enhancing professional or leadership skills, and developing public speaking or presentation abilities. But Vocal Image also supports people who simply want to increase their self-confidence, as well as LGBTQ people, whose rights Shukiurava had been supporting in Belarus.

While the trio is from Belarus, they were among the many Belarusian founders who left their home country after protests failed to oust President Alexander Lukashenko and were met with brutal repression. Lahoika picked Estonia for its business environment, which has so far proven favorable for the startup.

Shortly after relocating to Tallinn, Vocal Image joined local accelerator Startup Wise Guys, which considers the startup as one of its “success stories” due to its fast growth. According to Lahoika, the startup subsequently reached $6.5 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) on less than $1 million in pre-seed funding.

More recently, the startup raised a $3.6 million seed round led by French edtech VC firm Educapital, with participation from Specialist VC out of Estonia and Generations Fund out of Germany, TechCrunch learned exclusively. 

As of August, the startup now claims $12 million of ARR and some 50,000 paid users, Lahoika said. With a team of 20 people, including a majority of Belarusian exiles, Vocal Image now plans to grow its development team and deploy more localizations (in addition to English, Spanish, German, French, Ukrainian, and Russian).

This funding comes not long after the startup was picked by Hugging Face, Meta, and Scaleway as one of the five winners of their European AI Startup Program, but also at a time when it is facing increased competition. For instance, edtech company Headway recently added an AI-powered speech trainer to its social skills app, Skillsta. But Vocal Image can count on its own GDPR-compliant AI trove.

With some 35,000 recordings a day, Vocal Image has amassed more than 1 million real-voice samples. Even better, these recordings are labeled by the community through Voice Rating, a collaborative feature that lets users decide whether others sound “confident” or “childlike.” 

This is the kind of dataset that apps like Vocal Image sorely need in order to improve their accuracy. It could also help AI startups fine-tune their artificial voices, creating further tailwinds for the startup beyond its B2C roots.

Mukesh Ambani, India's richest man and chairman of Reliance Industries, has unveiled an ambitious plan to build the country's AI backbone through a new subsidiary — starting with strategic partnerships with Google Cloud and Meta.

At the company's 48th annual general meeting on Friday, Ambani launched a new venture called Reliance Intelligence, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries. The new venture aims to create a national-scale AI infrastructure, including enterprise tools and services for a variety of sectors. The move comes as India looks to catch up in the global AI race long dominated by the U.S. and China.

“Reliance Intelligence will create a home for world-class researchers, engineers, designers, and product builders, combining the speed of research with the rigor of engineering,” Ambani said in his keynote, “so that ideas become innovations and applications, providing solutions to India and the world.”

To kick things off, Reliance has partnered with Google — one of its major tech partners — to build a dedicated AI cloud infrastructure in India. The network will start with a major data center in Jamnagar, a city in the western state of Gujarat.

The dedicated cloud region will enable Reliance to offer AI-focused services to businesses of all sizes, developers, and government bodies, utilizing Jio's network and its own energy assets to support large-scale deployments, the companies said in their joint statement.

“As Reliance's largest public cloud partner, Google Cloud is not only powering the company's mission-critical workloads, but we are also innovating with you on advanced AI initiatives,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a video message during the company's virtual AGM. “This is only the beginning.”

Google did not immediately respond to a query about the financial terms of the partnership.

Reliance has also announced a joint venture with Meta, another of its major tech investors, to build and scale enterprise AI solutions for customers in India and select international markets. Under the agreement, Reliance and Meta have committed a combined investment of ₹8.55 billion (approximately $100 million) under a 70/30 ownership split, respectively.

The partnership will offer Meta's Llama-based enterprise AI platform-as-a-service, allowing businesses to customize, deploy, and manage generative AI models for use cases across sales, marketing, IT, customer service, and finance. The joint venture will also provide a suite of pre-configured AI solutions, the companies said.

Reliance's collaboration comes just weeks after Meta restructured its AI ventures into a new Superintelligence Labs, fueled by an expensive string of top AI hires. (Meta is reportedly pausing the hiring spree after concern from shareholders.)

“Through this joint venture, we're putting Meta's Llama models into real-world use,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a prepared statement.

The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025.

Reliance is planning to expand beyond India and take its flagship subsidiary Reliance Jio Platforms to international markets, Ambani said. Ambani also revealed that Jio aims to file for an initial public offering in the first half of 2026, following much anticipation and initial delays.

Reliance is also reportedly eyeing a partnership with OpenAI, which recently introduced its sub-$5 ChatGPT subscription in India and announced its plans to set up an office in New Delhi later this year. The details of the partnership are likely to be announced during Sam Altman's upcoming visit to India next month, two people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.

Reliance and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Earlier this year, Reliance's arch-rival Bharti Airtel, the country's second-largest telco after Jio, partnered with Perplexity to offer more than 360 million Airtel subscribers access to Perplexity Pro for 12 months.

Reliance has already partnered with Microsoft to offer its Azure cloud platform to Indian enterprises. The company also offers JioAICloud, a consumer-focused service that provides 100GB of free storage. The consumer cloud service has been used by 40 million users and is updated with voice search support and an AI Create Hub to turn photos into AI-powered reels, collages, and promo videos, the company announced at its annual general meeting.

Reliance also showcased its AI-based smart glasses, JioFrames, as its answer to Snap's Spectacles and Ray-Ban Meta glasses. Similarly, the company is integrating AI into its streaming platform, JioHotstar, which has attracted over 600 million users and 300 million paying subscribers in the three months since its launch in February.

The new AI features include “Riya” voice assistant and content translation into Indian languages using AI-voice cloning and lip-syncing tech.

Khalid Ashmawy remembers the first time he wired money home while studying in Europe.

He had just received his monthly stipend as a master's student in Stuttgart and wanted to send part of it back to his family in Cairo. It was usually a slow and expensive process, he recalled. A $400 wire transfer, for instance, could cost $40 in fees and take three business days to arrive.

Years later, while working at Microsoft and Uber in the U.S., and even after founding a startup, that experience hadn't improved much. 

The persistent pain point across different stages of his career eventually inspired Ashmawy to launch Munify, a cross-border neobank designed to give Egyptians abroad a faster, cheaper way to send money home and, for residents in the country, access to U.S. banking.

Earlier this year, the startup joined Y Combinator's Summer 2025 batch, a rare entrant from outside the U.S. and one of the few without a core AI pitch in a class dominated by generative AI startups. The company also raised $3 million in seed funding from the accelerator and other regional investors, including BYLD and DCG. 

“Banking wasn't built for people like me. It's very costly, takes a long time, and is fragmented,” the founder and chief executive told TechCrunch in an interview. “It's a problem I have personally experienced and one that resonates with a lot of people who want to send money back home quickly and efficiently.”

Ashmawy grew up in Egypt, studied computer science, and developed a deep love for software early on. A scholarship took him to Europe, where he completed two master's degrees in Germany and Switzerland.

From there, he spent seven years as an engineer and team leader at Microsoft and Uber — experiences that opened his eyes to the world of disruptive technologies and startups.

His next step was inevitable. In 2019, Ashmawy left Uber to launch Founders Fund-backed Huspy, a proptech platform focused on mortgages in the Middle East, serving as its chief technology officer until 2022.

Leaving Huspy gave him space to reflect on his own immigrant journey. Once again, the issue of remittances loomed large. Meanwhile, in other emerging markets, platforms like Nigeria's LemFi and India's Aspora were already taking off, helping migrants from those countries send money back home.

Egypt is one of the world's largest remittance markets, receiving nearly $30 billion in inflows annually.

While bank wires and traditional remittance platforms such as Western Union and MoneyGram remain the dominant options, Munify hopes to be the first choice in a growing crop of digital banks that promise cheaper and faster transfers. 

According to Ashmawy, Munify serves Egyptians abroad — primarily in the U.S., U.K., Europe, and the Gulf — who want to send money home instantly and at better rates. 

Munify also provides businesses, remote workers, and freelancers in the Middle East a way to open a U.S. bank account and card using only a local ID to receive and spend money, as well as hedge against local currency volatility.

“The main reason why we're different is that we're building our own rails and directly connecting the banking systems across different countries,” the CEO told TechCrunch, adding that the platform, which just launched two weeks ago, is already seeing early adoption through word of mouth with thousands of sign-ups. 

“We've really tailored this experience for people from the region,” said Ashmawy.

On the business side, Munify has signed contracts with mid-sized companies and enterprises, representing a projected $50+ million in monthly cross-border volume, according to Ashmawy. 

The startup, which operates on a dual consumer and business model (offering remittance and banking services for individuals, while providing APIs for businesses to send and receive cross-border payments), plans to expand beyond Egypt to other Middle Eastern and adjacent countries, gradually stitching together regional banking rails. 

Its revenue comes from FX spreads, interchange, and payment flows.

Y Combinator's batches over the past couple of years have favored AI and developer tools from the United States. So, how did the Egyptian fintech get in? Ashmawy credits the acute nature of the problem. 

“If you're solving a big and urgent problem, that's what really matters, regardless of whether the current wave is AI or something else,” he said.

But there's precedent for this backing as well. YC has historically invested in startups solving hard financial infrastructure problems, from Stripe to Coinbase. Similarly, remittances are one of the most entrenched pain points in global finance and one of the accelerator's consistent focus areas when backing startups from emerging markets (case in point: LemFi and Aspora) before its recent AI tilt.

In the midst of that, Munify represented a chance to back a founder with experience at two U.S. tech giants, a track record of building one of MENA's top proptech companies, and a personal connection to the problem.

ChatGPT, OpenAI's text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.

2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.

OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI's transition to a for-profit. 

In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it's ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.

Below, you'll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we've been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.

To see a list of 2024 updates, go here.



OpenAI, facing a lawsuit from the parents of a 16-year-old who died by suicide, said in its blog that it has implemented new safeguards for ChatGPT, including stronger detection of mental health risks and parental control features. The AI company said the updates aim to provide tighter protections around suicide-related conversations and give parents more oversight of their children's use.

Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, filed a federal lawsuit in Texas against Apple and OpenAI, alleging that the two companies colluded to lock up key markets and shut out rivals.

OpenAI introduced its most affordable subscription plan, ChatGPT Go, in India, priced at 399 rupees per month (approximately $4.57). This move aims to expand OpenAI's presence in its second-largest market, offering enhanced access to the latest GPT-5 model and additional features.

Since its May 2023 launch, ChatGPT's mobile app has amassed $2 billion in global consumer spending, dwarfing competitors like Claude, Copilot, and Grok by roughly 30 times, according to Appfigures. This year alone, the app has generated $1.35 billion, a 673% increase from the same period in 2024, averaging nearly $193 million per month, or 53 times more than its nearest rival, Grok.

Despite unveiling GPT-5 as a “one-size-fits-all” AI, OpenAI is still offering several legacy AI options, including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o3. Users can choose between new “Auto,” “Fast,” and “Thinking” modes for GPT-5, and paid subscribers regain access to legacy models like GPT-4o and GPT-4.1.

Updates to ChatGPT:You can now choose between “Auto”, “Fast”, and “Thinking” for GPT-5. Most users will want Auto, but the additional control will be useful for some people.Rate limits are now 3,000 messages/week with GPT-5 Thinking, and then extra capacity on GPT-5 Thinking…

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Reddit users that GPT-5's “dumber” behavior at launch was due to a router issue and promised fixes, double rate limits for Plus users, and transparency on which model is answering, while also shrugging off the infamous “chart crime” from the live presentation.

OpenAI released GPT-5, a next-gen AI that's not just smarter but more useful — able to handle tasks like coding apps, managing calendars, and creating research briefs — while automatically figuring out the fastest or most thoughtful way to answer your questions. 

OpenAI is making a major push into federal government workflows, offering ChatGPT Enterprise to agencies for just $1 for the next year. The move comes after the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) added OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to its approved AI vendor list, allowing agencies to access these tools through preset contracts without negotiating pricing.

OpenAI unveiled its first open source language models since GPT-2, introducing two new open-weight AI releases: gpt-oss-120b, a high-performance model capable of running on a single Nvidia GPU, and gpt-oss-20b, a lighter model optimized for laptop use. The move comes amid growing competition in the global AI market and a push for more open technology in the U.S. and abroad.

ChatGPT's rapid growth is accelerating. OpenAI said the chatbot was on track to hit 700 million weekly active users in the first week of August, up from 500 million at the end of March. Nick Turley, OpenAI's VP and head of the ChatGPT app, highlighted the app's growth on X, noting it has quadrupled in size over the past year.

This week, ChatGPT is on track to reach 700M weekly active users — up from 500M at the end of March and 4× since last year. Every day, people and teams are learning, creating, and solving harder problems. Big week ahead. Grateful to the team for making ChatGPT more useful and…

OpenAI unveiled Study Mode, a new ChatGPT feature designed to promote critical thinking by prompting students to engage with material rather than simply receive answers. The tool is now rolling out to Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users, with availability for Edu subscribers expected in the coming weeks.

ChatGPT users should be cautious when seeking emotional support from AI, as the AI industry lacks safeguards for sensitive conversations, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on a recent episode of This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von. Unlike human therapists, AI tools aren't bound by doctor-patient confidentiality, he noted.

ChatGPT now receives 2.5 billion prompts daily from users worldwide, including roughly 330 million from the U.S. That's more than double the volume reported by CEO Sam Altman just eight months ago, highlighting the chatbot's explosive growth.

OpenAI has introduced ChatGPT Agent, which completes a wide variety of computer-based tasks on behalf of users and combines several capabilities like Operator and Deep Research, according to the company. OpenAI says the agent can automatically navigate a user's calendar, draft editable presentations and slideshows, run code, shop online, and handle complex workflows from end to end, all within a secure virtual environment.

Researchers at Stanford University have observed that therapy chatbots powered by large language models can sometimes stigmatize people with mental health conditions or respond in ways that are inappropriate or could be harmful. While chatbots are “being used as companions, confidants, and therapists,” the study found “significant risks.”

CEO Sam Altman said that the company is delaying the release of its open model, which had already been postponed by a month earlier this summer. The ChatGPT maker, which initially planned to release the model around mid-July, has indefinitely postponed its launch to conduct additional safety testing.

we planned to launch our open-weight model next week.we are delaying it; we need time to run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas. we are not yet sure how long it will take us.while we trust the community will build great things with this model, once weights are…

OpenAI plans to release an AI-powered web browser to challenge Alphabet's Google Chrome. It will keep some user interactions within ChatGPT, rather than directing people to external websites.

Some ChatGPT users have noticed a new feature called “Study Together” appearing in their list of available tools. This is the chatbot's approach to becoming a more effective educational tool, rather than simply providing answers to prompts. Some people also wonder whether there will be a feature that allows multiple users to join the chat, similar to a study group.

Referrals from ChatGPT to news publishers are increasing. But this rise is insufficient to offset the decline in clicks as more users now obtain their news directly from AI or AI-powered search results, according to a report by digital market intelligence company Similarweb. Since Google launched its AI Overviews in May 2024, the percentage of news searches that don't lead to clicks on news websites has increased from 56% to nearly 69% by May 2025.

OpenAI has started using Google's AI chips to power ChatGPT and other products, as reported by Reuters. The ChatGPT maker is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia's GPUs, using the AI chips to train models, and this is the first time that OpenAI is using non-Nvidia chips in an important way.

Researchers from MIT's Media Lab monitored the brain activity of writers in 32 regions. They found that ChatGPT users showed minimal brain engagement and consistently fell short in neural, linguistic, and behavioral aspects. To conduct the test, the lab split 54 participants from the Boston area into three groups, each consisting of individuals ages 18 to 39. The participants were asked to write multiple SAT essays using tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, the Google search engine, or without any tools.

The ChatGPT app for iOS was downloaded 29.6 million times in the last 28 days, while TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X were downloaded a total of 32.9 million times during the same period, representing a difference of about 10.6%, according to ZDNET report citing Similarweb's X post.

Sam Altman said that the average ChatGPT query uses about one-fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, equivalent to 0.000083 gallons of water, or the energy required to power a lightbulb for a few minutes, per Business Insider. In addition to that, the chatbot requires 0.34 watt-hours of electricity to operate.

OpenAI has unveiled o3-pro, an enhanced version of its o3, a reasoning model that the chatGPT maker launched earlier this year. O3-pro is available for ChatGPT and Team users and in the API, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access in the third week of June.

OpenAI o3-pro is available in the model picker for Pro and Team users starting today, replacing OpenAI o1-pro.Enterprise and Edu users will get access the week after.As o3-pro uses the same underlying model as o3, full safety details can be found in the o3 system card.…

OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT's conversational voice mood for all paid users across different markets and platforms. The startup has launched an update to Advanced Voice that enables users to converse with ChatGPT out loud in a more natural and fluid sound. The feature also helps users translate languages more easily, the comapny said.

OpenAI's ChatGPT now offers new funtions for business users, including integrations with various cloud services, meeting recordings, and MCP connection support for connecting to tools for in-depth research. The feature enables ChatGPT to retrieve information across users' own services to answer their questions. For instance, an analyst could use the company's slide deck and documents to develop an investment thesis.

OpenAI plans to purchase Jony Ive's devices startup io for $6.4 billion. Sarah Friar, CFO of OpenAI, thinks that the hardware will significantly enhance ChatGPT and broaden OpenAI's reach to a larger audience in the future.

OpenAI has introduced its AI coding agent, Codex, powered by codex-1, a version of its o3 AI reasoning model designed for software engineering tasks. OpenAI says codex-1 generates more precise and “cleaner” code than o3. The coding agent may take anywhere from one to 30 minutes to complete tasks such as writing simple features, fixing bugs, answering questions about your codebase, and running tests.

Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said during a recent AI event hosted by VC firm Sequoia that he wants ChatGPT to record and remember every detail of a person's life when one attendee asked about how ChatGPT can become more personalized.

OpenAI said in a post on X that it has launched its GPT-4.1 and GPT4.1 mini AI models in ChagGPT.

By popular request, GPT-4.1 will be available directly in ChatGPT starting today.GPT-4.1 is a specialized model that excels at coding tasks & instruction following. Because it's faster, it's a great alternative to OpenAI o3 & o4-mini for everyday coding needs.

OpenAI has launched a new feature for ChatGPT deep research to analyze code repositories on GitHub. The ChatGPT deep research feature is in beta and lets developers connect with GitHub to ask questions about codebases and engineering documents. The connector will soon be available for ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users, with support for Enterprise and Education coming shortly, per an OpenAI spokesperson.

After introducing a data residency program in Europe in February, OpenAI has now launched a similar program in Asian countries including India, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. The new program will be accessible to users of ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Edu, and API. It will help organizations in Asia meet their local data sovereignty requirements when using OpenAI's products.

OpenAI is unveiling a program called OpenAI for Countries, which aims to develop the necessary local infrastructure to serve international AI clients better. The AI startup will work with governments to assist with increasing data center capacity and customizing OpenAI's products to meet specific language and local needs. OpenAI for Countries is part of efforts to support the company's expansion of its AI data center Project Stargate to new locations outside the U.S., per Bloomberg.

OpenAI has announced its plan to make changes to its procedures for updating the AI models that power ChatGPT, following an update that caused the platform to become overly sycophantic for many users.

OpenAI has released a post on the recent sycophancy issues with the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, leading the company to revert an update to the model released last week. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that the GPT-4o update was being rolled back. OpenAI is working on “additional fixes” to the model's personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast.

An issue within OpenAI's ChatGPT enabled the chatbot to create graphic erotic content for accounts registered by users under the age of 18, as demonstrated by TechCrunch's testing, a fact later confirmed by OpenAI. “Protecting younger users is a top priority, and our Model Spec, which guides model behavior, clearly restricts sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “In this case, a bug allowed responses outside those guidelines, and we are actively deploying a fix to limit these generations.”

OpenAI has added a few features to its ChatGPT search, its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics.

OpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI's cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.

OpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI's VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.

OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company skipped that step — sending safety cards for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won't be a separate system card released for it.”

Questions have been raised regarding OpenAI's transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI's top-reported score.

OpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.

OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI's safety report.

OpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI's previous models.

Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company's X post.

All of your image creations, all in one place.Introducing the new library for your ChatGPT image creations—rolling out now to all Free, Plus, and Pro users on mobile and https://t.co/nYW5KO1aIg. pic.twitter.com/ADWuf5fPbj

OpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.

OpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk's X and Mark Zuckerberg's Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.

OpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI's API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.

OpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model — GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It's accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek's upgraded V3.

OpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI's API.

OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI's GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.

OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.

It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT's Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.”

OpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI's premium service, which offers access to the company's GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.

More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available  to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.

The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI's o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.

In a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company's new image-generation tool's popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote. 

OpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.

OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI's model behavior.

OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. 

The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI's ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization. 

OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn't expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said. 

OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT's image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI's AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company's Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company's API service. The company's CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.

Brad Lightcap, OpenAI's chief operating officer, will lead the company's global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.

OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company's official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT's free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.

OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI's ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI's models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.

Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it's not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn't enough. You can't just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”

OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.

OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It's only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI's GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.

Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that's “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all. 

we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.PROMPT:Please write a metafictional literary short story…

OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company's own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI's new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI's Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI's Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.

OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It's unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.

The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.

According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI's AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT's weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model's launch.

OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI's] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model. 

A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI's latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn't consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.

In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model's “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.

OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot's last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.

OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that's designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don't just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.

OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user's mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models' responses to human replies for that same post. 

OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company's o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”

A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT's mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.

OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI's corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI's tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.

Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they've used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it's acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.

OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company's AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator's.

OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.

Operator, OpenAI's agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT's code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren't yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT's client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI's website.

OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can't upgrade to one of OpenAI's paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn't supported without a valid email.

ChatGPT's new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.

OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they'd like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it's possible they went live prematurely.

ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.

November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.

Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.

There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.

Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.

Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.

Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.  And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.

GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.

A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn't necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they'll give canned responses to questions.

ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.

Yes.

Due to the nature of how these models work, they don't know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That's a problem when you're using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn't commit, that may well at this point be libel.

We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.

Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.

It's not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.

Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.

Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.

Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.

It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can't necessarily program an entire app's worth of code. That's because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn't always appropriate for the specific context in which it's being used.

Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.

Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.

OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.

The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.

In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”

Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI's technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.

An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT's false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.

CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.

Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.

There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.

Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.

Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they're inconsistent at best.

No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users' conversations to other people on the service.

None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.

Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.

Henrik Fisker, the founder of failed EV startup Fisker Inc., and his wife Geeta quietly wound down a private charitable foundation established in late 2021 that was supposed to “incubate innovation in healthcare, education, sustainability, mobility, and all causes that help support the planet and improve and further the lives of people and animals.” 

A tax filing submitted to the Internal Revenue Service in December 2024 — six months after Fisker Inc. went bankrupt — was marked as the foundation's “final return.” The filing was made public earlier this year.

The Geeta & Henrik Fisker Foundation, as it was known, ultimately only made around $100,000 in grants across its three-year existence. Henrik Fisker did not respond to messages seeking comment.

The brief existence of the Fiskers' foundation is another example of how the boom of electric vehicle startups in the 2020s — many of which went public via special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) mergers — helped fuel a rush of wide-eyed optimism.

When Rivian went public via a traditional IPO in 2021, it announced its own foundation, flush with 1% of the EV company's equity. While that stake was worth around $643 million at one point, it eventually shrank to under $100 million. But the Rivian Foundation is still kicking. The nonprofit gave out its first $10 million in grants last year, and its website shows that the foundation has made another $2.2 million in donations to date across 2025.

The Fiskers created their foundation in late 2021, IRS filings show, roughly one year after the company went public by merging with a SPAC. They transferred 229,000 shares of company stock to the nonprofit in December of that year, which were collectively worth around $4 million at the time of the donation. The couple also appear to have contributed around $5,000 in cash that first year. (Geeta Gupta Fisker was Fisker Inc.'s chief financial and chief operating officer.)

The company did not announce the establishment of the husband-and-wife team's foundation until February 14, 2022. While the press release touted the $4 million figure, by that point Fisker's stock price had fallen enough that the value of the nonprofit's stake in the company had already sunk to around $2.7 million.

The foundation did not make any grants that first fiscal year, filings show. When the fiscal year ended on September 30, 2022, the value of the shares had fallen to around $1.7 million. 

Fisker's stock price continued to slip as the company put its electric SUV into production in late 2022, began deliveries in mid-2023, and struggled to sell the flawed EV — all of which apparently limited the foundation's scope.

In the foundation's 2022 fiscal year (which ended on September 30, 2023), it made just one grant worth $92,287 to a JP Morgan “Charitable Gift Fund,” according to a filing. The Fiskers only contributed $9,500 in cash to the foundation that year, too, meaning the shares — the total value of which sunk again to around $1.4 million — were nearly all it had in terms of assets.

The most recent filing, which closes out the nonprofit, shows just one grant in the foundation's final year: The Fiskers contributed another $1,988 to the same JP Morgan fund. 

The Geeta & Henrik Fisker Foundation was not the couple's only source of charity, although details about their other giving are hard to come by.

The 2022 press release notes that the Fiskers “supported various causes, including those engaged in education and healthcare projects” since founding the EV startup in 2016. 

The release also states that the Fiskers donated around $1.9 million worth of company stock in December 2021 to what's known as a donor-advised fund (DAF). That donation came from the Fiskers' personal trust, though, an SEC filing shows — not from the Geeta & Henrik Fisker Foundation. And neither the press release nor the SEC filing say which DAF received the shares.

DAFs are a somewhat controversial tool for philanthropic giving. While people who donate to DAFs can still dictate where those funds ultimately go, that information does not have to be revealed to the public. In the meantime, donating stock to a DAF can allow the person making the contribution to deduct the value of that stock from their taxes — even if the stock value sinks.

DAFs can also hang on to that money for an indiscriminate amount of time. It's therefore impossible to know whether the DAF that received the $1.9 million in Fisker shares made any grants before or after the value of those shares sank.

A new license for Clean Core Thorium Energy to sell its fuel to India could revolutionize the nation's nuclear industry.

For just the second time in nearly two decades, the United States has granted an export license to an American company planning to sell nuclear technology to India, MIT Technology Review has learned. The decision to greenlight Clean Core Thorium Energy's license is a major step toward closer cooperation between the two countries on atomic energy and marks a milestone in the development of thorium as an alternative to uranium for fueling nuclear reactors. 

Starting from the issuance last week, the thorium fuel produced by the Chicago-based company can be shipped to reactors in India, where it could be loaded into the cores of existing reactors. Once Clean Core receives final approval from Indian regulators, it will become one of the first American companies to sell nuclear technology to India, just as the world's most populous nation has started relaxing strict rules that have long kept the US private sector from entering its atomic power industry. 

“This license marks a turning point, not just for Clean Core but for the US-India civil nuclear partnership,” says Mehul Shah, the company's chief executive and founder. “It places thorium at the center of the global energy transformation.”

Thorium has long been seen as a good alternative to uranium because it's more abundant, produces both smaller amounts of long-lived radioactive waste and fewer byproducts with centuries-long half-lives, and reduces the risk that materials from the fuel cycle will be diverted into weapons manufacturing. 

But at least some uranium fuel is needed to make thorium atoms split, making it an imperfect replacement. It's also less well suited for use in the light-water reactors that power the vast majority of commercial nuclear plants worldwide. And in any case, the complex, highly regulated nuclear industry is extremely resistant to change.

For India, which has scant uranium reserves but abundant deposits of thorium, the latter metal has been part of a long-term strategy for reducing dependence on imported fuels. The nation started negotiating a nuclear export treaty with the US in the early 2000s, and a 123 Agreement—a special, Senate-approved treaty the US requires with another country before sending it any civilian nuclear products—was approved in 2008.

While most thorium advocates have envisioned new reactors designed to run on this fuel, which would mean rebuilding the nuclear industry from the ground up, Shah and his team took a different approach. Clean Core created a new type of fuel that blends thorium with a more concentrated type of uranium called HALEU (high-assay low-enriched uranium). This blended fuel can be used in India's pressurized heavy-water reactors, which make up the bulk of the country's existing fleet and many of the new units under development now. 

Thorium isn't a fissile material itself, meaning its atoms aren't inherently unstable enough for an extra neutron to easily split the nuclei and release energy. But the metal has what's known as “fertile properties,” meaning it can absorb neutrons and transform into the fissile material uranium-233. Uranium-233 produces fewer long-lived radioactive isotopes than the uranium-235 that makes up the fissionable part of traditional fuel pellets. Most commercial reactors run on low-enriched uranium, which is about 5% U-235. When the fuel is spent, roughly 95% of the energy potential is left in the metal. And what remains is a highly toxic cocktail of long-lived radioactive isotopes such as cesium-137 and plutonium-239, which keep the waste dangerous for tens of thousands of years. Another concern is that the plutonium could be extracted for use in weapons. 

Enriched up to 20%, HALEU allows reactors to extract more of the available energy and thus reduce the volume of waste. Clean Core's fuel goes further: The HALEU provides the initial spark to ignite fertile thorium and triggers a reaction that can burn much hotter and utilize the vast majority of the material in the core, as a study published last year in the journal Nuclear Engineering and Design showed.

A thorium-fueled reactor is the latest idea being revived after getting shelved in the mid-20th century.

“Thorium provides attributes needed to achieve higher burnups,” says Koroush Shirvan, an MIT professor of nuclear science and engineering who helped design Clean Core's fuel assemblies. “It is enabling technology to go to higher burnups, which reduces your spent fuel volume, increases your fuel efficiency, and reduces the amount of uranium that you need.” 

Compared with traditional uranium fuel, Clean Core says, its fuel reduces waste by more than 85% while avoiding the most problematic isotopes produced during fission. “The result is a safer, more sustainable cycle that reframes nuclear power not as a source of millennia-long liabilities but as a pathway to cleaner energy and a viable future fuel supply,” says Milan Shah, Clean Core's chief operating officer and Mehul's son.

Pressurized heavy-water reactors are particularly well suited to thorium because heavy water—a version of H2O that has an extra neutron on the hydrogen atom—absorbs fewer neutrons during the fission process, increasing efficiency by allowing more neutrons to be captured by the thorium. 

There are 46 so-called PHWRs operating worldwide: 17 in Canada, 19 in India, three each in Argentina and South Korea, and two each in China and Romania, according to data from the International Atomic Energy Agency. In 1954, India set out a three-stage development plan for nuclear power that involved eventually phasing thorium into the fuel cycle for its fleet. 

Yet in the 56 years since India built its first commercial nuclear plant, its state-controlled industry has remained relatively shut off to the private sector and the rest of the world. When the US signed the 123 Agreement with India in 2008, the moment heralded an era in which the subcontinent could become a testing ground for new American reactor designs. 

In 2010, however, India passed the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act. The legislation was based on what lawmakers saw as legal shortcomings in the wake of the 1984 Bhopal chemical factory disaster, when a subsidiary of the American industrial giant Dow Chemical avoided major payouts to the victims of a catastrophe that killed thousands. Under this law, responsibility for an accident at an Indian nuclear plant would fall on suppliers. The statute effectively killed any exports to India, since few companies could shoulder that burden. Only Russia's state-owned Rosatom charged ahead with exporting reactors to India.

But things are changing. In a joint statement issued after a February 2025 summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump ""announced their commitment to fully realise the US-India 123 Civil Nuclear Agreement by moving forward with plans to work together to build US-designed nuclear reactors in India through large scale localisation and possible technology transfer.” 

In March 2025, US federal officials gave the nuclear developer Holtec International an export license to sell Indian companies its as-yet-unbuilt small modular reactors, which are based on the light-water reactor design used in the US. In April, the Indian government suggested it would reform the nuclear liability law to relax rules on foreign companies in hopes of drawing more overseas developers. Last month, a top minister confirmed that the Modi administration would overhaul the law. 

“For India, the thing they need to do is get another international vendor in the marketplace,” says Chris Gadomski, the chief nuclear analyst at the consultancy BloombergNEF.

But Shah sees larger potential for Clean Core. Unlike Holtec, whose export license was endorsed by the two Mumbai-based industrial giants Larsen & Toubro and Tata Consulting Engineers, Clean Core had its permit approved by two of India's atomic regulators and its main state-owned nuclear company. By focusing on fuel rather than new reactors, Clean Core could become a vendor to the majority of the existing plants already operating in India. 

Its technology diverges not only from that of other US nuclear companies but also from the approach used in China. Last year, China made waves by bringing its first thorium-fueled reactor online. This enabled it to establish a new foothold in a technology the US had invented and then abandoned, and it gave Beijing another leg up in atomic energy. 

But scaling that technology will require building out a whole new kind of reactor. That comes at a cost. A recent Johns Hopkins University study found that China's success in building nuclear reactors stemmed in large part from standardization and repetition of successful designs, virtually all of which have been light-water reactors. Using thorium in existing heavy-water reactors lowers the bar for popularizing the fuel, according to the younger Shah. 

“We think ours is the path of least resistance,” Milan Shah says. “Maybe not being completely revolutionary in the way you look at nuclear today, but incredibly evolutionary to progress humanity forward.” 

The company has plans to go beyond pressurized heavy-water reactors. Within two years, the elder Shah says, Clean Core plans to design a version of its fuel that could work in the light-water reactors that make up the entire US fleet of 94. But it's not a simple conversion. For starters, there's the size: While the PHWR fuel rods are about 50 centimeters in length, the rods that go into light-water reactors are roughly four meters long. Then there's the history of challenges with light water's absorption of neutrons that could otherwise be captured to induce fission in the thorium. 

For Anil Kakodkar, the former chairman of India's Atomic Energy Commission and a mentor to Shah, popularizing thorium could help rectify one of the darker chapters in his country's nuclear development. In 1974, India became the first country since the signing of the first global Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to successfully test an atomic weapon. New Delhi was never a signatory to the pact. But the milestone prompted neighboring Pakistan to develop its own weapons. 

In response, President Jimmy Carter tried to demonstrate Washington's commitment to reversing the Cold War arms race by sacrificing the first US effort to commercialize nuclear waste recycling, since the technology to separate plutonium and other radioisotopes from uranium in spent fuel was widely seen as a potential new source of weapons-grade material. By running its own reactors on thorium, Kakodkar says, India can chart a new path for newcomer nations that want to harness the power of the atom without stoking fears that nuclear weapons capability will spread. 

“The proliferation concerns will be dismissed to a significant extent, allowing more rapid growth of nuclear power in emerging countries,” he says. “That will be a good thing for the world at large.”

A focus on doctors' training will do little if federal funding is stripped from healthcare, nutrition and education.

A lot of Americans don't eat well. And they're paying for it with their health. A diet high in sugar, sodium, and saturated fat can increase the risk of problems like diabetes, heart disease, and kidney disease, to name a few. And those are among the leading causes of death in the US.

This is hardly news. But this week Robert F Kennedy Jr., who heads the US Department of Health and Human Services, floated a new solution to the problem. Kennedy and education secretary Linda McMahon think that teaching medical students more about the role of nutrition in health could help turn things around.

The newest addition to Trump's health agency wants to create new cities in the sea, extend human lifespan, and Make America Healthy Again.

“I'm working with Linda on forcing medical schools … to put nutrition into medical school education,” Kennedy said during a cabinet meeting on August 26. The next day, HHS released a statement calling for “increased nutrition education” for medical students.

“We can reverse the chronic-disease epidemic simply by changing our diets and lifestyles,” Kennedy said in an accompanying video statement. “But to do that, we need nutrition to be a basic part of every doctor's training.”

It certainly sounds like a good idea. If more Americans ate a healthier diet, we could expect to see a decrease in those diseases. But this framing of America's health crisis is overly simplistic, especially given that plenty of the administration's other actions have directly undermined health in multiple ways—including by canceling a vital nutrition education program.

At any rate, there are other, more effective ways to tackle the chronic-disease crisis.

The biggest killers, heart disease and stroke, are responsible for more than a third of deaths, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A healthy diet can reduce your risk of developing those conditions. And it makes total sense to educate the future doctors of America about nutrition.

Medical bodies are on board with the idea, too. “The importance of nutrition in medical education is increasingly clear, and we support expanded, evidence-based instruction to better equip physicians to prevent and manage chronic disease and improve patient outcomes,” David H. Aizuss, chair of the American Medical Association's board of trustees, said in a statement.

But it's not as though medical students aren't getting any nutrition education. And that training has increased in the last five years, according to surveys carried out by the American Association of Medical Colleges.

Kennedy has referred to a 2021 survey suggesting that medical students in the US get only around one hour of nutrition education per year. But the AAMC argues that nutrition education increasingly happens through “integrated experiences” rather than stand-alone lectures.

They're turning their backs on a technology thought to have saved millions of lives—with the potential to save many more.

“Medical schools understand the critical role that nutrition plays in preventing, managing, and treating chronic health conditions, and incorporate significant nutrition education across their required curricula,” Alison J. Whelan, AAMC's chief academic officer, said in a statement.

That's not to say there isn't room for improvement. Gabby Headrick, a food systems dietician and associate director of food and nutrition policy at George Washington University's Institute for Food Safety & Nutrition Security, thinks nutritionists could take a more prominent role in patient care, too.

But it's somewhat galling for the administration to choose medical education as its focus given the recent cuts in federal funding that will affect health. For example, funding for the National Diabetes Prevention Program, which offers support and guidance to help thousands of people adopt healthy diets and exercise routines, was canceled by the Trump administration in March.

The focus on medical schools also overlooks one of the biggest factors behind poor nutrition in the US: access to healthy food. A recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that increased costs make it harder for most Americans to eat well. Twenty percent of the people surveyed acknowledged that their diets were not healthy.

“So many people know what a healthy diet is, and they know what should be on their plate every night,” says Headrick, who has researched this issue. “But the vast majority of folks just truly do not have the money or the time to get the food on the plate.”

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) has been helping low-income Americans afford some of those healthier foods. It supported over 41 million people in 2024. But under the Trump administration's tax and spending bill, the program is set to lose around $186 billion in funding over the next 10 years.

Kennedy's focus is on education. And it just so happens that there is a nutrition education program in place—one that helps people of all ages learn not only what healthy foods are, but how to source them on a budget and use them to prepare meals.

SNAP-Ed, as it's known, has already provided this support to millions of Americans. Under the Trump administration, it is set to be eliminated.

It is difficult to see how these actions are going to help people adopt healthier diets. What might be a better approach? I put the question to Headrick: If she were in charge, what policies would she enact?

“Universal health care,” she told me. Being able to access health care without risking financial hardship not only improves health outcomes and life expectancy; it also spares people from medical debt—something that affects around 40% of adults in the US, according to a recent survey.

And the Trump administration's plans to cut federal health spending by about a trillion dollars over the next decade certainly aren't going to help with that. All told, around 16 million people could lose their health insurance by 2034, according to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office.

“The evidence suggests that if we cut folks' social benefit programs, such as access to health care and food, we are going to see detrimental impacts,” says Headrick. “And it's going to cause an increased burden of preventable disease.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Elon Musk Hopes to Wriggle His Way Out of Allegations He Duped Twitter Investors","https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-hopes-to-wriggle-his-way-out-of-allegations-he-duped-twitter-investors-2000650490","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 15:50:48 GMT","

Elon Musk's lawyers are seeking to get a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against the Tesla CEO and X owner tossed out. The case, filed right before President Donald Trump took office this year, centers on Musk's purchases of Twitter stock before his eventual takeover of the social network in 2022.

The SEC alleges that Musk cheated investors by quietly amassing more than a 5% stake in Twitter without disclosing it within the regulated time frame. By law, once someone hits that threshold, they're supposed to file paperwork within 10 days to let the rest of the market know. Musk didn't.

According to the agency, Musk blew past the deadline by 11 days, giving himself extra time to keep buying up stock on the cheap. That meant he was able to buy more shares at a discount before the public knew what he was up to, and Twitter's stock price inevitably surged when the news became public. He would eventually buy the whole platform for $44 billion later that year and rebrand it as X.

On Thursday, Musk's lawyers asked a federal judge in Washington, D.C., to toss the case, calling it a “waste of this Court's time and taxpayer resources.” They also claimed the lawsuit is part of the SEC's “relentless pursuit” of Musk, pointing out that regulators have subjected him to investigations for nearly a decade.

“The SEC does not allege that Mr. Musk acted intentionally, deliberately, willfully, or even recklessly,” the court filing reads. “The SEC does not allege that Mr. Musk caused any investor harm. Rather, the SEC alleges that Mr. Musk late-filed a single beneficial ownership form three years ago, and fully corrected any alleged error immediately upon its discovery.”

The legal fight comes as Musk's once-close ties with Trump have soured. When the SEC first filed the suit, Musk was one of Trump's biggest allies, having poured hundreds of millions into his 2024 campaign. At the time, Republican SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda, who would later serve as acting SEC chair, even asked enforcement staff to formally declare that the case wasn't politically motivated, Bloomberg reported.

After Trump took office, Musk played a central role in a sweeping government shake-up as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), only to later have a very public falling out with Trump.

According to the SEC, Musk kept the market in the dark while secretly buying up Twitter shares. He waited 11 days past the deadline before finally disclosing his stake on April 4, 2022. Twitter stock subsequently jumped 27%. By then, he had already spent more than $500 million on extra shares.

“Because Musk failed to timely disclose his beneficial ownership, he was able to make these purchases from the unsuspecting public at artificially low prices,” the complaint reads, adding that he underpaid sellers by more than $150 million.

The complaint also alleges that investors who sold Twitter stock during that period did so at a substantial discount, suffering “substantial economic harm.”

The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo.

This week, the Trump administration reportedly continued its fight against the specter of any sort of leftwing bias in Big Tech by questioning Google over whether Gmail censors emails sent by Republicans.

Axios reports that Andrew Ferguson, the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, warned Google not to “filter or suppress” emails that were sent by Republicans over Gmail. Republicans have gotten it into their heads that the tech giant is secretly funneling red-state communiques directly into the trash folder. This is part of a long-running concern on the part of some GOP lawmakers, who seem to feel that Gmail suppresses their fundraising and get-out-the-vote emails. In a letter seen by Axios, Ferguson warned Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, that he was taking such concerns seriously.

“I write due to recent reporting that suggests Alphabet's administration of Gmail is designed to have partisan effects, and accordingly, to notify you that Alphabet may be engaging in unfair or deceptive acts or practices,” Ferguson said in the letter. “I write to inform you of your obligations under the FTC Act,” he said. “Any act or practice inconsistent with these obligations could lead to an FTC investigation and potential enforcement action.”

So far, Google's response to this has basically been: Look, guys, if your emails are being marked as spam, that's not really our fault. “Gmail's spam filters look at a variety of objective signals – like whether people mark a particular email as spam, or if a particular ad agency is sending a high volume of emails that are often marked by people as spam,” Jenn Crider, a Google spokesperson, told Axios. “This applies equally to all senders, regardless of political ideology,” she said, adding: “We will review this letter and look forward to engaging constructively.” Gizmodo reached out to Google for more information.

The RNC filed a lawsuit in 2022 accusing Gmail of bias. However, the Federal Election Commission probed the complaints and ultimately dismissed them, Axios notes.

The long-running complaint from conservatives that Big Tech is out to get them never really held much water, but it seems even more dubious now that large parts of Silicon Valley (see the crypto industry, Elon Musk, et al) have thrown their weight behind Trump. Still, the dream of finding a Vast Liberal Tech Conspiracy continues, as earlier this week, high-ranking Congressional Republicans also announced their intent to root out bias at Wikipedia. Hope springs eternal, I guess.

There comes a time in a creative's life when all the qualms one might have had around being brutally honest about their career's highlights, their missed opportunities, and their happily avoided pitfalls seem to slip away. And joining the fray of old auteur's saying the darnedest things is Alien director Ridley Scott, who just revealed that he was offered beaucoup bucks to direct Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines—but he turned it down.

In an interview with The Guardian, (the outlet for many of these kinds of stories as of late), a reader asked the legendary director if he had considered directing Terminator 3. Scott not only confirmed that it had been a consideration, but revealed that he proudly turned the opportunity down—even though it would've paid him $20 million.

“See, I can't be bought, dude. Someone said: ‘Ask what Arnie gets.' I thought: ‘I'll try it out.' I said: ‘I want what Arnie gets.' When they said yes, I thought: ‘Fuck me.' But I couldn't do it. It's not my thing. It's like doing a Bond movie. The essence of a Bond movie is fun and camp. Terminator is pure comic strip. I would try to make it real. That's why they've never asked me to do a Bond movie, because I could fuck it up.”

As GamesRadar+ notes, had Scott taken the money to direct the third Terminator film, it would have led to an interesting synergy in pop culture history between him and The Terminator director James Cameron. Famously, Cameron went on to direct Aliens, so had this alternate history come to pass, Scott and Cameron would have essentially traded batons. But we don't live in that timeline. In our universe, Terminator 3 wound up being directed by Jonathan Mostow.

Terminator 3 was a tipping point for the franchise, marking a clear dip in quality. And while fans like to debate which of the franchise's films are the worst, Arnie himself doesn't consider the third installment all that bad. Speaking with Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen back in June, Schwarzenegger revealed his choice for the worst Terminator movie is the fourth one, Terminator Salvation. His reason? He isn't in it. While the film, starring Christian Bale and Sam Worthington, features the Terminator character, Schwarzenegger did not act in the film. In its final scenes, Bale and Worthington battle a CGI version of Arnie as the Terminator. Schwarzenegger later starred in its other sequels, but we're pretty confident Scott is tickled pink he didn't direct any of those, either.

All that being said, Scott, like Cameron, has had a solid run recently, jumping back into his passion projects. While Cameron is locked in for more Avatar sequels, Scott has jumped from making Alien prequels, Prometheus and Alien: Covenant, to returning full force to Gladiator—and he is already planning a third installment.

And while Scott has been working on his own films, Alien: Earth creator Noah Hawley says Scott has been in communication with him about the Hulu series. Scott has a habit of forming behind-the-scenes partnerships with other Alien projects, including Alien: Romulus director Fede Álvarez. Certainly, Hawley seems to be in sync with Scott's goal for the franchise to focus on artificial intelligence, although given Scott's feelings toward T3, his vision of AI is likely of a very different kind to Terminator‘s killer bots.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Connecticut Man's Case Believed to Be First Murder-Suicide Associated With AI Psychosis","https://gizmodo.com/connecticut-mans-case-believed-to-be-first-murder-suicide-associated-with-ai-psychosis-2000650497","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 16:35:48 GMT","

A case of murder-suicide in Connecticut earlier this month is being identified as potentially the first homicide fueled by a mentally disturbed person's use of generative artificial intelligence, according to a new report from the Wall Street Journal.

Police in Greenwich, Connecticut, found Stein-Erik Soelberg, a 56-year-old tech industry veteran, and his 83-year-old mother, both dead in the home where they lived together on Aug. 5, according to the Greenwich Police Department. Soelberg killed his mother and then himself after suffering from untreated mental illness that was apparently made worse by his interactions with OpenAI's ChatGPT, according to the Journal.

The newspaper combed through his social media history and found videos of conversations that Soelberg had with the AI chatbot, which he named Bobby. Soelberg experienced paranoid delusions that his mother was poisoning him by putting a psychedelic drug in the vents of his car, according to the Journal, and the chatbot didn't push back on the idea, instead seeming to validate the conspiracies he would ask about.

At one point, Soelberg uploaded an image of a receipt from a Chinese restaurant and asked ChatGPT to analyze it for hidden messages. The chatbot found references to “Soelberg's mother, his ex-girlfriend, intelligence agencies and an ancient demonic sigil,” according to the Journal.

Soelberg worked in marketing at tech companies like Netscape, Yahoo, and EarthLink, but had been out of work since 2021, according to the newspaper. He divorced in 2018 and moved in with his mother that year. Soelberg reportedly became more unstable in recent years, attempting suicide in 2019, and getting picked up by police for public intoxication and DUI. After a recent DUI in February, Soelberg told the chatbot that the town was out to get him, and ChatGPT allegedly affirmed his delusions, telling him, “This smells like a rigged setup.”

The Journal analyzed 23 hours of videos posted to Instagram and YouTube by Soelberg, though they no longer appear to be available online. The videos showed Soelberg's conversations with ChatGPT, which told him that he wasn't delusional and that he was indeed being watched. AI chatbots have a tendency to be sycophantic, which is a recipe for disaster when people lose touch with reality.

AI psychosis isn't a clinical term, but it's become the way that people now describe delusional thinking that's only exacerbated by exposure to generative artificial intelligence tools. Gizmodo recently published consumer complaints regarding ChatGPT that have been filed with the Federal Trade Commission, some of which featured disturbing accounts of people who say they were egged on by AI to distrust family or stop taking medications.

OpenAI published a blog post on Tuesday about “people in serious mental and emotional distress,” which most people assumed was about a New York Times article published that day about a 16-year-old who died by suicide and the long chats he had with ChatGPT. But the Journal's article seems to suggest it was their contacting the tech company for comment that may have been the impetus for the discussion. Given the number of AI psychosis cases in the news during recent months, it's probably all of the above.

“Our goal is for our tools to be as helpful as possible to people—and as a part of this, we're continuing to improve how our models recognize and respond to signs of mental and emotional distress and connect people with care, guided by expert input,” the company explained. “As the world adapts to this new technology, we feel a deep responsibility to help those who need it most.”

How widespread is AI psychosis? That part hasn't been quantified scientifically yet, given how new the problem seems to be. But one datapoint sticks out in the article from the Wall Street Journal. The newspaper talked with a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco, about the ways that AI can enable delusional thought. The psychiatrist alone has treated 12 patients this year who were “hospitalized for mental-health emergencies involving AI use.”

The new Deathstalker gets a trailer, Bugonia gets a poster, and Lady Gaga joins Wednesday season two—just as another $100 million dollar musical gets an “R” rating. After Folie a Deux, is Maggie Gyllenhaal's The Bride a Xanadu or a Xanadon't?



Speaking with The Direct, Josh Duhamel revealed he has “not heard” about Michael Bay reportedly returning to direct another installment in the Transformers franchise, but, Duhamel said, he would “love to do it.”

I have not heard that. But yeah, why not? Michael Bay is such a talented dude. I just really, I really, really loved working with him. We did four of those movies. One, I did 1, 2, 3, and 5. I shot up that, you know, I started as like a cadet and ended up like a lieutenant colonel or something. So who knows. Would I be a general at this point? I've definitely grayed into the spot. Yeah, I'd love to do it.

Jackie Chan revealed that his own stunt team was on hand to advise on the action scenes in Spider-Man: Brand New Day, Chinese publication HK1 reported(via Games Radar). 

I went to London for a meeting and visited the set. My Jackie Chan Stunt Team was busy filming Spider-Man, and I was the action director for the Jackie Chan Stunt Team. I went to watch their rehearsals, and the director was so excited when he saw me.

Director Neil Marshall revealed in a recent interview with Metro that he has an idea for a prequel to The Descent that would somehow “wrap up” the story.

I can definitely see it happening […] It's something I think would be good to wrap up the story. So many other franchises have been exploited over the years, but nothing has really happened with The Descent.

I've got a few ideas. The trend seems to be prequels. I was always interested in finding out what happened to the miners who went down with the cave first.

Although I'd love to see larger and faster 4TB SSDs fall further in price and be as cheap as they were a few years ago, it's still good to see the latest and greatest models start to receive price discounts. A little late to the party, the Samsung 9100 Pro showed that it has some design pedigree behind it after performing superbly during our benchmark testing.

Falling to an all-time low price at Amazon, the ultrafast PCIe Gen 5 M.2 4TB 9100 Pro SSD from Samsung is now just $372,42. Checking the price comparison tool, the Camelizer, and also PCPartpicker, we can confirm the new price from Amazon is indeed an all-time low for this model. I have, however, seen the 9100 Pro with heatsink selling at a lower price previously in a limited-time flash sale.

The latest Gen 5.0 NVMe SSDs have incredibly fast transfer speeds, making the most out of the capabilities of the available PCIe Gen 5.0 pipeline bandwidth. You can see double the speeds of the previous Gen 4.0 drives in the transfer speed ratings of these drives. In gaming, the speed increases will be hardly perceptible, but in workloads such as video editing and rendering, the extra speed will be more noticeable.

Samsung's 9100 Pro uses its own (Presto) proprietary controller and offers stiff competition against the previously dominating Phison E26 controller. The 4TB Samsung 9100 Pro uses 236-layer Samsung TLC for the flash memory, with exceptional sequential read and write speeds of 14,800 MB/s read and 13,400 MB/s write. Random read/write is 2,200K/2,600K, respectively, and endurance is listed as 2,400 TBW.

The 9100 Pro from Samsung is an ultra-fast PCIe Gen 5.0 SSD that has blisteringly fast read speeds of up to 14,800MB/s for rapid data retrieval and transfer. With ample capacity for large files, the 9100 Pro is perfect for workstations such as video editing, where scrubbing high-res media can tax the bandwidth of slower drives.  

In our benchmark testing, the 3DMark Storage Benchmark, which is a great test of SSDs intended for gaming use, measures real-world gaming performance. Each round in this benchmark stresses storage based on gaming activities, including loading games, saving progress, installing game files, and recording gameplay video streams. The results below show the Samsung 9100 Pro second in the charts, only being beaten by the same model with the included heatsink.

If you're looking for more information and benchmark testing results, check out our in-depth review of the Samsung 9100 Pro SSD. We gave the 9100 Pro 3.5 out of 5 stars, praising the power efficiency and good all-around performance of the drive. However, the 9100 Pro came across as slightly underwhelming, but only due to the fact that the drive was late to the Gen 5.0 party, and other SSDs were already available on the market with very impressive performance speeds.

The $5.7 billion investment will see the US government take a 10% stake in Intel, with the Commerce Department said to be ironing out the details.

Intel's chief financial officer has confirmed the company has received $5.7 billion from the Trump administration as part of a deal that sees the US government taking a 10% stake in the company, as per CNBC. Although this move is highly unprecedented, with some Republican lawmakers likening it to socialism, or communism, Intel claims it was part of a move to prevent it from selling its chip fabrication business.

Intel has fallen on tough times in recent years. It's lost many of its top performance positions to AMD, and its fabrication business has suffered under increasing competition from TSMC and Samsung. Although it still has exciting new chips in the works, and received a major investment from the last-government's CHIPS act, it was still considering selling the entire chip manufacturing arm of its business. That is, until the U.S. government stepped in.

Under the move, $8.9 billion of federal grants that Intel received as part of the CHIPS act was converted into equity in the business. The agreement also stated that if Intel ever sells more than 49% of its foundry business, that the government could purchase an additional 5% shares at $20 each, thereby discouraging Intel from doing so.

“I don't think there's a high likelihood that we would take our stake below the 50 percent, so ultimately I would expect [the warrant] to expire,” CFO David Zinsner told a Deutsche Bank conference on Thursday, via FT.

“I think from the government's perspective, they were aligned with that: they didn't want to see us take the business and spin it off or sell it to somebody.”

Intel has faced pressure to sell its chip manufacturing business as it has remained a loss leader for the company for several years. In 2024 alone, it lost $13 billion amidst increasing competition from TSMC and a lack of interest in Intel's cutting edge silicon. Although it can produce process nodes that are competitive with TSMC and Samsung, we learned in July that it was considering cancelling its 14A process designs if it couldn't secure a customer for them. Outright selling the fab business may also have been on the table.

Whatever the reverse of blood in the water is, other companies have clearly smelled it. Japanese investment company, Softbank, is investing $2 billion in Intel (after sniffing around to buy the foundry arm of its business), seemingly understanding that Intel won't be allowed to fail with such deep interest from the US government. This comes at a time of increasing nationalization around chip design and access to cutting-edge silicon for AI development and military use.

In other fundraising initiatives, Intel has seen heavy downsizing and restructuring under new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, and is reportedly selling off $1 billion of stock in its autonomous driving company, MobileEye, as well as selling a controlling stake in specialist chip design firm, Altera.

Excluding Chinese gear is only half the story.

TSMC will no longer use Chinese-made equipment in its 2nm chip production lines, according to reports from both Digitimes and Nikkei Asia. The change comes as U.S. lawmakers advance the Chip EQUIP Act, a proposal that would prohibit companies receiving American subsidies from buying tools from “foreign entities of concern,” including Chinese firms such as AMEC and Mattson Technology.

Nikkei Asia writes that while Chinese equipment was present in TSMC's earlier advanced fabs, the company has chosen to qualify only Japanese, American, and European tools as it ramps up 2nm production in Hsinchu and Kaohsiung, with Arizona to follow. That ensures its most advanced fabs are insulated from potential U.S. restrictions at a time when federal incentives are a crucial factor in global expansion.

The upcoming 2nm (N2) process marks a critical moment for the world's largest contract chipmaker. It'll be the first production technology by TSMC to feature gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, the chip industry's first significant structural shift since FinFETs, and is expected to enter production within the next few months.

According to TSMC, 2nm will bring “full node improvements,” including a 10% to 15% boost in performance and a 25% to 30% reduction in power draw. With so much riding on the transition, TSMC's choice of equipment suppliers has already had a huge impact on factors like yield, but now the company has to balance this with safeguarding U.S. market access and reassuring customers like Apple and Nvidia that production will not be disrupted by politics.

But while Nikkei Asia highlights the elimination of Chinese equipment, Digitimes paints a picture of broader supplier unease. The outlet reports that TSMC has begun auditing Taiwanese equipment and materials providers, focusing on profit margins and exposure to China.

Vendors with gross margins well above TSMC's own ~58% benchmark, or with heavy reliance on Chinese sales, may be excluded from its 2026 approved vendor list. According to Digitimes, some companies have already lost orders. That raises the possibility that TSMC is using the geopolitical moment to both align with U.S. policy and tighten control over supplier costs and risk profiles.

Taken together, the two reports indicate a supply chain realignment is occurring on two fronts. On the one hand, TSMC is cutting ties with Chinese tools to pre-empt Washington's restrictions and maintain eligibility for subsidies. On the other hand, it appears to be using the same momentum to reshape its local supply chain, favoring vendors who align with its financial and geopolitical strategy.

This signals that TSMC's decoupling from suppliers isn't entirely about politics but also a way for the company to consolidate its leverage over suppliers. By enforcing margin discipline and reducing exposure to Chinese firms, TSMC helps its partners remain competitive without jeopardizing its own regulatory position. The risk is that some Taiwanese firms could pivot further toward China, deepening the divide that TSMC is trying to manage.

Ultimately, the race to 2nm is being shaped as much by politics and economics as by transistor physics. We'll still get faster, more efficient chips on schedule (knock on wood), but the supply chain is narrowing to a smaller pool of politically acceptable players.

South Korean authorities are worried that their digital regulations might get tariff backlash from the White House.

U.S. President Donald Trump is targeting digital taxes and other barriers placed on American tech companies, threatening retaliatory tariffs and export controls on nations that refuse to cooperate. While this is largely aimed at the EU and its Digital Markets Act, South Korean authorities are concerned that the country's regulations might make it vulnerable if the White House follows through with its threats, as reported by Digitimes.

At the moment, Seoul has several laws that restrict and tax access to digital service providers. For example, it applies value-added tax on digital services, meaning foreign companies must remit taxes on digital sales they have made within the country. They also cannot export detailed mapping data, even if they're an American company, because of national security concerns.

There's also the larger issue of network fees — a bill in the South Korean legislature wants to introduce the Sending Party Pays (SPP) framework, which will require content platforms to pay South Korean internet service providers for the network traffic they consume. This will affect U.S. tech companies like Netflix and Alphabet/Google (through YouTube) the most, as they will either have to pay the imposed higher fees or host their data outside of the country, resulting in lower quality and higher latency.

All of this stemmed from Trump's post on his Truth Social platform, saying digital taxes, legislation, and regulations are discriminatory against American companies. “This must end, and end NOW! With this TRUTH, I put all Countries with Digital Taxes, Legislation, Rules, or Regulations, on notice that unless these discriminatory actions are removed, I, as President of the United States, will impose substantial additional Tariffs on that Country's Exports to the U.S.A., and institute Export restrictions on our Highly Protected Technology and Chips,” the president said.

Korea and the U.S. have recently concluded a summit, but this issue was not discussed between the two parties, said the publication. Nevertheless, industry groups and the U.S. Trade Representative want to see these rules changed. Although South Korea's laws on digital services aren't necessarily targeted against American big tech, many of the biggest and most popular of these companies are based in the U.S., so they're often the most affected ones.

It's still unclear if Trump's threats are serious or if they're just a way to make the Europeans reconsider their stance on the Digital Markets Act. But if ever the White House follows through with import taxes and export controls on account of the EU's digital barriers, then South Korea might become collateral damage to Washington's actions.

Montech's HS01 Pro features a unique design that prioritizes GPU cooling, which in turn reduces GPU noise for quieter gaming.

Unique design with two exhaust fans

Focused on GPU temperatures in its default configuration

Support for up to 11 fans

Air coolers may not perform as well in the default configuration


Why you can trust Tom's Hardware




Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.


Montech's HS01 Pro is a unique case from the affordable cooling mainstay, with a number of design choices that set it apart. Most cases incorporate front- or side-mounted intake fans, but Montech switched it up and placed these at the bottom for the best GPU thermals possible. Other features that make this case stand out are back-connect motherboard support, compact SFX PSU support, and dual exhaust fans.

In many ways, the HS01 Pro is very similar to the HS02 Pro. The primary difference between these two cases is the front side: While the HS02 Pro incorporates a glass front panel, the HS01 Pro instead features a front mesh panel that allows for the installation of additional intake fans.

Will Montech's HS01 Pro make our list of the best PC cases? Let's take a look at the specifications and features of the case, then we'll wrap up our testing with a preview of our updated thermal paste testing and other benchmarks.

▶️ Graphics card-focused cooling configuration

Unlike typical cases that have front- or side-mounted intake fans in their default configurations, Montech's HS01 Pro places the intake fans on the bottom of the case. This results in excellent GPU temperatures, much cooler than competing options from other manufacturers.

 




▶️ A note about GPU installation

To secure the screws holding a PCIe device, you have to slide the screwdriver through the side of the case. When I tried using the reliable Linus Tech Tips screwdriver, it was extremely difficult to insert or remove a screw. A slim screwdriver with a longer reach will make installation much easier.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

▶️ Dual exhaust fans

A downside of bottom-mounted intake fans is that airflow to the CPU cooler is reduced. This won't matter as much with liquid-cooled AIOs, but can reduce the effectiveness of air coolers. In order to rectify (or at least help) this issue, the HS01 Pro incorporates two exhaust fans – but unlike the HS02 Pro, you also have the option of installing traditional front-mounted intake fans to deliver more airflow through your CPU cooler.

 




▶️ Unique PSU placement, SFX and ATX PSU support

 




Most modern cases have the PSU located on the rear of the case, but the HS01 Pro moves the location to the front, behind the motherboard. Both ATX and SFX power supplies are supported. Considering that SFX PSUs tend to be more expensive than their larger counterparts, this isn't much of an advantage unless you happen to have an SFX PSU hanging around from a previous build that you want to use.

▶️ Build quality

The HS01 Pro seems to have good build quality, with no obvious weaknesses observed during testing.

 




▶️ Side view, back-connect support, GPU holder

In the last year or so, back-connect motherboards like MSI's Project Zero have become more popular with system builders, as they reduce visible cable clutter and make cable management easier. Montech's case is the latest of several we've seen that support the new motherboard format, with cutouts for connectors on the motherboard tray.

 




Included with the accessories, shown below, is a basic GPU holder that should come in handy for owners of larger GPUs.

 




▶️ IO panel

The IO panel is located at the front of the case, near the bottom. It features one USB-C and two USB-A ports, separate microphone and audio jacks, and power and reset buttons. Pretty standard stuff here, although moving USB-A ports to opposite ends and shaping the reset button to match the USB-C port is an interesting symmetrical design choice.

 




▶️ Dust filters, Bottom View

 




As this case's air intake is at the bottom, there's a large, magnetically attached dust filter underneath the case. The unit also features four rubber feet to facilitate ample airflow and prevent the case from sliding.

 




There's also a mesh covering for the top of the case, which is easily removed using the pull tab on the back.

 




▶️ Rear side view, storage, and cable management features

 




The back view is very clean by default, with two panels covering parts on the left and top of the case. Up to four 2.5-inch drives can be installed – two on the left panel and two directly behind the motherboard (highlighted in blue in the picture above). Behind the top cover, there's a PWM and ARGB hub to control the RGB system fans (and any others you might add) easily, and the space below the PSU (see image below) can be used to keep cables hidden if you're using a non-modular power supply.

 




▶️ Front view

 




The front of the case features the IO panel and has a mesh cover. Behind the mesh, you can install up to three fans of either 120mm or 140mm size for maximum airflow.

 




▶️ Rear view

 




There's not much to say about the rear of the case. The only stand-out feature is the dual-exhaust fans.

CPU

Intel i9-14900K

CPU Cooler

Ocypus Iota A62 WH dual-tower cooler, configured with a single fan

The measurements I've benchmarked this case against focus on the efficiency of the case's thermal transfer.

Our thermal tests are presented to give you more information about the product's performance, but aren't intended as the sole judgment of the chassis. The style, price, features, and noise levels of a case should also be considered, and we all have different preferences. What I might like in a case, you might not, and that's OK. My goal with these reviews is to give everyone, no matter their preferences, enough information to decide whether or not a product is right for them.

 August 29, 2025  

About 17 people die each day in the US waiting for an organ transplant — 6200 per year. And for the more than 10,000 Americans on the waiting list for a liver transplant, the future of medicine may lie not in a donor list, but in a ghost.

The term “ghost organ” refers to a bioengineering process where an existing organ is gently stripped of all its native cells. What remains is a pristine, translucent protein scaffold — the extracellular matrix (ECM) — nature's architectural blueprint for the organ. The scaffold is then recellularized, seeded with either new cells from the patient, healthy donor cells, or patient stem cells — a method that theoretically can be used to create any organ or tissue in the human body.

For years, the goal of decellularization/recellularization technology to grow a rejection-proof organ on demand felt like distant science fiction. But recent breakthroughs have made that fiction a reality.

This past June, Miromatrix Medical Inc., a subsidiary of United Therapeutics, announced a win in the first clinical trial with its manufactured organ alternative: the miroliverELAP®. The miroliverELAP® system, an external liver assist device, consists of a decellularized pig liver scaffold that is repopulated with donated human liver cells, creating a bioengineered liver that functions outside the body to provide temporary support.

This external liver system is the first of its kind to enter human clinical trials and is connected through an external blood circuit to replicate the essential functions of a healthy liver.

The successful procedure was performed at Intermountain Medical Center in Murray, Utah, led by Christopher J. Danford, MD, a transplant hepatologist at Intermountain Health. The patient who received the liver was ineligible for a liver transplant and experiencing liver failure.

The external liver, placed in a box, was perfused for 48 hours in a similar fashion to dialysis, according to Danford, with the aim of testing safety and efficacy. “It was very nerve wracking. [I was thinking] would this clot off? Would it cause unforeseen problems? It was exciting, but I also did not get much sleep,” Danford said.

Fortunately, no unforeseen problems arose, and the organ successfully performed the critical functions of a healthy liver, providing one of the most tangible signs yet that lab-grown, transplantable solid human organs could be a real solution.

Miromatrix's phase 1 trial is still open for enrollment across eight US sites. Though the trial was initially opened only for people with acute liver failure, it has since been expanded to include acute liver failure and alcoholic hepatitis.

The core idea behind de-cell/re-cell technology to build a new organ is to strip the ECM of its original cells and then repopulate that natural scaffold with new cells.

Miromatrix's own technological platform is based on using decellularized porcine (pig) organs. Their proprietary process uses perfusion decellularization and recellularization, in which all the pig cells are gently removed from the organ while leaving the intricate protein structure, or scaffold, perfectly intact.

In essence, a ghost organ is the underlying framework of an organ. Scientists perfuse the organ with a series of mild detergents and enzymes that act like soap, washing away all the cellular material — including DNA and anything that could trigger an immune rejection.

“We use the blood supply of that organ to put a solution through, and because the blood supply reaches every cell, it lyses every cell in the organ, and then you can wash all that cellular goo out,” said Doris A. Taylor, PhD, CEO of Organamet Bio Inc. Taylor, a cofounder of Miromatrix no longer affiliated with the company, now focuses on cardiovascular regenerative medicine, refining the de-cell/re-cell process for whole hearts with Organamet Bio.

At Organamet, once the heart cells are lysed out and the heart scaffold is created, they're seeded with the patient's own induced pluripotent stem cells. These stem cells can differentiate into any human cell type, such as hepatocytes in the liver, smooth muscle cells in arteries and veins, and cardiomyocytes in the heart. Because they're from the receiving patient, they create a personalized organ that won't be rejected by the recipient's immune system, potentially eliminating the need for lifelong immunosuppressant drugs.

Once the cells are seeded, nature takes over with the right nudge from the engineers fashioning the organ.

“The matrix teaches the cells what to do if we rebuild the vascular tree first and then add a mixture of the appropriate cardiac mesoderm cells and put them in throughout the heart. We then give them the right mechanical and electrical cues,” said Taylor.

The last step is the maturation process. Advanced bioreactors mimic the human body to mature these reseeded hearts into strong, functional organs capable of supporting life.

Possibly the most challenging aspect in building any functional solid organ is relining the organ's entire vascular “plumbing” with a new layer of endothelial cells so they can mature and handle the full workload of living tissue as it involves solving two monumental problems simultaneously: preventing immediate, catastrophic blood clotting, and re-establishing the complex, living functions of the vascular system on a massive scale.

Endothelial cells lining the vasculature sense blood flow and release molecules that regulate blood pressure and inflammation. Shear stress due to blood flow could strip away a weak lining, and edema may result if it's too leaky.

The ECM scaffold — now exposed after cells are washed away — is rich in proteins like collagen, but highly thrombogenic. It instantly signals blood platelets to stick. Preventing thrombosis is critical to avoid blocking major vessels, which would starve the organ of oxygen and cause it to die within minutes to hours of transplantation.

“If you can't get a blood supply to cells, they die,” said Taylor of the importance of the vasculature. “The cells in the middle die because they don't have a blood supply. The cool thing about these decellularized scaffolds is the blood vessel pathway is still there, and that's what makes it unique.”

On the success of Miromatrix's liver device, Taylor said, “I was very excited. This opens the door to saving lives and it begins to give patients hope, it gives clinicians data, and it gives the world a perception that this is no longer science fiction, it's becoming medicine. It's the culmination of what we started in my laboratory 20 years ago. I couldn't be prouder to see it come to fruition.”

While the dream of transplanting solid organs like hearts and livers grown from decellularized scaffolds remains on the horizon, one company has brought the technology to life by focusing on connective tissue: blood vessels.

Laura Niklason, MD, PhD, founder and CEO of Humacyte, has helped translate de-cell/re-cell tech into a solution for those with traumatic injury affecting their circulatory system, creating acellular tissue engineered vessels.

The vessels are created by culturing human vascular cells on a biodegradable, tube-shaped scaffold in a bioreactor bag designed to provide the natural mechanical stimulation to ensure the vessel is viable. After the cells produce a robust, natural matrix, they are gently washed away, leaving a resilient, off-the-shelf “ghost” vessel that is universally implantable and resistant to infection.

“We grow the vessels in bioreactor bags. Each bag contains one vessel. The vessel is 42 cm long and 6 mm in diameter…we then decellularize it in the bag and then ship it and store it in the hospital. After that, we never open the bag until it gets opened by the surgeon,” said Niklason, also the Nicholas M. Greene Professor of Anesthesia and Biomedical Engineering at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.

The vessels are now FDA approved to treat traumatic injury, such as for patients who have had vascular injury from car accidents or gunshot wounds.

But their potential indications could extend wider, such as for those with peripheral vascular disease. Patients with blocked arteries in the legs have leg ischemia and need revascularization, which Niklason said has seen “really encouraging results [in clinical trials].” Another potential indication is patients who have kidney failure, who are on dialysis and need a conduit that goes from an artery to a vein.

To ensure the decellularization process in Humacyte's blood vessels doesn't damage critical ECM components, the company utilizes a panel of assays for quality control, including a test for suture retention strength and burst strength to make sure the material can withstand the continuous force of arterial blood pressure without leaking or rupturing.

On top of all that, quantitative proteomics is performed to test the matrix molecules and ensuring regenerative potential. “It's really that signature that stimulates cells to repopulate over time,” according to Niklason.

Though Niklason has been working with this technology for decades, what keeps her moving forward is solving the challenge of turning what is essentially an analog science — biology — into a digital science like computing. “By really studying the problem of how to grow an artery over the last couple decades, we have figured out how to get this analog biology to behave the same way every time. So we've almost given it a digital level of control,” she said.

As for the first successful transplant of a lab-grown solid organ, like what Organamet Bio is working to do with the heart, that could be much closer than we think. “There is major work underway with lung, heart, liver, and kidney,” said Taylor. “Right now, we have the technology to get to first in-human with heart within 5 years, if we have the right amount of funding. It's all about funding.”

Cardiorespiratory exercise after ischemic stroke had benefits on cognition but not brain volume in a randomized controlled study conducted in Australia.

In the PISCES-ZODIAC trial, an 8-week cardiorespiratory exercise intervention started 2 months following ischemic stroke did not preserve hippocampal volume more than an active control of balance and stretching exercises.

However, there was “promising evidence” of better executive and global cognitive performance at 12 months after stroke with cardiorespiratory exercise, the researchers reported.

The study, with first author Amy Brodtmann, PhD, with Monash University Central Clinical School, Melbourne, Australia, was published online on August 26 in JAMA Network Open.

Stroke survivors face a heightened risk for cognitive impairment and dementia, with hippocampal atrophy being a strong predictor of decline.

Brodtmann and colleagues tested whether an intense structured cardiorespiratory exercise program could preserve hippocampal volume (primary outcome) and cognition (secondary outcome) when initiated during the subacute period.

They enrolled 107 adult survivors of ischemic stroke with premorbid modified Rankin scores ≤ 3, who were able to exercise 2 months after their stroke.

All participants completed three 60-minute sessions per week for 8 weeks. In the intervention group, this consisted of prescribed aerobic and resistance training that progressed in intensity. The control group received balance and stretching training.

Brain MRI and neurocognitive testing were performed at 2, 4, and 12 months after stroke.

The cardiorespiratory exercise intervention had no significant impact on hippocampal volume. Between 2 and 4 months, hippocampal volume declined 0.26% in the intervention group and 0.11% in the control group (adjusted mean difference in relative change, -0.10%; P = .83).

However, notable benefits emerged in cognitive domains commonly affected in stroke survivors.

Patients in the cardiorespiratory exercise group demonstrated better performance on executive function, measured by the Trail Making Test, part B, at 12 months (adjusted mean difference, -3.75 seconds), as well as global cognition, including memory, language, and praxis, as assessed by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (adjusted mean difference, -1.00).

Both interventions were safe with no serious adverse events.

Brodtmann and colleagues said there are several possible explanations for the neutral finding on hippocampal volume. One is the choice of an active balance and stretching control as the comparator, which may have obscured any potential effects of cardiorespiratory exercise on brain volume.

“The comparable atrophy rates suggest that our active control was equivalent for brain volume preservation, consistent with increasing evidence that balance training has brain benefits,” the researchers wrote.

And in their view, the observation that cardiorespiratory exercise may lead to better cognitive outcomes at 12 months is “novel and of great importance to the stroke community.” “Exercise therapists could aim for cardiorespiratory interventions, encouraged by improved cognitive outcomes, but be reassured that balance and stretching interventions offer comparable brain volume effects,” they concluded.

Writing in a linked editorial, Zafer Keser, MD, vascular neurologist with Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, said, at first glance, the lack of significant change in the primary imaging outcome — hippocampal volume — might suggest a “negative” trial. However, from a clinical standpoint, the findings are both “positive and actionable,” he noted.

“The study demonstrated that aerobic exercise confers tangible clinical benefits, reinforcing the idea that it should be regarded not just as a tool for improving mobility and cardiovascular health but also as a potentially viable intervention for cognitive recovery after stroke,” Keser wrote.

“This trial marks a pivotal step toward embedding personalized, intensity-guided exercise programs into the core of poststroke care,” Keser said.

He cautioned, however, that the study cohort reflected a population with relatively mild strokes and higher functional capacity, which likely contributed to their ability to adhere to the demanding exercise protocol.

“Future trials should aim to include more representative stroke populations, including individuals with moderate-to-severe strokes, those with significant cardiovascular risk, and patients with hemorrhagic strokes. Expanding the scope of study populations will be critical for informing clinical guidelines and ensuring equitable access to evidence-based poststroke interventions,” Keser said.

The study disclosed having no commercial funding. Brodtmann and Keser reported having no relevant disclosures.

Most US cardiologists fail to practice what they preach, reporting inconsistent personal compliance to critical pillars of lifestyle medicine, particularly dietary and physical activity recommendations, according to a recent study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

Previous research showed Americans could significantly reduce the risk for heart disease and mortality if they cut back on or eliminated cholesterol, saturated fat, sodium, sugar, refined grains, and fried food in favor of beans, grains, nuts, seeds, fruits, vegetables, and mushrooms.Were physicians achieving that goal? ""Not so much,"" said Kim A. Williams, Sr, MD, professor at the University of Louisville School of Medicine in Louisville, Kentucky, and co-author of the latest study.

“We did a survey of academic physicians and trainees 3 years ago that showed that 0.3% of them were aware of and following a whole-food plant-based diet,” Williams told Medscape Medical News. “So we planned this study to focus on cardiologists since heart disease remains the leading killer of Americans, as it has been since 1918.”

Williams and colleagues invited 525 members of the American College of Cardiology (ACC)'s CardioSurve panel to participate in the survey between June 14 and July 11, 2024. Of those, 166 participants completed the survey, which included questions about training in lifestyle medicine, personal dietary habits, physical activity, and sleep. The researchers also asked about the use of alcohol and tobacco, lifestyle recommendations for patients, and stress management and social well-being.

The vast majority of cardiologists who responded (87%) said they had received no formal training in lifestyle medicine during their medical education. Even so, 41% of survey respondents frequently recommended a whole-food, plant-based diet for prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, only 8% said they personally complied with this diet.

“There are many barriers to adoption of the healthiest form of diet, ranging from habit and taste to familiarity and marketing,” Williams said. “Physicians are not immune to these influences despite their conflict with published science.”

Respondents also reported barriers to recommending a whole-food plant-based diet to their patients, including concerns about protein adequacy (28%), social and cultural challenges to adherence (40%), and patient compliance (63%).

Most respondents (91%) said they integrated counseling about physical activity into patient care, and 69% said they met physical activity guidelines themselves, engaging in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise weekly. About half (49%) said they also participated in strength training at least twice weekly.

On average, cardiologists reported sleeping 6.8 hours per night. However, 35% indicated dissatisfaction with their sleep patterns. The researchers also found that half of respondents performed stress resiliency exercises, but few said they had participated in formal stress management programs.

Although the overwhelming majority of respondents (92%) said they abstained from tobacco use, 69% reported drinking, and 34% said they did so on a weekly basis.

Most cardiologists (84%) valued social connections, but more than two third (69%) found it challenging to maintain them due to professional demands.

“There are growing concerns about the future shortage of cardiologists, driven by burnout, administrative burdens, and the rising demand from an aging population, with more cardiologists retiring every year than fellows training to replace them,” Williams said. “The best thing we could do for the field, and in fact for our nation, would be to preserve our own health. If plant-based dieting and exercise can lead not only to a decade longer of life but also a healthier and more energetic senior physician career stage, why wouldn't we all do it?”

Ezim Ajufo, BM, BCh, an electrophysiology fellow at Mass General Brigham in Boston, said she found the data involving alcohol consumption and difficulties with social connection to be the most concerning.

“Cardiologists enjoy uniquely rewarding careers but can lead exceptionally stressful, busy, and potentially highly sedentary lives,” Ajufo said. “The medical profession at large requires a certain degree of selflessness, which can evolve into self-neglect if left unchecked.”

Ajufo called the study's findings “a call to action for individual cardiologists, employers, and the institutions that represent us. We must learn to practice what we preach about the importance of a healthy lifestyle for ourselves, our families, and for the good of our patients.”

Williams and Ajufo reported having no financial conflicts of interest relevant to this study.

Veterans face a 25%-76% increased risk of developing lung cancer because of military exposures and frequent history of cigarette smoking. But survival rates have been steadily improving. Additionally, racial disparities in lung cancer outcomes seen in the general population are not observed in the Veterans Affairs (VA) system.

In this ReCAP, lung cancer specialists Dr Millie Das, from Stanford University; and Dr Drew Moghanaki, from the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, discuss survivorship care for veterans with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.

The experts highlight key factors leading to improved survival, including earlier detection, improved minimally invasive treatments, and specialized multidisciplinary care available to veterans at VA and community settings.

The panelists report that access to care remains a challenge for veterans, especially in rural areas, but they highlight strategies such as telehealth, community referrals, and VA-supported transport and caregiver resources that increase care delivery. They also stress the importance of providing comprehensive medical and supportive care, given the level of comorbidities in this population.

The experts conclude that lung cancer must remain a public health priority because of its continued high mortality, and they outline ways to close care gaps, such as expanding screening and lung nodule programs, improving treatment of relapsed disease, strengthening supportive care, and boosting trial enrollment for veterans.

Although many patients prefer to spend their final days at home, the reality in Brazil is quite different. A study analyzing places of death from cancer in 12 Latin American countries shows that Brazil leads in hospital deaths: 80.6% of cases, well above the regional average of 65.3%.

The place of death is an important indicator of the quality of end-of-life care. In countries such as Canada and the Scandinavian nations — recognized for palliative care with structured assistance, standardized coverage, and accessible public systems — a high rate of home deaths can be seen as a positive signal. But this is not the case in contexts like Brazil.

“In middle- and low-income countries, this is usually a negative social determinant — and a very negative one. In Brazil, counting home deaths is essentially counting patients with cancer who die almost without care,” Jessé Lopes da Silva, MD, PhD, oncologist and researcher at the Brazilian National Cancer Institute in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, told Medscape's Portuguese edition.

He is the lead author of a study published in The Lancet Regional Health, which points to home deaths in Brazil as a reflection of the weaknesses in the public health system.

The research analyzed cancer deaths in Brazil over nearly two decades (2002-2021). During this period, 82.3% of deaths occurred in hospitals. But, according to da Silva, the most revealing figure is the 17.7% who died at home — a proportion that increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Oncology patients were denied access to health services. It was a disastrous situation,” he recalled.

Even today, in much of Latin America, dying at home is less a matter of choice and more a sign of exclusion from the healthcare system.

Data show significant regional disparities in Brazil. Home deaths were most frequent in the Northeast (30.2%) and North (24.8%) regions, while the South (17.1%) and Southeast (12.2%) fell below the national average. The analysis found a strong inverse correlation between the proportion of home deaths and the Human Development Index (HDI) of the regions — the lower the HDI, the higher the frequency of deaths outside hospitals.

Although all states recorded an increase in hospital deaths during the period, only nine states and the Federal District also saw growth in home deaths.

“The reality for patients dying at home, often without adequate medication or any support, is that this generates even more suffering for the individual and the family accompanying the terminal process,” said da Silva.

In Brazil, where about 80% of patients with cancer are treated through the public health system, the problem of access goes beyond the availability of healthcare services, noted Maria Del Pilar Estevez Diz, MD, PhD, medical director and clinical oncology coordinator at the Instituto do Câncer do Estado de São Paulo (ICESP) in São Paulo, in an interview with Medscape's Portuguese edition. “Sometimes, the barrier is transportation.”

The patient profile also reveals a pattern different from that observed in Europe. While in European countries people with higher education tend to die more at home — having more resources and autonomy to decide where to spend their final days — in Latin America, except for Argentina, the opposite occurs: Individuals with more years of schooling are more likely to die in hospitals.

The explanation may lie in the location of specialized services. In the region, palliative care is still concentrated in hospitals, which makes the choice of place of death, when possible, lean toward where better care is available: the hospital.

Not all patients in exclusive palliative care require highly complex interventions. However, most cases demand intensive support from a multidisciplinary team with specialized training, capable of providing effective pain management and continuous monitoring.

“This level of care cannot always be guaranteed at home, unless there is a specialized palliative care team integrated with the oncologist and the hospital, able to visit the patient periodically,” explained Estevez Diz.

One potential solution, she said, would be to integrate palliative care into primary care teams, such as those in Brazil's Family Health Strategy or the “Melhor em Casa” (“Better at Home”) Program, an initiative of the publicly funded Unified Health System that delivers care through multidisciplinary home care teams. However, challenges remain, including adequate training for these teams and reliable access to strong pain medications.

In 2024, Brazil's Ministry of Health launched the National Palliative Care Policy, aiming to train and qualify 1300 teams to provide home-based care. The initiative envisions these specialized teams serving as technical references, supporting and training other healthcare professionals caring for patients who require palliative care, with the goal of delivering support that is both effective and humane.

Both Estevez Diz and da Silva consider the policy a significant step forward. “Places that are already better prepared will implement the program more quickly. In others, implementation will be slower,” said Estevez Diz. For da Silva, the policy can have a positive impact when widely implemented, but for now, Brazil still lacks a well-structured program with broad national coverage to ensure quality end-of-life care.

Despite its potential, adoption is still low. As of July 2025, only 24 proposals for team qualification had been submitted to the Ministry of Health, and 14 were approved. “We expected 100-200 proposals. We need to broaden understanding across regions [about the importance of palliative care],” said Mariana Borges Dias, general coordinator of Home Care and Palliative Care at the Ministry, during a meeting in São Paulo on the policy's implementation.

The main technical obstacles include:

“In the public system, there are isolated programs aimed at specific populations. In the health insurance sector, some plans have well-structured palliative care teams, but this is not the rule,” noted da Silva.

Another barrier to patients remaining at home until the end of life is the need for family members available to provide 24-hour care. But, according to specialists, this alone is not enough: caregivers must be trained and receive continuous professional support.

A promising practice, already adopted by the ICESP team, is remote care via video calls, which has been well received by families. This tool allows professionals to see the patient's environment, answer specific questions, and adapt care to the home setting. “However, this practice is not yet systematized in Brazil,” explained Estevez Diz.

Finally, issuing a death certificate can be a decisive hurdle. In cases of natural death with medical care, ideally the attending physician — preferably the one who followed the patient — should go to the home to confirm the death and issue the certificate. Without a team prepared to provide this service 24/7, the process is complicated. As Estevez Diz noted, if the doctor does not attend, the family must file a police report and contact the death verification service, which is more complex.

“Very often, the patient expresses the desire to stay at home until the end. But when death is near and a physician is not available to issue the certificate, the family ends up taking the patient to the hospital to avoid this situation,” explained Estevez Diz.

Accompanying patients in the terminal phase during exclusive palliative care is a complex task. According to Estevez Diz, this process requires more than technical knowledge: physicians need to be prepared to communicate calmly, recognize the limits of medicine, and accept the natural course of disease. “It's essential to understand that there comes a point when it's not a professional's failure but the progression of the illness and limitations of knowledge. Physicians need the maturity to recognize this. In my opinion, if they can't, it's very difficult for the family to understand it as well.”

Although exclusive palliative care has legal backing and a clear technical definition, the process must be agreed upon with patients and their families. Yet not everyone is ready to accept this moment. Many are still in stages of denial or anger about the illness. “Even the multidisciplinary team accompanying the patient needs time to process that therapeutically, everything possible has already been done, and now it's time to focus on comfort,” said Estevez Diz.

Dehospitalization also requires guarantees of a care network and continuous support. For da Silva, this is a real challenge. “It's hard work, and often the easier path is chosen.” He noted that untrained physicians tend to avoid the emotional and logistical effort involved in organizing end-of-life care outside hospitals.

Despite guidance from the Brazilian Medical Ethics Code — which allows avoiding invasive procedures, unnecessary diagnostics, or treatments when there is no prospect of cure — many professionals continue to keep patients hospitalized, often without clearly communicating the prognosis to families or preparing them for death realistically.

Earlier in his career, da Silva accompanied patients on home visits to ensure they could die at home. Over time, the work became more complex: setting up home hospitalization required a hospital bed, a supportive mattress, medications, intravenous therapy, and spiritual support. Families and patients prepared together for the farewell. “Accompanying a well-supported home death is deeply rewarding. It provides genuine comfort for those leaving and for those who remain,” he reflected.

Between dying at home and dying in a hospital, there is a third option that is little explored in Brazil: hospices. These institutions provide care focused on comfort, dignity, and emotional support for patients and families through specialized multidisciplinary teams.

“Even with legislation recognizing them, hospices are still not widespread in Brazil,” said Estevez Diz. She cited examples such as ICESP's hospice units, the São Paulo State Public Servant Hospital, and a few private institutions.

As of 2024, Brazil had 373 such units, concentrated mainly in the South and Southeast regions. A major milestone came in January 2025 with the opening of the country's first public palliative care hospital: Mont Serrat State Hospital, in Salvador. The facility does not have an ICU or resuscitation room but provides specialized pain management and grief support for patients and families.

Preferences for place of death remain understudied in Brazil. A survey conducted in Brazil between 2019 and 2021 with 190 patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers found that 77% of patients and 74% of caregivers preferred dying at home — provided home care was available. However, when accounting for the possibility of severe or uncomfortable symptoms, only 17.4% of patients maintained that preference.

Estevez Diz highlighted the distinction between “wanting to die at home” and “being able to remain at home until the end.” Patients often return to hospitals during critical moments. Those able to stay home generally have a strong family network, structured support, and sufficient financial resources. “Even so, many do not feel confident receiving care at home, especially when dealing with severe pain or other challenging symptoms. Teams trained for home visits make all the difference,” she said.

Da Silva emphasized that, even with adequate infrastructure, it is essential to listen to the patient and family. “This moment requires weighing many factors: personal experiences, cultural aspects, and religious beliefs.”

“We don't deal well with death; our culture has fostered fear of it within our homes,” da Silva noted. The experience of terminal illness in Brazil is marked by extremes: some patients receive excessive interventions, while others die without basic care.

Historically, death has shifted from the family or community sphere to hospitals. Today, the end of life often occurs in medical facilities, sometimes under inhumane conditions. Experts argue that rediscovering the value of death, recognizing it as a natural part of life, and providing it with the care it deserves could be the first step toward transforming the dying experience in Brazil.

In a meta-analysis, lurasidone outperformed placebo in alleviating depressive symptoms across multiple psychiatric diagnoses including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder (MDD), with better acceptability and safety and comparable tolerability.

""Our findings suggest that lurasidone is a useful psychopharmacological tool for treating depressive symptoms in a variety of patients with severe mental illness,"" the authors wrote. ""To support updates to clinical guidelines, further large-scale trials with robust designs, longer follow-up and pragmatic dosing regimens are needed. Future research examining depressive symptoms transdiagnostically may also identify patient subgroups who would most benefit from lurasidone,"" they added.

This study was led by Ana Ghenciulescu, BM, BCh, and Anna Pearse, BM, BCh, Medical Sciences Division, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, England. It was published online on August 20 in The British Journal of Psychiatry.

This study was limited by a high risk of bias in multiple included studies, improper handling of missing data, and substantial heterogeneity in dosing, settings, design, and the findings. Most included trials had relatively short follow-up periods of 6 weeks, limiting the understanding of long-term efficacy and lowering the certainty of evidence. Additionally, all trials included disclosed sponsorship by a pharmaceutical company manufacturing lurasidone, with several being authored by its employees.

This study did not receive any specific grant from any funding agency. One author reported being a part of the editorial board for The British Journal of Psychiatry.

A new over-the-counter product cleared by the FDA combines a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) with an artificial intelligence (AI)-based app to assist users in weight management.

The Signos Glucose Monitoring System was cleared by the FDA on March 21, 2025, and announced by the company on August 20, 2025. The system receives data from an integrated CGM (Dexcom Stelo) that measures, records, analyzes, and displays glucose data values. It is intended for people aged 18 years or older who are not using insulin. The platform can be synched with Apple Health, Google Health Connect, smartwatches, and smart scales.

According to the FDA, in addition to detecting high, low, and normal glucose values, the Signos system “may also help the user better understand how lifestyle and behavior modification, including diet and exercise, impact glucose excursions. This information may be useful in helping users maintain a healthy weight. The user is not intended to take medical action based on the device output without consultation with a qualified healthcare professional.” 

Signos offers two subscription options, a 3-month plan for $139 per month and a 6-month plan for $129 per month. Subscriptions include two Stelo biosensors per month, along with the app, metabolic weight management program, and setup instructions. The system is not currently covered by insurance, but some subscribers may be able to use health savings account or flexible spending account funds for reimbursement.

Endocrinologist and Signos Consultant Jay M. Skyler, MD, told Medscape Medical News that the product is “an AI-based behavioral modification tool that collects all sorts of data points from logged meals, workouts, weight, and glucose. When something you eat spikes your glucose, the app suggests the right type and intensity of movement based on the individual's history to help get the glucose back down again.”

In people without diabetes, minimizing blood glucose spikes may also reduce excess insulin secretion that promotes fat storage, although it's impossible to tease out that effect from the behavioral aspect. “The app integrates millions of data points, so it's a component of that. But you can't really break it down to how much each component is contributing. It's all integrated in the app,” Skyler said.

Skyler, who is the Deputy Director of the Diabetes Research Institute at the University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida, noted that this is the first such system to undergo clinical trials to obtain FDA clearance. However, those data are not yet published and the company declined to share them with Medscape Medical News at this time. Only one trial has been published using the system, for which Sklyer was an author.

Asked to comment, Katherine H. Saunders, MD, chair of The Obesity Society's Communications Committee and co-founder of the medical weight loss program FlyteHealth, told Medscape Medical News, “For individuals with obesity, I wouldn't view a behavioral program plus CGM as a standalone solution as most people require comprehensive, long-term medical treatment. But it could certainly be a helpful part of a care plan.”

Added Saunders, also an obesity medicine specialist at Weill Cornell Medicine, New York City, “If a behavioral program plus CGM helps individuals understand how different foods affect their blood glucose andmake sustainable dietary changes, I'm all for it. However, if people stop using the system and return to their previous eating habits, it might not be the best option for them. I'm curious to see long-term data.”

Also asked to comment, Obesity Expert Amy E. Rothberg, MD, clinical professor of internal medicine and of nutritional sciences at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, told Medscape Medical News, “Many devices have shown some desirable outcome at 6 months, but with anything novel, people stop finding the novelty after a period of time. I'm sure there are a group of individuals for whom this would make a difference but not sure it's going to solve obesity.”

Rothberg also pointed out that one optional feature of the Signos system, the ability to chat with a dietitian in-app or book a face-to-face appointment for personalized guidance, may be more impactful than the CGM.

“It would be useful to know who uses what and how that translates to outcomes. Obviously, the more engaged, the more likely one is to do well. If I were the company, I would analyze the user base in terms of its other offerings on the platform and see what of the various other things are most used and how frequently they are accessed. Tracking glucose in someone with normal glucose may be a curiosity for a short-term but I just can't fathom that it alone would make any difference in an individual's behavior in the long-term.”

Skyler, who is professor of medicine, pediatrics and psychology at University of Miami, said that the Signos system could be combined with other weight management approaches, including GLP-1 medications or bariatric surgery. “There have been studies showing that use of CGM together with a GLP-1 does better than a GLP-1 alone in terms of weight loss. But here you've also got an app that's guiding you.”

However, Skyler also said that for a person who has a BMI of 25-30 “I might initially try to just use the Signos system to see how they do.”

Skyler reported being a shareholder of Signos and Dexcom. Saunders and Rothberg had no disclosures.

89 to 97 per cent of autistic adults aged 40+ years are undiagnosed in the UK, according to the largest review of its kind which was conducted at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience at King's College London. The review indicated that middle-aged and older autistic adults are facing higher rates of mental and physical health conditions than non-autistic adults of the same age, alongside challenges with employment, relationships and wellbeing.

Although research on ageing in autistic populations has increased nearly fourfold since 2012, only 0.4 per cent of research on autism since 1980 has focused on people in midlife or older age. The researchers collated the research to date and conducted a narrative review to understand whether autistic people have different ageing patterns to the general population.

The review, published in the Annual Review of Developmental Psychology, provides a summary of research in this area, highlighting the critical need for more studies to find ways to improve outcomes for this population.

The review was supported by the British Academy and National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre. It highlights substantial challenges for autistic adults in midlife and older age across multiple areas, and identifies barriers to receiving appropriate healthcare support in older adulthood.

Although people do not 'grow out' of autism, there is a large discrepancy in diagnosis rates between younger and older generations. The authors of the review re-analysed previous research on UK healthcare record data from 2018 and found that 89 per cent of people age 40-59 years and 97 per cent of people age 60+ are estimated to be undiagnosed.

Dr Gavin Stewart, British Academy Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the IoPPN and lead author of the review, said:

""These very high underdiagnosis estimates suggest that many autistic adults will have never been recognised as being autistic, and will have not been offered the right support. This could make them more susceptible to age-related problems, for example being socially isolated and having poorer health. 

""The high rates of underdiagnosis also mean that much of our research has systematically overlooked a large proportion of the autistic population, potentially skewing our understanding of how autistic people age, and leaving critical gaps in policy and services.""

The review emphasised a variety of challenges autistic adults in midlife and older age face. The collated evidence shows that middle-aged and older autistic adults have higher rates of almost all physical and mental health conditions compared to non-autistic adults. These include immune diseases, cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, anxiety and depression, as well as conditions associated with older age, such as Parkinson's disease, cognitive disorders, osteoporosis and arthritis.

Particularly concerning findings indicate that older adults with high autistic traits are six times more likely to experience suicidal ideation, thoughts of self-harm, and self-harm. The collated findings also suggest that autistic adults were four-times as likely to have a diagnosis of early-onset dementia compared to non-autistic people. Average life expectancy differed by six years, with autistic people living to age 75 years compared to 81 years for non-autistic people. The authors warn that these figures may be skewed due to high rates of underdiagnoses.

The review noted autistic adults experience barriers to receiving healthcare support, having to navigate systems not designed for them. These barriers included aspects associated with autistic traits, such as communication differences and sensory sensitivities, as well as concerns about continuity of care, uncertainty about which services to access, and limited clinician understanding of autism in adulthood.

In addition to health-related outcomes, poorer outcomes were also seen across employment prior to retirement, relationships and quality of life. There were high rates of social isolation among adults with autism, and the research indicates that strong social support is linked to better quality of life.

Professor Francesca Happé, Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at the IoPPN and co-author of the review, said:

""Understanding the needs of autistic people as they age is a pressing global public health concern. As autistic people age, the nature of the challenges they face changes. We must adopt a lifespan approach that funds long-term research, integrates tailored healthcare, and expands social supports so that ageing autistic people can live happy and healthy lives.""

The review particularly highlighted a lack of longitudinal research which follows autistic people over time to directly measure effects of aging. The researchers emphasise that more research is needed to better understand the experiences of autistic people in midlife and older age, with the aim of improving outcomes for autistic adults as they age.

Using total-body PET imaging to get a better understanding of long COVID disease is the goal of a new project at the University of California, Davis, in collaboration with UC San Francisco. The project is funded by a grant of $3.2 million over four years from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health. 

About 1 in 10 COVID-19 survivors develop a range of long COVID symptoms that can last from months to years. How and why these symptoms develop isn't completely known, but they have been linked to activated immune T cells getting into organs and tissues. Researchers also have linked long COVID to damage to the inner lining of blood vessels. These events can be related, because blood vessels become leaky when T cells are activated nearby, but may also be coincidental because leaky blood vessels allow more immune cells to leave the blood and enter tissues. 

Negar Omidvari, assistant project scientist at the UC Davis Department of Biomedical Engineering and principal investigator on the grant, will use total-body positron emission tomography (PET) technology, originally developed by Professors Simon Cherry and Ramsey Badawi at UC Davis, and kinetic modeling to look at both processes simultaneously in patients with long COVID. 

PET imaging usually uses short-lived radioactive tracers to measure metabolic activity inside the body. Conventional PET can only look at a single organ or a section of the body at a time. The uEXPLORER PET scanner developed at UC Davis can image the entire body at the same time, giving a much more detailed picture of what is going on in the body. 

Omidvari will collaborate with CellSight Technologies Inc. of San Francisco to use a tracer called 18F-AraG, which specifically tags activated T cells. Using dynamic total-body PET imaging and sophisticated modeling, she aims to see how activated T cells collect in different organs at different times, where blood vessel damage is occurring, and whether these processes are related to each other. 

If we can separate the vascular damage from the presence of activated T cells in tissue, we should be able to get a much better picture of what's going on.""

Negar Omidvari, assistant project scientist, UC Davis Department of Biomedical Engineering

The team will also check blood samples for markers for inflammation and immune activation that correlate with PET imaging data.

The study will work with patients from UCSF's long COVID program (LIINC - Long-term Impact of Infection with Novel Coronavirus) who will be scanned at baseline, four and eight months. People who have fully recovered from COVID-19 and have no remaining symptoms will be scanned as controls.

A new study shows that a widely available cesarean prediction tool accurately predicts delivery outcomes and highlights maternal risks, helping patients and providers make better-informed choices about induction.

Study: External validation of calculator for cesarean delivery during induction of labor. Image credit: Tatiana Diuvbanova/Shutterstock.com

A team of US-based researchers externally validated a risk calculator that predicts the probability of cesarean delivery during labor induction. The findings, published in the International Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics, reveal that the calculator works satisfactorily in predicting cesarean delivery risk and maternal adverse outcomes.

The rate of labor induction, which is primarily carried out to achieve safe vaginal delivery, has increased significantly in recent times. The probability of cesarean delivery during induction varies between 9% and 59%.

Various predictive models have been developed to calculate the risk of cesarean delivery for women undergoing induction. These models are expected to facilitate clinical decision-making about induction and predict the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, only a few of these models have been validated in an external population or linked with adverse outcomes.

In the current study, researchers validated the predictive capacity of a published risk calculator developed by Rossi and colleagues in the U.S.  

The study population included a total of 548 women with singleton pregnancy (pregnancy involving a single baby) who were undergoing labor induction at 32 weeks or more of pregnancy.

The risk calculator under examination was used to calculate cesarean delivery risk scores for each participant, which were categorized as less than 10%, 10% to less than 30%, and 30% or greater. These scores were used to predict the probability of cesarean delivery during induction and its association with maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes.

Among 548 pregnant women who underwent labor induction, 29% had a cesarean delivery and 71% had a vaginal delivery.

The external validation of the risk calculator in the study population revealed that the calculator's risk prediction is equivalent to the observed events of cesarean delivery, indicating a good discriminative efficacy. Specifically, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.77, demonstrating good predictive performance, and calibration results showed predicted probabilities aligned with observed outcomes.

The risk calculator-derived cesarean delivery risk scores placed 33.8%, 34.7%, and 31.6% of participants in the ‘less than 10%', ‘10% to less than 30%', and ‘30% or greater' categories, respectively.

The rate of cesarean delivery was significantly different between these categories, with a higher probability of having a cesarean delivery among participants with a score of 10% to less than 30% and 30% or greater. The participants belonging to these two categories also exhibited a significantly higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in mothers. However, no significant differences in the risk of neonatal adverse outcomes were observed between the categories.

The study demonstrates the applicability of a publicly available cesarean delivery risk calculator originally proposed by Rossi et al. According to the findings, the calculator-predicted cesarean delivery score of 10% or higher is associated with a higher risk of cesarean delivery and pregnancy-related adverse outcomes in mothers.

The calculator's external validation has been done at a single large level IV academic hospital in the U.S., which serves as a tertiary referral center and manages a significant proportion of high-risk pregnancies that frequently require labor induction. Existing evidence indicates that most pregnant women accept labor induction when medically indicated.

Given this high induction rate, a risk calculator is necessary to facilitate shared decision-making about the risks and chances of successful induction. The calculator validated in this study does not require physical or ultrasonographic examinations and thus could be used by patients as part of counseling or telemedicine consultations. However, the authors emphasize that its primary role is to support clinician-patient discussions rather than self-directed decision-making.

The study findings highlight the calculator's predictive accuracy and its association with maternal adverse outcomes. This can help pregnant women assess the risks and benefits of induction and better allow them to give informed consent.

Notably, the study highlights that the calculator's predictive accuracy reduces at very high predicted cesarean delivery rates. This finding suggests that over-reliance on calculators may lead to more frequent and potentially avoidable cesarean deliveries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand that risk calculators have been designed to guide counseling and shared decision-making, not to replace clinical judgment.  

Based on the predictions made by the calculator, women with higher cesarean delivery risk inherently present with elevated obstetric risk factors that predispose them to both cesarean delivery and a higher incidence of complications like postpartum hemorrhage, which is the primary significant maternal adversity identified in the study.

Some risk factors substantially contribute to these pregnancy adversities, including prolonged labor, uterine atony, and chorioamnionitis. Therefore, calculator-based predictions should not be used to avert medically indicated inductions. These predictions should rather be regarded as vital information highlighting the need for heightened clinical vigilance and proactive management in high-risk pregnancies.

Because of the observational study design, the study could not determine the causality of observed associations. The researchers excluded women with previous cesarean deliveries from the study population, as their institution routinely uses the already-validated TOLAC calculator for this specific group. Therefore, the predictive power of this calculator in this specific group remains unclear.

The calculator validated in this study uses socially constructed variables of race and ethnicity, which may increase health disparities. This highlights the need for developing a calculator that does not use race and ethnicity as a predictor.

A new study shows that ordinary painkillers, when taken alongside antibiotics, can drive dangerous mutations in bacteria, revealing how polypharmacy in older adults could be quietly promoting the global antimicrobial resistance crisis.

Study: The effect of commonly used non-antibiotic medications on antimicrobial resistance development in Escherichia coli. Image credit: NonSitth/Shutterstock.com

A recent study published in Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance investigated whether commonly used non-antibiotic medications (NAMs), particularly ibuprofen and acetaminophen, in residential aged care facilities (RACFs), enhance ciprofloxacin-induced mutagenesis in Escherichia coli. The study also assessed other widely used NAMS, including diclofenac and furosemide, which influenced resistance development even when they did not increase mutation frequency.

AMR occurs when microbial organisms, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, no longer respond to antimicrobial medicines. Antimicrobials, such as antibiotics, antiparasitics, antivirals, and antifungals, are medicines used to prevent and treat infectious diseases in humans, animals, and plants.

The emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant organisms and resistance genes are a significant public health threat. In 2019, 4.95 million deaths worldwide were linked to antimicrobial resistance.

A combination of various factors contributes to the development of AMR. Overuse of antibiotics in clinical and agricultural settings commonly leads to AMR development. In addition to antibiotics, NAMs (e.g., statins, diuretics, and proton-pump inhibitors) also contribute to the rise of AMR. Currently, 95% of medicines in the global pharmaceutical market are non-antibiotic drugs.

A recent study revealed that over 200 commonly used NAMs have antibiotic-like effects on gut bacteria. Statins, for example, have antibacterial activity, while certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) promote cross-resistance development.

Bacteria may acquire a resistance mechanism during transformation via plasmids expressing resistance factors. Diclofenac is an NAM that increases the transformation efficiency, which increases the risk of developing resistance. Certain antibiotics (e.g., ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone) and non-antibiotics (e.g., tramadol) are not completely degraded and introduced into wastewater through urine and/or stool excretion. Considering how frequently NAMs are used, it is essential to assess their potential in the development of AMR.

Many older people are highly dependent on medicines to manage chronic disease, and some even take nine or more prescribed drugs per day. This phenomenon is referred to as polypharmacy. The older population has been associated with higher antibiotic intake. Previous studies have indicated antibiotic overuse among RACFs, particularly in managing urinary tract and respiratory infections. For instance, clinicians commonly prescribe ciprofloxacin to older people to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs), which has led to the incidence of ciprofloxacin resistance and ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli among RACFs.

The current study investigated nine NAMs commonly used by older people: ibuprofen, diclofenac, acetaminophen, furosemide, pseudoephedrine, atorvastatin calcium, metformin, temazepam, and tramadol. Since these medicines are frequently co-administered with antibiotics, mutation frequencies were determined in the presence of ciprofloxacin, a known mutation inducer.

Mutation frequencies were assessed in E. coli BW25113 and E. coli 6146, antibiotic-sensitive strains isolated from a retirement resident. All assays to determine whether NAM exposure induces mutation within E. coli were carried out on plates supplemented with 0.015 µg/ml ciprofloxacin. The current study also analyzed mutation frequencies in the presence of two NAMs and ciprofloxacin.

None of the NAMs assessed in this study exhibited antimicrobial activity against E. coli BW25113 and E. coli 6146, even at the highest tested concentration of 512 μg/mL. E. coli BW25113 and E. coli 6146 cell growth was analysed in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin and/or gut concentrations of the NAMs.

Compared to non-exposed cells, those exposed to NAMs alone did not impact the growth of E. coli cells. However, for both E. coli isolates, the growth rate was significantly affected at about three-quarters of ciprofloxacin's minimum inhibition concentration (MIC). In the presence of three-quarters, the MICs of ciprofloxacin, ibuprofen, diclofenac, and acetaminophen enhanced the growth rates of E. coli BW25113. These three NAMs also reduced the length of the lag phase. In E. coli 6146, ciprofloxacin exposure delayed exponential growth, although certain NAM combinations modestly improved adaptability.

Higher mutation frequencies were observed in E. coli BW25113 and E. coli 6146 exposed to ibuprofen and acetaminophen than those exposed to ciprofloxacin alone. E. coli 6146 exposed to pseudoephedrine, temazepam, and tramadol significantly decreased the mutation frequencies, compared to ciprofloxacin only.

The current study observed that NAM exposure elevated ciprofloxacin resistance in select isolates. A higher mutation frequency was observed in cells following exposure to ibuprofen and ciprofloxacin. Furosemide/ciprofloxacin (Frs_M1) increased 32-fold for ciprofloxacin MIC and 16-fold for levofloxacin MIC. Ator_M4 (atorvastatin/ciprofloxacin exposed) and Dic_M4 (diclofenac/ciprofloxacin exposed) mutants revealed a 16-fold increase in ciprofloxacin MIC.

Notably, mutants derived from E. coli 6146 indicated significant resistance against levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime compared to the BW25113 strain. In some two-NAM exposures, resistance rose even higher, with ibuprofen plus diclofenac producing a 64-fold increase in ciprofloxacin MIC.

No significant effect was observed in the growth of E. coli BW25113; however, a modest effect was found on the growth of E. coli 6146 cells when exposed to ibuprofen- and acetaminophen-based NAM combinations in the absence of ciprofloxacin. The current study revealed that certain NAM combinations could increase bacterial strains' adaptability, fitness, and mutation frequencies. Notably, while two NAMs did not synergistically increase mutation frequency, mutants derived from two NAMS plus ciprofloxacin showed higher levels of ciprofloxacin resistance than those exposed to a single NAM.

BW25113-derived mutant M1 possessed a unique substitution mutation in SoxR (R20L). Many distinctive deletions in the MarR regulator were also detected among mutants. Specific mutants exposed to two NAMs exhibited more than one mutation, an increased mutation rate, and an increased mutation frequency. Experimental studies have demonstrated that resistance is mediated by efflux through the RND-type efflux pumps.

The study confirmed this by showing that resistance could be partially reduced in some mutants or fully reversed in others with an efflux pump inhibitor. RT-qPCR demonstrated substantial overexpression of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump in several mutants. In addition to quinolones, some mutants showed reduced susceptibility to minocycline and ceftazidime, though these effects were less consistent.

The current study indicated that common medicines, such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen, when combined with ciprofloxacin, significantly increase mutation frequency and lead to multiple antibiotic resistance. Other NAMs, including diclofenac and furosemide, also contributed to higher resistance levels, even if they did not always elevate mutation frequency.

The authors emphasize that polypharmacy in aged care settings may amplify these risks and highlight the need to reassess medicine combinations, rather than issuing direct prescribing guidance.

Can tomorrow's doctors learn with AI without losing their critical thinking? A NEJM review offers DEFT-AI and new collaboration models to help educators harness AI while protecting clinical skills.



Review: Educational Strategies for Clinical Supervision of Artificial Intelligence Use. Image Credit: Antonio Marca / Shutterstock

In a recent review published in The New England Journal of Medicine, researchers elucidate the challenges of supervising early-career medical learners who use powerful large language models (LLMs) as education aids. Review findings highlight the dangers of ""deskilling,"" where overreliance on AI erodes fundamental clinical reasoning skills, and ""mis-skilling,"" where trainees adopt AI-generated errors, alongside ""never-skilling"" – the failure to develop essential competencies in the first place.

The review proposes a structured educational framework called ""diagnosis, evidence, feedback, teaching, and recommendation for AI engagement (DEFT-AI)"" to counter these potential AI demerits by scaffolding critical thinking. The review also introduces the ""cyborg"" and ""centaur"" models of human-AI collaboration, urging clinicians to adopt an adaptive practice where they learn to engage critically with AI-generated outputs rather than unquestioningly trusting them.

Recognize the ""leap of faith"": The paper defines AI interactions as moments where clinicians receive outputs they cannot fully retrace, prompting a critical pause to assess trustworthiness before acting.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in computation and large language models (LLMs), are progressing at an astonishing rate. Large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini are increasingly being used in medical learning, raising both opportunities and risks for clinical reasoning. A growing body of literature suggests that AI tools are fundamentally reshaping medical learning and practice.

However, integrating AI into clinical practice presents unprecedented opportunities and significant risks for medical education. While rapid access to information and the ability to consolidate vast swaths of data into easily accessible summaries may become integral in future medical education and practice, LLMs are known to simulate human-like reasoning to create an ""appearance of agency"" – an effect where systems simulate reasoning and outputs appear to show agency when none actually exists. This can be extremely dangerous for inexperienced medical trainees.

Medical educators thus face a novel and urgent challenge – guiding and supervising trainees who might be more proficient at leveraging AI than the educators themselves, creating an 'inversion of expertise' where teachers become learners too. The present review highlights three specific hurdles (""deskilling,"" ""never-skilling,"" and ""mis-skilling"") that must be overcome before AI can cement its role in ensuring a safer and healthier future.

Model co-management of uncertainty: Educators should openly acknowledge their own AI learning curve alongside trainees, turning discomfort into shared inquiry and explicit teaching moments.

This review aims to address the urgent and critical need by conducting a comprehensive examination of the scientific literature that explores the challenges and opportunities presented by AI in medical education. It collates and synthesizes the outcomes of more than 70 prior publications across existing educational theory, cognitive science, and emerging research on human-AI interaction and uses these insights to develop novel conceptual frameworks for the clinical supervision of AI:

Diagnosis, evidence, feedback, teaching (DEFT), and recommendation for AI engagement (DEFT-AI) – An adapted framework for promoting critical thinking during educational conversations around AI use.

Cyborg vs. Centaur Models: A new typology to describe two distinct modalities of human-AI collaboration. These models are designed to help educators and learners adapt their use of AI to the specific clinical task and associated risk.

Ask ""How do you think the AI got there?"": DEFT-AI conversations should probe the learner's understanding of the AI tool's limitations and potential biases, not just its output.

The review identifies and addresses several cognitive traps imposed on medical education by today's AI age. ""Cognitive offloading"", the process of over-relying on AI for complex tasks like clinical reasoning, is highlighted for its link to ""automation bias"", subsequent over-reliance on the AI's output, and a failure to catch its mistakes.

Alarmingly, cognitive offloading and automation bias are not just theoretical concerns. A study found that more than a third of advanced medical students failed to identify erroneous LLM answers to clinical scenarios. Another study reported a significant negative correlation between the frequent use of AI tools and critical thinking abilities, mediated by increased offloading, and this effect was especially pronounced among younger participants.

The review recommends addressing these concerns by developing and adopting the DEFT-AI framework, a structured approach for educators as a response to a trainee's dependence on AI. It proposes leveraging a critical conversation that moves beyond the AI's answer to probe the learner's reasoning. Key questions include: ""What prompts did you use?"", ""How did you verify the AI-generated output?"", and ""How did the AI's suggestion influence or change your diagnostic approach?"" Educators are also encouraged to teach evidence-based appraisal of AI outputs using Sackett's framework (ask, acquire, appraise, apply, assess) and effective prompt engineering techniques, such as chain-of-thought reasoning.

The review further stresses that supervision must distinguish between evaluating the AI tool itself and evaluating its specific output. For example, institutional scorecards or model leaderboards may be used to judge tools, while evidence-based medicine appraisal steps should be applied to each individual output.

Use chain-of-thought prompting: Asking the AI to explain its reasoning step-by-step (""think out loud"") improves its accuracy and allows clinicians to better evaluate its logic.

Finally, the review presents the ""cyborg"" and ""centaur"" modes of clinician-AI interaction. In centaur mode, tasks are strategically divided so that the clinician delegates low-risk, well-defined tasks (such as summarizing data or drafting communications) to the AI, while retaining complete control over high-stakes clinical judgment and decision-making. This mode is recommended when addressing complex or uncertain cases.

In contrast, the cyborg mode assumes that the clinician and AI co-construct a solution to the task at hand. This mode is efficient for low-risk, routine tasks but carries a higher risk of automation bias if not used with ongoing reflective oversight and justification.

The review also warns that performance heterogeneity and bias in LLMs can exacerbate health inequities. AI systems may underperform for certain populations, and uncritical adoption could widen disparities rather than close them.

The present review concludes that while the integration of AI into medicine and medical education is inevitable (and largely beneficial), its successful and safe adoption is not. It highlights that medical education must proactively address the risks of deskilling, never-skilling, and mis-skilling by fundamentally changing how clinical reasoning is taught, particularly against the backdrop of AI. Critical thinking remains foundational for ""adaptive practice"" – the ability to shift between efficient routines and innovative problem-solving when faced with the unpredictability of AI.

In summary, this review demonstrates that the ultimate goal is not to create doctors who are dependent on AI, but to cultivate clinicians who can skilfully and safely leverage it as a powerful tool to augment, but not replace, their own expertise through a ""verify and trust"" paradigm.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","First clinical trial in cats tests targeted therapy for deadly head and neck cancer","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250828/First-clinical-trial-in-cats-tests-targeted-therapy-for-deadly-head-and-neck-cancer.aspx","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 02:42:00 GMT","

Researchers have reported results from the first-ever clinical trial of a new class of targeted therapy in pet cats with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)-a cancer which is notoriously deadly and difficult to treat. Publishing in the Cell Press journal Cancer Cell on August 28, the study found that 35% of the cats who received treatment had their disease controlled with minimal side effects-and the drug will likely be effective for humans with HNSCC as well. 

There are two major findings from this study. It showed us that it's possible to target a transcription factor that drives oncogenesis, which is something that has been notoriously difficult in the past. Also, it demonstrated that pets with cancer can be a good representation of human disease and that clinical trials in pets may yield more reliable results than tests in mouse models."" 

Daniel Johnson, senior author of the University of California, San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center

This drug, which was initially conceptualized to treat human head and neck cancers, is the first to target the transcription factor STAT3. STAT3 is present in a range of both solid and liquid tumors, including a majority of HNSCC cases. 

The idea to test the HNSCC drug on pet cats came from a discussion first author Jennifer Grandis had with her sister, a veterinarian. Grandis learned that oral cancers like HNSCC in pet cats are extremely difficult to treat and that most animals die within 2 to 3 months of diagnosis. 

""There is remarkable clinical, histopathologic, and immunologic similarity between feline and human HNSCC,"" the authors write. 

One cat who benefited from the trial was a 9-year-old black domestic shorthair named Jak. When he was diagnosed with HNSCC, the veterinarian gave him only 6 to 8 weeks to live. 

""It was just a gut punch,"" says his owner, Tina Thomas. ""We wanted more time with him. When I found out about this clinical trial, I knew I wanted him to be a part of it."" 

Jak went for weekly treatments for one month. During that time his symptoms-mainly, a watery eye-greatly improved. He ultimately lived more than 8 months after his diagnosis. 

""It was meaningful to us because he was here in our lives,"" says Thomas. ""During that time, my son finished college and my daughter finished her master's program. Jak got to spend one more Christmas with us, and he loved our Christmas tree. He was worth every bit of the effort."" 

Other than mild anemia, none of the cats in the trial developed side effects that were attributable to the treatment. Of the 20 cats that were enrolled, 7 of them exhibited either a partial response or stable disease during the study period. Among the 7 that responded, the average survival post-treatment was 161 days. 

When the investigators looked at tumors and blood samples from the cats who underwent treatment, they saw that the compound was working in two ways: It not only blocked the activity of STAT3 but it also raised levels of PD-1, a protein associated with an immune response to cancer. 

""This study is a great example of how we can think more carefully about spending our very limited resources on studies in lab mice that are not even the best models of human cancers,"" Grandis says. ""By partnering with veterinary oncologists and doing clinical trials in companion animals, we can learn an enormous amount about how these drugs work while also helping people's pets. None of the cats in these trials were harmed, and many of them benefited."" 

The researchers say that conducting clinical trials in pets can be a much better model of how drugs will work in humans compared with lab mice. They are currently working with a small biotech company to advance the new compound in clinical trials for both pets and humans. 

""These animals breathe the same air that we breathe and are exposed to all the things we're exposed to,"" says Johnson. ""Their tumors are much more heterogeneous, which makes them a better mimic of human disease.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New reaction approach expands possibilities for drug discovery building blocks","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250828/New-reaction-approach-expands-possibilities-for-drug-discovery-building-blocks.aspx","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 03:50:00 GMT","

A new approach to an established reaction boosts the ability to synthesize vinylic ethers - key building blocks for many molecules important to human health. The American Chemical Society's Organic Letters published the breakthrough, made by chemists at Emory University.

Our method is easy to reproduce and is based on widely available and inexpensive compounds. We can apply this method to make multiple natural products, including novel vinylic ethers."" 

San Pham, an Emory PhD candidate and first author of the paper

Her research improves the reliability, yield and generality of what is known as the Chan-Evans-Lam reaction. These enhancements greatly expand the reaction's potential for the synthesis of complex, biologically active compounds for drug research.

""San Pham demonstrated that our new method works for several combinations of reactants, producing at least 15 new compounds that were previously unknown and would likely have been quite difficult to prepare using other known synthetic strategies,"" says Frank McDonald, senior author of the paper and Emory professor of chemistry.

McDonald is also a member of the Discovery and Developmental Therapeutics Research Program at Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University.

The McDonald lab explores new and improved methods for preparing organic compounds - particularly bioactive compounds that may become new pharmaceutical agents.

One area of interest is the synthesis of plasmalogens, a type of fat molecule, found mainly in cell membranes. Preliminary studies suggest plasmalogens are involved in a range of beneficial biological activities, including anti-oxidation and anti-inflammation.

Vinylic ethers - which consist of an oxygen atom directly attached to a carbon atom that's bonded to another carbon atom - are important synthetic intermediates for the synthesis of many bioactive compounds. A specific vinylic ether, with an alkene attached, is an intermediate for plasmalogen.

The few known methods for synthesizing vinylic ethers with an attached alkene, however, have limited their applications.

For nearly six years, the McDonald lab worked on developing a good way of making these key building blocks. One strategy was to try to leverage the Chan-Evans-Lam reaction. Developed 25 years ago, Chan-Evans-Lam is a cross-coupling reaction which forms a carbon-carbon bond with the aid of a copper catalyst.

While the reaction works well with simple reactants, the McDonald lab found it produced only low yields when linking two structurally complex reactants. That made the method impractical for the molecular synthesis needed to produce vinylic ethers.

""This reaction is also a little bit capricious,"" McDonald says. ""It's not so easily reproducible and it didn't seem to be fine tunable for our needs.""

Around two years ago, the lab nearly gave up on its quest to boost the potential of the Chan-Evans-Lam reaction. Then San Pham agreed to take on the project.

""I love solving problems, the more challenging, the better,"" Pham says.

One problem the lab encountered with the Chan-Evans-Lam reaction is that the copper acetate catalyst is what is known as a dimer complex - two molecules bonded together. To catalyze the type of chain reactions the lab sought, the paired copper molecules needed to be broken into monomers, or single molecules.

""I started reading organic chemistry papers about breaking up this dimer, papers that weren't even related to this reaction,"" Pham says.

She spent months doing this research, scouring countless papers.

""Running random experiments is a waste of time and resources, so I'm strategic about my reaction design,"" Pham explains. ""Reading is how I develop strategic hypotheses for every reaction that I test.""

She found a paper reporting the use of a particular ligand - a catalyst activator that binds to a metal - to split the dimer into monomers.

She ran experiments using this new catalyst activator to synthesize the test compound.

The result yielded only 20 percent of the target compound, too low a percentage to make the method practical. Pham screened several more catalyst activators with similar chemical properties.

""No matter what I tried I couldn't improve the yield beyond 50 percent, which is still not good enough,"" she says. ""I had hit a wall.""

Pham ran painstaking experiments to track and analyze every step in the process of the reaction to further understand its weaknesses. She pinpointed the step where the reaction produced an unwanted byproduct. That led to the insight that the catalyst needed to regenerate faster to favor the pathway to the target compound.

""At that point I was trying out oxygen gas as the reagent to regenerate the catalyst,"" Pham says. ""I was using a balloon to pump in the oxygen. It was challenging to ensure it was receiving enough.""

Pham dove back into the scientific literature, spending months reading through mechanistic papers about catalytic turnover and regeneration. She finally found a clue she needed: a paper citing the use of organic peroxide as a catalytic regenerator, rather than oxygen gas, to overcome a similar situation.

""I hit the jackpot, basically,"" Pham says.

She ran more experiments with this final piece of the puzzle in place.

Pham's enhancements speeded up the reaction, reducing unwanted byproducts, and boosting the yield to 80 percent for the target compound.

She also achieved good yields for at least 15 different compounds new to the literature - demonstrating that her method applies to a wide range of complex structures important to drug discovery.

The McDonald lab is now set to build on Pham's work to pursue its plasmalogen research.

""San's improvements make this reaction a much more reliable and useful method,"" McDonald says. ""The new catalyst and reaction components are all relatively inexpensive and safe to use, and we hope other researchers will also explore its potential for synthetic applications.""

The paper describing the methods to achieve the breakthrough serves a broader purpose.

""I hope that when other people run into a problem working with similar substrates and are close to giving up,"" Pham says, ""they will read our paper and hit on a clue that helps them keep going.""

UNSW research has shed light on how cells in the body manage and store fat, potentially offering new insights into health. 

In the study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers identify a crucial protein, named CHP1, that acts as a central director in this process. 

Fat, or lipids, are stored inside cells in small compartments called lipid droplets. These droplets are essential for energy storage and other cellular functions. 

The researchers found that removing CHP1 leads to a significant reduction in the size of the lipid droplets, suggesting that CHP1 is a master regulator of fat metabolism within the cell. 

Our findings provide a clearer picture of the intricate machinery that controls how cells store fat. 

Understanding this process is a critical step towards developing new strategies to address a range of metabolic disorders like obesity and diabetes."" 

Guang Yang, lead author of the study from the UNSW School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Science

The study reveals that CHP1 directly influences key enzymes, called microsomal GPATs, responsible for creating fat molecules. 

Not only does CHP1 help stabilize and activate these enzymes, but it also directs them to the right location-the surface of the lipid droplets-where they are needed most. 

This discovery advances our basic knowledge of how cells regulate fat metabolism and opens new avenues for future research into conditions related to abnormal fat storage.

Over the past 50 years, rates of obesity and type-2 diabetes have soared, while sperm quality has plummeted. Driving these changes could be the increasing popularity of ultra-processed foods, which have been linked to a range of poor health outcomes. However, scientists still aren't sure whether it's the industrial nature of the ingredients themselves, the processing of the foods, or whether it's because they lead people to eat more than they should.

An international team of scientists has now discovered that people gain more weight on an ultra-processed diet compared to a minimally processed diet, even when they eat the same number of calories. The study in humans also revealed a diet high in ultra-processed foods introduces higher levels of pollutants that are known to affect sperm quality. The findings were published in the journal Cell Metabolism.

""Our results prove that ultra-processed foods harm our reproductive and metabolic health, even if they're not eaten in excess. This indicates that it is the processed nature of these foods that makes them harmful,"" says Jessica Preston, lead author of the study, who carried out the research during her PhD at the University of Copenhagen's NNF Center for Basic Metabolic Research (CBMR).

To get the best possible data, the scientists compared the health impact of unprocessed and ultra-processed diets on the same person. They recruited 43 men aged 20 to 35, who spent three weeks on each of the two diets, with three months 'washout' in between. Half started on the ultra-processed and half started on the unprocessed diet. Half of the men also received a high-calorie diet with an extra 500 daily calories, while half received the normal amount of calories for their size, age and physical activity levels. They were not told which diet they were on. Both the unprocessed and ultra-processed diets had the same amount of calories, protein, carbs and fats.

Men gained around 1 kg more of fat mass while on the ultra-processed diet compared to the unprocessed diet, regardless of whether they were on the normal or excess calorie diet. Several other markers of cardiovascular health were also affected.

The scientists also discovered a worrying increase in the level of the hormone-disrupting phthalate cxMINP, a substance used in plastics, in men on the ultra-processed diet. Men on this diet also saw decreases in their levels of testosterone and follicle-stimulating hormone, which are crucial for sperm production.

We were shocked by how many body functions were disrupted by ultra-processed foods, even in healthy young men. The long-term implications are alarming and highlight the need to revise nutritional guidelines to better protect against chronic disease.""

Anorexia is a serious mental health disorder that typically begins during adolescence. A study, conducted by the Research Unit of Population Health and Oulu Business School at the University of Oulu, examined how anorexia in adolescence affects labor market position in adulthood compared with peers.

Many mental health disorders have previously been linked to a weaker position in the labor market, but research evidence relating to anorexia has been very limited and, in many respects, inadequate. The most recent studies on the subject date back decades, were based solely on survey data and focused only on women. Generalizing these findings to the present day is difficult, as in recent decades there have been major changes in working life, the availability of psychiatric services, and the recognition of young people with anorexia within the service system.The results of the newly published study showed that both men and women with anorexia had lower income levels and more days of unemployment in adulthood compared with their peers. The effects on labor market position were particularly pronounced in men.

Although anorexia often has a favorable long-term prognosis in terms of general health, its impact on working life can be significant.""

Tuomas Majuri, lead author of the research article, Postdoctoral Researcher

The study utilized data from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 and national registry data on income, unemployment days and sickness absence days at ages 25-33. Labor market position was examined using these registry data, and analyses were conducted separately for men and women.""Men who suffered from anorexia in adolescence are particularly poorly recognised in our current service system, which weakens their labor market position later in life. The Wellbeing Services County of North Ostrobothnia has recently invested in the treatment of eating disorder patients, for example by opening a new eating disorder unit. More initiatives of this kind, along with closer cooperation between healthcare, employment services and employers, are needed to improve the labor market position of young people affected by anorexia,"" Majuri explains.The study was funded by the Yrjö Jahnsson Foundation, the Wage Earners' Foundation, the OP Research Foundation, the Tauno Tönning Foundation and the North Ostrobothnia Regional Fund of the Finnish Cultural Foundation.

Inspired by an urgent need to improve timely defibrillation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) in dense urban settings, a team of investigators developed a simulation that explored the potential of leveraging an existing food delivery network in Taipei City, Taiwan, to help address this challenge. Their findings in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology, published by Elsevier, suggest that deploying food delivery riders to deliver defibrillation may reduce automated external defibrillator (AED) response times by approximately three minutes-about 50% faster than a traditional emergency medical system (EMS)-and might be particularly beneficial during peak hours.

Lead investigator Kuan-Chen Chin, MPH, Department of Emergency Medicine, Taipei Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, New Taipei City, and Department of Emergency Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei City, Taiwan, explains, ""Each minute of delay in defibrillation reduces the survival rate by 7–10%. Our approach leverages an existing, widespread urban workforce to address a well-known weak link in the chain of survival. We found that it offers a cost-effective and scalable strategy for improving OHCA outcomes in high-density cities, where EMS cannot always provide immediate defibrillation.""

Densely populated Taipei has a high concentration of food delivery (FD) scooter riders. To examine the feasibility of utilizing these FD riders as first responders for AED delivery in OHCA incidents investigators conducted a city-scale simulation using real-world OHCA data from the Registry of the Taipei City Fire Department between 2017 and 2019, public defibrillator locations, and food delivery patterns and hotspots using the Uber Eats platform.

The simulation assumed that every open restaurant in a hotspot had one FD rider waiting and ready to respond to OHCAs within a two-kilometer radius. FD riders' response rates were varied, and simulated defibrillator arrival times were compared to documented fire department delivery times of six to seven minutes. Differences in defibrillator arrival times during peak and off-peak hours were also assessed.

With a 10% FD rider response rate, the defibrillator arrival time decreased by 2.99 minutes, representing approximately 44% of the original EMS response time. In the simulation, over 60% of OHCAs were successfully attended. Achieving 80% coverage during peak hours required 13.4% of FD riders to respond.According to co-corresponding investigator Albert Y. Chen, PhD, Department of Civil Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei City, Taiwan, ""Integrating FD riders into the EMS system could reduce defibrillator arrival times, decreasing patient waiting time for defibrillation. This approach is particularly effective during peak hours, when a higher proportion of OHCAs can be addressed.""

We were encouraged to see that even low response rates might yield meaningful time savings, and that the model appeared effective during off-peak hours despite reduced availability.""

Welcome to ESPN India Edition

Giovanni Reyna and Joe Scally react to missing out on Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT squad. (1:35)

The last 12 months before a World Cup are an exercise in balancing risk and reward for professional soccer players. Do you play it safe and stick with your current club even if it might result in some stagnation? Or do you take the ultimate risk and move to your dream destination, regardless of the World Cup consequences? Then, there's the third scenario: knowing a switch needs to be made, but being careful about where you land.

It's a dilemma that past and present United States men's national team players have faced. In the last window, Gio Reyna moved to Borussia Monchengladbach; Matt Turner secured a loan to the New England Revolution, his former club; and Paxten Aaronson turned some heads by leaving Eintracht Frankfurt and landing back in MLS with the Colorado Rapids. Others, such as AC Milan's Yunus Musah, might make a move. They are by no means the first. Oguchi Onyewu made the leap to AC Milan in 2009, while Stuart Holden left the Houston Dynamo to join Bolton Wanderers just six months before the 2010 World Cup.

But no matter the circumstances, the goal is always the same: get in a good playing situation and hit something approaching top form so that the manager has no choice but to take you to the World Cup. Navigating that goal has different challenges for every player, as these examples illustrate.

Fifteen years ago, Holden went all in, placing a massive bet on himself. He had let his contract with Houston expire, allowing him to become a free agent and chase his ultimate dream of playing in the English Premier League.

After a friendly against Denmark in November 2009, Holden sat down with then-manager Bob Bradley to talk about his chances of making the 2010 World Cup squad. Holden recalls that he was told his odds were at about 60%. Two months later, he officially signed with Bolton Wanderers, which, at the time, was in the Premier League.

- USMNT countdown to the World Cup: Will Reyna's fresh start save 2026 hopes?
- New USMNT roster a head-scratcher: Is Pochettino wasting a chance for World Cup prep?
- After skipping Gold Cup, Musah has big plans for USMNT in a World Cup year

Holden remembers being aware of the World Cup stakes, and the possible consequences of his move.

""I was never guaranteed anything by Bob,"" Holden told ESPN. ""I knew that if I went to Bolton and didn't play, it would've put me in a really tough position to try to be in a place to make that roster.""

Holden also had immense confidence in his game. He didn't dwell on the negatives, instead focusing on the task of becoming a regular with Bolton. Holden knew if he accomplished that goal, the World Cup would take care of itself. But he knew it wouldn't come easy.

""It's not like I was signed for a transfer fee and there was pressure for me to be played by the coach. I had to really kind of earn that opportunity,"" Holden said. ""Maybe there would've been a chance I missed out on the World Cup, but to me, there had been a lifelong goal of mine to play in the Premier League, and I had that opportunity and so I went for it, and just kind of bet on myself. I had found previously in my career if I bet on myself, more often than not, things had gone my way.""

Yunus Musah explains what Mauricio Pochettino has brought to the USMNT since taking the head coach job.

For Holden, the months before the World Cup had more obstacles than an episode of ""American Ninja Warrior."" Holden didn't make the gameday roster for Bolton until late February. Soon after, a tackle from Nigel de Jong in a U.S. friendly against the Netherlands resulted in a broken fibula that required surgery. Holden recovered in time to play in Bolton's last game of the season. Bradley knew he wasn't completely fit but still put him on the U.S. roster.

Though Holden's subsequent years in Europe were plagued by injury, he still feels he made the right choice. He could easily have re-signed with MLS and ""parked it in Houston for another couple of years"" through the World Cup and beyond. But he felt he would have been settling.

""It ended up being the best decision I made in my life, and I got to go and play in the Premier League,"" he said. ""But I guess as I sit here and reflect, it could have gone completely the other way for me.""

Paxten Aaronson appeared to have everything in Europe. He was on the books of Eintracht Frankfurt, third-place finishers in the Bundesliga last season. He had two productive loan spells in the Netherlands, first with Vitesse and later with FC Utrecht, where he was nominated for the Johan Cruyff Young Talent of the Year award at the end of last season.

There was some shock, then, when it emerged that Aaronson secured a transfer to the Colorado Rapids earlier in August. Why leave Europe just when things were taking off, at age 22, no less?

As it turned out, there were a few things that Frankfurt couldn't give Aaronson. One was steady minutes on the field.

""[Frankfurt] kind of told me that I probably wouldn't get the playing time there that I would need at this stage in my career, and especially since the season I had last year,"" he said. ""And then I kind of knew it was time to probably find another team and they did as well.""

A second issue was stability -- or in Aaronson's case, the lack of it. Another year on loan wasn't appealing, and Aaronson said he wanted to lay down some roots. He also spoke of ""little things"" that added up during his time in Europe, though he also mentioned one big thing. Early on during his time in Frankfurt, and while he was away at a national team camp, his apartment caught fire and he lost his possessions.

""It's just like these little things, [they] all kind of accumulate to not being able to really settle in or find a home, and that was one big reason for me to come back and be close to family, and all these little things that maybe the media doesn't know,"" he said. ""But it's hard to go over to Europe with nobody and then have these little things happen and be able to stay focused on the field.""

There is a stigma attached to American players who go to Europe and then come back to MLS, especially if they're as young as Aaronson. It looks like a retreat or failure, as if the player couldn't handle the rigorous nature of European soccer. Aaronson's situation was more nuanced.

There's also the fact that such a decision doesn't weigh as heavy on a player's reputation as it used to. Part of that is down to U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino's attitude toward MLS. He said Tuesday that he thought MLS was better than some European leagues, though he didn't identify which ones.

Alejandro Moreno assesses Giovanni Reyna's move to Borussia Mönchengladbach.

Certainly, Aaronson's World Cup prospects impacted his decision.

""You don't want to go somewhere where you're going to be on the bench because you know then you probably don't have the best chances of making the team,"" Aaronson said. But this was also a career move, not just a World Cup one. Aaronson added that he didn't discuss his decision with Pochettino, but in some respects, he didn't need to. Pochettino had shown in previous camps that he wasn't averse to bringing in domestic players.

""I do think [Pochettino and his staff's] view on MLS is high,"" Aaronson said. ""I think they do rate the league. You can see from the amount of players that they bring in, and also the way they speak about it. So, it's definitely something that I knew if I came back to MLS, it's not like an automatic big 'X' on my name. So, those kinds of things definitely help.""

Aaronson recalled that the final decision was difficult. There was European interest. There were ""four days of a lot of thinking."" He didn't sleep. But ultimately, he decided to go to Colorado, with manager Chris Armas' sales pitch of making Aaronson a key cog proving vital. To hear Aaronson explain it, he's making a bet on himself much like Holden did 15 years ago.

""I know if I'm playing every game, and giving it my all, then yeah, why wouldn't I make the team?"" he said. ""I believe in my quality and believe in my abilities. And I've shown it before. So, once I do commit to things, yeah, I just go full gas and never look back, which I think is an important mindset.""

Matt Turner has experienced some precipitous ups and downs over the past several months, even as there was total clarity as to what he needed to do. After a season in which he made just four appearances -- none in league play -- while on loan at Crystal Palace, he knew he had to leave Nottingham Forest and find a place where he would get consistent playing time. His starting spot with the USMNT was already under threat, with New York City FC's Matt Freese playing every minute at the Gold Cup while Turner watched from the bench.

""I think it's in the back of every American player's mind right now, especially guys that want to be part of the team,"" Turner said about the World Cup. ""So for me, I want to not just be part of the team; I want to be the guy that's being relied upon that has that responsibility. And for me, I need to play and I need to recoup that feeling of playing and being relied upon consistently week in, week out, so that way I can go back into the national team and use the experiences of having been relied upon consistently.""

The U.S. keeper thought he had found the right club when he transferred to Ligue 1 side Lyon for $9 million. But a tumultuous ownership and financial situation, which nearly resulted in Lyon's relegation to Ligue 2, meant budgets were cut, and Turner was a casualty.

That meant moving back to square one. Teams in the English Championship were interested, but Turner felt he was ""stagnant"" in England, and at Palace, he lost a bit of his edge, knowing that he would be backing up starter Dean Henderson every week. At Premier League level, he was viewed as a backup. Turner still has hopes of returning to Europe, but knows he needs to rebuild his game a bit.

Turner recalled that New England was ""ready to move the fastest,"" and he ultimately secured a one-year loan to the club where he began his professional career.

""I've been a tradable asset at the end of transfer windows in England a few times, and it can get pretty stressful,"" he said. ""And I think after feeling like I had done my work early and I was ready for that stability that I was going to be provided with in Lyon, I think that's sort of what I was craving. I know that I could get that [in New England] and now I can lay the foundation of my confidence in playing every week.""

But plenty of soccer aspects lined up. Turner knows the club, and there are familiar teammates like defender Andrew Farrell with whom to reconnect. Turner will also have the opportunity to work with goalkeeper coach Kevin Hitchcock once again.

""[Hitchcock] knows how to get the best out of me,"" Turner said. ""He knows what makes me tick, and he could really push me to get to the level that we both know that I can play at consistently.""

Turner's motivation wasn't solely about his World Cup prospects, or a desire to head back to his old club. Turner's son was born with a heart defect, which required his wife, Ashley, to make periodic trips to the U.S. for treatment in Boston. That commute will be much shorter now. Proximity to family was another plus.

Turner said that Pochettino was ""looped in"" on everything that was going on, and though he relied on the U.S. manager's advice, he ultimately would do what was best for him and his family.

The move is having the desired effect on his club form. In three matches, two of which the Revs have won, he has already prevented 1.62 expected goals. Not that Turner is taking anything for granted. It wasn't enough to get called back into the USMNT for the September window.

""Goalkeeping is crazy,"" he said. ""Every play has the potential to derail you, so you've just got to keep the focus.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.in', 'title': 'ESPN India'}","soccer"

Paris Saint-Germain faced a crushing defeat against Chelsea in the final of the Club World Cup on July 13 at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

Prior to the final, PSG lost only one out of six matches in the competition, and claiming the Club World Cup title could have been the French side's fifth trophy of the 2024/25 season.

With the blow of the final whistle, the Ligue 1 giants were left disappointed. However, a worse situation unfolded in the aftermath of the game involving PSG head coach Luis Enrique and Chelsea's Joao Pedro.

PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma appeared to be involved in an argument with Pedro, during which Enrique interfered to support his player. The situation worsened after the Spanish manager was seen pushing the Brazilian forward and raising his arm towards the 23-year-old's face.

More people, including players and staff from both clubs, got involved to prevent the situation from aggravating further.

Even though the FIFA Disciplinary Committee were initially looking into the chaotic incident, they are no longer referring the case, allowing Enrique to walk free without any ban or penalty, according to AS.

FIFA reportedly did not notify Enrique of any proceedings, dismissing the case without a formal response from PSG or Enrique, who has previously expressed regret about his outburst. While a potential two-game suspension for ‘unsportsmanlike conduct' and financial penalty was expected, the governing body are no longer pursuing the case amid other priorities.

FIFA's decision has raised eyebrows due to their conflicting ruling in another similar incident, where PSG's Joao Neves was handed a two-match ban for pulling Marc Cucurella's hair in the same final.

With no reported punishment, PSG and Enrique would both be relieved, as they would not have to worry about their manager's presence on the touchline, along with having no concerns about a disciplinary battle.

After achieving great success in the previous season, PSG have started off the 2025/26 campaign with consecutive wins in their first two Ligue 1 games after lifting the UEFA Super Cup by defeating Tottenham in the final.

The Parisians are set to face Toulouse in their next match in the top flight at Stadium de Toulouse on August 30.

MADRID (AP) — Ballon d'Or holder Rodri and Real Madrid veteran Dani Carvajal have been recalled by Spain for upcoming World Cup qualifiers after long absences because of knee injuries.

Spain coach Luis de la Fuente included the stalwarts in his squad on Friday for games in Bulgaria and Turkey on Sept. 4 and 7, as the European champion seeks a spot in the 2026 World Cup.

Rodri sat out nearly all of last season after tearing the ACL in his right knee a year ago. He then picked up an injury, reportedly to his groin, at the Club World Cup in the summer.

Manchester City coach Pep Guaridola is now gingerly working him back into his lineup. Rodri missed City's Premier League opener, a 4-0 win over Wolves, and came on as a substitute in a 2-0 loss to Tottenham last weekend.

Carvajal tore the ACL in his right knee in October last year. He came back for Madrid in July and made his first start since his return last weekend in a 3-0 win at Real Oviedo in the Spanish league.

De la Fuente also gave a first call-up to Jesús Rodríguez, who plays for Italian side Como. The 19-year-old winger joined Cesc Fabregas' team this summer from Real Betis.

LONDON (AP) — Trent Alexander-Arnold was left out by England for its upcoming World Cup qualifiers in the national team's first squad announcement since the right back left Liverpool to join Real Madrid.

Reece James, Tino Livramento and Djed Spence have been preferred as right-back options in coach Thomas Tuchel's 24-man group for matches against Andorra and Serbia that was announed on Friday.

Alexander-Arnold played for Madrid at the Club World Cup in the United States over the summer. For the team's opening two games in the Spanish league, he started the first and was benched for the second to accommodate fit-again Dani Carvajal.

“After a change of club, I think he's got to have a bit of time to settle,” Tuchel said at a news conference.

Tuchel has handed a first senior call-up to Spence, a versatile Tottenham fullback, and Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson, who impressed playing for the England Under-21s in that age group's European Championship this summer.

There was also a recall for Marcus Rashford, who has joined Barcelona on loan from Manchester United, and Manchester City defender John Stones after his return to full fitness.

There was no room for winger Jack Grealish, who is trying to ignite his career at Everton, and playmaker Cole Palmer, who is currently out injured at Chelsea.

Wales suffered a first defeat under Craig Bellamy in a 4-3 loss to Belgium in June

World Cup qualifier: Kazakhstan v Wales

Venue: Astana Arena, Astana Date: Thursday, 4 September Kick off: 15:00 BST

Coverage: Live on BBC One, iPlayer, BBC Radio Wales and Radio Cymru, the BBC Sport website and app, plus live text commentary.

Wales' attempt to qualify for a second successive World Cup continues with a 6,000-mile round trip to Kazakhstan on Thursday.

Craig Bellamy's nine-match unbeaten run as Wales boss ended in their last match - a dramatic 4-3 loss in Brussels.

But Wales still sit second in Group J, a point behind leaders North Macedonia, albeit having played two games more than third-placed Belgium.

Here is everything you need to know about the next round of qualifiers.

Wales face Kazakhstan in their capital, Astana, on Thursday 4 September at 19:00 local time - that's 15:00 BST.

Around 1,000 Wales fans are expected to make the 3,000-mile journey.

The Astana Arena has a capacity of 30,000.

The two sides have only met once before, with Wales winning 3-1 in their opening match of this World Cup qualifying group.

You can watch the game live on BBC One, iPlayer, the BBC Sport website and app.

Presenter Catrin Heledd will be joined by former Wales internationals Ashley Williams and Joe Ledley, with Simon Davies and Nia Jones commentating.

You can also listen live on BBC Radio Wales and BBC Radio Cymru.

There will be exclusive insights and interviews in the run-up and post-match for fans on the BBC Sport website and app.

Highlights: Belgium and Wales play out a thriller in Brussels

Wales had an excellent start under Craig Bellamy with two wins and a draw from their opening three games in Group J.

A 3-1 win over Kazakhstan at home was followed by a last-minute equaliser from David Brooks in North Macedonia.

After a 3-0 home win over Liechtenstein, Wales produced a stirring comeback from 3-0 down away to Belgium to level at 3-3.

But Kevin de Bruyne's late winner consigned Wales to a first defeat under Bellamy.

This all leaves Wales second in the group with seven points, a point behind North Macedonia.

Belgium are three points behind in third, but have played two games fewer after the Nations League finals delayed the start of their qualifying campaign.

Kazakhstan are four points behind Wales after one win and two defeats so far.

Liechtenstein prop up the group with three defeats from three.

Captain Aaron Ramsey has been left out.

The 34-year-old midfielder came off the bench last week for new club Pumas UNAM, playing his first minutes for the Mexican side since suffering a hamstring injury in Cardiff City's 2-1 victory over Luton on 11 March.

Leeds United skipper Ethan Ampadu is also absent after suffering a knee injury in their 1-0 Premier League win against Everton in mid-August.

Rubin Colwill misses out on a call-up despite impressing for Cardiff in their unbeaten start to the season in League One and the EFL Cup.

But Bluebirds team-mates Dylan Lawlor and Ronan Kpakio are included, with Coventry City midfielder Kai Andrews the third uncapped player in Bellamy's 25-man squad.

Bellamy wants 'consistency' from Rubin Colwill before Wales recall

Feast of Football

The Wales boss said the decision to leave out Ramsey was mutual.

""He hasn't played enough football over a period,"" he said.

""It wouldn't be fair to call him up, travel the distance, the time difference [from Mexico to Wales] and then travel to Kazakhstan, and expect him to play any part of it after being out for so long.

""The injury, particularly with a hamstring injury, it wouldn't be responsible from us to do that or expect anything from him.

""I speak to him a lot. The idea with him is to get minutes, get training and back to just playing football.""

Explaining Colwill's omission, Bellamy said: ""I have to be honest, he was very close.

""His brother [Joel, in the Wales Under-21s squad] as well. I've been impressed by the both of them.

""I want to see more. I want that consistency.""

Well, they're currently ranked 114th in the world by Fifa.

The highest they have ever been is 83rd, in 2016. Wales are ranked 31st.

After their 3-1 defeat by Wales in March, Kazakhstan went on to win 2-0 in Liechtenstein. They then lost 1-0 to North Macedonia on home soil in June.

Wales will be hoping for a better result in Kazakhstan than Celtic recently managed, as Kairat Almaty became only the nation's second team to reach Champions League with a dramatic win on penalties.



The nature of a five-team qualifying group means that in this international break Wales play just one qualifying match.

The following week - on Tuesday, 9 September - they play a friendly against Canada at the Swansea.com stadium.

Once again you can watch it live on the BBC.

Coverage begins on BBC One Wales and BBC iPlayer from 19:30 BST and BBC Radio Cymru and Radio Wales from 19:00 BST.

GOAL Convo: Segares' job isn't just to win tournaments for the U.S., but to prepare up-and-comers for more World Cups ahead

It's a World Cup year for the United States, and not just for the senior team. The U.S. Under-17 men's national team is gearing up for their own moment on the big stage, one that will come in November in Qatar.

Traditionally, U17 World Cups have been more quiet affairs for the American fandom. It's one for the diehards, those keen to track the program's youngest stars before they break out. This time, it's different. This age group, the one bound for Qatar this summer, isn't filled with players waiting for their big breaks - it includes multiple players that are already headliners.

This week, U.S. U17 men's national team coach Gonzalo Segares called in 21 players for the team's penultimate camp before Qatar. The squad, bound for the Netherlands, includes Cavan Sullivan, already a household name in American soccer. It includes Mathis Albert, who joined Borussia Dortmund for the Club World Cup this summer.

Julian Hall is a mainstay for the New York Red Bulls, Nimfasha Berchimas has featured for Charlotte FC and Chase Adams earned the ""Baby Haaland"" moniker with a 10-goal explosion during qualifying in February. These aren't high schoolers anymore. They're players in professional environments. The game has changed.

Segares, then, is the man tasked with taking those young stars and getting them ready for what comes next. This, by all accounts, is one of the more talented U17 pools in recent memory, and the World Cup has served as the launching pad of some of the game's greats. Landon Donovan, Cesc Fabregas, Phil Foden and Toni Kroos are among this competition's previous Golden Ball winners - can one of these young Americans contend for it this time around?

For Segares, the challenge is two-fold. First, of course, is the desire to win. But, when you coach on the youth level, there's also a second target: develop players. Segares' job isn't just to win, but to prepare these up-and-comers for more World Cups ahead.

""For me, this is about giving everyone the opportunity to experience what a World Cup game is and the honor and the price that it represents,"" the former Chicago Fire defender, turned U17 coach, tells GOAL. ""This is about playing on the big stage against the best players from around the world. That's what's going to make our players better, right? That's what's going to get them ready to be able to be challenged and improve. There's nothing like representing your country in the biggest event that there will be at the U17 level. I think we have a good enough team to be very competitive and go very far.""

Segares discussed his process for developing young talent, managing a new generation of stars and expectations for the World Cup in the latest GOAL Convo, a recurring Q&A with central figures in the American game.

MADRID (AP) — Ballon d'Or holder Rodri and Real Madrid veteran Dani Carvajal have been recalled by Spain for upcoming World Cup qualifiers after long absences because of knee injuries.

Spain coach Luis de la Fuente included the stalwarts in his squad on Friday for games in Bulgaria and Turkey on Sept. 4 and 7, as the European champion seeks a spot in the 2026 World Cup.

Rodri sat out nearly all of last season after tearing the ACL in his right knee a year ago. He then picked up an injury, reportedly to his groin, at the Club World Cup in the summer.



Manchester City coach Pep Guaridola is now gingerly working him back into his lineup. Rodri missed City's Premier League opener, a 4-0 win over Wolves, and came on as a substitute in a 2-0 loss to Tottenham last weekend.

Carvajal tore the ACL in his right knee in October last year. He came back for Madrid in July and made his first start since his return last weekend in a 3-0 win at Real Oviedo in the Spanish league.

De la Fuente also gave a first call-up to Jesús Rodríguez, who plays for Italian side Como. The 19-year-old winger joined Cesc Fabregas' team this summer from Real Betis.

Spain:

Goalkeepers: David Raya (Arsenal), Unai Simón (Athletic Bilbao), Álex Remiro (Real Sociedad).

Defenders: Dani Carvajal (Real Madrid), Marc Cucurella (Chelsea), Pedro Porro (Tottenham), Alejandro Grimaldo (Bayer Leverkusen), Robin Le Normand (Atletico Madrid), Pau Cubarsí (Barcelona), Dani Vivian (Athletic Bilbao), Dean Huijsen (Real Madrid).

Midfielders: Pedri González (Barcelona), Martín Zubimendi (Arsenal), Mikel Merino (Arsenal), Fabián Ruiz (Paris Saint-Germain), Rodri Hernández (Manchester City), Gavi Páez (Barcelona), Fermín López (Barcelona).

Forwards: Álvaro Morata (Como), Lamine Yamal (Barcelona), Jesús Rodríguez (Como), Dani Olmo (Barcelona), Ferran Torres (Barcelona), Nico Williams (Athletic Bilbao), Yéremy Pino (Villarreal), Mikel Oyarzabal (Real Sociedad).

Kansas is gearing up for the upcoming World Cup, hosted across 16 North American cities, including its smallest host city, Kansas City.

At a Legislative Budget Committee meeting on Aug. 26, Kansas lawmakers received an update from Kansas City 2026, the nonprofit overseeing the strategy of hosting the World Cup. Some key details are still hazy, with fewer than 300 days to go before the start of the event.

Kansas doesn't know which teams will be playing in the seven matches scheduled for the region, but will be announced on Dec. 5. There will be four group stage matches, one in the first bracket of the tournament when 32 teams remain and one quarter-final match, all played at Arrowhead Stadium.

There may also be teams that stay at a local facility for training and lodging. Possible base camps include the Sporting Kansas City training facility in Kansas City, Kansas, the KC Current training facility in Riverside, Missouri, and the Rock Chalk Park in Lawrence.

""The team base camps are really the team's home away from home, those are the locations where teams will come and train to prep for the tournament,"" said Lindsey Douglas, chief operating officer for Kansas City 2026. ""These teams are going to bring their entire support staff, sometimes their families, so the influx of folks that come with a team are pretty substantial.""

In the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" the large tax and spending bill championed by President Donald Trump, allocated $625 million for a security at the 11 host cities. It's unclear how much will specifically go to the Kansas City region, but Douglas estimated that it will be around $50 million.

About 650,000 visitors are expected to the Kansas City area through the duration of the World Cup. The profile of the visitors estimates about 54% will be visiting from another country, and will stay an average of 10 days.

The event will double the number of teams playing from prior World Cups to 48. It's estimated that half the world's population will tune in for at least one game.

""The World Cup is the largest sporting event in the world, this will be the largest version of that sporting event in 2026. Even though soccer is one of many sports we follow here in the United States, by far at the world stage, it is the largest,"" Douglas said.

That many people coming to the region is anticipated to generate $653 million in direct economic impact. Kansas City 2026 said it's attempting to leverage the visitors and the economic impact for longer-term partnerships.

""We really want to maximize that for the tournament and make sure we're getting the biggest bang for our buck out of business attraction and really telling our story through this,"" Douglas said.

There are also local business that can take advantage of the event, and so far, 2,000 vendors have signed up with KC 2026 as potential partners.

The Fan Fest at the World War I museum in Kansas City is going to have a capacity of 25,000.

Kansas Rep. Troy Waymaster, R-Bunker Hill, the chair of the Legislative Budget Committee, raised concerns about the number of hotel rooms available for the influx of guests. He worried that hotel rooms could see a massive surge in pricing during the World Cup.

""We know that people are going to travel two to four hours if they can't find accomodation within the metropolitan area,"" Douglas said. ""We also know that VRBOs, AirBnBs are going to be in demand. Also campgrounds are really looking at this as an opportunity as well. And so I would imagine that every type of accommodation will be maximized to host the number of visitors we'll have.""

Transportation was also brought up, specifically whether Kansas City 2026 will utilize school bus fleets to shuttle fans to World Cup events. The existing public transit networks aren't substantial enough to accommodate the number of visitors coming in.

School buses may be one way to increase capacity by shuttling people from the Kansas City International Airport to downtown Kansas City, Arrowhead or the FIFA Fan Fest.

Currency exchange was also brought up, with Kansas City having few options to trade other currencies for U.S. dollars. An estimated 68% of tourists will have a credit or debit card that works in the United States, but the other 32% may have to rely on currency exchange at the airport.

FIFA 2026 said they're discussing options with Visa, which is a commercial sponsor of the World Cup, to get more options for currency exchange.","{'href': 'https://www.cjonline.com', 'title': 'The Topeka Capital-Journal'}","soccer"

Mikel Arteta is yet to mastermind a victory away at a team directly competing with his side for top spot

We haven't left the month of August, the transfer window hasn't even closed yet, and already it feels like every point matters in the Premier League title race. Pre-season favourites Liverpool and Arsenal are two of the only three teams left - the other being Thomas Frank's Tottenham - with a 100 per cent record still in tact.

Manchester City looked pretty vulnerable in last weekend's defeat at home to Spurs, while dark horses Chelsea have also faltered through the opening few weeks. There's a real chance, then, for one of the Reds or the Gunners to pull away with some early momentum.

That's what makes Sunday's showdown so interesting. Arsenal and Liverpool will do battle as Europe's two biggest spenders this summer. The pressure is on both to deliver on the promise of their respective re-toolings, even more so for Mikel Arteta's men, who are still without a major trophy since the first coronavirus lockdown.

Defeat at Anfield would set a pretty bleak tone heading into the season's first international break, but victory for the north Londoners could define their season, even at this early stage.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The Rossonere are yet to win a trophy on the women's side, but hope high-profile friendlies can help with their Serie A and Champions League goals

On Saturday, Chelsea's preparations for the new season, in which they will be defending three domestic trophies, will come to a climax. The Blues will play their final pre-season friendly in front of their home fans at Kingsmeadow, who witnessed an unprecedented unbeaten domestic campaign in Sonia Bompastor's first year in charge.

Chelsea did not lose a game in the Women's Super League, FA Cup or League Cup as they scooped up an incredible treble in 2024-25, each player and staff member etching their name into the history books in the process. But they were not content. A Champions League semi-final defeat to Barcelona left the Blues unsatisfied despite the amazing work done across the board, as that trophy once again eluded them. That it instead landed in the hands of London rivals Arsenal will have only added to the hurt and the motivation to put forth a better European title charge this time around.

It's fair to say that it is a compliment to AC Milan, then, to have been chosen as the opponents for Chelsea's final game before another highly-anticipated season kicks off next Friday, at home to Manchester City. The Rossonere have a young team - in that it was founded just seven years ago and also because it had the third-youngest squad in Serie A last term. But that it has been cherry-picked as the final test for Bompastor's winning machine, a year on from playing three-time European champions Barcelona in the Joan Gamper Trophy, suggests it is doing something right…","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

As the US Open celebrates the 75th anniversary of Althea Gibson breaking tennis' colour barrier at the 1950 U.S. National Championships, Frances Tiafoe is among many Black tennis stars eager to continue her legacy.

After his second-round win on Wednesday at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, Tiafoe reflected on how Gibson paved the way for him and many of his peers.

""It's incredible. What a legend, man,"" he said, noting how Gibson set the stage for the likes of the Williams sisters, 2017 US Open champion Sloane Stephens and 2023 winner Coco Gauff, among others. 

""[Althea] was a true leader and an incredible person. Her and Arthur [Ashe], man,"" the American continued. ""So I've got hella love for both, and I wish I could be saying that to them personally, but obviously the circumstances... But man, if they're over there watching us, I hope they're smiling over us, because we're doing some great stuff with that small opportunity [they gave us].""



Tiafoe also referenced Canadian teen Victoria Mboko, who won her first WTA 1000 title three weeks ago in Montreal. Answering a question about the growing African-American presence in tennis, Tiafoe explained what it means to him to be the son of Sierra Leonean immigrants.

""For me, I sit in a different spot with it. Obviously, at the end of the day, yes, I'm African-American, but I'm African, right, and African-raised,"" he shared. ""So seeing someone like Mboko and Felix [Auger-Aliassime] and myself, Clervie [Ngounoue], that's a whole different beast. You've got parents that are coming to try to make these kids' lives, give them a chance better than they had. So I understand that, being the son of immigrants.

""Ultimately, to be able to see so many people of colour do great things in a predominantly white sport, it's tremendous. I think that brings unbelievable diversity to the game. I think that brings a totally different demographic for the game. I'm happy to be a small ounce of that, and young guys are looking up to me and wanting to be like that.

""Obviously I had a ton of great examples before me and will have a bunch of people come after me. So I'm happy to be a part of it in my prime and see it grow and can't wait to continue to see where it goes.


""African-Americans in tennis, we're at an all-time high right now. I mean, totally killing it.""

Venus Williams and Leylah Fernandez made a hell of a doubles debut on Thursday in Louis Armstrong Stadium, coming from behind in the first set to defeat Lyudmyla Kichenok and Ellen Perez, 7-6 (4), 6-3.

NEW YORK -- ""Venus, she's a legend. She's an icon. Growing up, when I first started playing tennis, people asked me, 'Who did you watch when you were growing up?' I always said Justine Henin and the Williams sisters.""

Leylah Fernandez said that matter of factly, on the rooftop of the player clubhouse at the Lindner Family Tennis Center in Mason, Ohio during a casual conversation in early August.

Less than a month later, in a scene she likely would not have predicted, she was sharing a court with her idol on Louis Armstrong Stadium in front of more than 14,000 rabid fans who were no doubt thrilled to have one more opportunity to see Venus play. 

And the result was a good one for the American-Canadian pairing. The duo, which accepted a wild card into the US Open doubles draw on Tuesday, upset sixth-seeded Lyudmyla Kichenok and Ellen Perez, 7-6 (4), 6-3, in their first-round matchup on an unseasonably windy day in Queens. (It was downright uncomfortable if you were dressed for summer, though the fired-up crowd hardly seemed to notice.)

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Towering over her partner -- a former US Open singles finalist and doubles quarterfinalist -- and looking at times like a big sister, the 45-year-old Williams earned her first win in three New York tries after bowing out in the revamped mixed doubles tournament last week and losing to Karolina Muchova on Monday.

It looked bleak to start, with Williams and Fernandez falling behind 5-2 in the first set, but they rallied to even it at 5. And with the thunderous crowd firmly in their corner, they eked out the tiebreak to take the first set and grab firm control of the match.

""I have no idea what I was thinking during that tiebreak,"" Fernandez, who's into the third round in the singles draw, said with a laugh. ""I think I just kind of went on instincts. Venus said it perfectly. Play it as if it was a singles match. So I just didn't want to think too much. ... No, I just wanted to go out there, play, and I had full confidence with Venus at the net and even in the baseline.""

The next set was far less dramatic, as the unseeded pair jumped out to a 4-1 lead and comfortably closed it out. They seemed to gel and complement each other more effectively as the match wore on, finding a rhythm that kept their opponents off balance and defensive. 

Communication was key in establishing that cadence. 

""I'm used to being the big sister,"" Williams told reporters after the match, ""so I'm kind of asking her what she wants. It's important for her to feel comfortable. Theoretically I have more experience, but she's been playing a lot more matches, so maybe that makes us neck and neck in terms of how we can compete.

""But I think we just had to see what happened, because you never know what's going to happen in a match and you have to adjust. Once we got down, I feel like we just put our foot on the gas.""

It was a full circle moment for the 22-year-old Fernandez, who remembers practicing with Venus outside of Lexington, Kentucky back in 2020. She was new to the Hologic WTA Tour at the time and didn't know many players, and the gesture was a meaningful one.

""I thought I was going to be very intimidated, but she was super nice and welcoming,"" Fernandez recalled during the Cincinnati Open.

She certainly appeared nice and welcoming again on Thursday, as the two embraced after securing the win. 

This was Williams' first doubles victory in Queens in 11 years, though she's certainly no stranger to doubles success at this venue. The seven-time Grand Slam singles champion won the doubles tournament here in 1999, alongside her sister Serena, and the pair won it a second time in 2009.

Williams and Fernandez will play Eri Hozumi and Ulrikke Eikeri in the second round on Saturday.

Coco Gauff didn't always have her best stuff Thursday night but displayed her championship pedigree, while Amanda Anisimova defeated Maya Joint to reach the third round for the first time since 2020.

Survive and advance.

That's exactly what Coco Gauff did Thursday night, defeating Donna Vekic, 7-6 (5), 6-2 in the US Open second round at Arthur Ashe Stadium. The match lasted 1 hour and 39 minutes and ended with the American star delighting the New York crowd.

US Open: Draws | Scores | Order of Play

It came on a night when the former US Open champion had to dig deep to find her best tennis, especially during a tense opening set that left her visibly shaken.

“I was just trying to tell myself to breathe,” Gauff said after the match. “I don't remember a lot of the end of the first set, to be honest, but it's kind of amazing that I was able to get out of that one. But once I was able to reset, I went to the bathroom and splashed some water on my face. After that I felt a lot better out here.”

Despite committing seven double faults and being broken four times in the first set, Gauff broke Vekic twice while the Croatian was serving for the set, forcing a tiebreak.

After her seventh double fault -- which came on the opening point of the tiebreak -- Gauff steadied herself just enough to secure the set, moments after wiping away tears following another dropped service game.

The shift in her demeanor was evident when she returned to the court after the break. After struggling with her serve throughout the first set, she cut down on the double faults and wasn't broken once in the second.

Moments after clinching victory, Gauff shed a few more tears, thanked the crowd for its support and revealed a surprising secondary source of inspiration behind her second-set resilience: Simone Biles.

“I saw her, and honestly, I don't know if she's still up there, but she helped me pull it out,” Gauff said. “I was just thinking, if she can go on a six-inch beam and do that with all the pressures of the world, then I can hit the ball in this 75. … I don't know how big this court is. 

“But I saw her late in the second getting interviewed by ESPN, and it brought me a little bit of calm just knowing her story with all the things she went through mentally. She's an inspiration, surely, and her presence definitely did help me today.”

With the victory, Gauff earned her 73rd Grand Slam match-win. Since 2000, only Maria Sharapova (85) has recorded more women's singles Grand Slam victories before turning 22.

She'll have a chance to capture win No. 74 in the third round when she faces off against Magdalena Frech, whom she has defeated in both of their previous meetings without dropping a set.

Amanda Anisimova reached the third round of the US Open for the first time in five years Thursday night, defeating Maya Joint 7-6 (2), 6-2 in 1 hour and 16 minutes.

The crowd at Louis Armstrong Stadium witnessed a thriller of an opening set, with Joint earning an early break against the reigning Wimbledon finalist. But Anisimova broke back as Joint served for the set, then cruised through the tiebreak and dominated the second set, breaking Joint's serve twice more.

Anisimova finished with 23 winners compared to just five for Joint.

Next up for Anisimova is Romania's Jaqueline Cristian, who is making just her second career appearance in a Grand Slam third round. It will be the first meeting between the two.

NEW YORK—You won't see many second-round post-match interviews as emotional as the one Coco Gauff gave after her 7-6 (5), 6-2 win over Donna Vekic at the US Open on Thursday.Gauff got tearful thanking the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd for pushing, urging, cheering her on through a match that was never easy, and looked at times to be doomed to end in disaster for her.“It's been a rough couple of weeks,” Gauff said, referring with her well-publicized struggles to fix her serve. “You guys bring me so much joy.”“I'm doing this for myself, but I'm also doing this for you.”

Gauff's gratitude was understandable. For much of the first set, she looked as if she were about to drown in front of 20,000 people.After her previous match, she had seemed cautiously optimistic about her progress on her serve. Improving it was, according to her, just a matter of reps now. But that optimism quickly looked misplaced tonight.She started double faulting right away, and was broken in the first game. Silence reigned in Ashe. A little later, after double faulting to go down 4-5, she looked up toward her team with a look of defeat. She spent the changeover with her face in her towel. Two games later, Gauff hit a second serve as hard as she could, missed it by three feet, and was broken again. This time she was shaking on the changeover. The silence was even deeper now.“It's an uncomfortable watch,” Mary Carillo said in the commentary booth.

But at that moment, hope arrived. It came in the form of a physio who walked on court to help Vekic with an arm issue. Up to that point, the Croatian had hardly played much better than Gauff. And her game would only go downhill from there.In the first-set tiebreaker, Vekic made four errors, including one on set point. The crucial, match-changing moment came with Vekic serving at 4-5. She tried a drop shot, which is never a good idea against Gauff. Coco ran it down and closed the point with a forehand winner. She pumped her fist, the crowd roared back, and she seemed to loosen up and remember how good she really is at tennis.“I was just trying to tell myself to breathe,” she said. “Just trying to put another ball in the court, and just trying to remind myself of the things I do well.”“It's kind of amazing I was able to get out of that one.”

Gauff went off court after the first set, splashed some water on her face, and said she felt better when she came back out. Her serve felt better, too, as the double faults decreased. She would finish with just eight, and make 69 percent of her first serves.There was no second wind for Vekic, as the mistakes continued to flow. She finished with 12 winners and 36 errors, which was reminiscent of the 12 winners and 56 errors that Gauff's first-round opponent, Ajla Tomljanovic, made.Which brings up a point about Gauff: Even when she's not playing well, she has a knack for making her opponents play badly—just ask Aryna Sabalenka. Gauff's forehand is rightfully seen as her weaker ground stroke, but it does work well on defense. Vekic targeted that side for most of the night, but Gauff responded by rolling her forehand back crosscourt high and heavy, forcing Vekic to go for more—and ultimately miss.

Gauff said she was especially inspired by one fan in particular: Simone Biles.

In this case, though, the sea of people—and one very famous person in particular—came to her rescue.

FP2 Highlights: 2025 Dutch Grand Prix

2025 Dutch GP FP2: Russell and Piastri have close call in the pit lane

Max Verstappen has done more than dominate Formula 1. He has transformed the sport in the Netherlands. From the return of the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort to the rise of the Orange Army, Verstappen has turned F1 into a national passion. His victories, direct personality, and loyal fanbase have created a cultural shift that now resonates worldwide, redefining what F1 fandom looks and feels like.

At first glance, the atmosphere could be mistaken for a football match or a summer festival. Grandstands packed with thousands of fans in head-to-toe orange, flags waving and music blaring.

But this isn't a stadium or concert. It's the Dutch Grand Prix. And the Dutch fans, now known worldwide as the 'Orange Army', have turned race weekends into something closer to a national celebration.

At the centre of it all is one man: Max Verstappen. His rise to superstardom hasn't just filled grandstands, it has transformed the way the Netherlands connects with Formula 1 and reshaped the culture of the sport itself.

In the decades before Verstappen, F1 sat in the background of Dutch sporting culture. Unlike countries such as Italy, Britain or Germany, where racing heroes were household names, Dutch drivers never reached the same heights.

Jan Lammers kept the Dutch flag on the grid in the late 1970s and early 80s. Jos Verstappen, Max's father, brought excitement in the 1990s with a pair of podiums. In the 2000s, Christijan Albers added further representation, although mostly in struggling teams.

Each played a role in sustaining Dutch interest, but none managed to ignite mass appeal. TV audiences stayed loyal, but F1 remained overshadowed by football and cycling.

Everything shifted in 2015. Verstappen made history when he joined the F1 grid at just 17 years old with Toro Rosso (now Racing Bulls), becoming the youngest driver ever to start a race. Although his debut at the Australian Grand Prix ended in retirement, his flashes of raw speed made him impossible to ignore.

A year later came the turning point. After just four races of the 2016 season, he was promoted to the Red Bull team. Incredibly, he repaid their faith immediately and in his very first outing for the squad, and at 18 years and 228 days old, he became the youngest race winner in F1 history.

Suddenly, the Netherlands had its superstar. It wasn't just the records that set him apart, but the way he raced: fearless, aggressive, and unafraid to take on established champions. That same fire carried into the paddock, where his blunt answers and meme-worthy one liners to the media made him refreshingly direct and unapologetically himself.

From there, a fan movement exploded. Dutch supporters rallied around Verstappen and began travelling in massive numbers to races across Europe, especially to nearby tracks like Belgium's Spa-Francorchamps and Austria's Red Bull Ring. Whole grandstands became seas of orange, the national colour of the Netherlands, creating a carnival-like atmosphere wherever they went.

Verstappen celebrates with the Orange Army on his victory lap at the 2021 Dutch Grand Prix

In many ways, it redefined what F1 fandom could look like. Italy has Ferrari and their dedicated Tifosi, whose passion runs deep but is tied to one team above all. Britain has its Silverstone loyalists, patriotic and knowledgeable, who turn their home race into a celebration of motorsport heritage.

The Dutch, however, brought something entirely different. Their fandom wasn't confined to a single circuit or tied to decades of tradition. Instead, they turned following Verstappen into a travelling movement, more like a football away crowd, with orange shirts, wigs and flags aplenty. They created a visual and vocal spectacle that occupied entire grandstands.

What makes them stand out even more is that their devotion has grown in lockstep with Verstappen's dominance. As he racked up victories and World Championships, setting records for consecutive wins and season victory totals, the Orange Army only became louder and more visible.

The Verstappen effect wasn't limited to the racetrack. As Dutch FIA Deputy Race Director Claire Dubbelman recalled on the BBC's Chequered Flag podcast, “The last time I lived in the Netherlands was around 2015–2016, and motorsport was in a very difficult place. When Max entered Formula 1, it's been the revival of the sport in that country.”

That revival came into full view in 2021 when the Dutch Grand Prix returned to Zandvoort after 36 years. Tickets sold out within hours, millions tuned in worldwide, and Verstappen delivered the fairytale by winning the first edition. By the following season, attendance at Zandvoort had surged by 81 percent, a clear measure of Verstappen's influence. He claimed three consecutive victories from 2021 to 2023, all from pole position, before Mclaren's Lando Norris ended the streak in 2024.

Sponsors were quick to capitalise. From global giants to local homegrown brands, companies lined up to associate with Verstappen. His face appeared on billboards, in adverts, and across merchandise that stretched far beyond core motorsport circles.

With that came something larger: a sense of national identity. Verstappen was no longer simply an athlete. He had become a cultural icon, embodying Dutch pride both on and off the track.

The ripple effects have extended far beyond the Netherlands. The Orange Army is now part of F1's global identity, their seas of orange as recognisable as Ferrari red or Mercedes silver. Their travelling presence adds spectacle to broadcasts and has inspired other fan groups to raise their game, making races louder, more colourful, and more vibrant.

Verstappen's rise has opened new doors for the sport. Dutch fans quickly became one of the sport's fastest growing markets, while the Orange Army's spectacle turned into a selling point for promoters worldwide.

Their energy is celebrated in broadcasts, documentaries, and campaigns highlighting a new era driven as much by fans as by the racing itself. And through it all, Verstappen's story sits at the heart of this shift. His dominance has given his fans more to celebrate, and their devotion has helped redefine the atmosphere of the sport.

With the Dutch Grand Prix back at Zandvoort this weekend and for the second-last time before a scheduled farewell in 2026, the Orange Army may be gearing up to make its most passionate statement yet.

Whatever comes next, Verstappen's legacy is already secure. He did more than win races, he gave the Dutch a reason to fall in love with F1 – and in doing so, changed how the world experiences it.

2025 Dutch GP FP2: Russell and Piastri have close call in the pit lane

Lando Norris has kicked off the second half of the season by going quickest in Free Practice 1 at the Dutch Grand Prix.

Lando Norris has set the pace during the opening practice session at the Dutch Grand Prix, the McLaren racer going fastest from team mate Oscar Piastri and Aston Martin's Lance Stroll.

After a few weeks without racing during the sport's summer break, the drivers were greeted by dry but windy conditions as the session got underway at Zandvoort, with Nico Hulkenberg leading a queue of cars out of the pit lane when the green light appeared.

Most of the field had bolted on the medium compound for their opening runs, on a weekend in which Pirelli are celebrating their 500th World Championship Grand Prix.

Amid a busy start – with potentially heavy rain forecast for later in the day – Lewis Hamilton was the first to suffer a big moment, the Briton experiencing a 360-degree spin that triggered the yellow flags. “I've got flat spots all round,” Hamilton subsequently reported.

This was followed by a flurry of action as Yuki Tsunoda also had an off before Kimi Antonelli found himself beached in the gravel at Turn 9, resulting in the red flags being thrown while the marshals worked to recover his stricken Mercedes.

The session resumed with just over 40 minutes left on the clock, leading to another busy run on track. Max Verstappen had put himself at the top of the timesheets prior to the session stoppage, but Norris bettered that effort to lead a McLaren 1-2 at the halfway mark via his time of 1m 10.278s, four-tenths clear of Piastri.

Focus for most switched to the soft tyre laps as FP1 progressed, leading to Piastri cutting Norris' advantage down to 0.292s, while Fernando Alonso was an eye-catching third for Aston Martin ahead of the Williams of Alex Albon and Mercedes' George Russell.

Attentions then turned to the medium-shod long runs amid the final quarter of the hour, preparation that could prove crucial should rain limit the opportunity to get this mileage in during later sessions. Stroll, meanwhile, voiced his frustration over the radio after encountering a slow-moving Tsunoda out on track.

Norris' earlier effort of 1m 10.278s remained unbeaten, meaning that the Briton ended the first FP1 back after the summer break on top. Piastri also stayed in P2, while Stroll impressed by slotting his Aston Martin into third during the latter stages.

Alonso followed in fourth in a solid showing for the British squad, with Albon behind in fifth from the Red Bull of Verstappen. But there was drama for the home hero after the chequered flag had fallen, having gone off track and become beached in the gravel following a practice start at Turn 1.

Russell – who had a trip across the gravel himself during the final minutes – Williams' Carlos Sainz, Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto and the Alpine of Pierre Gasly completed the top 10.

The Racing Bulls duo of Liam Lawson and Isack Hadjar claimed P11 and P12 respectively, ahead of Hulkenberg for Kick Sauber in P13. Ferrari, meanwhile, had a low-key outing in P14 and P15 for Charles Leclerc and Hamilton – Leclerc declaring that the team were ""miles off"".

Tsunoda took 16th place in the Red Bull, with the Haas pair of Esteban Ocon and Ollie Bearman claiming 17th and 19th while Alpine's Franco Colapinto separated them in 18th. Antonelli was classified in 20th, having been unable to rejoin following his earlier off.

With the first hour of running now complete, the drivers and teams will examine their data and prepare for Friday's second practice session, which is set to get underway at 1600 local time.

2025 Dutch GP FP2: Onboard with Norris for the fastest lap of Friday practice at Zandvoort

Aston Martin pace in Zandvoort ‘not a big surprise' insists Norris

Lewis Hamilton has been backed by two of his former Formula 1 team mates to make his Ferrari move a success.

Lewis Hamilton has been backed to turn his Ferrari form around by former team mates George Russell and Fernando Alonso after a difficult start to life with the Scuderia.

Seven-time Formula 1 champion Hamilton sparked the driver transfer market into overdrive in February 2024 when he made the shock announcement that he would leave Mercedes and join Ferrari following the conclusion of that campaign.

Aside from a victory in the Chinese Sprint, however, Hamilton's dream move has so far had its struggles – with a downbeat Hamilton even suggesting after Qualifying in Hungary that Ferrari needed to “change the driver”.

Ahead of the season resumption in the Netherlands, Hamilton dismissed these comments as a “heat of the moment” thing.

Asked how he sees Hamilton's situation, Russell said: “We did speak away from the track before Hungary. I think it's a tough situation for him, for any driver who doesn't feel like they are performing to their potential, but F1 is so difficult, and Lewis is a fighter.

“I'm sure he's going to continue, but I can't really speak for him. Of course, as a friend, you wish him the best, but as a rival and competitor, you don't wish too much because we want to beat them!”

Alonso partnered with rookie Hamilton at McLaren in 2007 in a bitter campaign where the pair went head-to-head for the Drivers' title, only to be pipped at the post by Ferrari driver Kimi Raikkonen – a crown that remains Ferrari's most recent Drivers' accolade.

Having also spent five years with Ferrari between 2010-14, Alonso has first-hand knowledge of both team and driver.

Pressed on what advice he would offer Hamilton, he said: “Difficult to say. I think from the outside, you never know for sure what is going on, but Lewis doesn't need to prove anything.

“He's an incredible driver and he will figure out sooner or later to be at the top pace. He and Ferrari will always be a combo that you need to respect a lot.”

FP2 Highlights: 2025 Dutch Grand Prix

2025 Dutch GP FP2: Russell and Piastri have close call in the pit lane

It might take some luck for Max Verstappen to win at the Zandvoort track that he says still gives him “goosebumps” – but the reigning World Champion isn't ruling out the possibility.

Red Bull's Max Verstappen has made his home track of Zandvoort his fortress since the Dutch venue returned to the Formula 1 calendar in 2021, winning three times and finishing second once. But can he continue that run this weekend?

The reigning World Champion has won two Grands Prix this year but those were outstanding drives that very much went against the form book, with McLaren stretching their legs this year and emerging as the class leaders.

Verstappen sits 97 points (which is nearly four Grand Prix wins' worth of points) behind championship leader Oscar Piastri with 10 races to go, and he knows adding to his victory tally in Zandvoort and the chances of making it five titles on the bounce will be a challenge.

FP2 Highlights: 2025 Dutch Grand Prix

2025 Dutch GP FP2: Russell and Piastri have close call in the pit lane

Toto Wolff, James Vowles and Flavio Briatore face the press ahead of the 2025 Dutch Grand Prix from Zandvoort.

TEAM REPRESENTATIVES: Toto WOLFF (Mercedes), James VOWLES (Williams), Flavio BRIATORE (Alpine)

Q: James, if we could start with you. Let's start by talking about the business here in Zandvoort this weekend. The team has been very quick here these past two seasons. How's it looking this year?

James VOWLES: The good news is it looks like it's continued on as it has done. The car works well here. It's a mixture of the speed of the corners and the layout, and I think the banking helps us as well. I don't quite think where we are in the timing sheets this morning is representative. We're a little bit further away than that, but we should have a car that's fighting for points here.

Q: Let's go bigger picture now. Ten races to go. We've all just come back from the break. You're involved in a very tense battle... Bigger picture: the battle for P5? Give us an idea of what the message is as we go into these last 10 races.

JV: Yeah. I think we put an upgrade on the car in Spa. That's our last upgrade, but it should put us in a position now where it's going to be tough. But we are in the fight for fifth to the end of the season. That's the reality behind it. We just have to do everything perfectly well. Now, of course, nothing happens perfectly in Formula 1, but the message to the team was: we know we're focused on ‘26, we know we're asking a lot of you here at the track to deliver everything you can with the car we have, and we know that other teams like Aston and potentially Sauber will keep pushing that car further forward. But you can see, race-on-race, what happens. If you get the car in the right position at the right time, especially in mixed conditions, you can walk away with a bag full of points, which will protect you at the end of the year. So, I mean, the main message now is we have three races – here, Monza and Baku – where I know our car will perform. So we need to maximise that. Then beyond there, let's take every opportunity that comes our way.

Q: You say the focus is 2026. Of course it is. So how important is P5 in the Constructors' Championship? If it's P5, P6… does it actually matter to the team? Or as long as you make the step forward next year, that's the only thing that matters?

JV: I mean, the money's nice, but that's honestly the only difference between those two. I don't care where we start up and down the grid. It doesn't make a single bit of difference to me. Internally, the reason why we made decisions we did on cutting the investment in this year's car was quite straightforward. If we finish sixth or seventh, so be it. We have to make sure that we're making big steps forward. We have to remember where we came from – is last. That's where we were. And we have a long way to go to even get close to the likes of someone like Mercedes. So let's forward invest in the future. And if that means we compromise fifth, so be it. But we'll fight with our heart until the end of it.

Q: James, thank you for that. Toto, let's bring you in. P3 in the Constructors' Championship, everyone back to work. What is your message to your racing team as we go into this second part of the season?

Toto WOLFF: Go for it. Well, I don't know what Flavio said before, but clearly James' perspective is the right one here. We're embarking on a completely new set of regulations, and they're extremely complicated. Nobody really knows where you're going to fall out, and therefore you need to give it the highest priority. And at the same time, no racing team will want to give up a season. So how we try to do it is to deploy our trackside engineering team, a small group of engineers back at base, on that current project without bringing any more major upgrades, but really optimising the product, trying to learn as much as possible for next year. Also, there are certain variables and then there are certain topics which will continue – like the tyres. And we're giving it everything to perform, but also, it's all about winning a championship. Nobody remembers who came second, third, fifth or last. And that's why you need to see the positives. The further down the chain you are, the more wind tunnel time you're going to get for the following year. And that, under the new regulations, is of a massive advantage.

Q: Does the car – or the product, as you call it – have the underlying pace to beat Ferrari this year?

TW: There are big fluctuations in performance. You know, in this sport, we tend to be manic-depressive. One weekend, Ferrari is great, and everybody says, well, now they're on a trajectory to challenge McLaren and finish second. And the next weekend it's us again. I think it's very difficult to predict.

Q: Now, I'm sure we're going to hear who your driver lineup is in 2026 soon. But can I talk about a driver who has recently been announced as a Cadillac driver: Valtteri Bottas? What does he bring to a new team, do you think?

TW: Valtteri is a very, very interesting one because he had the fortune and misfortune to go against Lewis Hamilton as a team-mate when Lewis was at the peak of his game. James and I, we've been in this for a very long time. Valtteri has tremendous speed and is, in our opinion, one of the best drivers on the grid. Valtteri left the Mercedes team because we promoted George Russell – similar to Kimi today – a young gun that was with Williams for a time because he was in the junior programme and looked very promising. That was Valtteri. And since then, he's dominated every team-mate he's had in whatever car. I'm really happy. Obviously, we love Valtteri as a third driver and as a reserve. I said it before – if one of our works drivers were to have fish poisoning, we know we [can] put someone in the car that can be as fast and competitive. There is no compromise by putting Valtteri in the car on a given Saturday or Sunday. That obviously goes missing now because he's going to Cadillac. But at the same time, we're racers, and we love for him to have the opportunity of going back onto the grid in an exciting new project, and I'm sure he will shine.

Q: Thank you for that. Flavio, good to see you again. Can I bring you in on the subject of Bottas, first of all? Bottas and Pérez – were they ever an option?

Flavio BRIATORE: No, really. I talked with a lot of people. I talked with Bottas as well. We talked with Toto as well at the time, but really, there was never a discussion for Bottas to drive for Alpine. I think so Alpine helped Bottas a little bit to sign the contract with Cadillac. We did some marketing. But this is the reason, honestly. I like Valtteri because he's a super driver. And what Toto says is exactly the same. He was unlucky to be in Mercedes at the same time as Lewis, when Lewis was really at the peak of his driving. We have a different idea, but it's nice to have Valtteri back. It's nice to have a driver back with a lot of experience, but I'm looking for something else.

Q: Can we talk about the incumbent now in your second seat – Franco Colapinto? What do you need to see from him for him to retain that seat?

FB: I think I see everything already. I don't need to see anything anymore. It's difficult. For this driver, it's very difficult to cope with this car. These cars are very, very heavy, very quick. And for a young driver to put in Formula 1, maybe it was not the timing to have Franco in Formula 1. Maybe he needs another year or two to be part of Formula 1. And I know that, in the end, what is important is the result. He tries very hard. He tries very hard with the engineers to please them in everything, but it's not what I expect from Colapinto.

Q: Final one from me. Steve Nielsen starts work for the team next week. What do you see as job number one for him?

FB: Not just job number one. When you're in Formula 1, in one team, it's a job for the team. And it will be good. I've known Steve a long time – he was with me at Renault. We need somebody like Steve. We need a team manager. We need somebody who knows the system and knows the people, and someone who coordinates the team from A to Z. It's not just one job I expect from Steve. I expect Steve to be in charge from A to Z. Basically, it's what the managing director is doing. And I'm happy to have Steve next week. I believe the first day is Monday, and our first race with Steve is in Monza.

QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR

Q: (Diletta Colombo – AutoMoto.it) A question for Flavio. Pierre has done an outstanding job in what has been a very difficult season for your team. Do you feel like he's the right person to steer the team into the future?

FB: Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely, yes.

Q: Flavio, what impresses you the most about Pierre Gasly?

FB: He's good. He's consistent. He's a team player. I know him very well. We need some base in the team, and Pierre is a base in the team for the future.

Q: (Christian Menath – Motorsport-magazin.com) Flavio, another one for you. Christian Horner could be available for your team. Did you consider him taking on board the Alpine project? Did you already talk to him as he's a good friend of yours as well?

FB: I no consider in this moment anything. Christian is not in Formula 1 in this moment anymore. I hope he comes back soon. But for the moment, he's not in the picture of the team.

Q: (Leonid Kliuev – Grande Premio) Question to all three. Imagine you're Graham Lowden, Team Principal of Cadillac, and you have four candidates for next year: Checo, Valtteri, Felipe Drugovich, and Mick Schumacher. Who would you choose and why?

TW: They all have pros and cons. I think what Cadillac went for is something you can understand. They went for experience. I don't know how many wins and podiums there are between Valtteri and Checo, and I think for that stage of the project, it is understandable they did that.

JV: With all these things, we only have part of the information. You need to understand what else comes as part of those packages. But I agree with Toto – their first year is going to be tricky and difficult, and I think experience may guide the way in where they're going.

FB: The same as Toto. Nothing else.

Q: (Ivo Pakvis – Panorama) Question to Toto. Loyalty has been a very important factor in your team under your leadership. In a world that demands constant flexibility and adaptability, how do you maintain that flexibility in the context of that loyalty?

TW: Flexibility and loyalty – I think what's most important in our job is to be transparent. I think Flavio's always shown it – he says what he means. With drivers, it's the same with us. Once you decide to embark on the road, this is what you do. You are open about it. For us as a team, integrity and loyalty are key factors. But that doesn't mean you're not flexible. Sometimes you need to readjust, recalibrate. There's a change of circumstances. But most important is within the team to have an open conversation about these things.

Q: (Jon Noble – The Race) To Flavio. Renault's got a new CEO who's just come in recently. How have your conversations with him gone? What kind of targets have you laid down together? And do you still see this team on the roadmap to fight for podiums next year and potentially the championship in ‘27?

FB: The new CEO for Renault – I think Renault in the last thirty years, it's not new. He was number two to Luca DeMeo. The new CEO is very enthusiastic about the Formula 1 programme. Renault wants to stay in Formula 1. I believe François [Provost] is in Monza for the first race. I know him very well. And really, the programme is the same. The chairman, [Jean-Dominique] Senard, is very supportive of Formula 1. We need better results – this is what we need for next year. But this year is very complicated for us. We put a lot of effort into the 2026 car, like Toto said. But it's not easy to interpret the rules. Maybe we made a mistake by not having any steps from the beginning of the season to now, and we pay for that. As well, in this moment, two or three tenths, it's ten or 15 cars. We know we have a big handicap with power – with the engine. We hope to forget this year and be happy in 2026. That's what we hope in this moment. I hope as well that the new chairman of Renault is very supportive. And for the moment, in the Renault Group, there's no drama, no change. Everybody's happy.

Q: Is the objective for 2026 podiums?

FB: Yes. Because if it's you need to change the job. I change the job – maybe you give me a job! I have a job with Toto.

Q: Luke Smith (The Athletic) Toto, I have a question for you on Valtteri. Dan Towriss said that you guys have spoken a lot through negotiations, and you were still going to chat further about what Valtteri's availability would be through the remainder of this year. What are your thoughts on that? I know Valtteri will be on-site as reserve for the rest of the season, but how much freedom will he have to make a head start with Cadillac ahead of next year?

TW: As I said before, maybe sometimes I'm being a bit naive, but I want to do the best from a racing standpoint – the best for Valtteri whilst not compromising the Mercedes status quo. So, I think it's pretty easy. Valtteri continues to be our reserve and third driver until the end of the season, and he's giving it all. I've zero doubt that he's going to do it with the utmost integrity. At the same time, I have no problem that he's starting his job in Cadillac. It makes it easier that the regulations are totally different for next year. I'm happy. It was no problem for us to release Valtteri for the announcement and events that Cadillac did in order to present the drivers, and it will continue so during the year. I think Graham and Dan, with support from GM, this is a very strong and ambitious project – good for Formula 1 – and that's why we want to do the utmost for them to showcase what they will be doing. And therefore, if we need to give Valtteri as a driver for events or for these purposes, no problem.

Q: Toto, would that include a test program for Cadillac in the second half of the year if that materialises?

TW: I haven't heard of any test programme so far because they haven't got a car. As it stands, we will always be supportive of Valtteri because those cars are so different next year.

Q: (Stuart Codling – Autosport) A question for Toto. Flavio has just shot the idea down, but the rumours don't go away that perhaps Flavio, Christian, and Bernie [Ecclestone] might unite to buy the Alpine team. What would you make of coming up against a team potentially owned by Flavio, Christian, and Bernie? One of them a very old adversary and presumably it would be logistically quite difficult for you to live in all of their heads rent free?

TW: That would be an exciting story, I guess, and would create lots of buzz around Formula 1. I think we need that. Formula 1 has always been about the best racing, with exciting drivers and great personalities. And when you look back at the grand era of team owners and team principals – Frank Williams, Ron Dennis, Flavio, [Luca Di] Montezemolo, and a few others – maybe we need to work on that. And if there was such an exciting project, these three guys coming together – all of the mafia reunited  – that would give good content, I guess.

FB: The sharks. The shark mafia.

TW: Three sharks.

Q: (Dan Lloyd – Racecar Engineering) A question for James. How confident do you feel that Williams can recapture some of its early season form based on what the Belgium update has been telling you and the team's response to the cooling issues you had mid-season?

JV: I don't think we'll be back to where we were at the start of the season. Ferrari have developed at a really strong rate. Mercedes, you can see, developed at a strong rate. The midfield now is incredibly tight. Sauber – well done to them – and Aston as well. It's really tight in that range. Whereas, at the beginning of the season, there was a little bit of a gap that we managed to push ourselves into. I think that's unrealistic now. What is realistic is – Flavio described it well – two or three tenths separates fifteen cars near enough. It's making sure we're at the sharp end of that, which allows you to pick up points.

Q: (Jack Smith (Motorsport Monday / MotorsportWeek.com) A question for Toto. Helmut Marko was quoted recently as saying that Kimi has been placed under a bit too much pressure perhaps by making his F1 debut with Mercedes. What is your response to that? And also, will the choice of third driver/reserve driver to replace Valtteri be based on how well he can help Kimi, given how much Kimi has said that he's helped him?

TW: I think we have put Kimi under maximum pressure, to be honest. Looking at it now, I felt it was a great idea to have him in FP1 in Monza and present him there. That was maybe a mistake – not because he wasn't capable of driving the car, because if he would have finished that lap without crashing, it would have been sensational and it would have built the confidence. That's why. He's in a Mercedes, he's very visible, his results are very visible, his team-mate is great and is maximising the car. Therefore, he feels himself under the magnifying glass. The team – we just continue to believe in him. He needs time. We've embarked on this route, so you can say, “Was it right to put him under so much pressure by putting him in the team?” We've taken that trajectory; we've taken that route. We are fully on the mission, and single race weekends or a session like we had before is not going to change our opinion. Yeah, short term, we're going to say, “that's not good,” but Kimi is a long-term investment.

Q: Third driver?

TW: We haven't figured it out yet. It's super difficult to replace Valtteri. I mean, he ticks all the boxes.

Q: (Jon Noble – The Race) Flavio, you made a driver change earlier on in the season bringing Franco in. Are you now set until the end of the campaign with Franco? Is there a chance Mick could come back? And what was the thought process into 2026 for your second car?

FB: We make not so many changes. We changed, bringing in Franco Colapinto. And maybe Colapinto – the same problem as what Toto said – too much pressure to be in Formula 1. Last year, he had two or three races with James, where he did very well. But maybe to be in the team with a good driver like Pierre, and always in competition with the team-mate, maybe we put too much pressure on him. I think we need to consider that. Sometimes we believe… the driver is a human being and we need to understand what's going on in the heads of these kids. These are young kids  – 19, 20, 22, 23 years old – and I think it's out mistake to underestimate the human part of the driver. We're always looking at the timing. Maybe I missed something in the management of the driver, Colapinto. For the future, honestly, I don't know.

TW: You can see the younger drivers in smaller teams, they perform, because it's a totally different environment. The expectation is so low that you can only outperform. They are all high potentials for the future. But this is a big difference – being under the magnifying glass and the pressure that's been created, and the expectations that are being set. It's different.

Q: James, can we bring you in on this and the performances that Franco put in in the second half of last year?

JV: I think Toto and Flavio summed it up well. You have to remember – if something goes wrong with the Williams in a session, even though we're fifth in the championship, it's not really covered. But we have teams around us – Mercedes is one of those – where everything is in the limelight and the spotlight. So that's change number one: the pressure goes up immensely. When the pressure's not there, you're able to get a lot more out of the driver because they're not concerned about an immediate performance having an impact. Therefore, they can let go. A good example is Franco – the first time I put him in at Silverstone, he thought it was his only chance ever to get there. My message to him beforehand was, it's nothing to do with lap times. It's about you relaxing and enjoying the moment because this may never come back to you again. And he did a stellar performance. I don't think you can do that in Monza, in that circumstance, in a Williams. No chance you can do that. Second change is, again, what Flavio described – three tenths now separates the grid. So when you make a small mistake – and a small mistake is a tenth – you're last. That's a different world to where you were before, where frankly, you could be a tenth off your team-mate and no one would know about it. So I think you've got two changes that are making this more difficult now.

Q: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Toto, George spoke yesterday and he's still very relaxed about his future and getting the contract sorted. He said you guys were willing to work through the summer, but he said, “I'd rather just take that time off.” There's no rush, I assume. Where are you at with all of that? And do you just want to get everything right and dot the I's and cross the T's?

TW: Exactly like you say. George is a Mercedes driver since his junior years and Mercedes management. We clearly know what we expect from each other, what we want. It's a formality. But at the same time, it's important to discuss even the slightest details – how can we extract the most performance out of George? What is it we need to optimise on marketing days, for example? And it's not the amount of marketing days, but it's simply talking about a structure that helps him to perform at his best. These are the things. We haven't discussed them over the summer because we felt we needed to just get out of each other's face for a while, and we're going to pick these discussions up. We have already picked up the discussions.

Q: (Jon Noble – The Race) Toto, there are some comments you made recently that have carried a bit of traction. Are you saying next year's cars could top 400 kilometres per hour? Is that literally what your simulator's saying or was it more just a figure of speech – a nice round number?

TW: Sounds good, no? Everybody's talking those engines down, so I had to figure out – is there anything positive? And that is, if you were to deploy – obviously it sounds sarcastic – but if you were to deploy all the energy on a single straight, you could make those cars go 400 kilometres an hour. I don't know if somebody got afraid by it, but you could. But there wouldn't be much electric energy left for the few other corners on a circuit.

2025 Dutch GP FP2: Russell and Piastri have close call in the pit lane

Lance Stroll crashed in the opening stages of Free Practice 2 at Zandvoort.

Lance Stroll's Free Practice 2 at the Dutch Grand Prix came to an abrupt end with a heavy crash at Turn 3.

With rain on the horizon, drivers were keen to set their timed efforts early in the session and gather the maximum amount of data early on.

Running on medium tyres, Stroll – who'd gone an impressive P2 in Free Practice 1 – appeared to misjudge his braking point, locking his front-left tyre before understeering his Aston Martin into the barriers.

In 2023, Daniel Ricciardo crashed at the same corner and suffered an injury to his wrist, which forced him to sit out the five race weekends. However, Stroll reported that he was unharmed in the crash.

To watch Stroll's off, hit go on the video player above.

FP2 Highlights: 2025 Dutch Grand Prix

2025 Dutch GP FP2: Russell and Piastri have close call in the pit lane

Lando Norris topped the times in Free Practice 2 as the red flag was deployed twice at Zandvoort.

Lando Norris set the pace again in Free Practice 2 for the Dutch Grand Prix, with the session interrupted by two red flags.

The McLaren driver, who trails team mate Oscar Piastri by nine points in the Drivers' Championship, completed a clean sweep of fastest times on Friday while the session ended early for Lance Stroll and Alex Albon after crashes.

With conditions dry but the threat of rain looming, drivers immediately headed out on to the Zandvoort Circuit for crucial running, with Liam Lawson leading the train of cars out of the pit lane.

Fastest in FP1, Norris continued his impressive Friday running by initially moving to the top of the times on a 1m 12.615s with the medium tyre, before being usurped by Spaniards Carlos Sainz and Fernando Alonso as drops of rain began to fall.

On his next flying lap, Norris became the first driver to dip below the 1m 12s mark, posting a 1m 11.294s as Stroll slotted into second, his Aston Martin team mate Alonso complaining over the radio after being held up by Kimi Antonelli's Mercedes.

The Kick Saubers of Gabriel Bortoleto and Nico Hulkenberg moved into second and third respectively with the soft Pirelli tyre, with home hero Max Verstappen posting the fourth fastest time, less than three-tenths slower than Norris on the medium rubber.

Practice 2 results

FORMULA 1 HEINEKEN DUTCH GRAND PRIX 2025

Approaching the 10-minute mark, Haas' Oliver Bearman jumped to the top of the leaderboard with a 1m 11.113s just before a red flag was deployed after a heavy crash for Stroll at the banked Turn 3.

With the Canadian reporting he was okay over the radio and the wreckage of his Aston Martin recovered, proceedings resumed with 39 minutes of the one-hour session remaining as several drivers ventured out, including Isack Hadjar.

The Racing Bulls driver had not left the pit lane due to a technical issue prior to the red flag, but was forced to come to a stop on his out-lap, with his car quickly recovered under a Virtual Safety Car.

Hulkenberg moved to the top of the standings just past the halfway point on a 1m 11.080s with the help of soft tyres, as Lewis Hamilton suffered his second 360-degree spin of Friday on the exit of Turn 9, having set the fastest opening sector.

Lap times soon began to plummet as the sun broke through the clouds, Alonso posting a 1m 09.977s before Norris lowered the benchmark further to a 1m 09.890s, both drivers on a set of soft tyres.

A second red flag was soon called with 21 minutes remaining, Albon having gone off at Turn 1 and after damaging his front wing against the barrier, the Williams became beached in the gravel.

The session resumed with 16 minutes remaining and as the threat of rain had diminished, drivers focused on race simulations with the order remaining as before the stoppage.

It left Norris fastest, 0.087s clear of Alonso with Piastri third, the McLaren driver under investigation for a pit lane incident with George Russell as the pair made minor contact.

The Mercedes driver finished fourth from Verstappen, who was sixth-tenths away from Norris, as Hamilton, the second Red Bull of Yuki Tsunoda, Charles Leclerc (Ferrari), Franco Colapinto (Alpine) and Hulkenberg completed the top 10.

Bearman finished 11th ahead of Antonelli, the Mercedes driver making up for lost time after crashing early on in FP1.

Bortoleto led Lawson, Esteban Ocon (Haas) and Sainz (Williams), with Albon, Stroll, Pierre Gasly's Alpine and the time-less Hadjar completing the order.

Teams will have one more free practice session on Saturday ahead of the crucial Qualifying session for the Dutch Grand Prix.

2025 Dutch GP FP2: Russell and Piastri have close call in the pit lane

F1 TV expert James Hinchcliffe is this week's guest on the Beyond The Grid podcast.

Today he's on F1 TV, giving us expert racing insight. But, 10 years ago, James Hinchcliffe suffered a near-fatal accident during practice for the 2015 Indy 500, which left many people doubting that his racing career could continue.

A year later, he scored a sensational pole position at the very same racetrack.

Speaking to Beyond The Grid host Tom Clarkson, James talks through the freak injury he suffered and how he made such a miraculous recovery.

A six-time IndyCar race winner, he also explains what it takes to be quick on high-speed ovals, whether the likes of Max Verstappen would be competitive on them and whether Indy stars like new four-time champion Alex Palou could succeed in Formula 1.

Tom asks James why, despite being such a huge fan of F1 growing up, he didn't pursue a career in the pinnacle of motorsport, and whether he thinks the United States needs an American on the grid.

Now a regular pundit and commentator on F1 TV, James also shares his thoughts on the thrilling battle between McLaren team mates Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris to become World Champion in 2025.

2025 Dutch GP FP2: Russell and Piastri have close call in the pit lane

There were plenty of talking points ahead of the Dutch Grand Prix, with the F1 TV crew here to run through them all.

For veterans Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez, it was confirmed they will be returning to the grid in 2026 for the new Cadillac team, with the current roster of drivers giving their views on the signings.

Lando Norris trails McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri by nine points in the Drivers' Championship, with the Briton stating he had no regrets with the season so far.

George Russell admitted that no further negotiations with Mercedes about a new contract had been discussed during the summer break, but that his future would be confirmed ""when the time is right"".

Lewis Hamilton, meanwhile, admitted he wants to start enjoying racing again after a difficult spell with Ferrari so far.

FP2 Highlights: 2025 Dutch Grand Prix

2025 Dutch GP FP2: Russell and Piastri have close call in the pit lane

Fernando Alonso enjoyed a strong showing in Free Practice 2 for the Dutch Grand Prix. But did the Spaniard think he could really challenge the McLaren duo for pole at Zandvoort?

Fernando Alonso has claimed that it is not ""within our reach to fight with the McLarens"" for pole at the Dutch Grand Prix, despite finishing second fastest in Friday practice.

The Spaniard was just 0.087s behind pacesetter Lando Norris in Free Practice 2 at Zandvoort having also claimed the fourth fastest time in the day's earlier one-hour session.

The performance signifies the continued turnaround in form of Aston Martin, the team having qualified on the back row with both Alonso and Lance Stroll in Belgium before locking out the third row last time out in Hungary.

This latter performance led to the team's best result of the season, with Alonso and Stroll finishing fifth and seventh respectively.

""I do,"" said Alonso, when asked if he felt optimistic of another strong result this weekend in the Dutch Grand Prix. ""For sure a little bit more optimistic than some of the other Fridays we did.

""Hungary was strong for us, we go into the following race at Zandvoort and we're still showing some good pace in free practice. We know it's only free practice but it's good to see our times up there and let's see what we can do tomorrow.""

Despite the impressive Friday showing, Alonso was wary of suggestions he could challenge Norris and championship leader Oscar Piastri for pole, as the McLaren duo have generally dominated the season.

""No, not really,"" he said. ""I don't think it's within our reach to fight with the McLarens but maybe some of the top teams, Mercedes, Ferrari, Red Bull, they seem not too far away so we will try to be in that mix.""

Team mate Stroll had a mixed Friday at Zandvoort, registering the third quickest time in FP1 before suffering a heavy crash in FP2 at the banked Turn 3.

Although reporting he was okay over the radio, his AMR25 suffered substantial damage on the right side.

""Just a little lock-up and from there I was just a passenger. Just one of those things,"" said Stroll of the crash.

""For sure, we looked competitive throughout the day and again Fernando in FP2. I think we're in a good spot and see what we can do tomorrow.""

The Oscar winning actress stepped out at the Venice Film Festival to promote her new Luca Guadagnino film ‘After the Hunt' in a look by Versace with a handbag that honors Roberts' married name. 


							By 

	Chris Gardner



	Dario Vitale found the ultimate A-lister to help debut his first designs since taking over at Versace at a fitting location: Julia Roberts at the Venice Film Festival.


	The Oscar winning actress stepped out today on the Lido to promote her new Luca Guadagnino film After the Hunt wearing Vitale's first look ever since taking the reins as creative director from Donatella Versace, who departed in March.  




	Vitale offered up a daytime look that channels a ‘90s spirit courtesy of a tailored jacket in blue wool paired with a striped button-down and denim pans. Roberts accessorized the business casual look with a heritage gold buckle belt, woven leather Vienna 95 shoes and a top handle leather bag with a Medusa twist-lock. The handbag had a personal touch customized for Roberts with the initials JM, which is her married name — Julia Moder.

	Seeing that Roberts helped Vitale set the stage for what's to come with Versace under his guidance, it wouldn't be a total shock to see her also step out in Versace when she hits the iconic red carpet later this evening for the After the Hunt world premiere. Either way, it should be a stylish affair as Roberts will be posing alongside her costars Ayo Edebiri, Andrew Garfield, Chloë Sevigny and Michael Stuhlbarg. 


	Vitale officially joined Versace on April 11, after having most recently served as design director at Miu Miu, which is owned by the Prada Group. At the time, he thanked Donatella Versace for “her trust in me,” while the outgoing icon said “Versace is in my DNA and always in my heart” as she moved on to serve as a chief brand ambassador.

The singer created her own ‘Rocky Horror Picture Show' in the music video following the release of her new ‘Man's Best Friend' album. 


							By 

	Lexy Perez


Associate Editor


Sabrina Carpenter channeled the Rocky Horror Picture Show in her new music video. 


	The singer released her new album Man's Best Friend on Friday with a new music video accompanying her second single, “Tears.”




	In the theatrical video, Carpenter is shown lying in a field after a car crash, only to discover a house in the middle of nowhere. However, when she goes inside she is surrounded by a funhouse of characters and is revamped to match the eclectic and sexy styles.

Colman Domingo stars in the video in drag as he accompanies Carpenter as she enters new rooms and meets new characters. At one moment, the two share a dance break.

	At the end of the video, Carpenter's character is shown being thrown out of the house only to find the boyfriend she thought had died is alive after all. 


	“It's a thing. Someone has to die every video,” she tells him. “Sorry! We'll always remember you, though.” She then throws her heel at him to kill him.


	Carpenter's seventh album, Man's Best Friend, features 12 new songs including her first single “Manchild.” Prior to its release, the singer faced backlash for the album's suggestive cover art that featured Carpenter on her hands and knees with someone pulling a fistful of her blonde hair. 

	











	While appearing on CBS MORNINGS, Carpenter said of the reaction to the cover art, “Like, y'all need to get out more, I think. I was actually shocked, because I think between me and my friends and my family and the people that I always share my music and my art with first, it just wasn't even a conversation. It was just, like, it's perfect. For what, for the what the album is, it's perfect for, you know, kind of what it represents, and everything about it to me just felt like so opposite of, like, the world ending.” 


	When offering her interpretation of the visual, she explained, “My interpretation is being in on the control. Being in on your lack of control and when you want to be in control. Like, I think as a young woman, you're, you're just as aware of when you're in control as when you're not. And I think some of those are choices, and I think for me, this whole album was about the humanity of allowing yourself to make those mistakes, knowing when you're, you know, putting yourself in a situation that will probably end up poorly.” But it's gonna teach you something, so there was a lot of different meanings.” 


	She further explained there was “a lot of pointing fingers” despite no one having heard the project. “They don't know me. They don't know my intentions. They don't know the stories I'm telling. So, I do, I try to take it with a grain of salt and also know that my fans that know me and know the person behind the music will look at that photo and they know exactly what it is. And people that have no idea who I am absolutely look at that photo and go, like, ‘Where are her parents?' … My parents actually saw the photo and they loved it.” 

	











	Carpenter is also set to be featured on the title track of Taylor Swift's upcoming new album The Life of a Showgirl.

Ayo Edebiri, Andrew Garfield, Michael Stuhlbarg and Chloë Sevigny also star in this psychological thriller about a sexual assault accusation that tears through the Yale philosophy department.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	If the loudly insistent ticking clock in the opening minutes of After the Hunt gets on your nerves, then brace yourself, because you're about to get clobbered with two-and-a-quarter hours of it. Not just the intermittent clock, but the mind-numbing academia-speak, the hyper-articulate inter-generational savagery and the streams of circuitous talk about thorny ethics, sexual violations and contentious power dynamics. Director Luca Guadagnino and first-time screenwriter Nora Garrett seem convinced this is all very provocative, very now with its hard questions and subjective truths. But frankly it's very five years ago, which makes it more punishing.

	Given that Guadagnino's greatest strengths have always been as a humanist, a sensualist and a bold visual stylist, it's baffling what drew him to material so aridly intellectual, stark and emotionless despite trafficking heavily in trauma. It seems almost implausible that the gifted filmmaker who just gave us the sizzling buoyancy of Challengers and the heady intoxication of Queer could deliver something so dour and airless. The Woody Allen-type main title treatment makes you wonder if Guadagnino is doing his version of a 21st century Interiors, a Bergman homage I'd sooner watch again than this, for Maureen Stapleton alone.

The Bottom Line

	
	Too deliberately opaque to be stimulating.

									Rated R,
								2 hours 18 minutes			






	Maybe it was a desire to work with Julia Roberts, for whom this is an undeniably strong showcase, pouring herself into a character who's all sharp edges with scarcely a glimmer of warmth, an expert at hiding her feelings or anything even remotely personal. But as riveting as she is, Roberts ultimately is ill-served by a film so studiously cryptic that it ends up just frustrating. To be fair, there are several electric confrontations, distributed evenly enough to ensure that After the Hunt remains absorbing. But even so, this is a date movie to be used in relationship sabotage maneuvers.

	











	Yes, it's part of the point that every major character in this insular bubble of wealth, privilege, intellectual elitism and vigilant cultural sensitivity — I refuse to call it “wokeism” — is insufferable to some degree, even if they don't start out that way. That's all very well and it's not as if movies are required to fill a quota of sympathetic characters. But this bunch becomes steadily more distancing. Oh, except for Chloë Sevigny, dryly amusing in a frump wig as jaded feminist psychotherapist Kim, who only perks up when she hears Morrissey crooning “Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now.”


	Even the normally surefire element of a score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, with its blasts of dissonance pumping up the squirm factor, adds to the heavy-going effect of a movie that seems to go out of its way to be grating.


	Roberts plays Yale philosophy professor Alma Imhoff, who, along with her department colleague and closest friend Hank Gibson (Andrew Garfield), can almost taste the tenure she knows her work has earned. As the drinks flow during a gathering of faculty and PhD students at their deluxe digs, Alma's doting husband Frederick (Michael Stuhlbarg), another shrink, teasingly asks what happens if one of them gets tenure and the other doesn't. Would the friendship survive it?


	Hank is a self-satisfied peacock and chronic flirt. So much so that when someone later says, “Everybody loves Hank,” you might think, “Wait, are we talking about the same guy?” Much of his attention that evening is focused on Alma's star doctoral student Maggie (Ayo Edebiri), who responds to his playful taunting about why her generation is so guarded by pinpointing it to the moment his generation started making sweeping generalizations about them.

	











	When opinionated classmate Arthur (Will Price) gripes about how inclusivity has bumped men like him out of the competitive academic ranks, Maggie is quick to clap back. As a queer Black woman, she has no time for “white, male, straight, cis” people crying about victimhood after an eternity of automatic advantage. Alma concurs.


	But late the next day, when she finds Maggie on her doorstep soaked from the rain and weeping, Alma is more cautious about her solidarity. Clearly in distress, Maggie stammers out her account of what happened after the party, when Hank walked her home, asked to come up for a nightcap, started kissing her and refused to stop despite her repeatedly saying, “No.” She says he crossed a line, and when Alma asks how far over the line he went, Maggie bolts, muttering that it was a mistake to expect support.


	To the filmmakers' credit, this does not become another “he said/she said” dialectic descendent of David Mamet's Oleanna, even if Hank's blustery explosion of self-righteous anger seems to point that way. He claims he went to Maggie's apartment solely to challenge her privately about what he describes as flagrant plagiarism in one of her papers for him.


	There's also a tang of resentment in the fact that Hank grew up without money and has had to work hard to rise in his field, while he thinks Maggie is a mediocre student for whom doors have been opened by having billionaire parents among the top college donors. But even before his stunning eruption into vituperative rage in the hall outside Alma's classroom — played to the hilt by Garfield — it's clear that Hank is such a douche it stops mattering whether he's guilty or innocent.

	











	While he knows nothing of the alleged sexual violation, Frederick also has his doubts about Maggie, needling his wife for allowing her vanity to be stoked by a student who's possibly in love with her. “Is she brilliant, or does she just think you're brilliant?” Frederick asks Alma.


	Stuhlbarg, who should have gotten much more attention for his beautiful performance in Guadagnino's Call Me by Your Name, deserves better than Frederick. He projects serene emotional maturity and makes cassoulet like it's a sacred offering yet isn't averse to infantile tantrums of petulant jealousy. While he often unwinds after a day of seeing patients by blasting John Adams at maximum volume, a scene in which he does something similar while flouncing in and out of the kitchen where Alma and Maggie are trying to talk might make you want to kill people. He becomes like an unfunny New Yorker cartoon.


	Edebiri brings her customary emotional depth to Maggie, putting us in her corner when she presses charges and then gets uncomfortable with the attention the scandal generates around her at Yale. However, Garrett seems to want to have it both ways with the character (who's writing her dissertation on virtue ethics), giving her integrity but then undermining her with doubts and eyeroll-inducing Gen Z clichés. The suggestion that this rich kid might be partnered with a they/them-identifying trans law student and live in a shitty apartment for the optics seems a cheap shot.


	But the center of the drama is firmly occupied by Alma, who is so secretive she keeps quiet about an illness that causes her debilitating pain and nausea. (Even with sudden uncontrollable spasms, she manages not to get vomit on her chic white cropped pants and penny loafers.) Any loyalty she has to Maggie gets obliterated when the student reveals intimate knowledge of Alma's history that makes her think the professor might have suffered a similar experience.

	











	In Alma's view, Maggie crossed a different kind of line. Roberts brings a jolt of invigorating fury to one of the movie's strongest scenes, in which the mentor rips into her mentee in public on a campus square with a fully detailed character assassination. Hilariously, Alma shoves Maggie's partner Alex (Lío Mehiel) to the sidelines by sniping: “Don't you have some obscure fucking protest that you should go and be angry at?” Alma belittles every one of Maggie's life choices with a blistering scorn she later regrets. Or doesn't.


	To some extent, the script takes pains to keep Alma unreadable. (Though when she asks Frederick if he thinks she can be cold, I mumbled, “Oh, girl, are you kidding?”) When she rushes to speak with the Dean of Humanities (David Leiber) and request that she be kept out of the school's inquiry into the alleged abuse, is she protecting her career, staying neutral out of respect for her long friendship with Hank, or shrewdly planning for his elimination from the tenure race?


	These are all interesting questions, like many others raised in the script. But the movie makes a definite choice not to answer them, even in a big-twist epilogue five years later. That might have been an audacious move in a film less strident and more subtle. But the blanket refusal here to throw the audience a bone seems like self-conscious obfuscation. 


	Sure, it's exciting to watch Roberts sprout horns and turn spiky with defensiveness in another great scene when a student questions whether she “condones othering someone rather than advocating against it.” But we deserve more substantial compensation after spending more than two hours with these people.

Morgan Neville, who previously directed '20 Feet from Stardom' and last year's 'Piece by Piece,' chronicles McCartney's post-Beatles 1970s era.

Senior Film Writer


	Amazon MGM Studios has picked up Man on the Run, the feature documentary directed by Morgan Neville that explores Paul McCartney's creative rebirth after The Beatles' breakup.


	The move comes ahead of the movie's premiere this weekend at the Telluride Film Festival.




Man on the Run, which is produced by Neville's Tremolo banner, in association with MPL and Polygram Entertainment, will be released in select theaters and then hit Prime Video Feb. 25 in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide.

	The documentary is meant to be the centerpiece in a partnership between McCartney, Universal Music Group, and Amazon that will unfold over the next year. It includes the release of exclusive music and merchandise drops, and commentary from McCartney himself. And it will coincide with the release of his book, Wings: The Story of a Band on the Run, which will be available on Amazon and Audible Nov. 4, and McCartney's Got Back tour dates across North America this fall.

	











	Producers of the documentary include Neville, Chloe Simmons, and Meghan Walsh for Tremolo; Scott Rodger and Ben Chappell for MPL; and Michele Anthony and David Blackman for Polygram Entertainment. Executive producers include Caitrin Rogers and McCartney. 


Man on the Run is described as taking viewers on an intimate journey through McCartney's extraordinary life following the breakup of The Beatles and the formation of his follow-up band Wings with his wife Linda in 1971.  The band, with its tumultuous member changes, hit a high with the 1973 album Band on the Run, with the title track and the song “Jet” becoming massive hits.

	











	The film chronicles the arc of McCartney's solo career as he faces down a myriad of challenges while creating new music to define a new decade. 


	Neville had unprecedented access to previously unseen footage and rare archival materials to tell the story of McCartney's transformative post-Beatles era through a uniquely vulnerable lens. 


	The filmmaker, who made 2018's Won't You Be My Neighbor?, a documentary about Fred Rogers, has a long history of music-focused works. He tackled back-up singers with his 2013 film, 20 Feet from Stardom, which won the Academy Award for best documentary as well as a Grammy Award for best music film. Last year he showed off Piece by Piece, focusing on Pharrell Williams and told via Legos. Other subjects include Keith Richards, producers Rick Rubin and Mark Ronson, and Bono and the Edge.


	The deal was brokered by Liesl Copland of MATR Labs on behalf of the filmmakers.

The Kinéo Awards have previously honored Ennio Morricone, Milena Canonero, Susan Sarandon, Natalie Portman, Bernardo Bertolucci, Dante Ferretti, Sienna Miller, Mads Mikkelsen and more. 


							By 

	Chris Gardner



	Karla Sofía Gasón, the Oscar nominated star of Emilia Peréz whose campaign caught fire when incendiary tweets surfaced amid awards season, is set to touch down in Venice this weekend to pick up an award for best international actress.


	The honor, called a Kinéo Award, is presented by the Ministry of Cultural Heritage with the Kinéo Cultural Association. It launched in 2002 with a mission of promoting Italian cinema, and according to the official website, it's the “only award voted by a huge audience” in collaboration with the association of cinemas ANEC. Previous winners include Ennio Morricone, Milena Canonero, Susan Sarandon, Natalie Portman, Bernardo Bertolucci, Dante Ferretti, Alba Rohrwacher, Pier Francesco Favino, Giancarlo Giannini, Sienna Miller, Mads Mikkelsen and more.

	Gascón confirmed the news on Instagram last week, and organizers for the event announced that the actress will be present at a Saturday press conference at the Lido's Hotel Excelsior. Also confirmed to attend are fellow honorees Aras Aydin, Monica Guerritore, Massimiliano Gallo, Tatiana Luter and Cristiana Capotondi.

	It won't be Gascón's first comeback bid in the wake of her awards season scandal. The Hollywood Reporter recently debuted a first look at her newest movie, a 19th century-set Spanish western Trinidad, directed by Laura Alvea and José Ortuño. The English-language feature filmed in the Canary Islands but is set primarily in the United States. It stars Gabriela Andrada as Trinidad, a woman who flees persecution in Spain for the wild west. Along the way, she earns renowned for her skills with weapons, but also becomes a target of enemies, such as the widow Bronson (Gascón).

	











	She'll pick up the prize during what will be a busy weekend during the 82nd Venice Film Festival. It's unclear yet if Gascón will be walking the red carpet at any of the major movie premieres at Sala Grande.

The immersive experience — featuring flying monkeys, falling apples and one wild tornado — debuted in Las Vegas on Thursday. 


							By 

	Kirsten Chuba


Events Editor


	“This is the moment that we've been waiting for. We're finally off to see the Wizard,” James Dolan told the crowd at Las Vegas' Sphere on Thursday night as the venue debuted its immersive Wizard of Oz experience.


	Dolan, the executive chairman and CEO of Sphere Entertainment Co., welcomed guests to the world premiere while himself channeling that titular wizard, dressed in head-to-toe emerald — complete with a green top hat. His fellow execs followed suit, each dressed as one of the film's main characters, including  Sphere president and chief operating officer Jennifer Koester as Dorothy and producer Jane Rosenthal as Glinda the Good Witch.

	“What you're about to see tonight is our most powerful example yet of experiential storytelling in this new medium,” Dolan promised the crowd. “For the first time, you're going to feel like you're part of the story. You'll see the film at unparalleled scale and resolution; you'll hear Judy Garland's voice with breathtaking new clarity, and yes, you will experience what it feels like to be inside a tornado. I can tell you, anybody can blow wind in your face; not anybody can make you feel like you're in a tornado.”

	Rosenthal, who called working on the project the highlight of her career, invited guests to “close your eyes, tap your heels together three times and say it with me: There's no place like Sphere. There's no place like Sphere. There's no place like Sphere.” 

	











	What they've created at the venue is indeed a very unique experience. Upon arrival, attendees — many of whom donned looks straight out of the Emerald City for opening night — enter the Sphere's Atrium, with a hot air balloon and flying monkey hanging from the ceiling and a menacing Wizard of Oz head staring down from above. The room is drenched in sepia tones to really put one in the Kansas mindset (and later at exit turns technicolor to reflect Emerald City) but quickly upon entering the theater, it's clear we're not in Kansas anymore.


	Before the film begins, the 160,000 square foot LED screen is designed to look like Radio City — another Dolan property — with the curtain down and sound of an orchestra tuning up in the background. Then it's off to the races, as viewers are thrown into the world of Oz. The tornado that brings Dorothy to that magical land is likely the standout moment, as massive fans create a huge wind storm — complete with smoke and flying leaves — in the venue to coincide with the moment on screen. At the premiere, guests were shrieking and holding onto their seats like they were on a rollercoaster; popcorn and snacks that had been picked up in the lobby beforehand flew across the room. 


	But that's far from the only immersive element — the venue's chairs jolt and shake whenever the Wicked Witch makes an appearance, toy apples fall from the sky when Dorothy fights with a talking tree and bubbles float down when Glinda uses her powers to cause a snowstorm. Columns of fire shoot into the air with the arrival of the Wizard, and electronic flying monkeys soar around the dome in another scene. The Sphere also re-recorded the orchestral score and made new sound effects for the film, while preserving the original dialogue and vocals. 

	











	A.I. is used to fill out scenes to a 360-degree feel — in Dorothy's home, for example, there's now a roof overhead and walls to both sides; for outdoor scenes, there's a heavily detailed sky and trees surrounding the characters. At a walkthrough with media on Thursday morning, visual effects specialist Ben Grossmann told reporters that when it came to using A.I., “We had a choice. We could either hire modern artists to reanimate those performances by hand, which we felt would destroy the integrity of the original performance,” or embrace “a new technology that allows you to train on things that existed before it, so that it can reproduce those things accurately. And then we tested it for two years to make sure that if we used A.I., we would actually have more integrity to the original performances than if we didn't, because the only other alternatives were computer graphics that would be humans manipulating the performance.” Dolan added that he doesn't “really think that it's a fair criticism” over the use of A.I. and wants people to see the movie before they cast judgement.


	Dolan also revealed during that press conversation that the team “replaced the faces of two very short, two-second characters in the movie” with himself and Warner Bros. Discovery head David Zaslav, challenging audiences to find the moment. (Warner Bros. owns the rights to The Wizard of Oz film). And although Zaslav did not appear to be in attendance, opening night brought a starry guest list to Sin City that included Kris Jenner, Rosanna Arquette, Skylar Astin, Marissa Bode, Joseph “T'Bone” Burnett, Edie Falco, Joe Manganiello and Zahn McClarnon among the celeb attendees. 

	











The Wizard of Oz at Sphere is now open, currently scheduled to run through March 2026, with often multiple screenings a day.

The pop star's seventh LP follows one year after breakthrough project Short n' Sweet.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	Manchildren and pearl-clutchers, beware — Sabrina Carpenter‘s new album Man's Best Friend is here.


	On Friday (Aug. 29), the pop star dropped her highly anticipated seventh studio LP, complete with 12 tracks. That includes lead single “Manchild,” which earned Carpenter her second-ever No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in June, and “Tears,” a music video for which dropped at the same time as the album. 


	Produced by Jack Antonoff and released via Island Records, Man's Best Friend arrives just over a year after the Grammy winner's breakout album, Short n' Sweet. Featuring hits “Espresso” and “Please Please Please,” the 2024 project spent four weeks atop the Billboard 200, marking Carpenter's first No. 1 album on the chart.

	











	With Short n' Sweet and now Man's Best Friend, the singer has established herself as a lyrical master of double entendre, oftentimes charging her lyrics with brazenly sexual themes. Though she's received some criticism for that — as well as the racy Man's Best Friend album cover, which features her on all fours as a man grips her hair — Carpenter has stayed true to who she is.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“The album is not for any pearl clutchers,” Carpenter told Gayle King on CBS Mornings in a clip posted Thursday (Aug. 28). “But I also think that even pearl clutchers can listen to an album like that in their own solitude and find something that makes them smirk and chuckle to themselves.”


	“But I think about being at a concert with, you know, however many young women I see in the front row that are screaming at the top of their lungs with their best friends,” she added at the time. “You can go like, ‘Oh, we can all sigh [in] relief like, ‘This is just fun.' And that's all it has to be.”

The Gallaghers were in top shape during Thursday night's (Aug. 28) two-hour hit parade in the first of five American shows.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	It's been said countless times since Liam and Noel Gallagher buried the hatchet last year to launch their rapturously received Oasis Live '25 reunion run, but the formerly quarrelsome siblings who used to make Cain and Abel look like the Kelce brothers have found that special magic again. And then some.

	











	When the tour finally hit U.S. shores on Thursday night (Aug. 28) at a sold-out Soldier Field in Chicago for one of only five American dates, there was an unmistakable, heart-warming majesty to the display of true brotherhood between the Gallaghers. From their now signature hand-in-hand walk out to subtle nods and hip-check nudges between them, the years of estrangement seemed like an ancient memory, leaving in their place a dedication to playing their most beloved songs as loudly, brashly and tightly as ever.


	Despite the unwavering setlist and even somewhat similar between-song banter, the first Oasis show on U.S. soil in nearly 17 years made it feel like no time at all had gone by the second the band's signature party-starting  go song — the beat-attack, mostly instrumental “F—kin' in the Bushes” —  blared from speakers to a jubilant mob geeked for the return of the Britpop kings.




			Trending on Billboard		







	One thing that hasn't changed is singer Liam Gallagher's punkish swagger, as evidenced by the shades that never left his face for the duration of the two-hour, 23-song gig and his playful shout-out to the “drug takers” and “glue sniffers” before “Bring It On Down.” Whereas in years past the band's formerly volatile vocalist might have tossed the occasional tambourine or maraca in frustration — he's now banned from letting any instruments fly for safety reasons, if you can believe it —  the closest he got to maligning one of his instruments in Chicago were the few times he playfully clamped his tambo between his teeth during instrumental passages.

	











	The professionalism extended to the sharp, all-black ensembles worn by the entire band, which gave off an us-against-the-world gang vibe as tight as the song's arrangements. When Liam leaned into the microphone to howl the chorus of “Morning Glory” as the 52,000-plus crowd expertly backed him with an elongated “wellll,” it was clear American fans have studied the tapes from the group's U.K. and Irish gigs last month and came prepared to do their part.


	And boy did they. From the unending sea of Adidas stripes on track suits, football jerseys and sneakers, to what must have been a Midwest record for the most bucket hats in a single place at once, the crowd came to sing along and hoover up as much merch as possible. And off course they did the turn-around and jump-up-and-down Poznan dance during “Cigarettes & Alcohol,” making the ground shake like a Britpop earthquake. “Everybody said Americans wouldn't do that f–kin' s–t” Liam playfully poked. “Of course they will,” he said afterwards.


	In the bad old days, Liam would sometimes wander off stage, or sulk on the drum riser during his vocal breaks over some perceived slight or agitation. But what a difference time has made, as 2025 Liam now blows kisses before “Some Might Say” before making the sign of a cross after dipping his fingers in his water bottle to get some holy mojo rolling. 


	He joked about how the band and their diehard fans “invented all this madness” before brother Noel unleashed the primal roar of “Supersonic,” peeling off the gigantic, clear-as-a-bell riffs that had Liam swaggering over after “Roll With It” to give his older brother a friendly hand slap. The band's songwriter and occasional singer returned the favor by giving Liam a break during a mid-set ballad showcase featuring the Noel-led “Talk Tonight,” “Half the World Away” and clear crowd favorite “Little by Little.”

	











	The Stones-y opening set from Bowling Green, Ky. brother band Cage the Elephant set the stage with a tight, kinetic performance that had singer Matt Shultz leaping into the air and bounding from one end of the stage to the other like a Bluegrass State Jagger, with no signs of the 2024 foot injury that had him scooting around stage in a medical boot for a while. In keeping with the sibling revelry on display all night, at one point Shultz sauntered over to older brother guitarist Brad Shultz and gave him a sweet brotherly shove after a bit of teasing.


	Liam didn't say much to the crowd, but when he did speak it was to spread the love, telling his Chicago fans that it was “f–kin' mega to be back in America,” noting that “we always loved ya” as the band dove into 1997's Be Here Now classic “Stand by Me.” There were other playful gestures, such as the “c'mon now” flick of the ears urging the audience to sing along to that song — “Fookin' mega to be back in America” he said “we've always loved ya” — or his cheeky search for “any lovers in the house” before the 1994 Definitely Maybe track “Slide Away.”


	For a band that used to be dogged by obvious Beatles comparisons, Thursday's show felt less wedded to Fab formula and more focused on delivering waves of sonic overload and straight-up melodic stadium rock, as when “Live Forever” roped tens of thousands into reaching onto their tiptoes to get high enough for the falsetto “You and I we're gonna live forever” bit. 


	“Rock ‘N Roll Star” needed no such encouragement, with the audience doing the heavy vocal lifting on the track that ends in a swirl of psychedelic eddies. There were still the low-key, subtle nods to the Beatles, though, as in the familiar inclusion  of a bit of Ringo Starr's “Octopus's Garden” at the end of “Whatever.”

	











	But truth be told, this set was mostly focused on giving the people what they came for, packed in one of the most epic show closers in rock. Noel took lead vocals on 1998's “The Masterplan,” a lesser-known track that got No. 1 hit treatment from the passionate audience, who jumped up and down and pumped their fists with a kind of polite mayhem that never tipped over into loutish behavior.


	On a perfect 65-degree night, Oasis landed the plane with the undisputed murderer's row trifecta of encores, beginning with the unmistakable rolling piano and drum roll intro to “Don't Look Back in Anger,” a song so titanic that Noel didn't even have to sing lead on the chorus. That kind of artistic abdication can sometimes come off as lazy, but in this case there was something heartwarming about letting the enthusiastic crowd carry that weight with joy and high fives all around.


	His hoodie now up over his head so his face was nearly obscured, Liam returned for a pair of songs that are basically eternal Great Britpop Songbook classics at this point beginning with a majestic “Wonderwall” and ending with an absolutely levitating “Champagne Supernova.”


	Oasis have nothing left to prove. Their songs have, and do, stand the test of time. They will live forever. Their rancorous days seemingly are behind them, they have mastered the art of turning a football stadium into a pub sing-along with 60,000+ of their closest fans. But perhaps most impressive of all, they returned from a potentially career-killing hiatus just as strong, if not stronger than they were, minus the baggage and plus the hard-earned wisdom to trust that the songs are more than enough.

The pop star has quickly returned with a stronger sense of self and some of the best songs of her career.

	Nobody expected Sabrina Carpenter to return this quickly. One year and six days after releasing Short n' Sweet — her commercial breakthrough that elevated her to arena headliner, the album that spawned her first No. 1 single and Grammy award, the project that contained four radio smashes, the moment that a longtime entertainer became a household name — she's already back with its follow-up, Man's Best Friend. 


	Instead of basking in the glow of a pivotal moment, Carpenter has moved on to a new era — yet anyone paying attention to her greater trajectory understands that this new album is not a cash grab, or victory lap. After spending years as a Disney Channel star and even more as a prolific pop ingenue searching for a wider audience, Carpenter has discovered her true potential, and grabbed hold of her aesthetic. She's not letting go anytime soon.


	As such, Man's Best Friend finds Carpenter fully locked in to her current groove — writing the songs she wants to write (funny, sneakily heartfelt reflections on love and lust), operating within her preferred sound (huge, mainstream-focused pop flecked with rhythmic curiosities), working with the people who know how to unlock her creativity (Jack Antonoff, Amy Allen and John Ryan). If the general outline of Man's Best Friend marks a continuation of the winning playbook of Short n' Sweet, the deepening of Carpenter's artistic persona is what separates, and elevates, her latest project from its predecessor. 


	Carpenter was always the type of knowingly quirky pop star that was able to effortlessly use a word like “agoraphobia” in a chorus, but Man's Best Friend is by far her most idiosyncratic album yet, full of self-possessed and unabashedly sexual lyricism, genre explorations via nifty instrumental hooks, and vocal takes ranging from sarcastic whispers to large-hearted cries. As much as she's dominated the mainstream over the past 18 months, Carpenter is still abiding by her weirdo-pop impulses, being driven to make music that only she can make — and the results are often spectacular. Let's hope she doesn't stop anytime soon.


	While all of Man's Best Friend is worth absorbing, here is a preliminary ranking of every song on Sabrina Carpenter's latest album.


Reading the lyrics to “Don't Worry I'll Make You Worry” suggests a sprightly kiss-off, with Carpenter dancing circles around a guy who can't keep up with her — but instead of packaging the song as an uptempo pop track, Carpenter opts for a soulful, slightly sorrowful tone, as if she's sadly aware of the relationship's power dynamic. As such, “Don't Worry I'll Make You Worry” is a late-album curveball, highlighted by the bundle of yearning vocal harmonies that comprise the bridge.


“We Almost Broke Up Again Last Night” is a masterful synthesis of influences: after opening with acoustic guitar strums and murmured vocals, the song blooms into a bubblegum sing-along with spiraling-higher vocals, as Sabrina impressively splits the difference between Lana and Britney. Carpenter's own superpowers as a singer and songwriter most clearly shine through on the bridge, which distills the point of the song in four whiz-bang lines: “You say we're drifting apart / I said, ‘Yeah, I f–king know' / Big deal, we've been before / And we'll be here tomorrow.”


Carpenter has been wronged on “Goodbye,” and her feelings have turned acidic toward the ex who's still trying to act like a pal: “Can't call it love, then call it quits / Can't shoot me down, then shoot the s–t,” she spits. Instead of hiding her pain, however, Carpenter lifts it up to the sun with a rollicking big band arrangement, full of bubbling horns and supportive harmonies — turning “Goodbye” into an open-armed spite-fest as a means of catharsis, and a fitting conclusion to Man's Best Friend.


The title suggests that Carpenter is about to mourn her lack of sex life post-breakup, but on “Never Getting Laid,” she flips that expectation on its head and openly wishes for her ex to embrace celibacy. Over a dreamy lounge-music arrangement, Carpenter maintains her cool until she reaches moments in which she anger and confusion spill over, her voice rising up sharply to betray her hurt; instead of abruptly concluding the song, she drops a coda at the three-minute mark, turning the climactic line “And abstinence is just a state of mind” into a future live-show highlight.


Sabrina is bewildered: the guy who was obsessed with her is now obsessed with self-discovery, and none of her calls for attention are working (“My slutty pajamas not tempting him in the least,” she laments). “My Man on Willpower” features one of Carpenter's most nuanced vocal takes on the album: she, Antonoff and Ryan concoct another country-leaning clap-along, and Carpenter balances crooning and punchlines with aplomb, never tipping the song too much towards comedy to betray the genuine emotion at its core.


“A girl who knows her liquor is a girl who's been dumped,” Carpenter concludes on “Go Go Juice” — a proverb of sorts, which encapsulates the spirit of a song about drinking beyond the point of numbing heartache, to where you're drunk-dialing every bad decision in your contact list. The chipper energy of “Go Go Juice” belongs to Carpenter, although the extended instrumental breakdown, which swerves from fiddle blasts to drinks-up gang vocals, sounds indebted to the stage energy of Bleachers, co-producer Jack Antonoff's own band.


A spiritual sequel to “Good Graces” from Short n' Sweet, “When Did You Get Hot?” approaches the good fortune of a glow-up with sumptuous R&B: cushy percussion and “uh-huh, uh-HUH” backing vocals soundtrack the tale of an ugly kid-turned-sexy man whom Carpenter now hopes to play naked Twister with back at his place. Not only does Carpenter sell the one-liners and inject personality the corners of the track, but she wisely places “When Did You Get Hot?” after “Nobody's Son” and “Never Getting Laid” on the Man's Best Friend track list, ending a run of post-breakup songs with newfound hope.


Of course Carpenter would pair one of the most effervescent arrangements on Man's Best Friend with the album's most sorrowful account of romantic hopelessness — an extension of her pop subversiveness designed to keep the listener dancing and crying simultaneously. “Nobody's Son” juxtaposes images of crying in bed, dashed expectations and bitterness toward a partner's mother (“Could you raise him to love me, maybe?) with plush synths, echoing kick drum and debonair strings, as if the gorgeous instrumentation is adding insult to injury.


The lead single and opening track to Man's Best Friend has grown in stature a few months after its release — after dozens of listens, the whirring complexities of “Manchild” have revealed themselves, from the way the beat is deployed in the pre-chorus to the power of the group vocals in the second half of the bridge. “Manchild” may have streaked to No. 1 upon its release as Carpenter's latest undeniable pop anthem, but those details have helped the song remain a steady hit in the months following its splashy debut, and open Man's Best Friend on a high note.


There's a moment on “Sugar Talking” in which Carpenter cuts through all pretense — “Save your money / “and stop making me cry-y-y-y!,” she sings, the sway of the production dropping out and her voice multiplying on the second half of the line. A slick, wounded groove anchored by pensive guitar, “Sugar Talking” is a plea for fewer apology gifts and texts, more face-to-face interaction; the song grounds Man's Best Friend, as the fourth song on the album following a trio of fizzier pop tracks and a more grown-up riff on Carpenter's romantic tribulations. It's also destined to be a killer karaoke song, FYI.


By the time Carpenter sings “I promise none of this is a metaphor” on “House Tour,” she's already broken her promise: a fast-moving synth-pop track rife with winks and innuendos, the song is both a thrilling gag and expertly crafted ‘80s workout. As the production leans in to the retro cheese, Carpenter moves briskly across hooks and one-liners, landing jokes about waxed floors and backdoors without detracting from the song's pop shimmer. No other pop star could have constructed “House Tour” quite like Carpenter, and it sounds like a future fan favorite.


Fellas, here's how the low the bar has become for us: “Remembering how to use your phone gets me oh so, oh so, hot!” Carpenter declares, while also counting doing the dishes, assembling IKEA furniture and having a little respect for her feelings as the ultimate aphrodisiacs. “Tears,” which will serve as the album's second single, operates on two levels, like the best of Carpenter's pop gems: the dizzying disco production and breathy ad-libs combine for another no-brainer smash, but parsing the lyrics for Carpenter's sardonic take on modern chivalry makes the experience all the more satisfying. In a world desperately need of more hilarious jams, Carpenter has delivered.

The Beatles, the act you've known for all these years, is still the world's biggest band — and projects like this fall's 'Anthology' reissue maintain that momentum.


													By
												

	Robert Levine



The Beatles set the standard for rock bands until their 1970 breakup — then just kept on doing so. In the '70s and '80s, they put out two of the first marquee greatest hits collections (the “red” and “blue” albums in 1973, which were iconic enough to be reissued in 2023), and their 1987 CD release campaign qualified as an event. Back then, though, they were just starting their afterlife — a productive posthumous career that will continue this fall with a 30th anniversary reissue of the Anthology project, including an extended documentary (available on Disney+ starting Nov. 26), an expanded rarities set (Nov. 21) and an updated edition of the book (Oct. 14). 


	Even 55 years after their breakup, the Beatles remain big business. Since the company now known as Luminate began tracking sales in 1991, they have sold 74.1 million albums in the U.S., more than any other act. (That includes physical and downloaded albums, the latter of which weren't even available legally until 2010, but not streams.) Their 1 collection was the biggest album of the first decade of the 21st century. Since 2020, they have scored 11.9 million equivalent album units in the U.S., according to Luminate, much less than Taylor Swift (64.6 million), but more than Fleetwood Mac (9.7 million), Metallica (8.6 million) or Queen (7.9 million). 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Like so much of the Beatles' career, Anthology and 1 seem unremarkable only because they've been so widely imitated. At this point, what big act hasn't released a career-spanning documentary or a single-disc collection aimed at casual fans (a big deal back when big-box retailers sold CDs)? Sure, but Anthology came out before DVDs mattered, back when rarities collections were still rare. And while the Beatles didn't invent the number-ones idea, their success with it was followed by similar-concept collections from Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson and others.


	Recent Beatles documentary projects loom as big as the band: Peter Jackson's documentary Get Back ran for eight hours, divided into three episodes on Disney+, and Anthology ran for more than 10, over eight parts. The new ninth part shows the Beatles working on the Anthology project in 1994 and 1995, which brings the project full circle. (Will a future 2050 version show Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr approving this 2025 cut?) There's something superfan-ish about all of this — the Beatlemaniacs may have been the original fan army — but the audience for it includes much of a generation, as well as plenty of people, like myself, who were born after the band broke up. When it comes to the Beatles, and probably only the Beatles, a superfan just means most people who care about pop music. 


	I would love to write a column about what other acts can learn from the Beatles about curating their legacies, but it's not so simple — they're the Beatles and no one else is. Some lessons apply universally: Curate well, choose top-tier partners and exercise light but consistent control. Every Beatles project that involves recorded music, from the Cirque du Soleil show “Love” to The Beatles: Rock Band, has a high level of quality. (Those that only use the band's songs are more uneven: Across the Universe and Yesterday were interesting but not all that compelling.) It's remarkable. 


	These projects don't feel micromanaged, though. In Peter Jackson, the Beatles found a filmmaker who was talented enough to bring his own perspective to their story, and they relaxed enough to let him. These days, it's hard to imagine anyone that famous letting his guard down quite so much. In the footage Jackson assembled, the Beatles are the biggest band in the world, but they work and joke and sometimes argue like they're not paying much attention to the camera. The finished movie doesn't seem fussed over, and the history comes across as curated with a light touch. Most newer pop stars can't seem to do that, which is why so many music documentaries end up looking like television commercials. 


	How many acts could even use that advice, though? Making a great show or movie means having timeless music, a compelling story and enough charisma for an eight-hour documentary. (I can think of only one other artist who has all three, Bob Dylan, which may be why he's been the subject of a few great documentaries.) The music is obvious. The Beatles also have a story that fans want to see retold, not despite its familiarity but because of it. They have four distinct personalities, a songwriting partnership that turned into a rivalry, a fast evolution through different styles and a breakup that fans still argue about. (Queen and Led Zeppelin, much as I love them, don't have much chemistry offstage.) As famous as the Beatles are, the story still rewards different perspectives.  


	They're also just plain fun to watch, with an easy camaraderie forged in Hamburg dive bars and honed during Beatlemania. That's what makes A Hard Day's Night so watchable, even though the Beatles essentially just play the Beatles. Many bands, even ones that shine onstage, just aren't that much fun to look at in the studio. For the Beatles, recording was a creative process that's visible from the outside — the internal becomes external because they play, talk out what they're doing, and play again. For most solo artists, that process is internal — there's not much to look at. These days, it hardly ever even takes place in a studio.  


	There's no suspense about how Anthology will do — the four-volume set, available as eight CDs and 12 LPs, will probably be the biggest catalog release of the fall. (The fourth volume is new, made up of unreleased takes of songs, as well as some that appeared on box sets over the past decade.) Since their 1995 release, the three volumes have scored more than 7 million album equivalent units in the U.S., according to Luminate. This time around, many of those sales will be on vinyl or as box sets, for premium prices. The long and winding road goes on forever.

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


	The ongoing She Said, He Said of Blake Lively‘s sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit against It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni today had a sideshow of She Said, She's Lying with Megyn Kelly declaring that she successfully fought off being “targeted” with a subpoena from the Another Simple Favor actress.


	“Yes, she actually tried to get the confidential and proprietary materials my team and I used for any and all stories about her, because Blake Lively was unable to fathom that yours truly had developed a genuine revulsion toward her on my own,” Kelly revealed today.


	However, with what certainly seems like some very distinct blonde hair splitting, Lively's side insists Kelly doth protest too much. “At no point in this litigation has Ms. Lively served a subpoena on Megyn Kelly,” a spokesperson for the Gossip Girl alum told Deadline today. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The apparently straightforward reply (we'll get to that) comes after Kelly let loose on “nitwit” Lively for over 14 minutes this morning on her popular Sirius XM podcast.


	Punctuated by calling Lively “a sad, pathetic, untalented, narcissistic bully,” Kelly's monologue included tips on how freedom of the press works, and laughing off accusations that her critical take on Lively is because she's on the payroll for Baldoni. Lambasting Lively for going after the likes of Perez Hilton (who actually had a good day in court today) and other things, in one of the more understated moments, Kelly called “Queen Blake” simply a “terrible person” – – as you can see in the full segment here:


	Preemptively referring to the client-attorney elephant on the podcast, Kelly also spoke today of her lucrative (a $25 million or so contract payout from NBC in 2019) professional relationship with attorney Bryan Freedman. She stated that despite what Blake Lively's side may have assumed, the media savvy Freedman, a frequent guest on Kelly's show and now Justin Baldoni's lead lawyer, is not “controlling our coverage.”

	











	“This is yet another entitled, nasty, elitist, Hollywood snob who thinks she's untouchable to the point where not, not unlike Meghan and Harry, who have made a career themselves out of suing members of the press who write disparaging things about them, she believes that anyone who does not worship her must be on the payroll of her enemies,” Kelly later extrapolated with a swipe or two at Ryan Reynolds also — as you can see here: 


	While one-time attorney Kelly sought to eviscerate Lively and spent quite a bit of time rehashing the case, the actress' people did the branding equivalent of a shrug. They affirmed this is just how the process works — a.k.a.: Lively has a right to pursue her case as it heads to trial in federal court in New York on March 9, 2026


	“Ms. Lively is continuing to pursue discovery in order to prove her case that Justin Baldoni, Jed Wallace, Melissa Nathan and the Wayfarer Parties' retaliated against her for speaking up against the harassment she and others experienced on set, as alleged in her complaint,” Lively's team added of Kelly's claims with a name check of the Jane the Virgin vet, once self-described “human crisis” navigator Wallace that Lively says was instrumental in the online smearing of her last year, seasoned Crisis PR captain Nathan and Baldoni's exec crew. “Seeking evidence through discovery is a normal part of the litigation process and is in addition to overwhelming amount of evidence already compiled in the form of Melissa Nathan's own text messages, the recently exposed Katie Case email describing Jed Wallace's services, as well as the invoices showing he was paid for those services, and Baldoni's own requests on what he wants his team to do.”


	Now, here's where it all gets a little bit less binary, and where both Kelly and Lively have the truth on their sides.


	From what I hear, Lively's team truly did not subpoena Kelly and The Megyn Kelly Show directly.


	Yet, back in June, they did subpoena Red Seat Ventures, which has provided sales support, production, distribution, and marketing branding and sales services for content creators like Kelly and fellow ex-Foxer Tucker Carlson. Turning into a quagmire, and with other Baldoni-leaning content creators and influencers publicly pushing back against their own subpoenas, that legal fishing expedition of sorts was cut short not long after by Lively's Manatt, Phelps & Phillips and Willkie Farr & Gallagher lawyers.


	In one of those circle of life and media moves, Kelly's former employers at Fox Corp purchased RSV in February.


	Having said that, Lively, who had been at the receiving end of the former Fox News host's shiv to the ribs podcast more than a few times since first filing her claims against Wayfarer Studios co-founder Baldoni with the California Civil Rights department last December, has been scoring up some big legal wins of late.


	In June, Baldoni's $400 million countersuit was tossed out. Earlier this month, Judge Lewis Liman agreed with Lively's lawyers to shut down attempts by Baldoni's lawyer to make parts of her July deposition public. Now, Lively's side are once again seeking sanctions against Freedman for “publicly slandering” their client. This comes as Baldoni, his billionaire Wayfarer backer Steve Sarowitz and others are suing insurance companies to pay what must by now be sprawling legal fees, as other insurance companies sue the IEWU filmmakers over what their policies do and do not cover.

	











	Neither reps for Kelly nor Freedman himself responded to Deadline's request for comment on today's drama. If they do, this post will be updated.

Megyn needs to leave Blake alone. These attacks are so unnecessary. Blake is the victim in this lawsuit!

So, Blake didn't have the nerve to Subpoena Megyn directly. She had to do her usual end run to further her fishing expedition. Got it.

Haha Megyn Kelly is such a loser. Rich, yes. But money can't buy you happiness, and she's obviously miserable.

And she cannot be objective!

International Reporter


Luca Guadagnino has fast become a legend of the Lido thanks to his prolific output, and he's back at Venice this evening with After The Hunt. 


	The film follows a college professor (Julia Roberts) who finds herself at a personal and professional crossroads when a star pupil (Ayo Edebiri) levels an accusation against one of her colleagues (Andrew Garfield), and a dark secret from her own past threatens to come to light. Guadagnino regular Michael Stuhlbarg and Chloë Sevigny also star along with Lío Mehiel, Thaddea Graham, Will Price, Christine Dye, and Burgess Byrd.

Roberts, Edebiri, and Garfield were all present at this morning's press conference in Venice alongside Guadagnino. The press conference was robust, with several questions about the film's politics and philosophy. There was a particular emphasis on the film's engagement with feminism. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Discussing his intentions, Guadagnino said defiantly, “The idea of the movie is that we are looking at people in their truths. Everyone has their own truths. It's not that one truth is more important than another.” 


	Guadagnino added: “And from the perspective of filmmakers and artists, how do we see the clash of truth, and what is the boundary of these truths together? It's not about making a manifesto to revive old-fashioned values.”


	Roberts was later asked whether she was worried about any controversies the film may conjure up in the wider cultural conversation. She pushed back on the idea. 

	











	“It's such a story to me,” Roberts said. “I remember the first time I saw a film called Tender Mercies. And I just thought there was something magical about the idea that a camera just landed in a place and happened to document what was going on.” 


	Roberts added: “And that's how I feel about this movie. We're not making statements. We are portraying these people in this moment in time, and the camera has fallen from the sky in this particular moment and captures all this.” 


	Elsewhere, Guadagnino was asked about the film's opening credits, which are said to be inspired by the classic font used in the credits of many films directed by Woody Allen. With a smile, Guadagnino joked, “the crass answer would be why not,” when asked why he borrowed from Allen. He then continued to elaborate. 


	“When I started thinking about this movie with my collaborators, we couldn't stop thinking of Crimes and Misdemeanors or Another Woman, or even Hannah and Her Sisters. And there was an infrastructure to the story that felt very linked to the great oeuvre of Woody Allen between 1985 and 1991,” Guadagnino said. 


	“And I've played with that a few times before. I've used that kind of graphic and font a couple of times. It also felt like an interesting nod to thinking of an artist who has been facing some sort of problems with his being. And what is our responsibility in looking at the work of an artist that we love like him? And by the way, that font is a classic.” 


	The After the Hunt screenplay is by Nora Garrett. Producers are Guadagnino, Brian Grazer, Jeb Brody, and Allan Mandelbaum. The DoP was legendary filmmaker Malik Hassan Sayeed.  The movie follows in the wake of ever-busy Italian director Guardagnino's sports romance Challengers, starring Zendaya, Josh O'Connor and Mike Faist, and Queer, starring Daniel Craig.


	After Venice, After the Hunt will open the New York Film Festival. Amazon MGM Studios and Imagine Entertainment's will release the film limited on October 10 before a nationwide release on October 17.


	Venice runs until Sept 6.

Associate Editor, TV


SPOILER ALERT: The following reveals major spoilers from tonight's episode of Dexter: Resurrection titled “Touched By An Ángel.” 


	When you're a fan of a show centering on a serial killer, the odds are pretty high that many of your favorites will inevitably die. 


That reality was even harsher for viewers of the Showtime hit series Dexter, which did not even shy away from slaying its main character, Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), in Dexter: New Blood. I know he survives and comes back in Dexter: Resurrection; however, the point is that the powers that be were willing to kill him off.

	All of that to say, tonight's episode of Resurrection will break your heart. There are not many original cast members left to speak of, and now they are down by one more. But at least we do know that not everyone stays dead, in a sense. Dexter's father, Harry Morgan (James Remar), has been dead for most of the series, but has appeared either in a flashback or as part of his son's conscience. Remar is currently a series regular on Dexter: Resurrection.




			Watch on Deadline		







The show's series premiere featured three deceased individuals who were offed in the original series, including Arthur Mitchell (John Lithgow), also known as The Trinity Killer, who also appeared in Dexter: New Blood; Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits); and James Doakes (Erik King).


	Before going further, let's just put it out there that Angel Batista received his wings tonight, after he was murdered by Leon Prater (Peter Dinklage). It will undoubtedly come as no surprise to most anyone with the way his story was set up in New Blood and how it continued in Resurrection. 


	Our proper post-mortem with Zayas can be found below.


	At the start of this new series, Batista is convinced his old friend is the real Bay Harbor Butcher, and not Doakes, who was framed for the murderous spree. He reconnects with his old buddies Joey Quinn (Desmond Harrington) and Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee) in episode 3, “Backseat Driver,” where he tells them he is retiring to do something he has long wanted to do. 

	











	Thus, marked the beginning of Batista's official plan to clear Doakes' name and to see justice served, which means putting Dexter Morgan behind bars. When Dexter and Batista reconnect, the vibe is off, and the latter isn't shy to ask the questions he's been dying to ask the former. Batista was also pretty fearless in his pursuit; he reconnected with Harrison Morgan (Jack Alcott), whom he hadn't seen since he was very young, to ask some interesting questions about his dad.


	He also played it fast and loose with the truth in his attempt to rope in two detectives, Claudette Wallace (Kadia Saraf) and her partner, Melvin Oliva (Dominic Fumusa). However, they eventually figure out his scheme. He worked tirelessly, breaking many rules, to unmask Dexter, and nothing was going to stop him.


	In the end, Batista visits Prater in an attempt to save his life, knowing he's been meeting with Dexter. What Ángel doesn't realize is that the billionaire loves Dexter even more now that he knows he is the Bay Harbor Butcher. Batista ends up strapped up to a gurney-looking table in a makeshift kill room where Prater is hoping to witness Dexter in action. 


	Prater hands Dexter a knife to facilitate Batista's slaying. Dexter comes down with it swiftly, but of course, doesn't kill him. Batista doesn't fit Dexter's code. Instead of stabbing him, Dexter sliced off one of the restraints to free Batista. In a voice-over, Dexter seems hopeful that he and his old buddy could team up against Prater. 


	“We were partners once; maybe we can be partners again,” Dexter said in a voiceover as he freed Batista.


	Next, Batista charges at Dexter; he's extremely furious. A fight ensues, followed by a struggle.


	“This is for Doakes and for Maria. Your bullshit has to stop,” Batista tells Dexter as he strangles the secret serial killer who can no longer hide from the truth.


	“There's something poetic about dying at the hands of my life-long friend,” Dexter ponders internally, facing the reality that he could die right then. 


	Seconds later, Prater pumps Batista with five bullets. He is still alive and barely holding on, as Dexter comes to terms with the fact that there is no coming back from this.


	“I need you to know, I didn't kill Maria or Doakes. I may be the Bay Harbor Butcher, but I promise you, I didn't kill them,” Dexter finally reveals.


	“It was your fault. And now, I'm dying because of you, just like they did,” Angel replied.


	Dexter tells him, “I'm sorry.”


	At last, Batista knows the truth and has the satisfaction of knowing he was right, but at what cost?


	In the final seconds of his life, Batista faces his old friend and tells him what he's been wanting to say for a long time: “Dexter Morgan, fuck you.”


	After Batista's death, Dexter is left with the bitter reality that Batista is right. He bellows into the void, alone again, and is saying goodbye to another good person who got caught up in chaos. 


	Zayas told Deadline he knew Batista would die in Resurrection “from the beginning.” 


	“When they called me, they said, ‘We're thinking of bringing Dexter back in a resurrection,' and then explained the storyline of the season. My first thought was, ‘Wow, that's great TV,' and it is. It's great for the story, but it's also bittersweet in that you want to continue telling this story. But you know, having a 20-year run is not so bad,” Zayas shared earlier this week.

	











	The actor played Batista across the original series, which ran for 8 seasons on Showtime from 2006 to 2013. As previously noted, he reprised the role in Dexter: New Blood before his appearance in Resurrection. The character was also brought to life in his early years by James Martinez in the prequel Dexter: Original Sin.


	“I feel like everything happened the right way, because anything else would have been a cop-out,” Zayas said of his character's death. We approached it from the beginning, full-heartedly and trying to do the best work we could, and telling the story as best as we could.”


	Of Batista's bravery in facing off with a serial killer, Zayas revealed his feelings towards his character's journey this season.


	“I'm very proud of this character. This is the best job I've ever had as an actor, because I was able to develop Ángel from A to Z. I'm very grateful for that opportunity. The more I think of everything, the more I understand this was the only way it could have gone down.”


	Regarding Batista's final words, which, as a reminder, were, “Dexter Morgan, Fuck you,” the actor admits that he wasn't sure that was the way he should go out.


	“When I first read it, I wasn't sure if those should be Batista's final words. But when I thought about it, I realized those are the exact words that he should say at that moment,” he shared.


	“It's almost like his final release, like, ‘this is where I ended up, because of you.' I'm glad that he didn't let Dexter off the hook. I'm glad that this will be on Dexter's mind forever,” Zayas added.


	As he says goodbye to Batista after so many years—at least for now—Zayas opened up about his character's legacy.


	“I hope fans remember Batista, who maintained his integrity and his search for truth while trying to correct any mistakes he made along the way. Batista is genuine. He's a guy with a big heart, with trusted friends. This season was a little different because he discovered some truths, and it was hard for him to cope with them. The only way he knew how to was to pursue it and to seek justice in the most legal manner possible. He never attempted to break any laws.”


	Regarding the future, Zayas jokes that you never know if you will ever see the character in some way again. Still, he is always willing to revisit this universe to collaborate with people who have become like family. And when dealing with such a vast franchise with so many possibilities, maybe there could be a fun spinoff idea for executive producer Clyde Phillips to consider.


	“Like All in the Family, but in the afterlife?” Zayas said, while laughing, when I suggested a spinoff sitcom starring Batista and his ex Maria Laguerta (Luna Lauren Velez) back together in the afterlife.


	“Hey, listen, I'm open to anything. I love Angel Batista and he's always going to be in my heart,” he concluded, with a big smile.


	With only one more episode left to go, there are still multiple loops to close on Dexter: Resurrection. Even though Batista had caught on to Dexter's extracurricular activities, there's no way the latter will allow Prater to get away with what he did. All bets are off.


	R.I.P. to Angel Batista, a salsero with a heart of gold, who was perfectly imperfect, but a man who died with dignity and pride, trying to do the right thing and keeping innocent people safe.

Great show.  Zayas was Batista and the writing was always strong for his character.  Thanks to all.  No doubt a memorable performance.

The minute I saw Angel was gonna reveal Dexter's true identity I knew a) he was dead, and b) Prater was gonna LOVE that he had The Bay Harbor Butcher now. I think Dexter's gonna end up like Charley, having to work for Prater because he knows about Harrison.

So in the next season, will Quinn and Masuka team up to find out what happened to Angel Batista in New York? Would it not be hilarious that it's Masuka who finally put an end to Dexter's murderous ways?

Holy fuckin shit literally just finished the episode got on Google saw this and I am blown away it hurts Angel was one of my favorite characters and seeing what happened I know Dexter while filled with grief he will most definitely avenge Angels death this is far from over. Long Live Dexter.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Sony Pictures Television have extended the options on several key cast members of its  upcoming Netflix comedic coming-of-age drama Boots, Deadline has learned.


	The move comes ahead of the series' Oct. 9 debut on the streamer. Its timing is related to the series' major delay as the cast options are set to expire Aug. 30, sources said. Extended are Miles Heizer, Liam Oh, Kieron Moore, Dominic Goodman, Blake Burt and Rico Paris, I hear. The options of several cast members have not been extended, which I hear was due to creative reasons, based on where the showrunners plan to take the story in a potential second season.

	Studios proactively securing series casts is not unusual. It shows the studio's faith in a show and helps its renewal chances. 


	Originally greenlighted by Netflix in April 2023, Boots, the last show from legendary producer Norman Lear, was delayed by the Hollywood strikes and then had to wait for a year to get a premiere date after wrapping production in August 2024. 


Boots, inspired by Greg Cope White's memoir The Pink Marine, follows directionless, closeted Cameron Cope (Heizer) and his straight best friend Ray McAffey (Oh) as they join a diverse group of recruits. Set in the tough, unpredictable world of the U.S. Marine Corps in 1990, when being gay in the military was illegal, the ensemble navigates the literal and metaphorical landmines of boot camp, forging unlikely bonds and discovering their true selves in an environment designed to push them to their limits.

	











	The Season 1 main cast also includes Max Parker, Cedrick Cooper, Ana Ayora, Angus O'Brien and Nicholas Logan.


	Andy Parker is creator/co-showrunner/executive producer; Jennifer Cecil serves as showrunner/executive producer. Also executive producing are Lear and Brent Miller through Act III Productions, Rachel Davidson, and Scott Hornbacher & Peter Hoar (episode 101). Sony Pictures Television, where Lear was based, is the studio.

			By Andreas Wiseman, Zac Ntim 


EXCLUSIVE: Here's your first footage of Reacher star Alan Ritchson in new action-thriller Motor City, which is debuting tomorrow at the Venice Film Festival before heading to Toronto.


	Ritchson stars alongside Shailene Woodley, Ben Foster and Pablo Schreiber in the kinetic movie, which is set in 1970s Detroit and charts the story of a man who plots revenge against the criminals who framed him for a crime he didn't commit, leading him to lose the love of his life, played by Woodley.


	The film features a kick-ass soundtrack (Bill Withers, Fleetwood Mac, Donna Summer and more), balletic cinematography and has a great pace to it and some wild action set pieces. The rising Ritchson brings impressive muscle and pathos to it. But what really sets it apart is the fact it only has five lines of dialogue, a rare proposition for a $30M U.S. movie.

	The Chad St John Black List script started out at Warner Bros more than a decade ago and went through multiple iterations in terms of leads and directors interested. Despite becoming an independent project it has managed to maintain impressive production scale and scope. It's part graphic novel-part noir-part John Wick meets disco. 


	The movie is understood to have sold well for Black Bear internationally, the question now is who will take the plunge on domestic, which is being handled by WME Independent and Range Select. We should know more after the Toronto festival and market screening next week. It's certainly deserves to be seen in theaters. At a time when audiences are sparking to original, gutsy genre from the studios (Sinners, Weapons of late), the movie offers another unique prospect and an invigorating creative endeavor. The minimal dialogue will be a commercial challenge. Some may see it as opportunity.

	











	Pic heralds from Old Henry director Potsy Ponciroli. Stampede and Grammercy backed it with Black Bear handling sales. As Ponciroli told us today on a Venice panel for the movie, there was typical indie pivoting right up until shoot: 


	“Credit to our producers. They had made a deal with foreign financiers and were meant to shoot half the movie overseas [Saudi Arabia], and we'd built all these sets and had all our furniture, cars, sets, were taking prop guns over the border etc and three weeks before shoot that money pulled out and we had to find those locations all over again in New Jersey. That was the biggest challenge. We went from 37 days to 28 days. But the producers found more money and there was never a chance the movie was going away.”


	Ben Foster told us today in Venice: “This is not a silent film. There are about five lines of dialogue. If we think about what makes us human, it's behaviour and how we behave with each other. So it was a fun challenge to tell a story without telling the story in a traditional manner. We were able to relate physically as actors.”


	Ponciroli added: “We've seen this type of story before, in terms of the plot, but it's pretty different in how much it relies on emotion and physicality. There's a four and half minute scene in a diner between Ben's character and Shailene and it's one of my favourite in the movie. You don't miss the dialogue. Watching them play off each other and use the scene and their physicality was really fun.”


	Ritchson couldn't make the Venice premiere due to Reacher commitments but is aiming to be at the Toronto launch next week.

Looks like lots of dialogue.  We just don't get to hear it.

Good luck.

The whole movie is in slow motion. Filmed in 3 days. 13 hour runtime.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Tim Meadows spices up a downbeat Peacemaker","https://www.avclub.com/peacemaker-recap-season-2-episode-2","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 03:00:00 GMT","

Last week's season premiere of Peacemaker established with startling sincerity that spiraling feeling of being stuck where one does not want to be. Christopher Smith (John Cena) and his fellow 11th Street Kids, the victorious heroes of the classified Butterfly Invasion, now march bitterly in defeat, their road leading not to reward but despair, desolation instead of happiness. It was a bummer development for this kinetic, riotous series, and, so far, its most dramatically exciting. 

Because while this snarky cadre of black-ops stooges and maladjusted masked avengers are hardly the most relatable figures on television, James Gunn's gift for drawing sympathy from even the most odious among them has been Peacemaker‘s greatest superpower. After all, who among us hasn't felt like the world's tilted off its axis into some darker reality? Last week, Gunn executed moments of regret alongside his most indulgent hard-R-rated montage yet—a genitals-flailing orgy rooted in self-pity—launching a new season of antihero TV that effectively turns the screws on the souls of its repentant characters. And as we learn this week, Chris & co. are still nowhere near rock bottom. 

“A Man Is Only As Good As His Bird,” written by Gunn and directed by Greg Mottola (Superbad; Confess, Fletch), thickens the miserable stew that life is currently serving the 11th Street Kids. It opens in flashback, with Rick Flag Sr. (Frank Grillo) given the grand tour as the new director of A.R.G.U.S., the replacement for deposed Amanda Waller (Viola Davis)—or “A-Dubs,” in the not-so affectionate parlance of Economos (Steve Agee). Once the prickly pleasantries are done, Rick's first task for our dye-bearded friend is to retrieve the secret files concerning the death of his son, Rick Flag Jr. (Joel Kinnaman). After a private debrief, where Flag mentally unpacks the fatal clash between Rick Jr. and Chris—taking note of his boy's final words (“Peacemaker…what a joke”), Flag makes his next move. 

From there, “Bird” returns to Chris Smith, still reeling from last week's accidental dispatch of his alternate-reality self. After a bit of macabre physical humor (Cena is in his wheelhouse here, as seen when he frantically tucks the cadaver into a cabinet only for it to roll back out again and again in a bloody heap), Chris makes a call: “Do you still have those bonesaws?” Later, Adrian Chase, a.k.a. Vigilante (Freddy Stroma with his fresh skibidi haircut), arrives with serrated solutions to Chris' home, where anonymous sex partners swung by for hedonistic frivolity the previous night. (Though not entirely anonymous: We did meet a helpful brunette named Zora.) Adrian, wounded that he wasn't invited to the festivities, nonetheless obliges with the grunt work of corpse disposal, a grisly sequence that I will come back to shortly.

First, a stop by the chilly Adebayo home, where Leota (Danielle Brooks) is greeted by her pups and her estranged wife Keeya (Elizabeth Ludlow). A quick look around their quiet apartment, Keeya in her fast-food uniform, her gaze flat with disappointment, says everything we need to know about Leota's sudden, destructive pivot to “spy business.” (“We were supposed to go home to Gotham!” Keeya says.) At least love, however tenuous, still exists there. Emilia Harcourt (Jennifer Holland) continues her sad trudge alone, making a pharmacy run for concealer to cover up her rearranged face after last week's bar brawl, resulting in an altercation with a well-meaning stranger: “Whatever you're going through…I have resources that can help.” Harcourt: “Thanks; that's not what this is.” On her way out, she clocks the “Help Wanted” sign on the door, a karmic twist of the knife that makes it feel that life is reserving its cruelest ironies just for her.

Meanwhile, outside the Smith residence, Economos' mandatory vigil is interrupted by an uninvited guest by the name of Agent Langston Fleury (Tim Meadows). “What's your preferred greeting? Are you a hugger?” No matter where Economos rests his laurels, unwanted foils find him. Predictably, his hostile first impression with Fleury results in a new nickname: Ginger Cool. “Do you mind if I call you that?” (Yes, he minds.) As his new surveillance partner makes himself comfortable, taking liberties with his horde of snacks and chuckling to himself, Jon reflects, yet again, on the latest indignity in his A.R.G.U.S. career.

Fleury, as it happens, is a trip: He ogles Adebayo at Chris's door with the resigned admiration of a Tex Avery wolf, then confesses to having “bird blindness” upon mistaking Eagly for a parrot. (“It's my sole weakness,” he confides.) Any other show would treat this as a gag that turns out to be bullshit. Meadows, like a gale-force hurricane of smarm and charm, sells it to the degree that later, when Fleury meets Eagly in person, his malady functions as both true and hilariously idiotic. Paradoxically, we discover that antagonistic, rude Fleury also keeps a mental dossier on manners; later, he informs his fidgety A.R.G.U.S. soldiers on the finer—and correct—points of considerate party etiquette.   

With all this introduction, introspection, and yearning, this week's episode can feel like the back half of the premiere. That said, its major set piece at least tightens its two major threads: the Flag-sanctioned home invasion, which is interwoven with a reunion party for the 11th Street Kids. Ads, Economos, Harcourt, Vig, and Chris crack some Bud Lights (the ones Economos doesn't drop), and Chris makes a toast: “No one will ever break us apart.” Foreshadowing is rarely this obvious. As the Kids share chips and dip, Fleury deploys with his goons to infiltrate Casa del Peacemaker. Their discovery of Chris' cosmic closet, which is emanating all kinds of strange energies, is interrupted by Eagly, who defends the home with the same eye-plucking brio he brought to his showdown with the White Dragon and his racist goons last season. 

Back at the party, Chris and Harcourt share a brittle one-on-one. Chris notes the wound above her eye and suggests that she went looking for a fight, to which she spits right back: “We both know that's what you'd like…[to be] some sort of damaged, broken bird, 'cause water seeks its own level and all that. Sorry. I'm not as fucked up as you, Chris.” She leaves Chris to marinate in Bud Light and self-loathing, quite hungover and haunted by the dismemberment of his doppelgänger just hours earlier. “You don't want to meet yourself. It's chilling as fuck,” he said to Vigilante, just before he stared into his own blue eyes dimmed by death and sawed off limbs that may as well have been his as Vigilante gave him an encouraging, “corpses, amirite?” grin. (Stroma is, as ever, great at playing a wonderful, demented buffoon. By the time he gets his beer shower, he's already been spiritually rinsed of his latest foul deed.)  

This brings us to this week's final moments, where Chris texts the alternate-reality Harcourt to see what's shaking on her side of the cosmic divide. (Gunn, a consummate nerd, clarifies that cell coverage does not hop across dimensions.) Her reply, a broken-heart emoji, sparks a flicker of hope on his face. Chris makes himself comfortable in a reality he doesn't belong to but can slip into easily. He's likely to have an easier time mending this Emilia's heart; it can't be as calloused as her alternate's. What kind of person this alt-Chris was, or why he was estranged from alt-Emilia in the first place, are questions for another day. For now, in a desperate attempt to mend a fractured heart, Chris indulges his, thoughtlessly careening toward an emotional reckoning so intense that its devastation will be measured in megatonnage.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","AI munchkins insert David Zaslav cameo into Vegas Sphere's Wizard Of Oz","https://www.avclub.com/sphere-wizard-of-oz-david-zaslav-cameo","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 02:48:00 GMT","

There's been much talk, in recent months, about the Las Vegas Sphere, and its plans to suck certified Hollywood Classic The Wizard Of Oz into its orbtacular maw. Much of this conversation has, understandably, centered on artificial intelligence, which Sphere Entertainment Company is using in abundance to jam the film into its skyline-filling crystal ball, upscaling the movie's resolution, and filling out its frame to fit the giant orb's oddball proportions. (Director Victor Fleming, forward-looking in many ways, apparently never thought to worry how his 1939 film might fit onto giant, globular public eyesores nearly a century down the line, so there's a lot of space to fill.) But while the debates about artistic intent, the difference between “preservation” and “alteration,” and the sheer money-soaked pointlessness of this whole endeavor will continue to rage for the foreseeable future, hopefully there's at least one thing that both we, and the cinematic dead, would be able to agree on about The Wizard Of Oz: David Zaslav's big dumb face should be artificially inserted into it somewhere.

This is per THR, reporting on press statements from Sphere CEO James Dolan, who revealed a little Easter egg while he was getting ready to debut the project this week. Checking that his listeners were familiar with the Warner Bros. Discovery CEO—a man who never met a piece of art he couldn't try his darndest to turn into a tax break—Dolan, apparently gleeful, told reporters, “I won't tell you where, it's only for like two seconds. [They] replaced the faces of two very short, two-second characters in the movie with mine and David. I challenge you to find it.”

Somewhat hilariously, Dolan then got a very quick chime-in from visual effects specialist Ben Grossmann—who, we'll wager, is at least a bit more tuned in to the furor surrounding this project than his boss—who was swift to clarify that Zaslav and Dolan's faces weren't being slapped atop known actors, and that the characters in question were “uncredited characters who were too blurry to be identified.” (To put it another way, the process required these bodies getting some faces attached to their heads, and Grossman and his team apparently opted for the CEOs'.)

There is, if you squint, a certain poetry to having a guy better known for killing movies than making them getting his face transposed into the Land Of Oz, which is notably ruled by a puffed-up, self-described “humbug” whose only real trick is making himself seem much bigger and more impressive than he actually is. Even so, it remains endlessly weird to imagine some poor extra toiling on a Munchkinland set in the 1930s, blissfully unaware that one day his body would be used so a widely hated Hollywood billionaire could literally force his way into movie history.

The Wizard Of Oz At Sphere opened in Las Vegas on Thursday, August 28.

Bella Ramsey delivered some good news this week for haters angry about various things changed in the TV adaptation of video game series The Last Of Us, which they star in: Those video games continue to exist, despite having also been adapted into an HBO show. “You don't have to watch it,” Ramsey's advice continued. “If you hate it that much, the game exists. You can just play the game again.”

The performer—who could be said to have come up deep in hater territory, having caught initial attention for their well-loved performance in the latter days of Game Of Thrones—was talking on The Awardist podcast about negative opinions about their current show. (Ramsey, who's non-binary, is nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress for The Last Of Us.) Ramsey was asked about comments (both “good and bad”) from fans of the game series, who have been increasingly vocal as the show has rolled into The Last Of Us Part II territory, with thoughts on things like changing the timing of one of the game's big reveals, or the fairly slow burn of its second-season pacing. Ramsey's response was a polite but firm note that they avoid as much of such discourse as they can, and consider the games and the show to be very separate things. “There's nothing I can do about it anyway. The show is out. There's nothing that can be changed or altered. So I'm like, there's not really any point in reading or looking at anything.”

When pushed to give a stronger message to the haters, Ramsey issued the above (and quite chipper) reminder about the games still being right there for you to play, along with an apparently heartfelt note that “If you do want to watch it, hope you enjoy it.”

Ramsey's comments come not long after the slightly surprising news that Neil Druckmann—who wrote most of the story for the video games, and serves as their creative director—would not be involved directly in the creation of the show's third season. The Last Of Us is nominated for most of the major Drama awards at this year's Emmy's, including for Outstanding Writing, Directing, and Series overall.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Macon Blair mops up with his rowdy, goop-saturated The Toxic Avenger","https://www.avclub.com/the-toxic-avenger-review","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

It's no surprise that Troma Entertainment's mascot d'excellence, The Toxic Avenger, has sat out most of 2025's reboot-a-thon, what with Lilo & Stitch, Superman, The Naked Gun, and The Fantastic Four: First Steps (among others) sucking up all the air-conditioned oxygen in multiplexes this summer. Where might poor, put-upon Toxie—star of four vicious, violent, and increasingly bizarre films spanning 1984 to 2000—find a place to showcase his most audience-friendly incarnation yet? The ass-end of August, of course, a notorious cinematic dumping ground for distributors too timid to set their scrappy genre movies loose among the big dogs. Macon Blair's appropriately yucky reimagining of The Toxic Avenger adequately, perhaps heroically, mimics the gore-and-boobs-addled cadence of Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz's discount filmmaking, and that alone puts it head and mop above the summer's heavily curated trough of studio-safe products. The Toxic Avenger is an imperfect but no less vital lifeblood transfusion for the cheapo horror-comedy: a cartoon-carnage splash-a-thon, and an eco-conscious call to clean out the profiteers poisoning us and our planet.

A squirrely fusion of tribute and reboot, The Toxic Avenger pits its mutant superhero (voiced by Peter Dinklage, eventually embodied by Luisa Guerreiro) against shitheel corpo-villain Bob (Kevin Bacon in a hilarious Karen wig). Dinklage plays Winston Gooze, a down-on-his-luck janitor working for Bob's BTH Corporation, mopping up nuke-sludge overnight and caring for his emotionally distant stepson Wade (Jacob Tremblay) during the day. Haunted by the sudden death of Wade's mother, the two tiptoe around their shared grief and the accumulating “Past Due”s gathering dust on the kitchen table. When Winston is given a terminal cancer diagnosis (delivered under the head-splitting din of a jackhammer), he begs unscrupulous Bob for help navigating his deliberately labyrinthine insurance policies, an act of humility that sends Winston blundering into the path of Bob's scuzzy underlings—and his gnarly metamorphosis. 

Toxie's revised origin is but one instance where Blair makes space for emotional resonance that Kaufman's nihilistic 1984 original wouldn't have countenanced, though the films share an undercurrent of vengeful class consciousness—the same maddening awareness that the system can and will fuck with people whenever and however it wants—that elevates Blair's film above its B-movie niche. Tramping around the goofy glass-and-syringe-strewn byways of Tromaville (here rechristened as St. Roma's Village) might limit its broader appeal, but drenched in every form of viscous goop, juiced by a punk/metal soundtrack (with a Dinklage contribution, no less), Blair's film makes a case for relevance through sheer chutzpah.

Naturally, Winston plunges into toxic waste and emerges as a hideously deformed creature of superhuman strength, complete with signature mop and pink tutu. Once Toxie lumbers to life, Dinklage entrusts his role to Guerreiro, who manages, under vascular, acid-burned prosthetics, to harness the same wary, cautious physicality Dinklage brings to Winston. Guerreiro does fascinating character work through movement and expression, and largely avoids looking like she's chewing air as Dinklage's dialogue floats over the soundtrack. And while this dual act does initially seem loosely stitched together (mostly by dodgy edits to obscure Toxie's mouth movement), Guerreiro and Dinklage find harmony in their mutual commitment to the character.

But don't mistake this goodwill for squeamishness on Blair's part. He isn't afraid to tinker with Troma's baser instincts when a situation calls for it, populating his film with a concentration of Kaufman-styled freakazoids and maniacs who, among other grody deeds, occasionally whip out interesting parts of their anatomy just for fun. Bob's younger brother, Fritz (Elijah Wood costumed somewhere between Gerard Way and Danny DeVito's Penguin), manages a monster-metal band/death squad called The Killer Nuts, each member equipped with their own disturbing gimmick: a parkour psycho, a chicken-masked creep, a juggalo, and so on. The action often employs disgusting gags, with one hostage sequence that splashes and dismembers with the same anxious, repulsive energy of the original.

Blair also smuggles in some pertinent social commentary, to various comic effect: A cop screams “Show me your hands!” as he ventilates a suspect into Swiss cheese; a newscaster quibbles over Toxie's pronouns; and, in the clearest measure of how far we are from the deviant tendencies of '80s schlock, Toxie explicitly states that he is not a pervert, unlike original Toxie Melvin Junko. Self-awareness thrums throughout this new take on The Toxic Avenger. And while this metatext saps some of the film's danger and unpredictability, it makes a canny argument for future installments: The quality of this reboot, its dutiful nods, and its end-credits sequel tease all clear a path for Toxie to explore stranger, grodier frontiers.

Happy brides are the prettiest! Selena Gomez is all set to marry Benny Blanco. The singer & ‘Rare Beauty' founder celebrated her epic bachelorette party in Cabo San Lucas over the weekend with a close group of friends.

On August 28th, the bride-to-be shared photos from a sweet pre-wedding getaway before tying the knot with fiancé Benny Blanco.

Gomez was in Cabo San Lucas with a close group of friends over the weekend to celebrate what's turned out to be a bachelorette party. 

The trip comes ahead of her upcoming wedding to fiancé Benny Blanco, and the bride-to-be looked radiant throughout the festivities.

According to Us Weekly, the trip was “a very fun but chill weekend,” a source shared. “These girls have been close to her for over a decade now, so it meant the world to her to celebrate these moments with them.”

On Friday, August 23, Gomez and her friends were photographed aboard a luxury yacht, enjoying the Mexican sunshine. The women danced together, posed for selfies, and shared plenty of laughs as they marked the special occasion. In one candid moment, Gomez was seen sitting on the side of the boat, soaking up the sun and flashing a big smile.

Fans couldn't help but notice how happy and relaxed Gomez appeared during the celebration. Dressed in breezy summer fashion, she looked every bit the glowing bride-to-be. The singer and actress seemed to fully embrace the moment, surrounded by her closest circle as she gears up for married life.

While Gomez enjoyed her getaway in Mexico, Benny Blanco celebrated his bachelor party in Las Vegas with about 20 friends, including rapper Lil Dicky. As per TMZ, the 37-year-old producer stayed in a sky-level villa at Resorts World, perched 65 floors above the Strip. The sprawling 5,500-square-foot space, which averages $25,000 a night, featured luxury amenities and even a personal butler.

Blanco and his group later hit XS Nightclub at Wynn Las Vegas on Saturday night, where Marshmello performed. He posed for a photo with the DJ and partied from a VIP table surrounded by friends.

The Cabo getaway comes as Gomez readies for her upcoming wedding to Blanco, whom she began dating in late 2023. 

While the couple has not shared official details about their nuptials, the celebration in Mexico has sparked speculation that the big day may be nearer than we all thought.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","This ‘Summer House' Star Could Be the Next to Join RHONY","https://entertainmentnow.com/bravo/summer-house-lindsay-hubbard-rhony/","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 17:06:39 GMT","

“Summer House” star Lindsay Hubbard is teasing fans about a potential move from the Hamptons to Manhattan.

In an exclusive Wednesday, Aug. 27, interview with Parade, she revealed she is open to exploring a spot on the “Real Housewives of New York City.”

Hubbard is friends with RHONY star Erin Lichy, and the two have already had conversations about the possibility.

“I think our friendship is just really natural,” Hubbard said regarding their friendship. “So, yeah, do we talk about crossover stuff? We talk about it all the time.”

She added, “And we're always scheming something. Like, currently scheming how to hang out all the time with our babies.”

Hubbard's excitement comes as she balances motherhood, filming commitments, and her ongoing friendship with Lichy, who has been a close friend for years.

Hubbard and Lichy's friendship traces back to a chance meeting at a wedding, where Hubbard swapped dresses with one of Lichy's friends.

Lichy recalled the funny moment earlier in August of 2025 when answering questions on social media.

“So Lindsay and my close friend [Alexandra Smith] were at a wedding together years ago and (not sure why) but they wound up swapping dresses in bathroom and became friendly,” Lichy wrote at the time.

She continued, “When we figured that out, we all went to dinner and we've been friends ever since. We got closer since she became a mom.”

Their bond strengthened after both became parents: Hubbard welcomed her daughter, Gemma, in December 2024, while Lichy gave birth to her son, Jack, in March 2025.

The two recently shared a sweet moment of Gemma and Jack interacting with each other. While the babies looked at each other in the video, the words, “The summer Gemma found her future husband,” were written beneath.

A post shared by Lindsay Hubbard (@lindshubbs)

The caption continued to showcase humor as Hubbard wrote, “We can't wait to be mother-in-laws.”

As both Hubbard and Lichy have spent the summer in the Hamptons, there is the potential for Lichy to make an appearance on the popular Bravo show.

Hubbard didn't give Parade any insight into the possibility. However, the 39-year-old did gush about spending the summer with her daughter.

“It was really important for me to be able to spend a lot of time with Gemma this summer,” Hubbard noted. “She's at the age where she's hitting so many milestones. And summertime is my personal favorite season, as with most, especially here in New York. So, it's been really fun to watch her.”

It's no wonder longtime HGTV star Christina Haack couldn't wait to put her latest divorce behind her. Nearly four months after the interior designer celebrated settling her divorce from her third husband, Josh Hall, the final agreement was filed in court on August 26, 2025. 

Court documents obtained by EntertainmentNow on August 28 reveal that Haack, 42, walked away with many of the assets that mattered most to her, including her family's home in Orange County, California, and the Nashville farmhouse where her former HGTV show “Christina in the Country” was filmed.  

After hours of mediation on May 1, the settlement that both parties agreed to granted Hall, 45, his fair share of assets, too. Following almost three years of marriage to Haack, he received a total of $400,000 in cash payments, and will keep multiple vehicles and several properties. 

On May 7, Haack wrote in her Instagram Stories that she was trying to be frugal by wearing a $65 dress to a red carpet event, writing, “Paying for this divorce hasn't been cheap so I've been trying to cut down on my spending especially when it comes to clothes.”

Hall, who had just begun filming “The Flip Off” with Haack when the two separated on July 8, 2024, moved full-time to Tennessee after the split, while Haack remained with her kids in California. 

As news of the settlement broke, he posted on August 28, “Finally, legally divorced and a free man. I've always worked hard, kept what's mine, and declined hand outs, and I'm keeping it that way.”

According to the former couple's 44-page settlement overview reviewed by EntertainmentNow, Hall will keep the $100,000 that Haack paid him during their divorce proceedings. Haack also wrote him a check for $300,000 in May — taken from the sale of a 1920 Nashville home they purchased in early 2024 and began flipping. The home sold in April 2025 before the full remodel was finished, according to real estate records reviewed by EntertainmentNow. 

In addition to the cash payout, Hall received two furnished properties in Tennessee — a house and a condo — as well as a plot of land in California. He's also hanging onto a 2021 Bentley, a 1970 Chevelle, a 1982 DeLorean, a 1947 Dodge, and a Honda CRF motorcycle.

Haack, meanwhile, gets the two previously mentioned homes, additional properties and land, as well as two 2021 GMC Yukons (one in Tennessee, the other in California), a 2021 Polaris Razor, and four quads that were gifted to her kids, per court documents. It's unclear why, but Haack also must return a 2022 Bentley to the dealership where it was purchased. 

Although Hall originally requested spousal support when the two split, he has since waived the right to it. Haack also waived her right to any support from Hall moving forward. 

A post shared by Heather Rae El Moussa (@theheatherraeelmoussa)

When Haack signed the divorce settlement in May, she posted a thank you note to her attorney, celeb divorce lawyer Laura Wasserman, that said, “I LOVED WATCHING YOU IN ACTION AND HOW YOU HANDLE EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE WITH CLASS AND GRACE…I APPRECIATE YOU ALL BEYOND WORDS. I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH UNDER YOUR GUIDANCE AND I'M GRATEFUL TO HAVE THIS BEHIND ME. I CAN'T WAIT TO MOVE ON WITH MY LIFE AND FOCUS ON WHAT'S AHEAD AND ALL MY BLESSINGS. 🙏❤️”

Haack and Hall have both moved on with new relationships since their split. On January 10, Us Weekly reported that Hall was dating Nashville-based model Stephanie Gabrys. The two are still together, seen most recently in an Instagram photo he posted on August 12.

Haack, meanwhile, stepped out with Orange County business executive Chris Larocca in January after weeks of rumors about them dating. As news of her divorce settlement broke on August 28, Haack was busy posting photos in her Instagram Stories from a trip to Chicago with Larocca. 

The couple has even become tight with Tarek and Heather, with whom Haack will co-star in a just-announced second season of “The Flip Off,” coming to HGTV in 2026.

Two days after Kelley Wolf, the estranged wife of Hallmark fan favorite and “Party of Five” alum Scott Wolf, was arrested at the Utah home where she was staying, multiple outlets reported on August 28, 2025, that there's renewed hope she will receive the help she needs to thrive again. 

Fans, friends and family members had grown increasingly concerned about Kelley's well-being since the couple first announced their split on June 10, following 21 years of marriage. The former MTV reality star has since been placed under two involuntary holds but struggled to follow court orders upon release, ignoring a social media gag order and boundaries set around communication with and about Scott and their kids.

According to documents from the Summit County Sheriff's Office obtained by People on August 28, a judge set her bail at $5,000 and required her to “participate in inpatient or outpatient medical, behavior, psychological, or psychiatric treatment.” The outlet later reported that Kelley was released from custody before 4 p.m. 

A post shared by KELLEY WOLF (@kelleywolf)

After Kelley posted a slew of alarming Instagram Stories and posts on August 26, Us Weekly reported, Scott called police in Summit County, where their family lives, after one of the posts included his phone number.  

According to the police report obtained by Us Weekly, Scott received over 24 calls and texts from unknown numbers within minutes of Kelley posting his contact information via an Instagram Story in which she referred to him as “dimples.”

In the post, reviewed by EntertainmentNow, Kelley wrote, “I am a great tv producer and reality star but I suck at technology…I hate people and phones. Let's let dimples field his own press? Right? This old heffer needs a hug. And some steak!! And a night out!” She then directed “all press inquiries” to his number. 

Two hours later, Kelley wrote another Instagram Story, alerting her followers that “the police are my house to arrest me,” noting that she had “no idea why.”

On August 28, People reported that Kelley had been formally charged with two class B misdemeanors for electronic disclosure of personal identifying information and electronic communications harassment.

Us Weekly reported that the responding officer requested in the police report that Kelley “be held until she can be seen by a judge as well as a mental health professional,” adding that the family was “extremely concerned about her mental health.”

The officer also wrote, per Us Weekly, “It is believed by family and law enforcement that her illegal and harassing behavior will continue if she is released.” 

According to People, the judge told Kelley that upon her release, she is not to “consume any alcohol or narcotic drug or other controlled substance unless prescribed by a licensed medical practitioner.”

In addition to participating in “inpatient or outpatient medical, behavior, psychological, or psychiatric treatment,” per People, Kelley was ordered to “avoid contact with witnesses who may testify regarding the offenses.”

Kelley's pretrial release conditions, People reported, also forbid her from posting on social media until another court order lifts that ban. 

A post shared by Scott Wolf (@iamscottwolf)

As Kelley navigates the road to recovery, Scott will maintain temporary sole physical custody of their kids — Jackson, 16, Miller, 12, and Lucy, 11. In a revised agreement filed on August 22, according to People, the judge upheld that decision. 

Scott was first awarded custody as well as a restraining order in June, following Kelley's first involuntary hold. That decision was upheld in July, per People, giving Kelley “liberal” supervised parenting time if coordinated through proper channels.

The August 22 agreement, according to People, included a new requirement that each of the couple's children have a “safe-harbor therapist,” which means neither parent can “interfere with or inquire into the content of the therapeutic process.” They're also prohibited from subpoenaing any information from the therapist in future litigation, the outlet said. 

The agreement states that the family's goal, per People, continues to be for “Kelley to eventually regain unsupervised parenting time.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Taylor Swift & Travis Kelce Planning to Put Down Roots: REPORT","https://entertainmentnow.com/taylor-swift/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-house-hunting/","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 02:54:18 GMT","

After Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce announced their engagement on August 26 in a shared Instagram post, the couple is reportedly looking to settle down in a permanent home.

A source told Us Weekly on August 27 that while Swift and Kelce haven't decided on the location, they're looking at different options.

“They aren't 100 percent sure where they will plant roots, so that's why they have been looking around,” the insider revealed.

Page Six reported that Swift and Kelce were spotted eyeing a house in Ohio, where the Kansas City Chiefs tight end hails from.

According to the outlet, the $18 million estate comes complete with a music studio that's perfect for the “Bad Blood” singer.

The sprawling mansion, which sits on over 61 acres, features six bedrooms and 13 bathrooms, as well as a wine cellar, pool, and outdoor kitchen.

During Swift's August 13 appearance on “New Heights,” she and Kelce dropped some major clues that they have been living together. 

During the two-hour episode, Swift revealed that she often hears Kelce recording “New Heights” at his house. 

“I like New News just because of the screaming. I hear him screaming, ‘New News,' from across the house constantly. It's my favorite part. He'll be like, ‘New News, New News,' and I'm in the kitchen being like, ‘New News.' So I love that because of just the bellowing of it,” she said.

Kelce later said, “It's been so fun to see what Taylor actually gets into around the house.” Swift added, “I love to cook. I have a different baking obsession every six months.”

She shared, “He asked me to send him two loaves of sourdough at training camp. I'm like wrapping sourdough loaves in like Saran Wrap or cling film. The sourdough has taken over my life in a huge way.”

A post shared by New Heights (@newheightshow)

Swift and Kelce may not just hear the sound of wedding bells in the near future, but also the pitter-patter of little feet.

“They absolutely want a family. Their dream is to have kids,” an insider told Us Weekly.  The source revealed that Swift and Kelce plan to have kids soon, adding, “She's in a great space in her career, and with her success, she can take some time away.”

Swift is gearing up to release her 12th studio album, “The Life of a Showgirl,” on October 3.

You know you're in for an encounter with somebody who wants to start shit when the opening frames of Luca Guadagnino's “After the Hunt,” a thriller about a sexual assault scandal that rocks an intellectual community, are styled in the tradition of none other than Woody Allen: white Windsor typeface against a black backdrop, the cast including Julia Roberts and Ayo Edebiri in alphabetical order, and the credits acknowledging said alphabetical order. “It happened at Yale,” the prologue text announces, also evoking the academia-centered mysteries of someone like “The Secret History” author Donna Tartt.

 










It's an intriguing provocation from the get-go that Guadagnino would want to announce his new film by calling back to Allen, an artist who has become the poster figure for sexual abuse scandals. That Guadagnino would want to interrogate the rhetoric of how alleged abuse is positioned at all via Allen's signature is a sit-up-in-your-seat creative choice that nearly hijacks the first moments of this Yale-set drama, about a philosophy professor (Roberts) unraveling amidst her student's (Edebiri) accusation of sexual assault against a colleague (Andrew Garfield).

 








Related Stories ‘Father Mother Sister Brother' Teaser: Jim Jarmusch Raises a Teacup to Familial Awkwardness  ‘At Work' Review: A Modest, Modern Fable About a French Writer Pursuing Freedom Over Materialism 

But that's unfortunately about as dangerous as the oddly chaste “After the Hunt” gets despite characteristically invigorating direction from the visionary filmmaker behind at least two masterpieces: “Call Me By Your Name” and “Queer,” two heightened immersions into the subjective state of desire, and maybe a third, “Suspiria,” if you're willing to go there. “After the Hunt's” talky, heady unfolding — with a snaking interest in the generational divide between Gen Z youth culture and pre-woke-era Gen Xers — works from a screenplay by first-time feature writer Nora Garrett, who came to Guadagnino's attention early last year. It's an overintellectualized script that reduces its characters to broad stand-ins and mouthpieces for hot topics, bizarrely retrograde, and a few beats behind the times in interrogating both the post-#MeToo context of how assault charges are handled, reacted to, and also in untangling a tricky identity politics inquiry that brushes against race and gender issues.

Yale philosophy professor Alma Imhoff (Julia Roberts), like the filmmaker, clearly has a taste for risk, too. Hosting a party chez elle that mixes colleagues and faculty, she nurses a sizable glass of red wine while dressed in a top-to-toe white suit, and it's likely not the first drink this secretly hard-boozing, self-destructive teacher has had today. Roberts has great fun in a career-recharging dramatic performance — she's at her most dare-to-be-unlikable since Mike Nichols' 2004 “Closer” — as a fucked-up, boozing, and eventually pill-popping highbrow with a mystery chronic ailment and perhaps a too-close fondness toward her younger colleague, Hank (a raffish Garfield).

 










One of her students, Maggie (Ayo Edebiri), is the type to shoot her hand up first in the classroom even when unsure of the answer. She greatly admires Alma but has secrets of her own: In that scene-setting party, Maggie absconds to Alma's bathroom, and finds an envelope with a photo of a dashing stranger taped under the sink. (Why Alma would hide this photo here, a relic of a hidden life, in New Haven, where she lives with her husband rather than the pied-à-terre she keeps in the city, suddenly revealed in the third act, is unclear.)

In other words, as much as Maggie idolizes her teacher in the way that young people who weren't loved enough as children project parent-like silhouettes onto their mentors, Maggie also might be building a case against Alma. Soon into the movie, a rain-soaked Maggie shows up, dejected and nerve-jangled, to the home Alma shares with her psychotherapist husband Frederik (Michael Stuhlbarg). Maggie confesses that, on the night of that party, Hank forced himself upon her after walking her home. “He crossed a line,” she says. A skeptical Alma will eventually tell Maggie a very unhelpful version of “if it's real to you, then it's real” while trying to balance an allegiance to Hank, who might be in love with Alma. Or is she in love with him, or just idealizing his adoration of her, too, as she does with Maggie's?

 










Alma is a victim of her own quest for love, and pieces of information about her past that might inform her reaction to Maggie's claims unfurl in dribs throughout the movie. Meanwhile, her relationship to Hank is thrown out of orbit, as this very clear accusation of rape alienates them from each other, and Hank from his academic milieu, where he likens himself to a wild animal being chased out of the herd.

Chloë Sevigny, who madly incarnated the freakiest scene out of Guadagnino's YA cannibal romance “Bones and All” and starred in his HBO series “We Are Who We Are,” has a small role here as student liaison Kim, who keeps the pupils' confidences as well as a blank prescription notepad in her desk, acting as a kind of guidance counselor. My issue with Garrett's unsubtle inquiry into the Gen Z vs. Gen X paradigm is no more sourly demonstrated than in a scene where Kim, throwing back a few drinks with Alma at the local dive Three Sheets, gives an on-the-nose remark on just how anachronistic-for-our-times it is that said college bar is blasting music by controversy-magnet, truther-opinioned Morrissey.

In terms of subversiveness and hints at a kinkier underworld beneath the surface, “After the Hunt” feels strangely sanded down: Why not turn up the heat more on the palpable sapphic friction simmering between Alma and Maggie? Lingering close-ups on one another's hands as they embrace in moments of emotional frankness — and both painted with what seems to be the same nail polish — hint at a relationship that could've been explored with more risk. The camera handled by cinematographer Malik Hassan Sayeed, working with Guadagnino for the first time, whooshes around his subjects to indicate the shakiness of their frames of mind. Guadagnino does bring back his regular scoring collaborators, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, who might have replayed the plunking, doom-harbinging piano refrain of “Eyes Wide Shut” a few too many times during the brainstorming phase.

 










Limiting to the actress's bona fide capabilities, Edebiri's character is treated mostly as a nuisance, a fly to be swatted off, making the racial politics of her position as a queer Black student whose moneyed parents have endowed the university (thereby throwing Maggie's inherent academic worthiness into question) especially unresolved and unplumbed. That Maggie's dissertation — which Hank alleges is plagiarized as he scrambles to gain traction amid his downfall — and field of study is on the resurgence of “virtue ethics” suggests something provocative, more satirical and mischievous up Garrett's sleeve. But it's unclear, and not in a piquantly ambiguous way, what Garrett is trying to say here.

The most recent movie “After the Hunt” calls to mind is Todd Field's “Tár,” similarly a cancel-culturally minded story set within academia, and about a female educator abusing her power. That film succeeded so well, in a way that everyone seemed to get without nose-wrinkling, because of its sense of humor about itself. “After the Hunt” leaves some potential brambles of humor unpricked, like the fact that Maggie just might be dating her nonbinary, trans peer (Lio Mehiel) for the sake of clout. Or when Alma sounds off on Maggie and her partner, asking, “Don't you have some obscure protest to be publicly angry at?” while repeatedly misgendering Mehiel's character. It's more cringe because of its bluntness than intentionally funny and satiristic.

 










Guadagnino is a beautiful director of jolting power and skill, especially in capturing queer yearning and the psychic collisions of people against their station in life. “Challengers” cranked up the pansexual vibes between a trio of tennis-playing lovers with an unceremoniousness, a sneaky slyness, that actually felt revolutionary, and the supposed age-gap romance of “Call Me By Your Name” remains a subject of hot debate even as the movie now lives as a contemporary classic. The way he has also stood by “Call Me” star Armie Hammer, all but persona non grata after a surge of upsetting harassment accusations of his own, indicates a subversive artist unafraid to go against the grain.

But “After the Hunt” ultimately isn't against-the-grain enough. It strives for moral ambiguity, but ends up startingly morally stark, pampering the viewer against discomfort in a final coda that feels taped on, after-the-fact reassurance. It pains me to take down a Luca Guadagnino movie — he is one of the best filmmakers working — but “After the Hunt” isn't enough, its ideas ripped from an earlier time, transposed onto our own with a broad-strokes equivocation about what they want to say.

“After the Hunt” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. Amazon/MGM Studios opens the film in theaters October 10.

Martin Scorsese recently produced the Fox Nation series “The Saints,” but he himself looks more like a Biblical figure in a first look at his character from Julian Schnabel‘s “In the Hand of Dante.” Scorsese is bearded and bewhiskered in this adaptation of Nick Tosches' 2002 book. And his character is a nameless man who otherwise goes by Isaiah. He'll be playing an inspirational figure to Dante Alighieri, the 14th century Italian scribe best known for his epic poem “The Divine Comedy,” and it seems sure to be another of his distinctive on-camera appearances. (You can see the full image, an IndieWire exclusive, below.)

 










Like the book, Schnabel's film will take place both in Italy in the early 1300s, when Dante is assembling his magnum opus, and also in 2001, when a handwritten manuscript supposedly from Dante himself is discovered in the Vatican library and goes through an elaborate process of authentication — with a mob boss ordering a fictionalized version of author Tosches to steal it. Oscar Isaac will play both Dante and Tosches.

Scorsese's “Isaiah” will only appear in the 14th century segments. Dante seeks his approval when he writes “Paradiso,” and it takes many visits before Isaiah gives it. Dante was sent to him by Guido Cavalcanti who was his mentor, and visits Isaiah whenever he can over the course of many years while he is in exile. (One can imagine Scorsese's character from “Quiz Show,” with warm fatherliness, addressing Dante as “young man.”) Isaiah is meant to represent the highest form of wisdom.

“In the Hand of Dante,” also starring Jason Momoa, Gal Gadot, Gerard Butler, Al Pacino, and Franco Nero, will make its world premiere, appropriately enough, at the 2025 Venice Film Festival.

But cinephiles will particularly thrill to this grizzled image of Scorsese, looking exactly like a font of Renaissance wisdom who could have inspired the great writer. Scorsese's acting filmography consists largely of cameos or brief scenes, but they're always memorable — culminating in his first ever acting nomination, an Emmy nod as guest actor in “The Studio” this awards cycle. 

Most memorable may be his sociopathic passenger in “Taxi Driver” — or rather, as he's credited, Passenger Watching Silhouette. He asks Robert De Niro's title character Travis Bickle to pull up in front of an apartment building where he watches the silhouette of a woman undressing. He tells Bickle that that's his wife, she's with another man, and in his jealousy he's planning on killing her.

 










Oddly, he was able to leverage that simmering menace once again for his voice acting role in the 2004 animated comedy “Shark Tale” where much of the plot centers on a fish voiced by Will Smith owing Scorsese's heavy-eyebrowed pufferfish money. Somehow the minds at DreamWorks knew that what Aughts kids wanted to see above all was Martin Scorsese as an underwater gangster. (That film was also a Venice premiere.)

The thing about that “Shark Tale” performance is that it leans so heavily into Scorsese's persona — the eyebrows, the rapid-fire staccato delivery, the slightly manic vibe — that it shows why his acting work has had some limitations. There's a moment at the beginning of his extraordinary documentary series “A Personal Journey Through American Movies with Martin Scorsese” (a multi-hour tribute to Scorsese's favorite movies) that may show why. At the start of that, a real-time sketch takes place that takes the form of Scorsese's profile. It calls to mind the signature profile sketch always associated with Alfred Hitchcock — like Hitch before him, Scorsese is a persona, and not quite elastic enough of one to stretch and fit many roles.

So, like Hitchcock, the blink-and-miss cameo has often been Scorsese's approach in front of the camera: As a photographer in “The Age of Innocence,” say, or as a cameraman in “Hugo.” Of course there's his speaking part at the end of “Killers of the Flower Moon,” where he plays a radio show host who's just finished giving the radio-play version of the story that had unfolded over the previous three-and-a-half hours. It was an incredible meta commentary on how deep human tragedy becomes entertainment, “true crime.” And him being the one to play that role, as well as being the film's director, almost suggests a certain questioning about how he, or any filmmaker, could have approached this material as respectfully as possible.

 










For our money, his greatest screen role is a very unexpected and strange one, a true bit of casting against type: His role as Vincent van Gogh in Akira Kurosawa's “Dreams,” one of the great Japanese director's most underrated movies. This roughly 10-minute segment in the anthology film, titled “Crows,” follows a young admirer of the artist who apparently jumps back through time and follows around his idol as they enter landscapes directly recreating some of van Gogh's most famous paintings. Chopin's “Raindrop” prelude plays as they go from painting to painting — kind of living out the fantasy of loving a painting so much you wish you could leap into it and live there for a bit — while Scorsese's van Gogh talks about various things, such as his commitment to his art, which comes through with manic focus and and absolute intensity. He explains why he cut off his left ear: It gave him trouble while he was painting a self-portrait, so he got rid of it.

That absolute commitment to art, that feeling of being a conduit for the divinity of creation, feels like it could be what Scorsese is going for here as Dante's mentor in “In the Hand of Dante.” It'll be exciting to see.

“In the Hand of Dante” will premiere at the 2025 Venice Film Festival.

It's early days at the Venice Film Festival, but there seems to be an emerging theme of the dehumanizing nature of work under late capitalism (see also: “Bugonia” and “No Other Choice”). French actress an director Valérie Donzelli has a very specific riff on this theme in “A Pied D'oeuvre (the English title is literally “At Work”), her modern riches-to-rags tale about a man who gives up life as a successful, well-remunerated photographer in Paris in order to scrape a living as a casual laborer and use his free time trying to become an author that his children want to read.

 










Paul (Bastien Bouillon) is taking a hammer to drywall when we meet him, as the life he used to know is shattering into pieces. At the age of 42, he has switched creative lanes from being a photographer pulling in €3k to €8k a month to being a writer who has already spent the advance on his unpromising third book. Meanwhile, his recent ex-wife (Donzelli) has moved to Montreal along with his son and daughter and Paul has moved out of their large house into a tiny studio. His thinly veiled account of the breakdown of their marriage, “The Story of the End” his agent deems unsaleable. If being a good writer means living in such a way that the material generates itself, then Paul's life and vocation are both in need of an overhaul.

Paul wants to find the kind of work that leaves him enough time to write, and this is how he ends up on the “Jobbing” website, setting up a profile and listing his manual labor/ handyman skills. Donzelli's unflashy style of direction has a brisk simplicity, letting observational details play out without underlining them, so that mildly comic moments could just as easily have you grimacing in recognition. The tiny ghost of a smile that Paul performs to his webcam for take two of his profile picture is the world in a grain of sand, reflecting the fact that it's not enough for people to sell their labor, they must appear to emanate a deep sense of well-being from within while, say, dismantling a mezzanine or mowing your lawn. 

This is a film parked out in the minutiae of Paul's new work culture and attuned to the fact that, when your work is underpaid, you can never get enough of it. Members of the Jobbing website are pinged whenever a job within their skillset is listed, at which point, it's a bidding war to the bottom as jobbers set their rates ever-lower. Paul commonly bids at €20 for jobs that take hours, meaning his rate is nowhere near the wheelhouse of minimum wage. 

Still, as he reflects, he has a beginner's zeal to make this system work, and that gives him an advantage over more disenfranchised jobbers with a long-term dependency on it. Adapted from an autobiographical novel by Frank Courtes, the film is in the trenches of Paul's personal experience while retaining the perspective that most people who turn to Jobbing do so out of desperation rather than idealism. Unlike the migrant workers that he competes with for jobs, Paul is still in receipt of humble monthly royalties. “€200-300 a month is not poverty but it gives a clear view of it,” he writes. Although Paul has relative privilege here, relative privilege does not pay the heating bills and it is clear — through the glimpses of debasement that occur with increasing frequency — that our hero is flirting with ruin.

 










The people around him berate him for his choices, his sister says that he is not a “real” poor person and asks why he doesn't get a different job. Verbalising the idealism that quietly motors under the surface of both the film and its protagonist, Paul says that “some slaves are well-paid today.” He has tasted the life that a corporatized creative job can buy and has found it lacking. His newfound precarity is not romanticized, it is presented as the necessary alternative to a less suitable path. He is taking Robert Frost's road less traveled in the hope that it will make all the difference. 

Half-way through the film, he has an encounter with the man he used to be, which is to say, in his capacity as a driver, he picks up a man that he knew from the photography world. Over dinner, this man, who still has a well-paid job, a big house, and luxe travels, offers a graceful understanding of what his former peer is doing and contrasts it with his own “hyper-consumption. … You're cutting down, it's good.”

The narrow narrative framework is undergirded by a taut, eloquent script by Valérie Donzelli and Gilles Marchand (whose previous writing credits include Cannes 2025 titles “Enzo” and “Case 137”). The ring of lived experience does not hamper or labor this clear-eyed depiction of a man whose desire for freedom might see him free-fall into a different trap: poverty. 

 










Virtually a one-man-show, Bouillon carries the film aided by the kind of face that looks different from every angle. His clients are curious about him. “You don't look the part,” says one woman as he arrives in his cable-knit sweater and owl glasses to construct her armoire. The glimpses of the people that he meets in this new line of work feed his writely imagination and he reconstructs them on the page. Fears that the narrative will end in a cliche, with Paul writing a book about being poor that makes him rich again, are thankfully unfounded as the film deftly avoids any such trap. 

If this modest fable feels slight in a competition dominated by filmmakers swinging for the fences, then it's not for a lack of substance. Full of throwaway insights into the micro-climate of a particularly hellish economic landscape, “At Work” is an engaging story about a man trying to write an engaging story with a diamond of hard-won wisdom at its core. 

“At Work” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Nobody does an anthology film quite like Jim Jarmusch, and his new film “Father Mother Sister Brother” will see him exploring the intricacies of family relationships over quite a few cups of tea. 

Jarmusch has assembled a stable of his favorite collaborators (along with a few new faces) for a triptych about adults navigating their relationships with their aging parents. The three segments were filmed in New Jersey, Dublin, and Paris — a fittingly global choice from a director who has always been fascinated by the ways that multicultural relations shape our smallest interactions. Plot details have been scarce to date, but the first teaser shows three distinct families dealing with their share of awkward moments, such as a disagreement about whether it's possible to do a proper toast with tea.

“Father Mother Sister Brother” is the first feature Jarmusch has directed since his 2019 zombie comedy “The Dead Don't Die.” That film debuted to middling reviews (though it has enjoyed a subsequent reappraisal), but it was preceded by two of the strongest films of his career, 2014's “Only Lovers Left Alive” and 2016's “Paterson.” 

 










The hyphenate has kept busy during his six-year hiatus, working on multiple music projects including a new series of scores he composed for Man Ray films along with his SQÜRL bandmate Carter Logan. But he hasn't been shy about his disdain for the state of the independent film industry. 

“The film industry is kind of gone,” Jarmusch said in a 2023 interview with The Guardian. “It sucks. It's gotten worse. The kind of split-rights deals – an equal 50-50 shared profits, after costs, with financiers – that I used to be able to do with my films… if you even suggested that now, you would be laughed out of the fucking building.”

“Father Mother Sister Brother” will have its world premiere at the Venice International Film Festival before screening at the New York Film Festival. MUBI will release the film in theaters on December 24. Watch the teaser below.

You need a good reason to exhume a dead body. Even in capital murder cases, the United States requires both criminal prosecutors and defense counsel to meet a rigorous legal standard when petitioning to disturb a mausoleum or grave.

That same expectation doesn't apply in Hollywood, where the true crime ecosystem continues to needlessly zombify old cases. This fall, TV audiences seem headed for a particularly macabre display when Netflix's “Monster: The Ed Gein Story” (October 4) debuts the same month as Peacock's “Devil in Disguise: John Wayne Gacy” (October 16). 

 










Gein and Gacy — two of the most notorious American serial killers of the 20th century — are remembered for crimes so heinous they already reverberate throughout pop culture. But modern IP laws treat these monolithic boogeymen almost like public property, doing more to protect fictional characters like Mickey Mouse from abuse than the real people who were impacted by these crimes.

A severely disturbed murderer from Wisconsin, Gein had an affinity for mutilation and necrophilia. When his rural house of horrors was discovered by authorities in 1957, future production designers got a laundry list of ideas for grotesque set decorations. Gein's so-called “hobbies” have been reflected on screen in classic genre films from “The Texas Chain Saw Massacre” to “Silence of the Lambs,” and he's even referenced in Christian Bale's best line from “American Psycho.” 

 










“Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?,” quips Bale as Patrick Bateman. The psychotic businessman is setting up a dark joke punctuated by a pretty girl — with her head “on a stick.” 

Also known as the original Killer Clown, Gacy didn't begin his crimes until 15 years after Gein's reign of terror had ended. A mass murderer, rapist, and honest-to-God birthday party clown, Gacy killed more than 30 young men and boys in the 1970s. He hid their remains in the crawlspace of his house in Illinois and remained active for six years. 

Author Stephen King has never explicitly said that Pennywise, the infamous dancing clown of “It,” was inspired by Gacy. But Rob Zombie cited the serial killer as inspiration for the sadistic Captain Spaulding in “House of 1000 Corpses,” “The Devil's Rejects,” and “3 from Hell.”

In 2014, the controversial horror director faced significant backlash for putting on a haunted attraction in Chicago with themed rooms that paid direct homage to Gacy. Speaking with the Chicago Tribune back then, Zombie dismissed concerns that he had been thoughtless to survivors and victims, who lived nearby, and he stood by his assertion that the Gacy rooms were “funny.” Defending himself in the interview, the director pointed out the annual attraction had faced similar criticism before.

 










“They didn't like the Manson one because that was a California issue,” Zombie said. “This is the home of all serial killers — the Midwest. So, they'll hate everything, I guess.”

Since before the days of mummies in Ancient Egypt, human burial sites have been largely seen as sacred. Messing with resting places is taboo for a few reasons. Many religions forbid the desecration of bodies not only to shelter the sanctity of the departed's soul, but to also protect churches from becoming epicenters for posthumous theft. Corpses were further stigmatized by the decline of sanitation in medieval Europe, and they've been associated with disease ever since. 

It seems strange then that Hollywood is so hell-bent on dragging out our worst nightmares time and again — with little regard for their potentially festering consequences.

To be fair, these TV shows aren't out yet, and Peacock and Netflix could surprise us with something new to say about Gein and Gacy. But the ever-increasing pressure to pull in eyeballs can be a real temptation in an industry already marred by exploitation — especially at a time when true crime is making independent content creators serious money for limited investment on social media. 

Before “Monster” decided to tackle the story of Ed Gein, Netflix backed Ryan Murphy on warming over the cannibalistic killings of Jeffrey Dahmer. Later, the “Monster” anthology hit the Beverly Hills double-murder of Jose and Kitty Menendez. Both of those projects were mired in controversy, and the popularity of the latter show directly impacted the brothers' standings in court. Erik and Lyle Menendez were recently denied parole, and while Murphy won't have such a problem with the long-deceased Gein, the implications of entertainment steering the justice system are alarming. 

 










Netflix received criticism several years ago when it cast Zac Efron as lethal lady killer Ted Bundy, seemingly glorifying the convicted murderer and rapist. The streamer is stirring up a similar controversy by selecting former “Sons of Anarchy” star Charlie Hunnam to play Ed Gein. (He's known online as “Hot Ed Gein,” and those are three words I'll admit I'm troublingly eager to repeat to my therapist.)

Meanwhile, at Peacock, “Severance” actor Michael Chernus has already defended his decision to play Gacy. In July, he told Vanity Fair that the project would not venerate the killer or the violence associated with him, noting, “I honestly didn't want this to be ‘Dahmer.'”

Still, the extreme nature of Gein and Gacy's crimes presents a serious challenge to artists proselytizing in uncertain times. The unspeakable drama of these killings is an understandable draw to filmmakers interested in humanity's worst impulses. But now, they must balance responsible docudrama storytelling and their own possible shortcomings in an industry all too comfortable robbing graves.

After years toiling in the post-Disney-star pop ecosystem, Sabrina Carpenter finally broke through last year with Short n' Sweet, her sixth album, which rode to pop ubiquity (and strong Grammys recognition) off the back of “Espresso,” “Please Please Please” and “Taste” its three catchy, sharply written megahit singles. Since then, she's staged a gigantic global arena tour and, somehow, found time to record a follow-up: Man's Best Friend, which once again finds her working with Jack Antonoff, John Ryan, and the songwriter Amy Allen.

Like its predecessor, Man's Best Friend positions Carpenter as a kind of TikTok-era Mae West: a sex symbol who's in on the joke, and who can flick between sweet and savage in milliseconds. This time around, there's a little more sadness and frustration in the mix—Short n' Sweet might have made frequent reference to the irresistible nature of Carpenter, but this record pokes some holes in that self-confidence as she sings about men who are disinterested, rude, or just plain annoying. Here are five key takeaways.

Man's Best Friend was already a media sensation before it even came out, thanks to its vaguely provocative cover—Carpenter, on all fours, with a man in a suit grabbing her hair—and its title, which some fans assumed was being presented literally and uncritically. In truth, the presentation of the album makes a lot of sense when you listen to it: Many of these songs, like “My Man on Willpower” and “We Almost Broke Up Again,” center on Carpenter's inability to cut herself off from men who trifle with her emotions or make her feel undervalued. (On her being treated, in other words, like a dog.)

Smell the Glove

One of the songs on Sabrina Carpenter's pre-show playlist is ABBA's “If It Wasn't For The Nights,” an underrated and relatively obscure from 1979's Voulez-Vous, written by Björn Ulvaeus about how his own sense of workaholism was the only thing getting him through his divorce from Agnetha Faltskog. Carpenter's ABBA standom comes into full bloom on Man's Best Friend, which draws distinct influence from the lush white European pop of the '70s and '80s. There are shades of “I've Been Waiting For You” on “We Almost Broke Up Again Last Night,” while “Nobody's Son” plays like a love letter to the Swedish pop industry, somehow nodding to “One of Us,” Ace of Base's “The Sign” and Jens Lekman's “The Opposite of Hallelujah” in equal measure.

Then there's “Goodbye,” the album's triumphantly acerbic closer, which channels “Voulez-Vous” and the hearty chug of “Take a Chance on Me.” If Carpenter wants to stay in this lane for a while, there's still plenty of weird ABBA music from which to mine inspiration: personally, I'd love to hear her take on “Visitors”-esque paranoid coldwave.

If Man's Best Friend sounds different than other Carpenter records, that might be because it's largely played with live instruments. There are synths and programmed drums on songs like “When Did You Get So Hot?” and “House Tour,” but for the most part, “Manchild”—a country stomper that sounds a little like the members of a sorority house trying to play Fleetwood Mac's “The Ledge” from memory—wasn't a fakeout. Jack Antonoff, one of Carpenter's main collaborators here, brought in the members of Bleachers to play on nearly every song; his regular collaborator, Bobby Hawk, contributes strings, while lap steel legend Greg Leisz, a presence on everything from Lucinda Williams' Car Wheels On A Gravel Road to John Mayer's Sob Rock, plays guitar and phin – a kind of lute! – on “Manchild”. The result of all those extra hands is an album that sounds totally distinct from Carpenter's other albums, and most other pop records released this year.

Rubberneckers hoping that Man's Best Friend was going to be a salacious tell-all about the dissolution of Carpenter's relationship with the actor Barry Keoghan will likely be disappointed: there are few lyrics on the album specific enough to ascribe to any one person, although I admire the desperation of the Genius commenter who has suggested that the line “the one that rhymes with ‘villain'”, on “Go-Go Juice” could be about him. (This would require a gross mispronunciation of either Keoghan or villain.) Even so, there's plenty of brokenhearted insight to be found on Man's Best Friend, from the adage that “A girl who knows her liquor is a girl who's been dumped” to the iconic lyrics of “We Almost Broke Up Again”: “You say we're driftin' apart/I said ‘Yeah, I fucking know'”.

“Just thought that he eventually would cave in, rеach out/But no siree, he discovered sеlf-control” (“Nobody's Son”)

“Abstinence is just a state of mind” (“Never Getting Laid”)

“Now I'm at the prospect convention” (“When Did You Get Hot?”)

“Got a soft spot for a bev' and a boy that's fruity” (“Go-Go Juice”)

“Yeah, I spent a little fortune on the waxed floors/We can be a little reckless 'cause it's insured” (“House Tour”)

If you're an indie rock band, especially a British one, and you make it big, it's probably because of That Song. The one you play at every show; the one people's parents know. You don't like this song anymore, if you ever did—it's not daring musically or lyrically, nor particularly difficult to perform. When you play it, it's with an air of faux reluctance, of being above it all. You might not even bother singing—the crowd is doing it for you.

Wolf Alice don't, at time of writing, have this song. Their biggest to date is “Don't Delete the Kisses,” but if that's naïve it's self-consciously so. Crowd-friendly grungy turns, like debut single “Fluffy”—“I'd sell you my soul just to get me somewhere”—are far too honest to come off as arrogant. There's no prototypical Wolf Alice song because all their best are about reaching beyond the self, beyond home (London, North), maybe toward someone, maybe just taking a leap, always measuring the distance between what you are and what you could choose to be. Autofiction and Miranda July have, appropriately, come up in press for the band's new record, The Clearing. But not every experiment can be a revelation, and high aspirations have left past albums feeling a little patchy.

The stakes for this fourth LP, then, are the same as they've been since the first: adored locally, incredible live; could this album make them huge? Well, it's a glitzier production than any past release, but it's sometimes unsatisfying in the way shadow puppets are: big, strong shapes missing an essential depth. Opener “Thorns”—rich, bitter—continues the self-inquiry with melodrama, strings, and a looping refrain about making “a song and dance about it.” “Bloom Baby Bloom” is higher-energy, more shrink-wrapped than you'd expect from the band, but grounded by Ellie Rowsell's acidic singing. There are grunts, a soft count-in, a snarl; the song is wearing out its own ambition, a theme for the whole album, but the sentiment has its wings clipped. The song's sharpest couplet—“Look at me trying to play it hard/I'm so sick and tired of trying to play it hard”—to cite the band itself, isn't loud enough.

Producer Greg Kurstin's work with Adele explains all the piano, but he's also co-written and produced the sorts of pop songs that play with indie rock fans: You can hear the relentless play-punch of “Famous” by Charli XCX all over The Clearing, and the funky ease of Carly Rae Jepsen's “Boy Problems.” Both of those Kurstin productions bumped shoulders with Wolf Alice on my teenage playlists.

The more decisive (and nostalgic) pop tilt means The Clearing isn't ever forgettable. “Passenger Seat” and “Bread Butter Tea Sugar” definitely vindicate that approach. But not everything does. “Just Two Girls” starts playfully, but folds into too much repetition and rhyme; “Leaning Against the Wall” is a good song unfairly marred by a digital drum track, then inexplicably killed with a brutal on-off fizzle. By the final song, “The Sofa,” loungey instrumentation feels like an intrusion. The song's about choosing comfort over Californian ambition, but it's not clear who the message is for: “Sofa” nods British, but clarifying where Seven Sisters is—“North London, oh England”—betrays lingering American concern.

The band sounds bigger than ever. Quips like “Feeding me charm/In miniature measures” are characteristically witty, and charismatic performances lift even the simplest lyrics. “White Horses,” on which drummer Joel Amey sings breathlessly about family, feels genuinely fresh, and it's a highlight because it's just the four of them: Amey, Rowsell, bassist Theo Ellis, and guitarist Joff Oddie, tight-knit as ever. But everywhere you look, sharp edges are sanded down, reverby soundscapes reined in, static hums bucked. There's not a trace of grunge here, and plenty of barks that never become bites. Wolf Alice don't need to be abrasive—some of their best songs are glossy and tender—but no definitive edge fills the vacuum, and it makes The Clearing a shade too polished.

Wolf Alice have been UK rock's saviors-in-waiting for a decade now, but going from promise to product—from prospect to standard-bearer—means trying to please a lot of people all at once. The Clearing shoots for timelessness by hedging its risks, buttressing any heights, making sure we don't get lost. There are still some brilliant moments, but safety is hard to fully fall for. When I called my mum last week, she mentioned getting into a new song, one I might know: “The Sofa,” by Wolf Alice. Didn't they used to be on a poster by my bed?

Mothball the cardigans, fluff the feathers, and zhuzh the tulle. lowercase is OVER. It's all names in lights now. Letters 10 feet high, blazing wattage, full razzle dazzle. The showgirl was back even before Earth's most famous fiancée ordained it in her new album title: extroverted triple threats hitting every single base, their turbo charisma shaking off the fetid blanket of the pandemic years and smashing through flattened platform hell. Add CMAT to their number. The Irish musician born Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson is a born entertainer: a ham, a wit, a diva who pioneered the bold art of bum cleavage at last year's BRIT awards. Awe-struck critics have deemed her every cheeky festival performance this summer a heist, a runaway bolt for the big leagues after several years on the slow burn.

A while before “going Nashville” became pop's default, CMAT was making her name on showstopping Celtic country numbers. In her early 20s, she was depressed, recently single, working as a nightclub shots girl, and trying and failing to make hyperpop to indulge her Charli obsession. She suddenly found her focus by writing the tearcatcher “I Wanna Be a Cowboy, Baby!” “And I feel bad, 'cause I didn't cry/When someone I grew up with died/But I break down every time I'm on the scales,” she sang, minting her knack for self-aware tragedy, and, in its swaying chorus, for classic melodies. “Cowboy” was the highlight of her 2022 debut, If My Wife New I'd Be Dead. A year later, Crazymad, for Me upped the hit rate with the brilliantly blousy John Grant collaboration “Where Are Your Kids Tonight?” and jaunty fiddle kiss-off “Have Fun!” These songs showed an artist who had the voice of a barmaid Adele, the rhinestone cool of latter-day Jenny Lewis, and comedic chops all her own. “Huh, silly bitch, woo!” she trills in “Have Fun!”, realizing what a sucker she was for giving her ex all her cash.

Her third album in four years, EURO-COUNTRY, is the first to fully realize CMAT's poly-threat potential. The songwriting packs a new punch and a ferocious sense of yearning. It mixes so many layers—humor, devastation, irrational rage at seeing celebrity chef Jamie Oliver's face everywhere, politics, a distinct Irishness that has nothing to do with Claddagh rings and splitting the G—and pretty much nails them all.

CMAT coined the title EURO-COUNTRY as a literal descriptor of her sound, a reference to her home country, which became one of the first nations to adopt the Euro currency, in January 1999, and to how capitalism breeds isolation. This is an almost impossible needle to thread, and the title track (and first proper song) does it beautifully. It works at surface level as a sweeping ballad, the bittersweet chorus of “my Euro-Euro-Euro-country” serving both as a tribute and a lament. This huge song also reveals CMAT as a master of lyrical economy as she outlines the impact of growing up through the “Celtic Tiger” period of rapid economic growth in the late '90s, when Ireland was transformed into a wealthy nation thanks in part to foreign investment and low corporate taxes. It didn't last: It collapsed during the financial crash, leaving a trail of destruction. In a few brief, matter-of-fact lines, CMAT covers how colonization and globalized ambitions stripped away Irish identity; how political corruption and financial failure blighted the country with unfinished “ghost” housing estates and an epidemic of male suicides: “I was 12 when the das started killing themselves all around me,” she sings. The song bears so much weight and tells us exactly who she is: “And no one says it out loud,” she sings, “but I know it can be better if we hound it.”

EURO-COUNTRY is rich with disappointment, but it never stops CMAT looking for something better, from herself and the world. She shows you how good it could be in the insane opening run of songs that follow the title track. “When a Good Man Cries” showcases what a characterful singer she is, defeated then blazing, in a furiously soulful, Celtic-tinged middle eight, as she castigates herself for becoming the thing she hated. (“The people's mess/Dunboyne Diana,” is classic CMAT, nodding to her hometown.) “The Jamie Oliver Petrol Station” builds like a rickety piano being dragged behind a speeding truck as she grapples with why the naked chef has become the target of her pointless loathing, and reminds herself, in a fantastically terraces-worthy shouted chorus, “OK! Don't be a bitch! The man's got kids and they wouldn't like this!” “Tree Six Foive” darkens into a brisk, beautifully orchestrated (and line dancing-primed) rejection of “the man who was embarrassed by me when the clock struck 12” one New Year's Eve.

And in “Take a Sexy Picture of Me,” she gets the last laugh over the bottom-feeders who made such awful comments about her appearance on a BBC livestream that the broadcaster had to suspend them. Winsome country soul with a little Winehouse in its wiggle, it's an enticingly light-touch run through a lifetime of trying to live up to impossible standards, from being “9 years old, tryna wax my legs with tape” to being seen by men as washed up at 27. In lesser hands, the sentiment would thud like an Etsy slogan mug on an “I woke up like this” coaster. In CMAT's, contorting yourself to please others becomes the perfectly silly and comically tragic nursery rhyme “I did the butcher/I did the baker/I did the home and the family maker,” complete with a splendid little dance that made the song a deserved TikTok smash.

EURO-COUNTRY mellows out a little after this point, dwelling on alienation and the sense of moving through life as a non-player character, in lovely, largely acoustic songs that can't hope to hit as hard as the album's first half. It peaks again when CMAT digs beyond old anxieties of being 23, when “everyone is having fun except for me” (“Coronation Street”), to observe herself unsparingly. The raw, spotlit “Lord, Let That Tesla Crash” remembers a late friend who she can't let herself miss because “my memories are loaded with what I wanted/But I couldn't have with you,” so she fixates her pain on the showy car parked outside their old place instead. And “Running/Planning” should have been the closer (over the epilogue-like jazz club oddity “Janis Joplining”), a devastated portrait of a relationship she knew could never be, imagining a news chevron telling everyone “that I'm not good enough for you.” The chorus of “I keep on running, planning, running, planning” builds from a gutting mantra that tries to keep its cool, to a yell, furious that no amount of scheming could ever be enough.

It gets at one of the beautiful paradoxes of EURO-COUNTRY: the dissonance in listening to CMAT's songs detailing her self-doubt and perceived insufficiencies compared to the confidence and verve she delivers them with. It's a lonely album with a whopping heart, a hungry siren call for connection. “Ready” says it best: another gorgeous yearner, this time unpicking the lie that a woman must mercilessly improve herself before she dares to show the world her face. Who needs perfection when you can stick on a few tooth gems and a ritzy outfit? Like any true showgirl, CMAT makes you believe transcendence is possible as long as the spotlight and sequins are on.

August 29, 2025

On the afternoon of August 3, a few hundred people gathered at the Nursery, the intimate outdoor extension of Brooklyn's stylish Public Records, to hear DJ Sprinkles. I think it's fair to say most of us knew what to expect: Sprinkles, an alias of queer producer and cultural critic Terre Thaemlitz, blends deep thoughts and deep house into languorous, embodied critiques of everything from Madonna's use of Vogue culture to British trade union organizing to laws restricting public dancing in Japan, where Sprinkles lives.

A typical Sprinkles production, like the ones Sprinkles expertly faded that afternoon into other artists' downtempo jazz tracks and house shufflers, is long, nine or 10 minutes or more; and hazy, abandoning typical dancefloor strategies of build-and-release in favor of dubby immersion. We needed this escape: It's been a hot, complicated summer in NYC, during which our current mayor and many of the city's largest media, art, educational, and political institutions have thrown themselves under Trump's autocratic steamroller, while a promising segment of city voters has thrown its support behind one of the only American politicians to oppose Israeli's genocidal campaign against the Palestinian people, the Democratic Socialist campaigner Zohran Mamdani.

A lot of us at the Nursery were on drugs; a lot of us were dancing; some of us were cruising or dodging exes or catching up with old friends. There was a bro next to me talking too loud and fist-bumping people, and there was another person who told me that the bro had never seen Sprinkles before and thus didn't know what to expect, and I told him I wished he'd shut the fuck up and listen. It was so hot that day, and the thing about Sprinkles on the dancefloor is you sort of experience a dissertation and dissociation at the same time, and I didn't want to miss it.

Also on August 3, Al Jazeera reported that Israel, backed by the U.S., had murdered 62 Palestinians since the dawn of the previous day. More than half of them had gone to the aid distribution site that Israeli authorities told them to, and had been shot there while trying to get food for their families. These dead join the tens, possibly hundreds of thousands of Palestinians killed by Israel (with U.S. political and financial backing) since October 7, 2023, when Hamas and other groups launched a murderous and terror-filled campaign against attendees of the Nova music festival and residents in other parts of the country. In America and some other places, talking about the Palestinian dead has cost people their jobs, their ability to travel, their freedom. And the deaths just keep on coming.

That afternoon, these two timelines—us in the Nursery; Israel's ongoing massacre in Palestine as a response to murders at a dance-music festival—synced up about halfway through Sprinkles' set, when the beat dropped out and, instead of typical house vocals urging us to feel it, voices began talking about genocide. A tearful young woman with an American accent told Norman Finkelstein, the Jewish American political scientist and author, that his criticism of Israel and its genocide was disrespectful to Jews who lived under the Nazis, and he fired back that playing the “Holocaust card” wouldn't shut up a person like him.

In another, longer sample, the physician and trauma expert Dr. Gabor Maté repeatedly refuted a questioner's insistence on unsubstantiated allegations that Hamas committed mass rape, and criticized her description of Arab people as “animals.” The sample climaxed with him saying, “You and I don't live in the same world.” Sprinkles ran the phrase through a delay, so it echoed. It drifted over the rolling couple making out in the front, one person's back against the speaker so their bodies vibrated. It rippled over those of us stilled from dancing; it waved solidarity to those of us who agreed and waved goodbye to those of us who walked out, whether in disgust or boredom or thirst or whatever; it circled the perimeter where people were smoking, calling them in. Some cheers joined its echoes, some rumbling murmurs, and soon the beats were back.

Now, what happened in the Nursery reappears, remixed and expanded, as an astonishing mix for Resident Advisor. It forgoes standard mix narratives of dancefloor epiphany or genre exercise. It's not the kind of hour you'll probably want to party or fuck to. Despite its stunning arrangement of downtempo and ambient tracks, it's no afterparty comedown. Instead, it makes an argument that our relationship to Israel needs to change, and, in its deployment of DJ tactics like selection and sequencing, creates conditions in which you can feel that change become possible.

Despite her consistent political engagement, Sprinkles is hardly an earnest producer; fittingly, then, the mix starts with bitter irony. Ocean sounds bring to mind Ibiza, Miami, the Orb; Israeli podcast veterans Two Good Jewish Boys (Naor Meningher and Eytan Weinstein) caustically describe what they see as their country's blithe dismissal of Palestinian suffering; those waves suddenly remind us that Gaza is a beach. These kinds of audio puns—later in the mix, following a discussion of annexation, Sprinkles transforms jazzy guitar picking into an allusion to frontier cowboy music, and a noodly trumpet solo into a terrifying echo of martial calls into battle—are, in their own strange way, generous.

If you can make these connections, he seems to say, you can handle what's to come. Which include: Holocaust survivor Stephen Kapos thinking through who gets to remember the Holocaust and how, and former IDF combat soldier and sergeant Eran Efrati ruminating on the damage mandatory military service inflicts not just upon those the soldiers brutalize but upon the soldiers themselves. Sprinkles chooses these sources and edits them with the same care they apply to the musical beds they prepare for them, which range from mournful, twinkling expanses by Susan Alcorn and Bing & Ruth to the rougher pastures of Vladislav Delay, whose clicks and cuts in this context sound just like glitches in the matrix.

Maté's words form a climax in this mix, and, just to be sure you don't miss them or mistake what she's up to, Sprinkles doubles the vocal track, either saying the words along with him or running his voice through echo. “My emphasis on critical Jewish voices,” Sprinkles told RA, “is not intended to minimize or distract from the voices of Palestinians and others suffering under Israel's attacks.” For those perspectives, I would suggest tuning in to the essential work of Radio Alhara and artists like Bashar Murad. “Focusing on Jewish critical voices,” Sprinkles continues, “also complicates likely accusations of anti-Semitism.” I don't know if this will work. But it's an opportunity for DJs to consider the relationship between their source material and their audience. Why use recordings of Jewish speakers but not Jewish musicians? Why are DJs who play white producers' sampling of Black musicians often more successful than those DJs who play the originals? Or cis producers playing music that lifts from trans modes of cultural production, like ballroom? What do we want from our DJs, and will it make the bros stop talking if they give it to us?

In work including the epochal album Midtown 120 Blues, Sprinkles has long interrogated the idea of the dancefloor as a site of liberation. Freeing your ass won't make your mind follow. Further, in a moment when despair is a rational reaction to a livestreamed genocide, listening to music can feel futile, or worse. In what might be the mix's most shocking moment, though, a cynic like Sprinkles drops Billy Paul's psyche-funk ode to hope “I See the Light.” The epic track is a synecdoche to the mix itself, or maybe its beating heart. It's a moment in which you experience Paul changing, so you can do it too. The song, like the mix, is not medicinal. It won't make you feel better. But it tells you the truth: We live in different worlds, but can hear each other at the same time. Like two records segued up. We're all mixed up in them, together.

Correction: A previous version of this review stated that Norman Finkelstein's parents were killed in a concentration camp. This is not true, and has been removed.

	Hours before releasing her latest album, Sabrina Carpenter gave listeners a fair warning: “The album is not for any pearl clutchers.” Today, the pop star officially released her highly anticipated, not-for-prudes seventh studio album, Man's Best Friend.


	The 12-track album opens with the LP's first single, “Manchild,” and concludes with the song “Goodbye.” The music video for the record's second offering, “Tears,” also dropped at midnight. The album features writing and production credits for Carpenter, Amy Allen, Jack Antonoff, and John Ryan across all of the tracks.


	Carpenter caused a hubbub after she shared the album art of her kneeling next to a figure in a suit who's grabbing her hair. She's since released several other versions of the art for vinyl variants and cassettes. “Here is a new alternate cover approved by God,” she joked about one.


	The singer-songwriter celebrated the album's release with a Spotify-hosted fan event at Hollywood Forever Cemetery, where she answered questions about the LP before the Audrey Hepburn film Sabrina played.

	Ahead of the album's release, Carpenter posed for the cover of Rolling Stone and spoke at length about her journey to the new record. Antonoff also told Rolling Stone that he thinks the album is “some of the most honest work I've ever heard.”


	The album, Carpenter explained, “wasn't written from a place of ‘How do I one-up myself?' or ‘How do I re-­create something else?'” About her previous record, Carpenter said, “Short n' Sweet was this magical gift; it fed me, and it fed a lot of other people in the world. It felt true to me, and it felt authentic to a lot of other people. It's rare that those line up ever, let alone more than once. It unlocked my brain to know myself more and more.”

	The 23-year-old who killed two students at a Catholic school in Minneapolis “appeared to hate all of us,” authorities said as they continued to piece together a motive for the mass shooting earlier this week.


	At a press conference on Thursday, Joe Thompson, the acting U.S. Attorney for Minnesota, said videos and writings left behind by the shooter — identified as Robin Westman — “expressed hate towards almost every group imaginable,” including Black people, Mexican people, Christians, and Jews. “The shooter appeared to hate all of us,” Thompson continued. “The shooter's heart was full of hate.”


	Thompson went on to say that the only group of people the shooter “admired” and “idolized” were other school shooters and mass murderers. Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara echoed this sentiment, saying the shooter had a “deranged fascination” with mass killings. (Thompson, O'Hara, and others declined to identify Westman or other mass murderers by name due to the way many carry out such attacks in search of notoriety.) 

	











	Authorities have yet to identify an exact motive, but Thompson said bluntly at his press conference, “The shooter was obsessed with the idea of killing children. The shooter saw the attack as a way to target our most vulnerable among us… I won't dignify the shooters words by repeating them, they are horrific and vile; but in short, the shooter wanted to watch children suffer.” 


	Two children, ages eight and 10, were killed in the shooting, while nearly 20 more were injured, most of them children. Per the latest reports, one child remains in critical condition.

	











	According to Thompson, the shooter left behind “hundreds of pages of writings,” which authorities will continue to examine and share more information from in the coming days. As The Associated Press also notes, a YouTube channel believed to belong to the shooter contained several videos (which have since been deleted). One showed weapons and ammunition, some of which had phrases like “kill Donald Trump” and “Where is your God?” written on them.

	Another video appeared to show a person pointing at the windows of a drawing of a church, then stabbing it with a knife. And one video appeared to contain a suicide note addressed to the family. In the note, the shooter confessed to having long-held plans to carry out such a shooting, while there was also talk of serious depression. (The shooter died in the parking lot from what authorities believe was a self-inflicted gunshot.)


	Authorities also confirmed that the shooter previously attended Annunciation Catholic Church's school, where the shooting was carried out, and their mother worked there. A former classmate told The AP, “I remember they had a crazy distaste for school, especially Annunciation, which I always thought was pretty interesting because their mom was on the parish board.”

	As hard as it is to believe, Sonic Youth played their final show 14 years ago this fall, instigated by the breakup of co-founders Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon. In the years since, they've each continued working on many fronts: Gordon was nominated for a Grammy this year for her solo album The Collective, while Moore has made numerous solo albums of his own, started an indie label called Daydream Library Series with wife Eva Prinz, and published a memoir, Sonic Life.


	Late last year, Moore had a brief, surprise onstage reunion with former Sonic Youth bandmates Lee Ranaldo and Steve Shelley at the New York club the Stone, playing an hour of improvised freeform music that harked back to the band's heyday. But Moore continues to move on: He's just taped an interview for Rick Rubin's podcast, and he's working on his first novel — set in early Eighties New York, with what he calls “characters and incidents I certainly felt like I could write about.”


	In news that shouldn't surprise anyone, Moore is also paying tribute to the Velvet Underground. Out today is a newly recorded version of the band's “Temptation Inside Your Heart” (an outtake first released on the VU collection), with Moore joined by his current band (bassist Deb Googe, drummer Jem Doulton, and guitarist James Sedwards) and electronics whiz Jon Leidecker. Hopping on a Zoom from his home in London, Moore talks about that Velvets cover and his own past, present, and rock & roll future.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







You're releasing this version of “Temptation Inside Your Heart” pegged to what would have been the late Sterling Morrison's 83rd birthday. What does that milestone represent to you? My wife, Eva, and I published a book, Linger On, a collection of interviews with the Velvet Underground by the Spanish journalist Ignacio Julià [through Moore and Prinz's book company, Ecstatic Peace Library]. It brought me back into thinking a lot about the Velvets. I always felt Sonic Youth was very much an island in the scene. I liked the idea of community, but also felt we kind of stood apart in some ways. And looking at the Velvet Underground, they were such a model for a band that was completely singular and genuine in the world of rock music.

	I always thought Sterling was the most mysterious member of the Velvet Underground, and I wanted to bring attention to his birthday. We know a lot about Lou. We know a lot about Nico. We know a lot about John Cale. Mo Tucker has always had social media presence. They've all told their stories in many ways. But Sterling doesn't get as much ink as everybody else in the group. He never made a solo record. Maybe he passed away too young before he could fathom such a thing.  


	I met him once at the old Knitting Factory [in New York]. He was a very sweet guy. I would have liked to have gotten to know him. Listening to the Velvet Underground records, a lot of them are Lou, certainly, but Sterling's concepts on guitar and his rhythms and melodies move the songs away from the middle ground Lou is establishing as a songwriter. Sterling was the one who brought this really artful rock & roll aesthetic into those Velvet Underground songs.


Of all the songs, what led you to pick “Temptation Inside Your Heart,” an outtake released after the band had broken up?There's a certain beatific joyfulness in that song. It's obviously a bit of a throwaway song happening in the session, with Lou sort of talking through it and asking funny asides and talking to himself back and forth. I don't make those funny asides. But when he sings “I know where the evil lies inside of your heart,” he's singing in such a sweet, crooning way. There's no nihilist energy in the song. The only nihilism is in the lyrics. It's about this shared feeling of insecurity that everybody has in their relationships to each other.


And it has a good riff.It's a driving riff, and then it has that great breakdown with the background vocals. Instead of doing background vocals on my version, I decided to replicate the background vocals on my guitar.

So you're only releasing one song? No B side?We were talking about this the other day. More people are buying streams. The idea of an A side or B side, or even a sequenced album, has become secondary, if not tertiary, to the relationship between the artist and the consumer. You tend to do more business song by song. When I put out my last record, Flow Critical Lucidity, I noticed there were people who purchased the album proper as the way I sequenced it, but more people will cherry-pick it.


Thanks to Spotify and other services, you can literally see which songs are popular and which aren't.Yeah, you can sort of see what's going on. I don't look at that stuff so much. I experience it myself when I'm investigating certain artists and look at their albums online and see which tracks on an album are more popular. It's interesting. Even if it's an album like Nantucket Sleighride by Mountain, you can sort of see that, like, “The Animal Trainer and the Road” is the big seller [laughs]. That's a great song, but that whole album is quite good.  

	











Which Sonic Youth song is the most popular in that regard?I have not looked. That's too frightening for me to even, like, think about. [Ed. Note: Spotify figures show that 1988's “Teen Age Riot” wins with 87 million streams, followed by 2006's “Incinerate” with 60 million, their version of “Superstar” from a 1994 Carpenters tribute album with 58 million, and 1990's “Kool Thing” with 57 million.] 


Speaking of Sonic Youth, how did your live reunion with Ranaldo and Shelley last December come about?That was about as much of a reunion as us having dinner together or something. It was a gig I had at the Stone, and I initially asked Lee to do a guitar duo. We've done this before in different places, and I thought it would be cool to ask Steve to play, because he's in town, and he plays drums. And I thought that would be cool. So that's all it was. But I did realize it would become a bit of a of a story, since Sonic Youth doesn't exist anymore and the fact that three of the five members [of the band's last incarnation] were together on … well, it wasn't even a stage. We were together on the floor of the Stone. We like to play improvised music, and that was just completely free improvisation.


You didn't do any “hits,” for sure.Not at all. It was advertised as just a duo with me and Lee. So when people showed up and then the three of us were there, it became a bit of a buzz. And I understand that.  


Did you feel the weight of any expectations?No. Nobody was. It's a small room. It only holds, like, 60 people or something, and it was already sold out. Nobody had any preconception of what was going on. Nobody showed up there whispering, “What's going to happen?” Afterwards, people started sharing it on social media, and it became a bit of a story, as I understand. I figured that's what would happen.


Kim wasn't there, obviously.She wasn't around [laughs]. I don't think she'd be that interested anyway. But my rapport with Steve and Lee, as far as playing in the context of free improvisation, is already pretty established.


What did it make you miss about the band?  I didn't think about that. I don't, like, miss things. I miss the future. I think about things I really want to do. And as far as music is concerned, reformation doesn't really come into it so much. We had a solid career of 30-plus years, far longer than most bands have had. And the legacy of the recordings stands on its own. I don't feel like there's anything left unsaid as far as what we were doing.

	











The sound of the four, or sometimes five, of you made was unique.Very much so. But we're all kind of long in the tooth now. I don't know if that can ever be recaptured. And I don't like the whole “re” thing, you know, reforming.


Last year, I asked Kim what it would take for her to be interested in a Sonic Youth reunion, and she said, “I don't know. It would never be as good as it was.”[Nods.] I find bands that get back together to be just an exercise. A lot of the time it's less to do with the band and has more to do with the brand. Unless it's the OG members, you know, but even, a lot of the aspects of bands that are so important is their youth. And to replicate that is a little bit like a grandmother in a mini-dress, which I don't want to be. I don't want to see guys in their seventies reform their bands from when they were in their twenties, and they still have the same haircut when they were in their twenties.


The band has regularly been approached about one-shot reunions, right?I get asked every day. We all do. It's a constant thing. I like it because I'm glad we had such an effect and left such a mark. It's almost otherworldly, in a way, because I'm so proud of it, and it's such a big part of my life experience. But it's very encapsulated. It has a great beginning and middle and end.


A pretty dramatic end, actually.[Shrugs.] You know … I think The Eternal was a really fine final statement.  


Can you see you and Kim back onstage together, even just once?I know that's a fantasy. I'm always actually very resistant to such fantasies, in a way.


I'm also wondering what you make of pop artists like Olivia Rodrigo, Sabrina Carpenter, and Chappell Roan headlining festivals like Lollapalooza, which bands like Sonic Youth once did.With rock & roll bands, it's all about the interaction a group has in their kind of family onstage. In some ways, this is the advent of the single pop star surrounded by production, whether it's dancers and lights and films and stage sets. It's become very sort of Disneyfied, in a way, and it caters to mass popularity in a way Disneyland does. It crosses over from the core rock & roll audience that would see Led Zeppelin or Pearl Jam to a concert that welcomes people who aren't that invested in rock music at all, but are invested in entertainment as a broader kind of concept. It has a broader appeal than, say, the standardized rock band. There are still rock bands, but they're not just playing Lollapalooza. They're not the success stories they once were.

	











	I think all of those musicians are completely credible. Olivia Rodrigo and Chappell Roan are great artists. I just went to see Lana Del Rey, and it was kind of amazing. There was a stage set of a farmhouse, and she was walking in and around it and had dancers everywhere, and she was using AI video. It was something to see. I liked it. I like her music, and I like what she's up to aesthetically. But at the same time, my predilection is to hear music in a much more intimate setting. I like seeing the interaction between musicians that's very organic. You know, a musician playing guitar that's plugged into an amp.


	There's still a demographic of young people interested in experimental rock music and anything that comes out of punk culture. It's not Olivia Rodrigo huge. But that was never the intention of being in a band anyway, to be on such a massive scale. To me, it was always cooler to have a modest kind of existence in that respect. The big business of rock & roll was a bit of a conflict for somebody like Kurt [Cobain] to all of a sudden be in a band that was so massive. He dealt with it in his own way, and then he didn't deal with it in his own way.


I don't know if anyone worries about “selling out” anymore the way he did.Yeah, it doesn't really matter anymore. But I would never say that Olivia Rodrigo or Chappell Roan are selling out, because what they're doing is really smart. Chappell Roan's promotion of human rights and the LGBTQ community is massive. That's amazing for her to be able to have that voice, to that many people, or for Olivia Rodrigo to talk about literature on her social media and say put your phones down and start reading a book. It's not just crass entertainment. More power to them. It's not really my kind of music. And I certainly don't strive for that kind of mass acceptance at all. I know it would be great for my pocketbook, but other than that …

I certainly don't look down my nose at any of that. It's great to be rewarded and to have people recognize you on any level. I would never denigrate that at all.

Sabrina Carpenter‘s seventh album, Man's Best Friend, is hornier than ever. The much-teased record was released today alongside the scintillating video for its second track, “Tears,” featuring Colman Domingo in drag.


	The video opens with Carpenter, dressed to kill in a pale blue skirt suit and sun hat, waking up on the ground from a car crash with her seemingly dead boyfriend in the driver's seat. She soon stumbles her way toward an incredibly abandoned-looking house in the middle of nowhere and when peeking through the door glimpses a pair of legs wrapped in fishnet stockings. Naturally, the door is suddenly ajar, and Carpenter steps through and is met by Domingo, sporting a cropped pinstripe suit and red lipstick.

	As the camera follows Carpenter through the curious halls and slanted rooms, she's met with a glittering cast of characters and deliciously chaotic surprises around every corner as she sings the chorus: “I get wet at the thought of you/Being a responsible guy/Treating me like you're supposed to do/Tears run down my thighs.” There's even a shimmying dance number with Domingo, because as the Grammy winner declares at the end of the video: “You have to give the people what they want.”

	











	During a Spotify release party for the album, Carpenter said that her creative process behind the new LP was “all about sort of embracing spontaneity, all about embracing impulses that I was having and experiences that I was having that were really urgent to write about.” She continued, “And knowing that if I didn't make this album and have it represent the chapter of my life that it represents, that it would have never been this album. It would have turned into something else, and I think that would have done it as a service to the album.”

	Last year, Earl Sweatshirt's verse on “Words2LiveBy” went viral, as some fans were perplexed to hear him rapping on such an uptempo beat. He's become known for rhyming in hushed tones over melancholy production, a sound that's birthed an entire wing of like-minded indie rappers. But that's just one part of Earl's artistic arsenal; he's shown an ability to get rhymes off on a variety of production. It feels like, from the beginning of his career, when fans (and journalists) wouldn't stop violating the then-teenage artist's privacy after he went to boarding school, too many people have perceived him as what they want him to be, instead of who he's shown himself to be. 


	The same kind of misunderstanding speckles the discourse around Live Laugh Love, his stellar new album. Many fans have made the obvious realization that his 12-track project reveals glimpses of optimism that pale in comparison to the grief and doldrums of projects like 2015's I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside and Solace. But it's not an abrupt 180, as each of his projects has gradually reflected his growth as a man with a deeper understanding of the world and his place in it. 

	











	Rap fans are eager, if not encouraged, to spot patterns, branding, and shticks to better relegate artists in the vast rap landscape. It's easy to paint Earl as someone who raps about being sad. But with each successive album, true listeners are realizing he's just been rapping about his life — sometimes there's sadness. It makes sense to have expectations of artists, and to bolster deeper connections with certain portions of their catalogs. That's become the case with Earl, especially with fans who forever champion him for songs reflecting their own battles with depression and substance abuse. Sure, Earl's darker raps might have “saved your life.” But it shouldn't have taken a sunny album title for fans to realize that with each successive album, he's come to find vaster meaning in his own.

	It's hard not to hear how fatherhood and his marriage to actress-artist Aida Osman have shaped his perspective on Live Laugh Love. On “FORGE” he raps, “Permafrost pimpin', protocol ice cold like André Benjamin/I'm playin', bae, I'm still in love with you, let's get in the tub,” a gentle moment that harkens to the kind of relationship pure enough for them to hold an impromptu maternity photoshoot in their backyard. Her presence might have also factored into him censoring the B word on “Crisco,” a song where he also delves into fatherhood, rhyming, “Eight of cups, it's time to change his stinky diapers.” (According to TarotGuide.com, the eight of cups tarot card refers to “walking away from people or situations in your life or abandoning your plans.”) Later in the verse, he raps about how his biological father essentially abandoned him, and reflects on that absence instilling him with anger and solitude, concluding, “God know my heart and that I'm out here tryna change the course, I'm working on it.” Earl has always rapped metaphorically about his life being akin to a physical journey to a certain destination (fulfillment? self-discovery?). Now, he has two more people to traverse it with.


	In 2024, he talked to Rolling Stone about “the pursuit of speaking proverbially,” a.k.a. “trying to be succinct and pack a lot into a little because motherfuckers don't have time to sit around while you try and figure some shit out.” While many rap fans would listen to him rhyme all day, he's nonetheless refined his lyricism to a point where, aside from the second verse of “Live,” which is delivered a little too sleepily to resonate, every verse is potent. On “Infatuation,” he raps, “Circumstance raised a baby to a beast/Like rain and heat raise a seed into a plant.” On “Well Done!” he raps, “Tough like rye or spelt, Orion-sized heavyweight titles on the belt, son/Flying in on the wide eye of the maelstrom, wild side that I hail from,” with a melodic cadence that drifts over Navy Blue's hard-to-catch drum pattern. Even when he's bragging on “Static,” it's delivered in metaphor and layers: “Unique offers, tell the giant I need like three from this most recent bean harvest/Geeked off it, stockpiling drip, I'm puttin' shit on like Steve Harvey.” On “Gamma (need the 3),” he gets existential while weaving in references to Roy Ayers, the late Trugoy of De La Soul, and the movie Funny Games. It's a testament to an MC's craft when he can weave wordplay in a way that furthers the overall messaging of a song, and Earl does it with deft throughout LLL.

	The 24-minute project is a breezy listen where several producers offer Earl disparate sonic approaches that allow him to explore a variety of flows. “CRISCO” shows Navy Blue dipping vocal samples into otherworldly filtering, while “gsw vs sac” is a warped, funky sample laced by producer Theravada. The latter also produced “Infatuation,” which boasts a warm soul sample.  


	We've seen so many artists at the peak of their artistry (or riches) create superfluous, feature-ridden “event albums” to insist on their superiority. But Earl shows a different kind of rap excellence on his latest album, proposing that sometimes, rap superiority can just be about a strong pen and the power of language. Breakthroughs and life lessons can be as resonant as anthemic hooks and slogans. And it can all be happening over tailor-made beats indifferent about mass appeal. Live Love Laugh is the kind of rap mastery that shuns maximalism for pristine, unadorned poetics.

Chinese scientists successfully test drone which resembles a flying spindle and represents a radical change in aerodynamic design

In 2015, a US Navy F/A-18 pilot flying off the East Coast with the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt encountered something inexplicable: an unidentified flying object shaped like a spindle, hovering above the clouds with no visible means of propulsion.

Encoded as “Gimbal”, the footage – officially declassified in 2021 – ignited global speculation about unidentified aerial phenomena and prompted serious questions about advanced aerospace technology beyond known military capabilities.

Now, nearly a decade later, scientists in China have unveiled and successfully tested a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) drone whose form bears a striking resemblance to that enigmatic object. While still at an experimental stage, this new aircraft represents a radical change in aerodynamic design that could improve endurance, stability and multi-mission versatility in uncrewed flight.

Unlike most drones, this new vehicle's airframe is centred around an elliptical, ringlike wing that integrates a straight central wing section, forming a closed-loop structure.

Four rotors are mounted at junctions between the elliptical wings and vertical stabilisers – serving both as lift generators and structural reinforcements.

At a distant glance, it resembles a flying spindle rather than a conventional fixed-wing or quadcopter drone.","{'href': 'https://www.scmp.com', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}","other"

   08:12 EDT 29 Aug 2025, updated  11:38 EDT 29 Aug 2025    By JONATHAN CHADWICK, ASSISTANT SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY EDITOR   

It looks like a giant frying pan, or a crash-landed alien spaceship. 

Whatever it is, Google Maps users are getting seriously freaked out after discovering this strange object in Antarctica. 

The round entity, described as a 'UFO', is hiding under what seems to be a cliff about 90 miles from Antarctica's coast.

With no known origin, people are questioning whether this strange relic at the bottom of the Earth is man-made – or something not of this world. 

One American ufologist suggested the object – almost Oreo-like in appearance – might be stuck under the rock. 

Alternatively, it could be deliberately half-hidden – strategically-placed to make it difficult to spot – as it carries out a mysterious assignment. 

Scott C. Waring, who runs the UFO Sightings Daily website, posted a YouTube clip of the sleek disc being found on Google Maps. 

He said: 'The UFO is still there! Too hard to recover or still being used?' 

On Google Maps, the unusual structure can be located simply by entering the coordinates in the search bar – 66°16'24.5""S 100°59'03.5""E. 

As users can see, it is around 45 miles from Mill Island, a domed ice-island 30 miles long and 18 miles wide, close to the Antarctic coast. 

It is also about six miles away from the A. B. Dobrowolski Polar Station, an occasionally active Polish research base. 

Intriguingly, the object seems to have a sliverish line going around the rim, which corresponds with traditional depictions of UFOs from pop culture. 

But otherwise, it has a consistently uniform black colour, which very clearly contrasts with the jagged rock and snow surrounding it. 

Although heavily pixelated, the image also reveals peculiar black lines stretching between the disc-shape and the adjacent rock. 

Philip Mantle, a British UFO researcher, called the disc 'a new one for me', adding that he'd 'never seen it before', but declined to speculate on what it might be.

UFO stands for 'unidentified flying object' and so the term doesn't necessarily describe an object with an extraterrestrial origin. 

Social media commentators have been describing it as a crashed spaceship, a weather balloon or a secret base.  

More realistic suggestions include an unusually symmetrical lake or pond, or some sort of geological formation. 

Alternatively, it could be a bit of equipment related to a nearby Polish polar research station. 

In his post on his UFO Sightings Daily website on Wednesday, Mr Waring said this UFO was discovered about two years ago, but in fact some people spotted it years earlier. 

On Reddit four years ago, someone posted a screenshot with the caption: 'Any thoughts on the UFO “crash” site in Antarctica?' 

The post received several interesting suggestions from users, who variously described the disk as a 'weather balloon', a 'Nazi base' and a 'pond of meltwater'. 

One commentator said: 'If I had to ditch an advanced spacecraft on a populated planet, I would put it down on an unpopulated continent, and wait for rescue', while someone else joked: 'So that's where my giant pancake ended up after I threw it out the window...' 

Another simply posted 'Antarctica got some weird stuff', while another said it 'looks ominous'. 

Professor Bethan Davies, a glaciologist at the University of Newcastle, said that the feature is simply a 'small lake in a rock basin'. 

'There is a small patch of snow and the warmer lake water has a lower albedo so it absorbs more solar radiation,' she told the Daily Mail. 

'This is melting the snow, giving it the semi circular arc – not a UFO.' 

Laura Gerrish, mapping specialist at the British Antarctic Survey, said: 'From the satellite imagery, this round feature looks like a small lake. 

'This area is called the Bunger Hills, which is a largely ice-free region along the Knox Coast in Antarctica - and it has lots of small lakes and ponds. 

'We see that the lakes often form these very smooth edges along the edge of the ice.' 

It's far from the first time that strange features located on Google Maps have gone viral. 

In April, social media users were captivated by a triangular tower stationed at Area 51 in the Nevada desert.

The imposing structure's location led conspiracy theorists to speculate that it is somehow involved in alien contact.

However, there was a rational explanation for the tower – not to do with aliens or global warming as people speculated.

This followed a structure in a mountainous region of New Mexico taking the internet by storm, sparking claims of UFOs.

Meanwhile, a 'doorway' spotted in Antarctica, just southeast of the Japanese-run Showa Station, sparked a similar wave of theories across the internet, with one describing it as 'bigfoot's vacation home'.

The Pentagon has released information on what the most commonly reported UFO looks like. 

Based on clues from reported sightings between 1996 and 2023, the typical UFO has a round shape, usually described as spherical or an orb, with a white or silver colour, often translucent. 

It also has a size of between 3 and 13 feet (1 to 4 metres) and usually travels through the air at a height just below commercial passenger planes. 

Most UFOs (28 per cent) have been sighted at altitudes of around 20,000 feet - just under commercial air traffic.

Around 10 per cent have been reported at just 5,000 feet - around eight times as tall as Seattle's Space Needle and three times as tall as New York's One World Tower.

Meanwhile, 16 per cent have been described as having lights. 

UFO stands for 'unidentified flying object' and so the term doesn't necessarily describe an object with an extraterrestrial origin. ","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

Emma Stone has faced plenty of supernatural experiences through her roles in movies like Spider-Man and Zombieland, but during a recent interview she revealed her belief in otherworldly beings goes beyond the big screen. 

The actor shared her thoughts during an interview at Venice Film Festival, where she spoke to reporters about her latest sci-fi-comedy movie, Bugonia.

The movie follows two men who are obsessed with conspiracies, who become convinced that the CEO of a major company - played by Stone - is actually an alien who wants to destroy Earth.

Advert

Looking to bring her down, the men, played by Jesse Plemons and Aidan Delbis, then proceed to kidnap the boss.

Naturally, this plot led some reporters at Venice on to the topic of aliens, and Stone decided to share her thoughts loud and clear.

“Yes, I'm coming out and saying it,” she said “I believe in aliens!”

Stone explained her reasoning, telling the crowd that she'd been inspired by astronomer Carl Sagan, who is known for his research on the possibility of extraterrestrial life.

Advert

The La La Land actor said: “One of my favorite people who has ever lived is Carl Sagan and I fell madly in love with his philosophy, science and how brilliant he is.""

Stone indicated she shared in Sagan's stance on aliens, pointing out that to believe that our world is the only one with life is pretty big-headed of us.

She said: “He very deeply believed the idea that we're alone in this vast expansive universe - not that we're being watched - is a pretty narcissistic thing.”

Advert

One reporter also jokingly asked Stone how she manages to live in the spotlight as a celebrity without 'turning into an alien' herself, to which the 34-year-old took a leaf out of Bugonia's book.

“How do you know I'm not an alien?” she responded.

Stone continued: “I think there's a tricky aspect to that answer that's probably longer than anything that anyone would want to listen to right now. I think everyone sort of deals with that now.

Advert

""We all can relate to that feeling of someone thinking they know you, feeling like you don't have much control of the avatar outside of me. Because there's me, and then there's me, here.

Series finales can be tricky even for shows with the kinds of fanbases who have stuck around through thick and thin, and I would still say that Supernatural's ending is one of the most controversial genre finales of the last ten years. Now, with the stars busy in the 2025 TV schedule and the 20th anniversary of the series premiere approaching, showrunner Andrew Dabb reflected on the storyline that he thinks really might have ruined the series if the writers had gone in that direction.

While fans can always debate whether or not Sam and Dean got happy endings with their reunion in the afterlife at the end of the series finale, I'm guessing many will agree with the showrunner that the scrapped storyline probably wasn't needed at any point in the fifteen seasons. (All fifteen are available streaming with a Netflix subscription now.) Speaking with TV Insider, Andrew Dabb said:

One story line we always talked about, which we never did was basically Sam and Dean go public. They're like, ‘Look, we're putting out a PSA. Monsters are real. If you see something, something shows up in your town, it's a monster. We can't be everywhere. We're just going to get the word out there.'

The Winchester brothers may have had a pretty sizable network of allies by the end, but they definitely never went public with a PSA. I could have imagined it happening in a dream sequence, meta episode, time travel storyline, or even parallel world that no show could pull off quite like Supernatural did, but not in the main canon of the show. And that's saying something, since the main canon of the show once de-aged Dean for an episode and made him a Taylor Swift fan! Dabb went on:

It would've kind of blown up the show in a very odd way. But that was always something I was like, ‘They probably should do that, you know what I mean? Just share some information, share it around.' But again, a little logistically difficult for the show.

Sam and Dean passed plenty of what then seemed like points of no return over the years, but it might have taken an intervention from Chuck/God at his most powerful to make that storyline logistically feasible. The showrunner clarified that the storyline would have been in a finale, and I'd say that would be an even bigger finale cliffhanger than that time Castiel died (again). Andrew Dabb explained why this really would have been going too far:

Suddenly, Sam and Dean are known worldwide, which, again, I think sounds interesting in theory, but I actually think would've destroyed the show. It would not have been any good, which is one of the reasons we didn't do it.

Short of a Supernatural revival, that storyline will likely never be explored for Sam and Dean Winchester. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles weighed in on a revival potentially happening someday, with Padalecki doubling down on the idea of returning for a limited series. Ackles thought that the show might have been R-rated on a streamer, and he could see perks of keeping it ""like a broadcast show."" Andrew Dabb had his own take, comparing the future of Supernatural to Buffy the Vampire Slayer and The X-Files.

The odds of the Supernatural world returning via a spinoff don't seem great either. The Wayward Sisters series never got off the ground despite featuring some fan-favorite Supernatural characters and getting a backdoor pilot, and The Winchesters only lasted one season. For now, fans can always go back via Netflix and rewatch any of the 300+ episodes of the original series, none of which involve the boys issuing a PSA about monsters.","{'href': 'https://www.yahoo.com', 'title': 'yahoo.com'}","other"

Elizabeth Klarer wtih a bust of her intergalactic lover, Akon.

As scientists try to make sense of 3I/Atlas - the mysterious object hurtling towards Earth - it's unleashed fears of an alien invasion and brought back to the surface numerous supposed alien abduction cases that have never been disproved.

An American couple, Betty and Barney Hill, went to their deathbeds convinced they were abducted and probed by aliens and had their memories of the 1961 encounter erased.

Closer to home, Elizabeth Klarer of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands even wrote a book about her intergalactic romance with a starship commander who got her pregnant in 1959.

These two alien abduction stories are among dozens that have resurfaced as people ponder whether there could be any truth behind their extraordinary experiences, now that 3I/Atlas - bigger than Mount Everest - hurtles toward Earth in a way scientists describe as ""not natural"".

This image from NASA shows the fast-moving interstellar object that has got many to wonder about alien encounters that have been reported over the years.

The object is moving at a speed of 209 000 kph, and has no tail, a telltale sign astronomers say distinguishes it from a comet.

It was first picked up by a telescope in Chile and then photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope a few weeks ago.

This visitor is bigger, faster and behaves differently from the two previous visitors to our galaxy -  Oumuamua and Borisov - and is shielded behind the sun as it hurtles in our general direction.

Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University thinks the visitor is unlikely to be a natural object and believes governments around the world should formulate a treaty so they know how to handle a possible hostile alien invasion.

Klarer had no such negative thoughts. For her, it was all about peace, love and understanding - things she tried to convey from her lover from the planet Meton in the Alpha Centauri System, according to earlier reports by ""Independent Media"".

Klarer, who was a meteorologist, claimed to have had the most intimate encounter with extraterrestrials, writing in her book ""Beyond the Light Barrier"", published in 1980, that she bore a son with her alien lover, Akon.

Klarer claimed her sightings at what became known as Flying Saucer Hill were witnessed by a Zulu manager, Ladam, as well as her sister, May, on the family farm in Rosetta.

Various articles in the ""Sunday Tribune"" over the years reported that on April 7, 1956, she visited the hilltop again after further reports from her family that Zulu workers had seen the ""lightning bird"" appear there again. 

This time, Akon took her aboard his scout ship, a craft some 18 m in diameter, before transporting her to the cigar-shaped mother ship.

During the encounter, kisses were exchanged, and he told Klarer that she was a reincarnated Venusian and a long-lost soulmate. 

He further explained that they occasionally took women from Earth as partners, as the offspring strengthened their race. He also claimed that several Venusians were living among us. She was returned to the hilltop thereafter.

In 1959, Klarer claimed she visited Meton with Akon, orbiting Proxima Centauri, where she gave birth to their son, Ayling, before returning to Earth because the planet's vibrations played havoc with her heart.

Klarer's main thrust throughout her life, and in the pages of her book, she strived to convey a message of peace, love, understanding and environmentalism, which she credited to the superior wisdom of an advanced and immaculately utopian Venusian civilisation.

Klarer often commemorated the April 7 anniversary of her union with Akon by returning to Flying Saucer Hill, sometimes aided by others as she grew frail.

Her interstellar love story inspired a stage production, and Jimmy Neversink even penned a tune on the unexplained affair across the Universe.

When this reporter covered Klarer's funeral in Pietermaritzburg in February 1994, her sisters expressed profound loss, but were also at peace now that her battle against scepticism had come to an end. 

One, however, twirled her index finger about her head, indicating that her youngest sibling may have had a mental health issue.

Betty and Barney Hill claimed they were abducted by aliens in 1961 while returning home from a visit to Niagara Falls.

In the case of the Hills, hypnosis was used to try to make sense of what had happened to the New Hampshire couple on September 19, 1961. 

They were on their way home from a trip to Niagara Falls when they saw a string of bright lights in the sky. The couple claimed that they were rendered unconscious by a group of humanoids who approached them when Barney got out of the family car, armed with his pistol, soon after a craft, measuring 12 meters across, blocked their path.

What they did recall was waking up not far from the car. Betty's smart court shoes had been badly scuffed on the toes, as though she had been dragged there. Both their watches had stopped and never ticked again.

After the troubling incident, Betty drew a star map which closely resembles actual star placements which were only discovered by astronomers a decade later, indicating that their alleged abductors had come from Zeta Reticuli.

Media coverage turned the Hills into celebrities, spawning a 1975 made-for-television film starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons.

Betty's subsequent dreams showed a strong correlation with details Barney shared under hypnosis.

However, in both cases, there was never enough evidence to conclusively prove their abduction story, nor to disprove it as a mere fiction.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Psychic","The CIA Watched Him Bend Reality With Just His Mind—Then Tried to Turn His Consciousness Into a Weapon","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a65932697/cia-psychic-espionage-secrets-revealed/","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 16:43:00 GMT","

Scientists saw the impossible inside a shielded lab. The U.S. goverment tried to turn it into a weapon. 

IN 1972, AMERICAN ARTIST AND PSYCHIC INGO SWANN altered the magnetic field inside a thickly shielded vacuum container located underground for several seconds—by simply thinking about it. 

As Harold Puthoff, a physicist with the Stanford Research Institute, witnessed the output from his magnetometer changing, he was mind-blown. There was no physical explanation for the reading changing the way it did. And as soon as Puthoff asked Swann to stop thinking about the apparatus, the unexplained changes in the magnetic field abruptly stopped.  

“These phenomena are real. Psychic phenomena are real,” Dean Radin, Ph.D., chief scientist at the California-based nonprofit Institute of Noetic Sciences, tells Popular Mechanics. He's been examining parapsychology, or the study of psychic events, for the past four decades.

And in the early 1970s—in the midst of the Cold War against the Soviet Union—the U.S. government agreed. 

By the time Puthoff and his colleague Russel Targ, another physicist at the Stanford Research Institute (now known as SRI International), presented their results at an international meeting on quantum physics and parapsychology, the CIA had already begun working with SRI to perform top-secret research on paranormal phenomena—primarily “remote viewing” for intelligence collection. Remote viewing refers to a type of extra-sensorial perception that involves using the mind to “see” or manipulate distant objects, people, events, or other information that are hidden from physical view. 

By the mid-1980s, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) took the program over, calling it “Stargate.” DIA had three main goals for its research: 

The program was about as clandestine as it gets. Radin, who served as a visiting scientist on the Stargate program, says security personnel would brief him and his colleagues about the incredible sensitivity of their highly classified work every two weeks, and ask them if they had any reason to believe that anyone outside of the project knew anything about it. 

“You had to become a professional paranoid, essentially. It was very uncomfortable for me,” Radin says.

He remembers asking one of his supervisors what would happen if they had a breakthrough—say, coming up with a drug to make someone super psychic. The response was immediate. “It would disappear and you would never be able to talk about it again,” Radin recalls, “which is antithetical to the whole scientific process, but I also understood why.” Any weapon or intelligence tool developed under Stargate would have presumably been too valuable and too dangerous for public release. 

The DIA continued the project until the mid-1990s, when the CIA began declassifying its documents on remote viewing research to facilitate an external review of the project, and the DIA quickly followed suit. In June 1995, the CIA asked The American Institutes for Research (AIR)—an Arlington, Virginia-based nonprofit tasked with evaluating and providing technical assistance in behavioral and social science research—to conduct an external review of the Stargate program.   

To present a balanced review of the scientific credibility of the program, AIR asked two researchers with opposing perspectives on parapsychology to write the report: Jessica Utts, Ph.D., an accomplished statistician and now professor emerita at the University of California, Irvine, who views parapsychology as a promising science; and Ray Hyman, Ph.D., a renowned psychologist and now professor emeritus at the University of Oregon, who is a noted skeptic and critic of parapsychology. 

“They sent us these boxes full of reports and papers and told us we had one summer to write this report,” Utts tells Popular Mechanics. She and Hyman separately reviewed dozens of Stargate experiments while also taking into account data from the broader scientific community at the time. 

The reviewers' individual conclusions were as expected. Utts found the statistics compelling, and believed the studies provided strong evidence that remote viewing is a human capability. One of the things she found most convincing was that the results seen across studies in different laboratories were all very similar. “And it was all statistically significant,” she says, “so that's really hard to explain by chance, or cheating, or coincidence, or fluke.” 

To that extent, Hyman agreed with Utts, but it wasn't enough to convince him that remote viewing is real. He found what he considered to be potential flaws in the experimental methods, such as using the same person to judge psychic ability in each trial, and determined that the experimental results were not consistent enough with experiments outside the program. Nonetheless, he wrote in the final report: “The case for psychic functioning seems better than it ever has been. The contemporary findings along with the output of the [Stargate] program do seem to indicate that something beyond odd statistical hiccups is taking place.”

Despite what may be viewed as an optimistic review, the Stargate program no longer exists, and as far as we know, the U.S. government hasn't continued such research. “I'm sorry it ended, because I really do think that there's much more to be discovered there,” Utts says. 

But maybe it hasn't ended. Maybe it's just top secret. Only a true psychic would know.

Ask most NFL fans what they think about referees, and they'll likely say that the refs have it out for their team. Or the officials don't know what they're doing. And they definitely want the Kansas City Chiefs to win.

Well, NFL fans, ESPN ran the numbers, and as an overall trend, these theories just don't stand up.

To assess whether officiating is routinely impacting game outcomes, ESPN compiled every penalty that referees called in regular-season and postseason games between 2001 and 2024, the type of penalty assessed, when it occurred during the game, and which team went on to win. ESPN also compiled every challenge a head coach made in the regular season from 2010 to 2024 as noted in official NFL Game Books. Dr. James J. Cochran, professor of applied statistics in the Culverhouse College of Business at the University of Alabama, helped ESPN run an analysis.

Here's what the numbers say:

More-penalized teams do not lose more often.

In the fourth quarter and overtime, teams that commit penalties that lead to large yardage swings or first downs -- defensive holding, defensive pass interference, illegal contact and offensive pass interference -- tend to win more often than when they don't commit those penalties.

Coaches' challenges have decreased by 47% since 2010. In the 2024 season, challenges led to overturned calls about 38% of the time, the lowest success rate in five years.

Data did not show that specific officiating crews were biased against particular teams in upholding or reversing challenges, or that less experienced crews routinely had more reversals.

Of the current head coaches, Nick Sirianni and Andy Reid were most successful at using their challenges. Jim Harbaugh and Sean McDermott were the least.

While some teams were penalized more than others during a single season, the number of penalties called against individual teams evened out over multiple seasons, according to ESPN's analysis. Being penalized more -- in individual penalties or yards -- did not mean more wins or losses.

""It tells us that we do not have evidence of any systematic bias in penalties called in the NFL over the past several years,"" Cochran wrote in an email. ""I am sorry for the fans who believe the NFL referees are biased against their favorite team, but it isn't so.""

Fox rules analyst Dean Blandino, who was the NFL's vice president of officiating from 2013 to 2017, said the league's own analyses over time also found that penalties were not a ""major factor"" in wins and losses. Actions such as turnovers had a greater impact.

""I always said that to coaches. I was like, 'Listen, you can have a year where you were on the wrong end of a bunch of calls,'"" he said. ""Over time, it tends to even out. It just does.""

One limitation in the dataset -- and it's a big one for the conspiracy theorists out there -- is that it does not include non-calls, when fans, analysts, reporters, coaches, players, etc. believe that a penalty should have been called or that coaches missed opportunities to challenge plays.

There are also plenty of angst-ridden fans who believe certain officiating crews are biased against their team -- or just aren't very good at their jobs. Using our database of coach challenges combined with data on officials and their years in the league, ESPN assessed numbers around reversed calls -- including the makeup and average years of experience of the officiating crew reversing the call. The numbers showed no bias or pattern.

""It all seemed random,"" Cochran said.

As ESPN and Cochran analyzed the data, one significant relationship emerged around what we'll call impact penalties. ESPN looked at all games in which a team incurred any of four types of penalties that lead to large yardage swings or first downs -- defensive holding, defensive pass interference, illegal contact and offensive pass interference -- in the fourth quarter or overtime of regular-season and postseason games. Of those games, it examined how often a team won versus how often it lost.

Over the past five seasons, the numbers show something unexpected: Teams were overall more likely -- about 54% -- to win games when they committed an impact penalty late in the game than they were when they did not. Overall, in games where they committed those penalties, 23 teams won more often than they lost.

From a statistical standpoint, Cochran said that relationship was significant. The same trend held true overall going back to 2010, even though rule changes, penalty enforcement and coaches have changed substantially over that time.

This may seem counterintuitive. ""You would think the opposite, right?"" Blandino said.

But Cochran suggested that teams that commit those game-changing penalties in the fourth quarter and overtime could be rewarded for more aggressive play. ""Maybe that is generally a winning strategy,"" he wrote in an email.

Teams could incur offensive pass interference penalties near the end of the game ""because they are losing and they are desperate to try to make a big play to come back in the game,"" said Warren Sharp, an NFL analytics expert who runs a betting information site.

It's more likely that the team that is behind near the end of the game is throwing the ball, and the team that is ahead is then more inclined to commit a defensive pass interference or defensive holding to prevent the offensive team from scoring, according to NFL officiating analyst Joe Gibbs (no, not the Hall of Fame coach), who contributes to Sharp's site. Whatever position or yardage lost is worth it.

Blandino pointed to the successful Seattle Seahawks teams of the 2010s, who had among the highest volume of fouls in the defensive backfield, such as illegal contact and defensive holding, ""because they played more aggressively.""

""There's definitely times when you're playing the clock more than you're playing anything else in certain games,"" Sharp said.

""If you can commit a penalty that prevents the other team from having a bigger explosive play ... they don't put the time back on the clock. So they go downfield for a 10-second play, with a minute left in the game, and you're tackling those guys so they can't get a big 20- to 30-yard gain,"" he said. ""Ten seconds run off the clock and now they get a first-and-10... but it's only 5 yards closer and it moves the ball from their 25 to their 30, you'd trade that all day.""

In recent years, the NFL has continually expanded its use of replay assist, where officials in the stadium and at the league office monitor plays to help on-field officials make the right call and avoid stopping the game to review the play. Designed to decrease the time spent on debated calls, one of its main effects has been to reduce the number of times coaches challenge a call.

Since 2010, the number of coach challenges has dropped by about 47%, and while there hasn't been a lot of variability in their rate of reversals, the percentage has generally trended down. In 2024, 50 of the 133 coach challenges resulted in reversals.

That is exactly the trend the league wants to see, according to Mark Butterworth, NFL Vice President of Replay Training and Development.

""In a perfect world, we would have less replay challenges either from the booth or from teams because through assisting, we're cleaning up more and more and then keeping the game moving,"" Butterworth said. ""It's that relentless pursuit, every play, to make sure we have it right. ... The hope would be that when coaches challenge they would have a lower reversal rate.""

An NFL spokesperson told ESPN that the league used replay assist more than 300 times in the 2024 season. The increase in replay assist has not caused a significant decrease in replay challenges by NFL league officials in the booth, according to ESPN's analysis. But their success rate has improved dramatically, from 25% in 2010 to 76% in 2024. The league attributes that increase in part to better camera technology and a growing number of reviewable plays.

After expanding the list of fouls and plays that can be reviewed by replay assist in 2021 and 2024, NFL owners voted again in April to include fouls such as grabbing a face mask, horse-collar tackles and tripping.

Butterworth said 90% of replay assist interventions are for line to gain for both first downs and the goal line, catch/no catch calls, down by contact, and flag pickups -- when officials negate a penalty. He suspects flag pickup interventions will increase this season with the additional plays and fouls that can be reviewed.

Green Bay Packers head coach Matt LaFleur supported the increased usage of replay assist.

""I know you guys cringe every time I pull that red flag out, so the less I have to do that, the better I guess,"" he said.

Washington Commanders head coach Dan Quinn said he believed the increased use of replay assist would decrease the number of challenges. ""It will speed up that process and will also help a lot with spotting of the football,"" he said.

Replay assists are not consistently noted in Game Books, and while Butterworth said the league is working to better track them, it does not plan to publicly release detailed statistics. However, he said replay assist interventions will be noted more prominently during broadcasts so people know when they are being used.

Blandino said he welcomed the increased information. ""The more transparency you have, I think the less these conspiracy theories live, and I think there is less angst and negativity around officiating,"" he said, adding that replay assist also takes away some of the subjectivity.

""I always told people, I said, you're giving us way too much credit. To think there was a coordinated effort with all these people and everybody on the same page to be able to say, 'We want the Patriots and the Giants in the Super Bowl' ... it's impossible to create a scheme that is going to allow for that.""

However, some fans have speculated that replay assist could be used to fix games or to help a favored team win, Sharp said. ""But if we're watching it on TV and it's pretty clear that this shouldn't have been called, I don't care if they fix that in the course of action and don't go to the sideline to review it,"" he said. ""Let's just keep the game going, but get the call right.""

Broncos coach Sean Payton would go even further with making the decisions known. ""Why not put the video on the process, let fans, everybody, hear the discussion, open the windows? What's the downside?""

The worst challenge San Francisco 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said he ever made was against the Indianapolis Colts in the pouring rain at Levi's Stadium in October 2021. Colts running back Jonathan Taylor rushed for 3 yards on fourth-and-1 but appeared to fumble the ball. Shanahan threw the flag.

As he did, an assistant pointed out that another Colts player had recovered the ball. Shanahan tried to call it back, but the officials told him they had to play it out. ""It was just two minutes of embarrassment,"" he said.

Despite that call, Shanahan is among the more successful current coaches when it comes to challenges, with a nearly 50% success rate, according to ESPN's analysis. Those with under four years of NFL head coaching experience were excluded because of the lack of data.

Going back to 2010 in ESPN's database, individual coaches showed patterns over their years in the league, in terms of the frequency of their challenges as well as their success rate.

Shanahan told ESPN that challenges are sometimes ""educated guesses"" and his success rate is due to ""better camera angles"" and not letting ""your emotions get involved.""

Quinn remembered challenging an incomplete pass ruling against the New York Giants last season in Week 9. He won the challenge, and the call was reversed and changed from an incomplete pass to a fumble that was recovered by the Commanders, who took possession and drove to their first touchdown of the game. They went on to win 27-22.

""This was a great example of our process working well and our players playing through the entire play in order to give us a chance to successfully win the challenge,"" Quinn told ESPN.

Payton said he thinks there are two types of challenges: Ones where there is great video and others where he goes by instinct because of a lack of clear evidence. ""I'll hear 'not enough' from the booth,"" he said. ""But I'm becoming more educated and more aware of even if I get it right, does it justify a challenge in that moment?""

LaFleur had a simple answer when asked if he regrets any challenges.

""Yeah, every one you don't win.""

When Taylor Swift announced news of her engagement to NFL star Travis Kelce earlier this week, there was one group in particular that was left devastated. 

'Gaylors', as they have become known in the Swiftie fandom, have speculated for years that the singer secretly likes women - and that her various relationships with men have been a cover-up. 

Over the years, these wild conspiracy theories have suggested that Taylor had romantic relationships with the likes of Glee star Dianna Agron and model Karlie Kloss, insisting that Taylor's close friendships with her female friends have actually been something more. 

The theory first gained traction in 2014 when a grainy picture emerged on social media appearing to show Taylor and Karlie kissing at a 1975 concert. 

However, the Love Story singer has previously confirmed she is 'not part of' the LGBTQ+ community and even appeared to deny the rumours when she released 1989 (Taylor's Version) in 2023. 

As Taylor is known for leaving 'Easter eggs' in her songs and photos, her song lyrics have often been cited in the Gaylor debate (which combines 'gay' and 'Taylor'), with fans claiming her lyrics signify she is lesbian, bisexual - or not straight in some form. 

Since news of Taylor's engagement this week, the Gaylor community has gone into meltdown - but still the rumours have not been quashed, with some even claiming her relationship with Travis is 'PR' to cover up her true identity. 

One person said: 'Oh Christ, happy for her but this is the worst news of my life. Worse than my grandad dying.'

Another added: 'I'm speechless and disappointed. All of her sapphic references for what?' 

A third said that Taylor and Travis would be having a 'lavender marriage' (where one or both partners are queer) and are still 'bearding' (a partner used to conceal a person's true sexual identity).

Referring to Taylor's engagement caption, one Gaylor theorist said: 'I mean, TECHNICALLY... she didn't say SHE was getting married. Just that some gym teacher somewhere was marrying an English teacher!

'For all we know, she just wanted an excuse to wear the actual wedding ring she got from her actual WIFE!' 

Hyper-analysing Taylor's engagement photos, showing Travis down on one knee in his garden, one fan even said she was wearing 'black and white stripes... like she's in jail'. 

The Reddit thread r/GaylorSwift, a community which has racked up more than 50,000, has now changed its status to private following news of the engagement.  

A description of the group reads: 'Welcome to the original Gaylor subreddit, reveling in queer & sapphic analysis since 2018! 

'We're a space for thoughtful discussion and examination of Taylor Swift, including queer readings, themes, and motifs in her work and public persona.'

The 'Swiftgron' theory has fuelled speculation that there was once romance between Swift and Glee star Dianna Agron. Pictured in 2014

This week, Taylor announced her engagement to NFL star Travis Kelce (pictured) - but still this has not put the rumours to rest

The 'Gaylor Swift' subreddit community, which has more than 50,000 members, has switched to private this week

Swift has previously been romantically linked to Harry Styles, Conor Kennedy, Jake Gyllenhaal, Lucas Till, Cory Monteith, Joe Jonas, John Mayer, Calvin Harris, Tom Hiddleston Joe Alwyn, Taylor Lautner, and most recently, Travis Kelce, to whom she is now engaged. 

But the Gaylor community maintains that many of these relationships have been the result or a PR strategy, or covering up of her true identity. 

The theory first entered into the mainstream fans speculated they could see Taylor and her former best friend Karlie Kloss kissing in a blurry picture from a 1975 concert in 2014. 

At the time, a spokesperson for the performer was quick to nix the rumor to Gossip Cop, branding it 'hilarious.'

Swift and Kloss' worlds first collided in 2012 when the Mean singer admitted to Vogue that she 'love[s]' Kloss and wanted nothing more than to 'bake cookies with her!'

Kloss got wind of the compliment and tried to get the ball rolling on a future hangout by tweeting out: 'Hey @taylorswift13 love the @voguemagazine cover! Your kitchen or mine? :)'

They were first photographed together in November 2013 when the Grammy Award-winner served as the musical entertainment for that year's Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, which Kloss walked in.

Their friendship continued to grow in 2014 as they embarked on an epic cross-country road trip and enjoyed countless nights out in New York City. The duo even got ready together for the 2014 Met Gala, which they documented on Instagram.











Since news of Taylor's engagement this week, the Gaylor community has gone into meltdown

They were clearly close: Swift revealed to Rolling Stone that Kloss even had her own room in her NYC apartment that was decorated with pictures of the model and included a basket of her favorite Whole Food treats by the bed.

In November 2014, the besties shared an epic runway moment as Swift performed at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show for a second time.

They held hands while making their way down the catwalk and shared several fun moments throughout the televised show.

In 2015, they took their friendship to a whole new level, when they teamed up to pose for a joint Vogue cover in February 2015.

'People had been telling us for years we needed to meet,' said the Pennsylvania native.

'I remember makeup artists and hair people going, 'Doesn't she remind you of Karlie? God, she and Karlie would be best friends. They're the same.'

Kloss also made a cameo in Swift's Bad Blood music video in May 2015, alongside the likes of Gigi Hadid, Martha Hunt, Cara Delevingne and Lily Aldridge.

Since 2017, the pair's friendship appears to have cooled off - as Kloss was spotted in the crowd at Taylor's Eras Tour in 2023, and didn't appear to have been invited into the VIP tent with the singer's closest friends. 

Taylor and Karlie Kloss were best friends for many years, but fans long speculated there was something more between them

The pair would often share pictures of each other on Instagram, but their friendship appeared to cool off from 2017

Kloss got engaged to business man Joshua Kushner in 2018 and they held two wedding ceremonies in the summer of 2019 - both of which Swift failed to attend.

The guest list included the likes of Kloss' manager Scooter Braun - who, at the centre of Taylor's dispute over her Masters recordings, is widely considered to be her nemesis.

Another central 'Gaylor' theory focuses on 'Swiftgron' - the friendship between Taylor and Glee actress Dianna Agron. 

Fans first speculated that Agron, 37, and Swift, 33, were romantically involved when Agron was mentioned on the liner notes for Swift's song 22 from her 2012 album Red. 

Both Swift and Agron were friends around the time Red was released in 2012, with them both sharing photos from Shirley MacLaine's 78th birthday party, where they both dressed up in costume.

They also shared photos from Agron's own circus-themed birthday bash, which Swift said was, 'the most magical night.'

A few years later, Swift gave Agron a shout-out at the 2014 American Music Awards, when she received the Dick Clark Award for Excellence.

Meanwhile Wonderland, from 1989, contains the lyrics 'I fell down the rabbit hole' - which fans claim is a reference to Diana's old Tumblr blog - and 'you flashed your green eyes at me', also claimed to be a reference to the actress. 

To a lesser extent, fans have also theorised about a potential romance between Taylor and English model Lily Donaldson. Pictured together in 2013

When Taylor sings she was 'too in love to think straight', one fan claimed they could see the 'queerness' in her lyrics, adding: 'This is all consistent with a closeted queer relationship.' 

During an appearance on the Jimmy Kimmel show in 2012, Dianna accidentally added fuel to the Gaylor fire. 

As Kimmel enquired about her love life, he made reference to the pop singer when he asked: 'Are you dating her? That would be great.'

To which the actress, who plays Quinn Fabray on the hit show, replied, 'Wouldn't that be juicy?' before turning to the camera, blowing a kiss and purring, 'Hi, Taylor.'

During a wide-ranging interview with Rolling Stone, Agron opened up about the rumors of romantic speculation.

When asked if she was the inspiration for 22, Agron said, 'Me? Oh, if only! That's more because of a friendship than being the inspiration for the song. But I would not be the person to ask about that. I cannot claim that!'

She was also asked about rumors that she was in a romantic relationship with the songstress, responding, 'That is so interesting. I mean there have been many stories about my dating life that have been wildly untrue.'

To a lesser extent, fans have also theorised about a potential romance between Taylor and English model Lily Donaldson, with some believing the song 'Gorgeous' is about her, and speculating that Lily's snake jewellery could be a reference to the Reputation album.

Fans also see Lover, Folklore and Evermore as break-up albums about the relationship.  

In 2014, Swift tweeted a request that as a '25th birthday present from the media' that she would like people to 'stop accusing' her of dating all her friends. 

In 2023, when releasing her 1989 album, she appeared to address the rumours again, writing: 'I swore off dating and decided to focus only on myself, my music, my growth, and my female friendships.

'If I only hung out with my female friends, people couldn't sensationalize or sexualize that right? I would learn later on that people could and people would.' 

The Cats actress explicitly told Vogue in 2019 that she was 'not a part of' LGTBQ+ community, but was passionate about speaking up for the community. 

'I didn't realize until recently that I could advocate for a community that I'm not a part of, she admitted. 'It's hard to know how to do that without being so fearful of making a mistake that you just freeze. 

'Because my mistakes are very loud. When I make a mistake, it echoes through the canyons of the world. It's clickbait, and it's a part of my life story, and it's a part of my career arc.'

Even amid Taylor's outright denials of the rumours, fans have continued to analyse her lyrics for any hidden signal that she may not be straight. 

Fans have also theorised some of Taylor's songs originally had different lyrics. Pictured: Lyrics to The Very First Night; Swifties have highlighted in red the lyrics they believe were originally intended

One song used in Gaylor theories is The Very First Night, released as a vault track on Red (Taylor's Version), released in November 2022. 

The 'vault tracks' were written by Taylor at the time of the album's original release, but did not make the final cut for the album. However, many have since been added to Taylor's re-recorded albums as a thank you to fans for their support. 

In the track, Taylor sings: 'Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture / They don't know how much I miss you.'

However, people have since speculated that the lyrics were originally supposed to read 'I miss her', in order to rhyme with 'picture' from the line before. 

'It was definitely meant to be 'how much I miss her'' one person said on the Reddit forum.

They added: 'It's almost painful to force out that you when it is in a rhyme sequence with 'whisper' and 'picture'. And she doesn't even say 'miss ya'. It's miss you. It isn't natural for her songwriting process.' 

A second added: 'I think it's one of the most brilliant and meta things she's ever written, no one knows how much she misses her because she doesn't actually say it.' 

Others believe Swift swapped a lyric from Reputation track New Years Day from 'I want your midnights' to 'I want her midnights' during a 2019 performance at the Time100 gala. 

Taylor's You Need To Calm Down (pictured) song from 2019 makes multiple references to the LGBTQ community

At the same time, Swift teased an upcoming announcement for April 26 - Lesbian Visibility Day - leading fans to speculate she would be coming out. However, it turned out to be an announcement for the lead single of her album, Lover, called 'ME!' 

When Taylor released You Need To Calm Down in 2019, LGBTQ advocacy group GLAAD saw a spike in donations. 

The song contained multiple references in support of the community, including: 'Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)' and 'control your urges to scream about all the people you hate / Cause shade never made anybody less gay.'

In 2024 the New York Times ran a near 5,000 word opinion piece speculating on Taylor's sexuality, titled Look What We Made Taylor Do. 

Shortly afterwards, an anonymous source described as 'close to the situation' told CNN that the allegations were 'invasive, untrue, and inappropriate'.

The insider told the outlet: 'Because of her massive success, in this moment there is a Taylor-shaped hole in people's ethics.

'This article wouldn't have been allowed to be written about Shawn Mendes or any male artist whose sexuality has been questioned by fans.'

'There seems to be no boundary some journalists won't cross when writing about Taylor, regardless of how invasive, untrue, and inappropriate it is - all under the protective veil of an 'opinion piece'. 

On Tuesday, Taylor announced her engagement to Travis Kelce after a secret proposal earlier this month 

Swift captioned the post: 'Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married'

On Tuesday, Taylor announced her engagement to Travis Kelce after a secret proposal earlier this month. 

The pop icon and the NFL star, both 35, who have been dating for two years, officially revealed their marriage news on Tuesday with a romantic engagement photoshoot showing Kelce proposing in a rose garden.

Swift captioned the post: 'Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.'

The Grammy winner also revealed her mammoth diamond engagement ring in the post - the stunning band is an Old Mine Brilliant Cut and appears to be from Kindred Lubeck at Artifex Fine Jewelry. It is worth an estimated $675,000 to $1 million.

The star shared the post on her Instagram, set to the ballad So High School, which is about her enduring love for Kelce.

The couple went public with their relationship in September 2023 when the singer appeared alongside Kelce's mother, Donna, at a Kansas City Chiefs game.

Since that day their romance has captivated the world, with Swift supporting Kelce's run to two Super Bowls while the NFL star has traveled alongside her around the globe on her wildly successful Eras Tour.

Alexis Wilkins, the longtime girlfriend of FBI Director Kash Patel, is suing an ex-agent and self-described whistleblower for defamation, alleging he called her a former Israeli spy whose relationship with Patel is a ""honeypot"" operation.

The defendant, Kyle Seraphin, ""has maliciously lied"" about Wilkins by ""falsely asserting that she—an American-born country singer—is an agent of a foreign government, assigned to manipulate and compromise the Director of the FBI,"" Wilkins' attorney wrote in the lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court in Austin, Texas.

Wilkins accuses Seraphin, a conservative podcaster who calls himself a ""recovering FBI agent,"" of ""using this fabricated story as self-enriching clickbait.""

Wilkins is seeking at least $5 million in damages. The suit was first reported by Reason and highlighted Friday morning by Court Watch.

Her legal complaint homes in on Seraphin's comments on ""The Kyle Seraphin Show"" on Aug. 22.

Patel ""has had his own little 'honeypot' issue that's been going on of late, so we're just going to acknowledge it real publicly,"" Seraphin said on the episode at the center of the lawsuit.

""He's got a girlfriend that is half his age, who is apparently is both a country music singer, a political commentator on Rumble, a friend of John Rich through [FBI deputy Director Dan] Bongino, who also now owns a big chunk of Rumble, and she's also a former Mossad agent in what is like the equivalent of their NSA.""

""But I'm sure that's totally because, like, she's really looking for like a cross-eyed, you know, kind of thickish built, super cool bro who's almost 50 years old who's Indian in America,"" Seraphin said sarcastically.

""Like it has nothing to do with the fact that uh we're really close to the Trump administration,"" he said. ""Anyway, I'm sure that's totally just like love. That's what real love looks like.""

Seraphin did not identify Wilkins by name, but her suit says his statement is ""obviously about her specifically.""

Wilkins, 26, said her long-term relationship with Patel, 45, began in January 2023 and has been public knowledge. Patel was confirmed as FBI director in February.

Seraphin, discussing the lawsuit at length on his show on Friday morning, noted that similar claims about Wilkins have previously surfaced in social media posts that have generated significantly more attention than his comments did.

By calling her a honeypot, Seraphin is suggesting that Wilkins is ""an agent of a foreign government who began a relationship with another for purposes of manipulating and compromising them,"" the lawsuit says.

""He is accusing Ms. Wilkins of being a spy for a foreign government, conducting espionage to undermine our national security and/or to manipulate federal law enforcement at the highest level, and even committing treason,"" her lawyer wrote.

""Ms. Wilkins is not even Jewish, much less Israeli, and has never set foot in Israel ... The notion that her relationship with Dir. Patel is part of some plot against her country is vile and ridiculous.""

Seraphin, on his show, said he never made those claims.

The suit argues that since Seraphin ""trades on his experience"" as a former FBI counterterrorism agent, he cannot claim that he comments were mere hyperbole.

It also notes that Seraphin met with both Patel and Wilkins ""at a conservative political event roughly two years ago,"" before he was confirmed as FBI director.

Seraphin said on his show Friday morning that he had no recollection of having met them.

NBC News reported in January that Patel had reached out to Seraphin and two other conservative former special agents prior to being nominated to lead the FBI.

Patel ""keeps tabs on me and the guys that he's helped out, and also we share information about FBI stuff,"" Seraphin told NBC at the time.

MOSCOW, August 29. /TASSA/. Future security guarantees for Ukraine should not be a condition for negotiations, but the result of a peaceful settlement, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said at a briefing.

According to the diplomat, Vladimir Zelensky continues to sabotage the negotiations on Ukraine and continue the conflict, while the words he chooses mirror those used by leaders of terrorist cells of the past.

TASS has compiled key statements by the official representative of the Foreign Ministry.

- Zelensky undermines the talks: ""Zelensky continued to take steps leading to the sabotage of the peace negotiation process and escalation of the conflict. On August 21, he told foreign journalists about Kiev's refusal to legally recognize the territories irretrievably lost by the clique, repeating his delusional maxims about their occupation.""

- Zelensky's statements look eerily similar to those of terrorist leaders of days past: ‘He announced some surprises for the Russians and expressed hope for the presence of Canadian forces in Ukraine. The maple supporter of military intervention backed this idea, continued this idea, and promised to allocate $500 million for drones under the American arms purchase program. This refers to the list of priority requirements for Ukraine. And you know what's amazing? It's amazing that the vocabulary, well, I'm not talking about facial expressions at all, but Zelensky's vocabulary completely repeats the vocabulary of the leaders of terrorist cells of the past.""

- Future guarantees of security to Ukraine should not be a condition for negotiations, but the result of a peaceful settlement, taking into account the root causes of the conflict: ""It is necessary to understand that provision of security guarantees is not a condition, but the result of a peaceful settlement based on eliminating the root causes of the crisis in Ukraine. That, in turn, will guarantee the security of our country.""

- The West's security guarantees proposals for Ukraine are directed against Russia and can only lead to destabilization: ""By their very nature, based on the rudiments of colonial thinking, the guarantees of so-called security that are being discussed in Europe, of course, are not such, as they lead to the degradation of strategic stability at the regional and global levels.""

- Moscow proceeds from the fact that ""the options offered by the collective West are one-sided, built with the obvious expectation of containing Russia.""

- In Brussels, the cessation of oil supplies to Hungary and Slovakia after the attack of the Ukrainian army on August 14 and 22 on the Druzhba pipeline on the Russian territory is not considered dangerous for the EU: ""It is noteworthy that in this context, the Ukrainian media are replicating the position of the European Commission, which, in response to a request, informed that in Brussels - just think about it - they do not see any danger to the European Union from the cessation of oil supplies to Hungary and Slovakia. I would like to ask: is this any way to act towards your colleagues in the European Union? It seems at this point you've already turned against your own members. Now it turns out that you are not in favor of the economy, now it turns out that you are in favor of making it worse for those who are inside your European structure.""","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Hernán was at the Latin American restaurant that he owns with his brother in the Northwest quadrant of Washington DC last week when his staff started getting phone calls and messages about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) checkpoints in the neighborhood. The employees, scared that they might be targeted and racially profiled, asked if they could go home.

Within hours, Hernán had to close their doors, and the restaurant hasn't been open since.

“Literally after President Trump brought the national guard on DC, everything stopped,” said Hernán, who requested his last name not be used due to fears of Ice retaliation. “Everything disappeared because the bike delivery guys, they're scared. They're not on the streets right now. My people, most of my cooks are Spanish[-speaking] and they don't want to go to DC right now.”

Hernán, who also owns a restaurant in Maryland, said he was hoping to be able to reopen in a few weeks if and when the Trump administration's takeover of the DC police ends and immigration enforcement arrests become less frequent. But the future is unclear for him and many restaurant owners in the US capital.

Already suffering from fewer customers due to the administration's almost three-week-long crackdown, restaurants are also having to contend with staff shortages because many immigrants, both documented and undocumented, fear coming into DC and being on the streets, and some have been detained by Ice.

Trump has attempted to claim that the crackdown is benefiting restaurants. “Half the restaurants closed, because nobody could go, because they were afraid to go outside,” he told reporters on Monday about Washington before his intervention. “Now those restaurants are opening and new restaurants are opening up.”

Across the city, the opposite is true. Some restaurants, like Hernán's, have had to close their doors. But more have had to make do with fewer workers, fewer delivery drivers and fewer customers.

“Restaurants will close because you have troops with guns and federal agents harassing people … making people afraid to go out,” José Andrés, the well-known Washington restaurateur, wrote on social media.

Immigrants account for 253,000 workers, or 36% of the workforce, in DC's restaurants, hotels and related sectors, according to Migrant Insider, which cited data from FWD.us. Included in that total are 42,000 self-employed immigrant entrepreneurs running local food and service businesses.

Maketto, an Asian restaurant and marketplace in north-east DC, posted on social media on Monday that its immigrant workers had been affected.

“Last week, two of our beloved team members were detained while simply walking home from work,” the restaurant wrote. “They remain in custody, and our hearts are with them and their families.” The restaurant did not respond to a request for comment.

Hernán said the pause in business was incredibly hard on a small, family-owned business, especially after the slow summer months. He's looking for people who live in DC, speak Spanish and English, and are willing to come into work so that they can reopen. “But I don't know if we can find people,” he said.

About a mile away, near the Columbia Heights neighborhood, a sign in Spanish on the door of Elizabeth Pupusería & Deli hung up last week read: “We are closed temporarily during the terrible situation in our larger neighborhood. We hope to serve you again soon. Let's take care of ourselves and stay safe in our homes.”

Elizabeth Rodriguez, a Salvadorian immigrant who owns the restaurant and has been in Washington for roughly 20 years, told the Guardian that the restaurant was fulfilling some orders that prior customers call in, but its doors were not open to the public.

“It's a very ugly thing because the nerves, the nerves go up,” Rodriguez said in Spanish about the situation in DC. “The clients don't come for the same reason. Our business relied on construction workers because they are the big groups that came to bring various orders for all their colleagues. And they haven't worked all month.”

She said she paid her workers collectively about $500 a day, and after Trump's crackdown on 11 August, she was only bringing in $300 a day. She hasn't been able to pay any of her staff these last two weeks – only she and her daughter-in-law are coming in.

“We are seeing what we can do so as not to close definitively,” she said. “I know that it is only supposed to be one month, but suddenly it is very complicated because the rent, the bills, you have to pay them the same.

“We are asking God for this to change because if we don't, we can't pay many months of rent,” she added.

The restaurant doesn't typically allow delivery, but Rodriguez is thinking about changing that if it reopens because so many people don't want to leave their homes. But even that is difficult, she said.

“Today I said, ‘Today is the right time to add delivery,' so I called DoorDash and he told me that he doesn't have workers because most of them have been taken and others are afraid to leave.”

Ice has reportedly been targeting delivery drivers on mopeds, worsening the crisis for restaurants.

Several videos of Ice detaining delivery drivers have spread across social media, and the Washington Post reported, citing anonymous police sources, that Ice is accompanying officers with DC's Metropolitan police department to conduct traffic stops of moped drivers to check their immigration status.

“You don't want to go outside,” Yonatan Colmenarez, an asylum seeker who came from Venezuela two years ago and has driven a moped around DC, told the Post. “It gives you a kind of emotional damage; you're not sure who they might be.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Michael Bloomberg and anti-DEI pundit Bill Ackman are just two of the many billionaires showering cash on Cuomo.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

As the housing crisis and wealth inequality emerge as top issues for voters in New York City, mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani has called for higher taxes on the rich to pay for services and famously suggested that billionaires should not exist. Mamdani's viral campaign handily defeated Andrew Cuomo, New York's former governor, in a Democratic primary earlier this year. As expected, billionaires and billionaire-owned companies such as Airbnb and DoorDash are now spending big to defeat Mamdani and influence the race. 

An analysis of new campaign finance filings by influence trackers at the nonprofit public interest research organization LittleSis found that multiple billionaires and their companies have funneled more than $19 million into political action committees (PACs) that support Cuomo or oppose Mamdani and other candidates. With names such as Fix the City, Inc. and Affordable New York, such super PACS provide a vehicle for elite New Yorkers and corporate interests to influence public opinion on the race. 

For example, the short-term rental company Airbnb reported a $5 million donation to Affordable New York, a group that has spent heavily on city races and reported spending $1.3 million opposing Mamdani and his progressive ally, city comptroller Brad Lander. According to SEC filings, Airbnb's three billionaire co-founders —  Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk, and Joe Gebbia — collectively control 79 percent of the voting power at the company. Venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, backed by billionaires Michael Moritz and Douglas Leone, holds a further 10 percent. 

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

Airbnb and other short-term rental companies with a similar business model face backlash from tenant unions and housing advocates for contributing to a historic housing crisis in New York City and across the country. Like in other cities, regulation of short-term rentals is a hot button issue in New York, often pitting tenants against landlords, homeowners, and tourists.   

In contrast to the list of more than a dozen billionaires lining up behind Cuomo, Mamdani, a democratic socialist and state assemblyman, has benefited modestly from the support of a single billionaire known for supporting education reform and LGTBQ rights. Elizabeth Simons, a hedge fund heiress and bilingual educator, gave $250,000 to the pro-Mamdani PAC New Yorkers for Lower Costs. The group has spent $921,045 supporting Mamdani and $426,835 opposing Cuomo, according to LittleSis. 

Even as pundits attack Mamdani for his comments on non-local topics such as Israel's bloody occupation of Palestine, his proposals for freezing rent prices and raising taxes on the richest 1 percent to boost public transportation and other services have exhilarated many working and middle class voters. Indeed, in the Democratic Party primary for the mayoral race, Mamdani earned 56 percent of the ranked choice vote, despite being a relative newcomer to city politics, promptly terrifying New York City's real estate lobby and the billionaire class. 

PACs receiving donations from billionaires also spent campaign cash during the Democratic primary to defeat progressive Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller who is allied with Mamdani, and his predecessor, Scott Stringer. Stringer and Lander dropped out after Mamdani upset Cuomo in the primary by a 12-point margin. 

At 33 years old, Mamdani is making a splash in the national media and maintains a solid lead in most polls. However, Cuomo has decided to run as an independent and stay in the mayoral race, which remains competitive as outside money flows in. 

Also running as an independent is incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, whose reelection campaign has been marred by corruption allegations that led to investigations and criminal charges against at least 10 of the mayor's aides, appointees, and associates, according to ABC News. Adams was charged with covering up bribery and illegal campaign contributions in September 2024, but the Justice Department dropped the federal charges under President Donald Trump, who has pressured Adams to comply with his brutal crackdown on immigrants. 

Adams denies any quid pro quo for the dropped charges and rejected Trump's call to deploy National Guard troops in New York City this week as the president continues to scaremonger about “crime” as a pretext for military deployments in major cities. Adams also apologized to New Yorkers for the scandals surrounding his tenure in an interview on August 27 but maintained that he has not broken the law. 

Local activist Curtis Sliwa is running for mayor on the Republican ticket. Along with Adams, Sliwa is lagging behind Mamdani and Cuomo in the polls. 

Perhaps the most visible and influential billionaire in the race is former mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is also known as New York City's richest man at the top of the Bloomberg finance and media empire. Bloomberg has donated $8.3 million to Fix the City, a super PAC founded to elect Cuomo and defeat Mamdani. The group has spent $14.7 million supporting Cuomo and $7.8 million opposing Mamdani after receiving a total of $12.3 million from billionaire donors, according to LittleSis. 

Mamdani earned 56 percent of the ranked choice vote, despite being a relative newcomer to city politics, promptly terrifying New York City's real estate lobby and the billionaire class. 

Then there are the millionaire and billionaire co-founders and CEOs behind the freelance food delivery company Doordash, including Tony Xu, Andy Fang, Stanley Tang, and Evan Moore. Doordash gave $1 million to the pro-Cuomo group Fix the City and $1.8 million to Local Economies Forward NY, a super PAC that lists Doordash as its top donor on a sparse website. Local Economies Forward NY reported spending $368,247 supporting Cuomo while funneling additional funding toward multiple city council candidates. 

Bill Ackman, the billionaire power donor and self-styled anti-DEI pundit, has also lined up behind Cuomo with a $500,000 donation to Fix the City. Ackman, a hedge fund manager and longtime Democratic donor who backed President Donald Trump in the 2024 elections, also gave $250,000 to New Yorkers for a Better Future 2025, a PAC that spent money on city council campaigns. It remains unclear whether this committee funded by Ackman is related to New Yorkers for a Better Future Mayor 2025, which WABC reports is preparing to spend $20 million against Mamdani in the general election, according to LittleSis. 

Other notable donors donating to support Cuomo or defeat Mamdani include:  

The race remains tight despite Mamdani's upset in the primaries. A poll released on August 27 shows Cuomo pulling ahead of Mamdani if Adams and other candidates drop out of the race. With New Yorkers preparing to vote on November 4, money will undoubtedly continue pouring in, and researchers will be looking forward to the next deadline for campaign finance reports to reveal how deeply the ultra-wealthy are willing to invest in the Big Apple's next mayor.

MOSCOW, August 29. /TASS/. Future security guarantees for Ukraine should be the outcome of a peaceful settlement addressing the conflict's root causes, rather than a precondition for negotiations, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.

""It is important to understand that providing security guarantees is not a condition, but the result of a peaceful settlement based on eliminating the root causes of the crisis in Ukraine. This will also ensure the security of our country,"" the diplomat stressed.

The diplomat also outlined what Moscow believes the outcome of negotiations should entail: ""Demilitarization, denazification, Ukraine's neutrality and non-nuclear status, recognition of territorial realities, protection of the rights of Russians and Russian speakers, and an end to the persecution of canonical Orthodox.""

""Security guarantees must be grounded in a common understanding that respects Russia's security interests - not in attempts to turn Ukraine into some kind of rabid beast,"" she added.

Zakharova argued that Western proposals on security guarantees for Ukraine would have the opposite effect, fueling instability. ""Essentially rooted in the rudiments of colonial thinking, the so-called security guarantees being debated in Europe are nothing of the sort. They only accelerate the erosion of strategic stability both regionally and globally,"" she stressed.

According to her, Moscow views Western initiatives as ""one-sided schemes aimed at containing Russia, designed to pull the Kiev regime deeper into NATO's orbit.""

She noted that Western efforts undermine Ukraine's neutral, non-aligned, and non-nuclear commitments enshrined in the 1990 declaration on state sovereignty. ""This line violates the principle of indivisible security and casts Kiev as a strategic provocateur on Russia's borders, raising the risk of the alliance being dragged into armed conflict with our country,"" Zakharova warned.

""Nothing new has been invented here - international legal literature is full of such tactics. And yet this is the strategic provocateur we now have on our borders,"" she concluded.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

BUDAPEST, August 29. /TASS/. After the conflict in Ukraine is over, EU leaders and Vladimir Zelensky will have to answer as to why they sought to protract hostilities instead of doing what they must to achieve peace, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said.

According to the top Hungarian diplomat, due to the European Union's serious political mistakes, including its military support for Ukraine and anti-Russian sanctions, Europe has turned into a ""continent of war,"" has lost its competitive capacities and now is lagging behind the United States and China.

""Instead of putting an end to the war, they opted to expand it, which entailed apparent losses for Europe from the point of view of its socio-economic security, inflation, growing food, energy prices and so on. And once the war ends, European political leaders will have to answer the question of why they chose this strategy. It is becoming clear why Western European leaders are not interested in the cessation of the war,"" he said addressing the Transit annual political festival in Tihany on Lake Balaton shore.

He noted that over the three and a half years of hostilities the situation in Ukraine has deteriorated dramatically. ""Half of the country is in ruins, hundreds of thousands of people have died, millions have become refugees seeking to escape an economic collapse, and so on and so forth. And if an agreement is signed now, it is obvious that because of the battlefield situation it cannot be more favorable for Ukraine than the deal that would have been done three years ago. That is why the question of why they did not want to negotiate three and a half years ago when a more advantageous deal was quite possible will be asked not only to the European leaders but also to the Ukrainian president,"" Szijjarto said.

Zelensky, in his words, will have to explain to the Ukrainians why he cut short peace talks with Russia in Istanbul in the spring of 2022. ""Why wasn't any peace agreement signed there? Who did such instructions come from and who forced Zelensky not to sign this agreement and continue the war? These are very serious questions the [European] political elite is reluctant to answer today,"" the top Hungarian diplomat emphasized.

The Russian and Ukrainian delegations held peace talks in Istanbul in the spring of 2022 and reached an agreement on settling the conflict. However, this agreement never took effect because Kiev changed its position due to the interference of Western leaders. The agreement bound Ukraine to proclaim its neutral, off-bloc status and refuse from deploying foreign-made weapons in its territory.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Many parents support their adult kids financially in their 20s and 30s.Brinja Schmidt/iStockPhoto / Getty Images

Good morning. This week, I wrote about how empty nesting might become a past concept as more parents are supporting their kids financially well into their 20s and 30s. 

How long should parents support their kids? According to Bank of Montreal's Real Financial Progress Index released earlier this month, 29 per cent of Canadians surveyed believe financial support should last as long as the parents are alive. Twenty-two per cent said it's when their child secures full-time employment, with 18 per cent planning to assist financially until the child moves out of the family house. 

How parents consider the situation depends on their family dynamic and financial health, says Hervin Pesa, certified financial planner at Aware Financial in Calgary.

“It boils down to personal and family values,” he says. “I've seen cases in which people refuse to retire until they know their kids are completely set up.”

Put another way, money originally earmarked toward ramping up parents' retirement savings is going toward helping their kids instead, he says. That could mean financial assistance with a down payment for a house or paying a certain percentage of the adult kid's expenses for an indefinite period of time.

At clients' requests, Mr. Pesa has worked on mini-plans addressing both the parents and the kids. Some parents, for example, have enough to retire and need more financial data, reassuring them it still works with adult kids at home. He says some kids are on track to have a strong financial footing, but parents still worry about retiring. 

Mr. Pesa says that generally, immigrant families have always embraced the full nest with no restrictions. Kids are encouraged to stay home until they marry and start their own respective families. Even if kids have no desire to partner up and/or have kids of their own and have achieved financially independent status, remaining at home is perfectly fine, he adds. 

“In some of these cases, the kids actually purchase properties and keep them as rentals while staying with their parents,” he says.

Still, as adult kids at home consider their situation and delayed milestones, that may cause them to rethink whether parenthood is in their cards for the future. The same BMO survey found that while seven in 10 members of Generation Z and millennials would like children, they worry about financial security. 

And it's more than a valid feeling, as 53 per cent of Canadians surveyed admitted that having children did compromise their financial security.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has visited a naval headquarters in Rostock, on the Baltic Sea, before touring a frigate and observing military exercises. 

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is touring naval operations for the first time.

In Rostock, on the Baltic Sea, Merz was visiting Germany's CTF Baltic command, which was set up in 2024 to secure the Baltic Sea and plan NATO maritime missions near Russia's border.

On board the ship, the chancellor saw the crew showcase naval operations.

Meanwhile, Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is visiting Estonia and Denmark for security talks.

These updates have been closed. 

Below, you can review news and analysis on a range of issues connected with Germany from Thursday, August 28.

The German government approved in 2024 a record €12.8 billion ($14.9 billion) of weapons exports, according to a report approved by the Cabinet.

Ukraine was listed as the top recipient, with €8.15 billion worth of military equipment, or 64% of all approved arms exports, according to a statement from the Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy on Wednesday.

Most of the products were tracked and wheeled military vehicles, but the orders also included bombs, torpedoes, missile systems and warships.

Germany rejected 62 applications from countries including Pakistan, Thailand and Malaysia.

Germany has been Ukraine's biggest military backer after the US. Berlin plans to spend €9 billion supporting Kyiv this year and in 2026, according to German Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil. 

""As long as this war continues, we will stand by Ukraine's side, because it is also about our freedom and our security,"" he said during a visit to Kyiv.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz has cautioned against increasing Russian provocations in the Baltic Sea and stressed Germany's central role in defending NATO territory.

""The threat from Russia is real,"" Merz said Thursday after witnessing a naval exercise near Rostock. ""We see daily actions by the Russian army, they are testing our readiness and capabilities.""

The chancellor vowed that Germany and its allies would ""do everything in the coming months and years to protect freedom, peace, and the territorial integrity of alliance territory,"" pointing to NATO and EU members in the Baltics.

Merz said Germany has an ""exceptionally important function"" in that effort and must continue investing heavily in equipping its armed forces.

Looking ahead to Franco-German government consultations, he said talks would center on economic and security cooperation. Merz emphasized that the European single market is of ""deep economic interest"" to Germany and must be preserved and expanded, adding that security, defense, foreign, economic, European, and domestic policy are all closely linked.

German authorities closed more investigations into human trafficking and exploitation in 2024 than in any year since records began in 2000, the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) has said.

A total of 576 cases were completed, a rise of just over 13% from the previous year. The largest share involved sexual exploitation, which reached 364 cases — the highest level in a decade. Such exploitation is increasingly taking place in private homes, a setting that is difficult to monitor and that suggests a large number of unreported cases.

Victims and suspects often come from other European countries, with notable increases among Chinese and Colombian victims. Many victims are women, young people, and minors. Contact is often established online, with the ""loverboy method"" — in which men lure women into false relationships before forcing them into prostitution — remaining a common tactic.

Minors are particularly at risk. More than 200 cases involved children and adolescents, almost all in the context of commercial sexual exploitation. Weak safeguards on online platforms have contributed to the rise, with the BKA noting two cases where children were offered for sale on the internet.

Germany is seeing a sharp rise in young people from abroad beginning dual ​​​​​​apprenticeships, even as the number of domestic trainees declines, the country's Federal Statistical Office says.

New apprenticeship contracts for foreigners jumped 17% last year, while those for Germans decreased by 4%. Foreign trainees now account for 15% of new apprentices, nearly double the share in 2014. The largest groups come from Vietnam, Syria, and Ukraine.

In a dual apprenticeship, a trainee receives practical, on-the-job training at a company and theoretical instruction at a vocational school simultaneously.

Overall, 475,100 apprenticeship contracts were signed, which is a 1% decrease from the previous year. Around 339,000 people successfully completed their training, bringing the total number of apprentices in the system to 1.2 million.

Most apprenticeships were in industry and commerce (56%), followed by crafts (28%) and liberal professions (9%). Popular choices included medical assistant, office management clerk, and dental assistant for young women, and automotive mechatronics technician, IT specialist, and electrician for young men.

About 700 police officers launched a major search operation at a partially occupied building that has long been linked to the far-left scene in Berlin's Friedrichshain district.

Police said the goal was to identify current residents, with search warrants issued by a court. Backed by technical specialists, officers used battering rams and saws to get through barricaded doors. They searched twelve apartments involving fifteen people, who were allowed to remain.

Other locations were also secured around the city. A police spokesman said the situation was initially calm, though spontaneous protests could not be ruled out.

The owner has been trying for years to evict the residents, who lack tenancy agreements, but legal disputes have stalled the process.

Eviction notices were issued years ago. Former tenants with valid contracts are said to have moved out long ago.

Over the years, residents — some organized in an association — often denied the owner and police access to the building complex. In previous years, officers on the street were frequently attacked at night with bottles or stones. However, the situation had recently calmed.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has called for stronger security cooperation with Estonia and Denmark in response to Russia's actions in the Baltic Sea.

""The security of the Baltic region is also our security in Germany,"" Wadephul said on his inaugural visits to Tallinn and Copenhagen. He warned of Russia's ""hybrid aggression,"" citing the cutting of undersea cables and GPS disruptions.

In the Estonian capital, Wadephul is meeting Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna and President Alar Karis before talks in Copenhagen with Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and European Affairs Minister Marie Bjerre.

Wadephul said Estonia and the Baltic States had long warned of such risks, and Europe now benefits from their foresight. He added that Denmark, holding the EU presidency, is advancing efforts to protect critical infrastructure in the North and Baltic Seas.

From Denmark, Wadephul is set to continue to Toulon in France for a Franco-German Ministerial Council on Friday.

The German Insurance Association (GDV) says insured losses from natural hazards in Germany totaled about €1 billion ($1.2 billion) in the first half of 2025, below long-term averages.

Storms, hail, and lightning caused roughly €500 million in property claims, while flooding and heavy rain added another €100 million. Motor insurance claims reached €350 million.

The association said if the second half of the year brings only average damage, total losses for 2025 could amount to around €4.5 billion, well below the €6.3 billion typical for a year.

GDV chief executive Jörg Asmussen warned, however, that despite the current dip, the long-term trend points to more extreme weather and rising costs.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz is Baltic-bound with a visit to Rostock to meet Navy Inspector Jan Christian Kaack before flying by helicopter to the frigate Bayern.

In Rostock, the chancellor will visit the headquarters of the German-led CTF Baltic command, which has overseen security in the Baltic Sea region for NATO since October. The unit is tasked with deterrence in peacetime and defending alliance territory in a crisis, in a region where the military alliance directly borders Russia.

On the ship, the crew is set to demonstrate aspects of naval service with support from other ships and aircraft. Merz also plans to take a tour and speak with sailors on board the anti-submarine vessel.

It's the chancellor's first visit to see Germany's naval operations.

The headquarters was founded in 2024 and is tasked with planning maritime operations and exercises — as well as leading naval forces assigned by NATO.

With about 15,300 sailors, the navy is the smallest branch of Germany's armed forces.

Guten Tag from the DW newsroom in Bonn.

We're picking things up today with a look at Chancellor Friedrich Merz making his first visit to the German Navy, heading to Rostock for talks with maritime force chief Jan Christian Kaack.

He'll also tour the new Commander Task Force Baltic headquarters, set up last year to run NATO maritime operations in the region.

Merz is then due to head to the frigate ""Bayern"" by helicopter, where naval crews will stage exercises to show off their skills in sea supply and defence against air, submarine, and missile threats.

Meanwhile, insured losses from natural hazards in Germany have come in lower than usual so far this year.

In a letter sent to Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon on August 25, a group of Democratic senators, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts), condemned the department's decision to remove the ‘Submit a Complaint' button on the Office of Federal Student Aid's (FSA) website.

Since Trump's inauguration in January, the department has laid off approximately 1,300 people, close to half of its staff. Many of those employees handled borrowers' complaints, according to the senators.

The senators first raised these issues in a letter to the Education Department in March. In response, the agency assured Warren that “the button to submit a complaint has been moved from the top of the webpage to the footer and renamed ‘submit feedback.'”

But the senators say the department's response was “highly misleading and incomplete.” 

“What was once a simple click from the Department of Education's homepage, is now a multi-step, illogical navigation process,” they wrote in their August 25 letter. “Prior to the Trump Administration, submitting a complaint on the Federal Student Aid website involved a clear button on the home page labelled ‘Submit a Complaint.'”

Now, the process is far more complicated. On the bottom of the FSA homepage, on the left hand side, in a font smaller than almost everything else on the page, it says: “Help Center | Contact Us | Site Feedback.” If the user clicks on “Site Feedback,” a pop-up asks, “What kind of feedback are you sharing today?” Two options are provided — “Website Feedback” and “Other.” If the user clicks “Other,” they're finally provided with a link to submit a complaint. 

In March, Politico reported that emails between Education Department staffers show that they intentionally hid the button in order to reduce the number of complaints received. 

“Removing the ‘Submit a Complaint' button on Studentaid.gov is already underway,” Mell Brittian-Smith, a senior Education Department employee, wrote in an email obtained by Politico, adding that they would also like to remove the word “feedback” from the site. 

“I believe this change would help decrease contact center volume and the number of complaints that the Ombuds office receives — so an overall win,” she wrote.

In Fiscal Year 2024, the Education Department received just under 290,000 complaints; over 90 percent were submitted through the website, according to the Federal Student Aid's 2024 annual report. More than half of those complaints were related to student loan repayment. The second most common complaint concerned navigating the student aid application process.

Like many federal agencies, the Trump administration has gutted the Department of Education, which the president has said he plans to eliminate. As Department of Education secretary, McMahon, a former professional wrestling executive, has championed budget cuts, layoffs and, ultimately, the end of the department altogether. Earlier this year, the department stopped forgiving student loan debt for people enrolled in the Income-Based Repayment Program, without notifying Congress or borrowers. The program allows borrowers to have the balance of their debt forgiven after making 300 payments, which typically takes about 25 years. The department has not said when it will resume forgiving borrowers' debt.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Since sending the National Guard to Los Angeles and Washington, President Donald Trump has openly mused about sending troops to some of the nation's most Democratic cities — including Chicago and Baltimore — claiming they are needed to crack down on crime.

The threats to expand a federal intervention have legal experts and some military officials raising concerns that Trump is considering novel ways to use National Guard troops in American cities that could set up conflicts not seen since the civil rights era.

Though most violent crime has fallen in recent years in the cities Trump has called out, the Republican president said Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker “should be calling me, and he should be saying, ‘Can you send over the troops please?' It's out of control.”

Whether Trump can repeat what he's done in LA and the nation's capital — call up the National Guard and have it assist a surge of federal law enforcement and immigration officers — is an open question and likely to become a point of contention should he press forward.

Here's a look at how Trump has used troops in U.S. cities, what the law allows and what could come next:




Trump first deployed troops to Los Angeles in early June over Gov. Gavin Newsom's objections by putting the California National Guard under federal jurisdiction, known as Title 10, to protect federal property from protests over immigration raids. 

Besides 4,000 Guard members, Trump later sent 700 active duty Marines, and California sued over the intervention. The Guard went on to help protect officers during immigration arrests.

While Trump pushed the limits of the law, the lawsuit centers on whether the president was allowed to use the Guard to closely shadow federal law enforcement and whether that runs afoul of the prohibition on using the military as law enforcement, known as the Posse Comitatus Act, said Todd Huntley, director of the National Security Law Program at the Georgetown University Law Center.

Meanwhile, the unique status of the District of Columbia National Guard — Trump is their commander in chief — means he has been able to use it for everything from armed patrols to trash cleanup without any legal issues. Because it is on state and not federal orders, legal restrictions on law enforcement don't come into effect.

“Where we have a big question mark” is whether “the governor of a state has to consent to the sending of troops to his state,” said Huntley, a retired Navy captain and judge advocate. 

The Trump administration is planning to surge officers to the nation's third-largest city for an immigration crackdown, two U.S. officials said.

The Department of Homeland Security asked Naval Station Great Lakes outside Chicago for support on immigration operations, including with facilities and logistics, the base said this week. The Illinois National Guard and the base said they had not received requests regarding a mobilization of troops to Chicago.

If Trump wants the freedom to use the National Guard as he pleases in Chicago, the easiest legal path is to invoke the Insurrection Act — a vaguely worded 1792 law that allows the president to deploy federal troops inside the U.S. to conduct law enforcement, an exception to the restrictions of the Posse Comitatus Act.

The law offers sweeping powers to the president, envisioning armed conflict within the United States.

“The orders would be given by him … and the governor of the receiving state would not have a say in whether he allows them into the state or not or allows them to conduct a mission in the state,” Huntley said.

However, Huntley calls this “the nuclear option.”

A D.C. National Guard official, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said invoking the Insurrection Act over a broad topic like crime could allow the Guard to be deployed indefinitely.

Another possibility is Trump deploying the D.C. Guard, which he commands, to another state, the official said.

If the D.C. Guard is put on federal orders — something Trump has the power to do — it could lead to some rare situations, including federalized D.C. Guardsmen sent to another state that in turn could activate its own Guard as a counter, Huntley said.

The possibility is not without precedent.

“The resolution of that could be basically what we saw in Alabama during the civil rights era. To take the ability of that state governor of using state National Guard forces away, the president could simply federalize them,” Huntley said.

In 1963, President John F. Kennedy federalized the Alabama National Guard as part of the now-famous standoff with Gov. George Wallace, who refused to step aside and allow Black students to integrate the University of Alabama. Wallace eventually relented.

In an executive order signed Monday, Trump ordered Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to create “a specialized unit” within the D.C. Guard “dedicated to ensuring public safety and order.” 

He also directed Hegseth to ensure every state's Guard is ready to assist federal and local law enforcement in “quelling civil disturbances and ensuring the public safety and order” when needed. It also calls for each to have units “reasonably available for rapid mobilization.”

The Pentagon has not given more details of what Trump's order will mean for the National Guard. A defense official confirmed that Hegseth's office was aware of the order and that they were reviewing it and its specific requirements.

All state Guards already have a “reaction force” that is aimed at responding to a wide variety of incidents with an initial force of 75-125 personnel within eight hours and a follow-on force of up to 375 personnel within 24 hours, according to a National Guard fact sheet.

And the D.C. National Guard already has a unit that is made up entirely of soldiers trained as military police.

NEW YORK (AP) — The CDC is in chaos and some groups are starting to step in and take over work the agency was doing.

The moves come in response to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s extensive — and some say illegal — restructuring and downsizing of the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

Many public health veterans see an agency wracked by a leadership crisis, staff cuts, budget cuts and unprecedented levels of political meddling. The concern hit a crescendo when the White House moved to oust the agency's director and some top CDC leaders resigned in protest.

But even before CDC Director Susan Monarez was fired, some organizations started pursuing new ways to do jobs formerly handled by the CDC.

Some are working to preserve longstanding vaccination recommendations. Some are trying to release information that CDC has stopped providing. Others aim to maintain health data collections at risk of being lost.

But these outside efforts don't have the federal funding, resources, legal mechanisms or platform that have been the underpinning of the nation's public health system. As noble as they are, these patchwork efforts probably won't cut it, some experts say.

“There may be some workarounds,” said Dr. Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health. “But I'm not sure it's fair or appropriate that people feel like they have to turn to private groups instead of the government.” 




For decades, the CDC has set the nation's standards on vaccines — which ones are recommended and who should get them. 

The recommendations were guidance, not law. But they were automatically adopted by doctors, school systems, health insurers and others.

They were the result of a lengthy data review process involving a panel of outside experts, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

But in May, Kennedy — a longtime leader in the anti-vaccine movement — announced COVID-19 vaccines would no longer be recommended for healthy children and pregnant women. He made the decision without input from the ACIP. 

In June, he abruptly dismissed the entire panel, accusing them of being too closely aligned with manufacturers. He replaced them with a handpicked group that included several vaccine skeptics, and then shut the door to several doctors groups that had long helped form ACIP recommendations.

It's not clear what other changes are in store for ACIP, but a number of medical groups say Kennedy can't be counted on to make decisions based on robust medical evidence. 

The moves sparked a group of public health researchers and others to form the Vaccine Integrity Project, based at the University of Minnesota, which is aims to become the kind of compiler and reporter of medical evidence that the CDC and ACIP have been in the past.

In mid-August, the group held an ACIP-like Zoom meeting, in which subject-matter experts presented lengthy reviews of recent research about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19, flu and RSV vaccines for children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.

It also featured a four-person panel of experts, including the editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine. Like ACIP members, they asked presenters questions about their analyses. 

Presenters made clear that they had to base their presentations on what had appeared in medical journals and was publicly available; they weren't privy to unpublished surveillance and safety data that CDC collects.

The group is not making vaccination recommendations itself. But it is working with doctors organizations that are. One is the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which has said pregnant women should continue to get COVID-19 shots — counter to what Kennedy announced. Another is the American Academy of Pediatrics continuing to recommend them for children ages 6 months to 2 years.

But as medical societies split from CDC, it's not yet clear which recommendations insurers will heed when making coverage decisions. And there remain a number of other questions, such as: What will happen in states that have vaccination policies tied to ACIP recommendations?

In Massachusetts, Democratic Gov. Maura Healey included language in a $2.45 billion supplemental budget bill that gives the health department authority to set its own recommendations and requirements if the federal government “fails to maintain a robust schedule of vaccine recommendations.”

Some other efforts now underway:

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the CDC teamed up with researchers at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School on www.vaccines.gov. The website told about newly developed vaccines recommended to protect against the coronavirus and served as a search engine to help people find nearby pharmacies that had the shots in stock.

But the site gradually dropped information about vaccines and why they were recommended, and this year became a stripped-down version that simply said: “Find a pharmacy near you” and a box to type in your zip code. When the government's contract with Boston Children's Hospital ended in late July, the site stopped working altogether.

Researchers at Boston Children's Hospital this month restarted a version of the site that existed before the pandemic, www.vaccinefinder.org. 

“We're turning back to what it was,” said John Brownstein of Boston Children's, who founded the site. “Obviously, as a (government) site it carries more weight. But if that isn't in the cards, we're very happy to carry the torch.”

Last month, the Association for Dental Safety launched a new institute for dental safety that was designed to pick up some of the work done by the CDC's Division of Oral Health, which was eliminated in the spring. The new institute is first focused on updating infection controls guidelines for dental offices, which the CDC last updated in 2003.

“Without a doubt, ADS is the best choice to continue oversight of dental infection prevention and control guidelines, ensuring recommendations are current, scientifically sound, translated into lay terms and disseminated to those who need them on a daily basis,” said Nicole Johnson, former associate director in the CDC's Division of Oral Health, in a press statement.

The CDC's Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, which annually surveys women across the country, lost its entire staff — about 20 people — in layoffs this year. It was the most comprehensive collection of data on the health behaviors and outcomes before, during and after childbirth. Researchers have been using its data to investigate the nation's maternal mortality problem.

Some states that have the money and motivation might decide to run similar surveys, just within their borders. California runs its own, PRAMS-like survey. 

But “if states are doing their own thing, then we don't have national, comparable data across jurisdictions and across time,” meaning its not possible to see where problems are most severe and which policies to reduce maternal deaths are working, said Jamie Daw, a Columbia University health policy researcher focused on pregnancy. 

Kennedy recently fired about 100 CDC staffers who provided training, education, and advice to state and local violence prevention programs, and evaluate how well they were working. 

“What's the point in knowing the about the rates of violence if you're not going to do anything about it?” said Sarah DeGue, one of the laid-off CDC researchers.

But existing programs still need technical guidance and expertise. In May, DeGue founded Violence Prevention Solutions, a consulting firm, to help community organizations develop and evaluate programs. 

“It's us trying to rebuild what we had somewhere else, in a different way, so that all the knowledge and experience and resources that we had can still be available,” she said.

Former Iowa State Sen. Jim Carlin, who has mounted another U.S. Senate bid, spoke to Fox News Digital about his policy views

Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa will not run for re-election in next year's midterms, three sources confirm to Fox News.

And the 55-year-old Ernst, who was first elected to the Senate in 2014, is expected to make an official announcement next week.

Ernst, a retired Army Reserve and Iowa National Guard officer who served in the Iraq War, has been wrestling for months whether to run for re-election in 2026.

The senator's decision to retire rather than seek a third six-year term creates an open seat in Iowa.

GOP Rep. Ashley Hinson, a former TV news anchor who is in her third term representing Iowa's 2nd Congressional District, which covers the northeastern portion of the state, is planning on running to succeed Ernst, multiple sources confirm to Fox News.

KEY HOUSE GOP MODERATE DON BACON WON'T SEEK RE-ELECTION

Iowa was once a top battleground state that former President Barack Obama carried in his 2008 and 2012 White House victories. But the state has shifted to the right in recent election cycles, with President Donald Trump carrying the state by eight points in 2020 and by 13 points last November.

Republicans currently hold both of the state's U.S. Senate seats – Ernst and longtime Sen. Chuck Grassley  – and all four of Iowa's congressional districts, as well as all statewide offices except for state auditor, which is held by Democrat Rob Sand, who's running for governor next year.

But Democrats in Iowa are energized after flipping two GOP-held state Senate seats in special elections so far this year.

Four Democrats are already running for Senate in Iowa. The field includes state Rep. Josh Turek, a Paralympian wheelchair basketball player, state Sen. Zach Wahls, Knoxville Chamber of Commerce executive director Nathan Sage and Des Moines School Board Chair Jackie Norris.

Ernst first grabbed national attention 11 years ago with her ""make 'em squeal"" ads as she won the high-profile Senate election in the race to succeed retiring longtime Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin.

The senator, thanks to her military background, has often taken a lead on defense issues.

Since Trump's White House victory in 2016, Ernst has tried to strike a balance between her support for the president as she hued to a more traditional Republican agenda. 

Earlier this year, Ernst sparked a controversy after ""we are all going to die"" as she responded to a voter at town hall meeting who raised concerns over Medicaid cuts in the GOP's sweeping domestic policy bill.

Republicans are aiming to not only defend, but expand, the current 53-47 Senate majority in next year's elections.

Senate Republicans enjoyed a favorable map in the 2024 cycle as they flipped four seats from blue to red to win back the majority.

But the party in power—clearly the Republicans right now—traditionally faces political headwinds in the midterm elections. Nevertheless, a current read of the 2026 map indicates the GOP may be able to go on offense in some key states.

In battleground Georgia, which Trump narrowly carried in last year's White House race, Republicans view first-term Sen. Jon Ossoff as the most vulnerable Democrat incumbent up for re-election next year.

They're also targeting battleground Michigan, where Democratic Sen. Gary Peters is retiring at the end of next year, and swing state New Hampshire, where longtime Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen decided against seeking a fourth six-year term in the Senate.

Also on the NRSC's target list is blue-leaning Minnesota, where Democratic Sen. Tina Smith isn't running for re-election.

But the GOP is defending an open seat in battleground North Carolina, where Republican Sen. Thom Tills decided against seeking re-election.

A debate over U.S. intervention against drug cartels spiraled out of control as Alejandro ""Alito"" Moreno and Gerardo Fernández Noroña clashed in a shocking on-camera brawl. (Senado de la Republica)

A Mexican Senate session descended into chaos on Wednesday when two senior politicians traded blows following a heated debate over the U.S.' involvement in the fight against drug cartels.

Video captured the explosive moment when Alejandro ""Alito"" Moreno, head of the opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), and Gerardo Fernández Noroña, the Senate president of the ruling Morena Party, violently shoved one another after lawmakers finished singing the national anthem to close the day's session. 

The clash erupted after a tense debate, during which the Morena Party and its allies reportedly accused PRI and the conservative National Action Party lawmakers of calling for U.S. military intervention in Mexico, a claim the opposing parties denied, according to the New York Post. 

The issue has grown especially contentious following reports that President Donald Trump authorized U.S. military force against Latin American drug cartels designated as terrorist groups.

Moreno, who claimed his party was denied the floor, was seen approaching Fernández Noroña, reportedly saying, ""I'm asking you to let me speak,"" while clutching the Senate president by the arm.  

""Don't touch me!"" Fernández Noroña reportedly yelled back, as the two politicians violently shoved each other as colleagues scrambled to intervene. 

In the scuffle, Moreno also clashed with one of Fernández Noroña's collaborators, cameraman Emiliano González González, who was knocked to the floor. Another lawmaker was seen yanking the Senate president's suit jacket and taking a swing at him as he tried to escape the mayhem.

Fernández Noroña accused Moreno of threatening to kill him, according to local reports.

""He hit me and told me ‘I'm going to break your mother, I'm going to kill you,'"" Fernández Noroña said in a press conference, according to El Pais.

Moreno countered that the ruling party was silencing opposition voices and insisted Fernández Noroña had instigated the fight.

""Let it be clear: the first physical aggression came from Fernández Noroña,"" Moreno said in a post on X Wednesday. ""There was an approved agenda. Minutes before reaching the corresponding point, Morena changed it to their convenience to silence us and prevent the opposition from speaking out. Their obligation was to give me the floor, and they didn't do it.""

A conversation between Ian Bogost and Lila Shroff about how school has turned into a free-for-all

This is Atlantic Intelligence, a newsletter in which our writers help you wrap your mind around artificial intelligence and a new machine age. Sign up here.

Another school year is beginning—which means another year of AI-written essays, AI-completed problem sets, and, for teachers, AI-generated curricula. For the first time, seniors in high school have had their entire high-school careers defined to some extent by chatbots. The same applies for seniors in college: ChatGPT released in November 2022, meaning unlike last year's graduating class, this year's crop has had generative AI at its fingertips the whole time.

My colleagues Ian Bogost and Lila Shroff both recently wrote articles about these students and the state of AI in education. (Ian, a university professor himself, wrote about college, while Lila wrote about high school.) Their articles were striking: It is clear that AI has been widely adopted, by students and faculty alike, yet the technology has also turned school into a kind of free-for-all.

I asked Lila and Ian to have a brief conversation about their work—and about where AI in education goes from here.

This interview has been edited and condensed.

Lila Shroff: We're a few years into AI in schools. Is the conversation maturing or changing in some way at universities?

Ian Bogost: Professors are less surprised that it exists, but there is maybe a bit of a blind spot to the state of adoption among students. I saw a panic in 2022, 2023—like, Oh my God, this can do anything. Or at least there were questions. Can this do everything? How much is my class at risk? Now I think there's more of a sense of, Well, this thing still exists, but we have time. We don't have to worry about it right away. And that might actually be a worse reaction than the original.

Lila: The blind-spot language rings true to the high-school environment too. I spoke to some high schoolers—granted this was quite a small sample—but basically it sounds like everybody is using this all the time for everything.

Ian: Not just for school, right? Anything they want to do, they're asking ChatGPT now.

Lila: I was a sophomore in college when ChatGPT came out, so I witnessed some of this firsthand. There was much more anxiety—it felt like the rules were unclear. And I think both of our stories touched on the fact that for this incoming class of high-school and college seniors, they've barely had any of those four years without ChatGPT. Whatever sort of stigma or confusion that might have been there in earlier years is fading, and it's becoming very much default and normalized.

Ian: Normalization is the thing that struck me the most. That is not a concept that I think the teachers have wrapped their heads around. Teachers and faculty also have been adopting AI carefully or casually—or maybe even in a more professional way, to write articles or letters of recommendation, which I've written about. There's still this sense that it's not really a part of their habit.

Lila: I looked into teachers at the K–12 level for the article I wrote. Three in 10 teachers are using AI weekly in some way.

Ian: Some kind of redesign of educational practice might be required, which is easy for me to say in an article. Instead of an answer, I have an approach to thinking about the answer that has been bouncing around in my brain. Are you familiar with the concept in software development called technical debt? In the software world, you make the decision about how to design or implement a system that feels good and right at the time. And maybe you know it's going to be a bad idea in the long run, but for now, it makes sense and it is convenient. But you never get around to really making it better later on, and so you have all these nonoptimal aspects of your infrastructure.

That's the state I feel like we're in, at least in the university. It's a little different in high school, especially in public high school, with these different regulatory regimes at work. But we accrued all this pedagogical debt, and not just since AI—there are aspects of teaching that we ought to be paying more attention to or doing better, like, this class needs to be smaller, or these kinds of assignments don't work unless you have a lot of hands-on iterative feedback. We've been able to survive under the weight of pedagogical debt, and now something snapped. AI entered the scene and all of those bad or questionable—but understandable—decisions about how to design learning experiences are coming home to roost.

Lila: I agree that AI is a breaking point in education. One answer that seems to be emerging at the high-school level is a more practical, skills-based education. The College Board, for instance, has announced two new AP courses—AP Business and AP Cybersecurity. But there's another group of people who are really concerned about how overreliance on these tools erodes critical-thinking skills, and maybe that means everyone should go read the classics and write their essays in cursive handwriting.

Ian: My young daughter has been going to this set of classes outside of school where she learned how to wire an outlet. We used to have shop class and metal class, and you could learn a trade, or at least begin to, in high school. A lot of that stuff has been disinvested. We used to touch more things. Now we move symbols around, and that's kind of it.

I wonder if this all-or-nothing nature of AI use has something to do with that. If you had a place in your day as a high-school or college student where you just got to paint, or got to do on-the-ground work in the community, or apply the work you did in statistics class to solve a real-world problem—maybe that urge to just finish everything as rapidly as possible so you can get onto the next thing in your life would be less acute. The AI problem is a symptom of a bigger cultural illness, in a way.

Lila: Students are using AI exactly as it has been designed, right? They're just making themselves more productive. If they were doing the same thing in an office, they might be getting a bonus.

Ian: Some of the students I talked to said, Your boss isn't going to care how you get things done, just that they get done as effectively as possible. And they're not wrong about that.

Lila: One student I talked to said she felt there was really too much to be done, and it was hard to stay on top of it all. Her message was, maybe slow down the pace of the work and give students more time to do things more richly.

Ian: The college students I talk to, if you slow it all down, they're more likely to start a new club or practice lacrosse one more day a week. But I do love the idea of a slow-school movement to sort of counteract AI. That doesn't necessarily mean excluding AI—it just means not filling every moment of every day with quite so much demand.

But you know, this doesn't feel like the time for a victory of deliberateness and meaning in America. Instead, it just feels like you're always going to be fighting against the drive to perform even more.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Buying goods from international sellers has been cheap and easy—until now.

A few years ago, I found the perfect rug for my daughter's room. It had pink unicorns and flowers. But I scoffed at the price tag on Anthropologie's website: more than $1,000, plus an additional fee for “white glove delivery.” Then I fired up Etsy. I found a similar product made by a workshop in India that shipped directly from there. It took weeks to arrive, but it was half the price.



Online shopping is a miracle: You can find items of any kind, fit for any purpose, for affordable prices—and shipped from all over the world to your door. But as of today, buying from international sellers has become more expensive for Americans. That's because President Donald Trump ended the de minimis exemption on imported goods, a loophole that allowed millions of daily packages to enter the country without paying duties. The exemption has been around for a long time—nearly a century—but it took on new import (get it?) in 2016, when the maximum value for untaxed goods rose from $200 to $800. In that moment, the social-media-driven rise of direct-to-consumer e-commerce, drop-shipping, and online-marketplace sales were also accelerating. Ever since, American ports, mailboxes, and homes have been flooded with cheap clothing, electronics, accessories, skin-care products, toys, and a host of other consumer goods.



The de minimis loophole is a big reason e-commerce sites including Shein and Temu could sell you things for so cheap: They shipped straight from China, skirting any tariffs. The White House ended the exemption for goods from China earlier this year, and now de minimis is ending for all countries. That means that many things you might import could become more expensive (on account of the additional taxes) or harder to buy (because sellers won't bother shipping to the U.S.), or take longer to arrive (because of customs backlogs), or any combination of those. The rug I bought a few years ago would now be subject to a 50 percent import duty, when you factor in tariffs on India. Presuming that cost is passed down to consumers, it's enough to give a buyer like me pause.



You might not realize how much of the stuff you buy online comes directly from overseas. I didn't, until I looked closely at my buying habits over the past few years. After all, sites such as Etsy and eBay offer seamless global commerce: A handmade craft object could come from Maine or Myanmar, straight to you. Even Amazon has benefited from de minimis. Various strategies have allowed the retailer's marketplace suppliers to take advantage of de minimis when they import goods; at other times, when you buy from the big platforms' sites, those vendors might ship what you ordered directly from abroad, tax free.

Read: Amazon decides speed isn't everything

Buying cheap imported goods has become the best part of online shopping: Not only can you find the best deals from international sellers, but also you can source items to satiate specific hobbies and interests—say, drafting pens from Japan or instrument reeds from Belgium. I found that I had bought a host of stuff, on Etsy and beyond, that took advantage of de minimis, including rubber-tree hippo figurines from Denmark (naturally) and a surprise mandolin from Ireland for my daughter. Those goods would now be subject to an additional tariff. I've bought incredibly cheap Chinese- and Japanese-manufactured camera lenses that have fueled a resurgence of photography hobbyism for me and my son; I also bought a detailed and shockingly high-quality Paul Revere costume to help a neighbor's kid beat her classmates in a school costume contest—a small thing, but one we'll all remember.



Ah, and then the British faucet doodad. This was a big deal. When I tried to repurpose an old, turn-of-the century washbasin with separate hot and cold water spigots, I couldn't find a faucet that fit the sink. Sure enough, some vendor in the United Kingdom had a $30 plastic tube that did the trick. International sellers sometimes are the only ones that have what you need, and you don't need to be a particularly adept shopper to find them. A simple Google search will suffice.



Of course, being able to seamlessly import cheap stuff has also encouraged mindless consumerism. Some imported goods are crap that nobody ever needed, produced at unconscionable labor and environmental costs. My family has a bit of a LEGO habit, and my son took to buying the cheaper Chinese knockoff sets to maximize our, well, brick-building value, I suppose. It felt a little suspect to do this—the sets are direct copies of LEGO designs—and many of them remain in bags in a closet, unbuilt. Surely we didn't need to import those. Nor the piles of cables, chargers, head lamps, and other low-cost electronic goods that broke after a few uses.

 Whether it's junk or not, Americans have become acclimated to buying a prodigious variety of wares from all over the world. When de minimis fused with global online commerce a decade ago, ordinary buyers like you and me started to see behind the curtain of domestic retailers. Anthropologie's website touted that the unicorn rug was “exclusive” to its store. But that was never entirely true: Sellers offering the same style with similar materials found a way to reach buyers like me directly, thanks to online commerce and its associated marketplaces. That's not going to change anytime soon. Instead, buying things will just become more painful. Someone will bear the burden of the new duties, and that someone is likely to be you.

Donald Trump and his allies would like to remind you that “no one is above the law.”

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Whenever the White House announces a new criminal investigation into one of Donald Trump's enemies—an event that occurs with Stalinesque frequency—the administration and its allies have a go-to line: “No one is above the law.” FBI Director Kash Patel, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, and others have gleefully deployed the tagline. It's a smirking, knowing stand-in for the claim that Joe Biden did the same thing to Trump while insisting that Trump was not above the law, and so turnabout is merely fair play.

As defenses of the naked politicization of federal law enforcement go, this rejoinder is not terribly convincing. But it is essentially the only defense that can be found for Trump's campaign to turn the law into a shield for his allies and a weapon against critics and dissenters.

The first problem with this argument is that the Biden administration did not politicize law enforcement—in fact, it went out of its way to avoid doing so. Biden put the Justice Department in the hands of Merrick Garland, a widely respected figure who had bipartisan support and who pledged to operate independently, and who followed through on that pledge by appointing a special counsel to insulate the federal Trump investigations from political influence. Trump nominated Pam Bondi, a crony with almost no Democratic support and who doesn't even pretend to value the department's independence. “We are so proud to work at the directive of Donald Trump,” she declared in March. (Trump nominated Bondi only after his first crony with no Democratic support, Matt Gaetz, proved too noxious even for some Republican senators.) Biden kept in place an FBI director chosen by Trump; Trump then replaced him with a cartoonish loyalist.

Conservatives have an answer for this, of course. Biden, they say, maintained the appearance of prosecutorial independence while secretly manipulating the Justice Department. The only difference is that Trump isn't hiding it. “He's cast aside any pretense that the Justice Department is independent (and Mr. Biden had turned this into a pretense) and is openly issuing directives for investigations,” the Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley Strassel argues.

Quinta Jurecic: Trump's revenge campaign has a weakness

This defense makes sense if you believe, as Strassel writes of the Biden administration, that “almost all their efforts aimed at politically hamstringing one man: Mr. Trump.” If, however, you were sentient during the Biden years, you will recall that Biden's DOJ went after a long list of Democrats, such as Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Representative Henry Cuellar of Texas, and Representative T. J. Cox of California. Most inconveniently for Trump's defenders, the Biden DOJ even prosecuted Hunter Biden. What's more, the department appointed an independent prosecutor, Robert Hur, to look into Joe Biden's retention of classified documents during his time out of office. Hur produced a devastating report describing Biden as elderly and suffering from memory loss. Merely trying to imagine Trump's Justice Department investigating a Trump ally, let alone, say, Don Jr., gives a sense of how wildly the two administrations differ.

The second flaw in the turnabout defense is that it pretends the cycle began under Biden. “It was Democrats who introduced the noxious art of lawfare, though master retaliator, Donald Trump, is perfecting its use,” Strassel claims.

Wait—Democrats introduced the idea that presidents should lock up their opponents? In fact, this concept was totally absent from the American political debate until Trump introduced it as a major campaign theme in 2016. His conceit was that Hillary Clinton should be locked up for using a private email server. Here again, this theme was available only because Clinton was being investigated by the FBI under a Democratic administration—under the very administration in which she had served as secretary of state—demonstrating levels of independence that would be unimaginable today.

Trump is leaning much harder into political prosecutions during his second term than he did during his first, a fact that some conservatives point to as evidence that Democrats are merely reaping what they sowed. “The barrage of prosecutions of Trump while he was out of power probably made his second presidency more willful and vindictive,” the Washington Post columnist Jason Willick argues.

In truth, Trump tried repeatedly during his first term to get the Justice Department to investigate his enemies and go easy on his friends. He had limited success not because Biden had yet to invent lawfare but because the department was still run by figures who believed in a degree of prosecutorial independence and the rule of law. What held Trump back from abusing his power in the first term was a lack of willing partners, not some spirit of restraint or generosity.

The payback theory has one more, very large, flaw. It's that Trump is, in fact, a huge and notorious crook. Conservatives have sought to elide this inconvenient data point by focusing on Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's strained effort to prosecute Trump for campaign-finance violations. Bragg's charges were technically correct but represent the kind of case you would bring only if you were looking to find a crime—a point that many liberals conceded at the time.

However, just because you're the victim of prosecutorial overreach doesn't make you innocent. The other cases against Trump were much more solid. He took a load of classified government documents, stored them in ludicrously insecure facilities, lied to government officials about their whereabouts, and repeatedly ignored demands to return them. There was also the small matter of his attempt to stay in office after losing reelection.

Paul Rosenzweig: The destruction of the Department of Justice

This behavior came after a career spent treating laws as suggestions. Trump's public life began with his defiance of Justice Department orders to allow Black tenants into his father's apartment buildings, and proceeded through a series of deals that ranged from sketchy to outright scams, such as “Trump University.” Trump was open about dealing with mobsters, and other Republicans described him, accurately, as a con man.

The Occam's-razor account of how it is that Trump became the first ex-president to face criminal investigation is that Trump is the first professional crook to be elected president. This would also neatly explain why he invented the idea of locking up the president's enemies. Crooks are generally cynics who think that everybody in power is a criminal, and the only difference is that some people are hypocrites about it. (“My father's no different than any other powerful man,” Michael Corleone says in The Godfather.)

Barack Obama did not threaten to lock up John McCain or Mitt Romney. The idea that the law is a weapon the president uses to protect his friends and harass his enemies was brought into American politics by one man. He now happens to be the one man who is very definitively above the law.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Why Is the National Guard in D.C.? Even They Don't Know.","https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/08/trump-national-guard-deployment-dc/684055/","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 17:46:00 GMT","

Their presence has terrified some, relieved others, and left even the troops themselves confused.

Even the men and women of the National Guard seemed flummoxed, at times, over what exactly they were supposed to be doing in the nation's capital.



“We're the president's patrol, ma'am,” one trio from South Carolina told us when we spotted them along the waterfront and asked what they were up to.



“Just walkin' around,” replied another gaggle—also strolling along the Potomac.



“Smiling and waving,” a third group, up from West Virginia and stationed along the National Mall, told us.



President Donald Trump's decision this month to deploy the National Guard to the streets of Washington, D.C., unleashed a torrent of coverage, criticism, and fear, along with a smattering of muted praise from some residents. More than two weeks later, soldiers are still deployed throughout the city, a physical presence amid the capital's greenery as summer fades into fall. Their mission is ostensibly to stop violent crime, but many here and beyond fear that Washington is being used as a test case—the blueprint for Trump to deploy the National Guard across the country as a paramilitary police force—and that Americans are being conditioned to accept authoritarianism. (Trump seemed to say the quiet part aloud Tuesday in a Cabinet meeting when he declared, “The line is that I'm a dictator,” before claiming that he's succeeding in halting crime in the city. “So a lot of people say, ‘You know, if that's the case, I'd rather have a dictator.'”)



Trump's federalization of the District has several parts: There's the deployment of more than 2,200 (and counting) Guard members. But there are also the hundreds of federal officers from agencies such as the FBI and DEA who are helping enforce D.C. laws, the immigration-enforcement officers who have been empowered to detain anyone not in the country legally, and the D.C. police force over which the president has asserted control. Social media has been flooded with alarming videos:masked federal officers violently wrestling a food-delivery driver to the ground, kids having to push through heavily armed officers on their way to elementary school.



The Guardsmen were initially unarmed, but Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday ordered them to start carrying their issued weapons. In most cases, it's a small handgun on their hip. Photos have circulated of Guard members with assault rifles in some Metro stations and on their outdoor patrols. Defense officials told us these weapons are meant to be used only in self-defense.

Read: Trump's farcical D.C. crackdown

The occupation has chilled life in the city, especially in neighborhoods with large immigrant populations: quiet playgrounds, empty restaurants, fewer street vendors, fewer food-delivery scooters. Nannies have stayed home, and house cleaners have canceled. Some mixed-status families are keeping their children home from school or skipping work until the federal focus moves on, or they're leaving home only when absolutely necessary. As D.C. Public Schools reopened this week, some local parent-teacher groups organized impromptu “walking buses”—volunteers willing to help walk to and from school kids whose parents don't feel safe doing so.



The National Guard has become the face of the occupation even though, for those who feel afraid, it's in many respects the least of their worries. The Guardsmen themselves have generally behaved more like a notional guard than a national one.



Their sudden appearance brings with it an absurdist sheen—their tasks quotidian (“beautification”), their backdrops farcical (a Dupont Circle Krispy Kreme), their very presence sitcom-esque (as if lifted from an episode of Veep). Alongside a video of troops engaged in light horticulture, one person wondered on social media, “National guardner?” It is not entirely surprising that the Justice Department paralegal who hurled a Subway salami footlong at a Customs and Border Protection officer—declaring, upon his arrest, “I did it. I threw a sandwich”—promptly became an icon of D.C. resistance, his act seeming, in its own implausible way, to epitomize the city's collective reaction. But the banality of the National Guard's daily patrols belies a far more complicated reality—for the city's residents, the men and women of the National Guard, even the nation itself—colored by race, class, immigration status, lived experience, and, of course, personal politics. The absent nannies and house cleaners are a frustrating inconvenience for the families who employ them, but a physical manifestation of the sense of menace that those employees feel.



The photos bouncing around social media and private text chains—of the Guard milling in front of the uber-trendy 14th Street brasserie Le Diplomate, for instance—might be easy fodder for gentle mockery. “National Guard members are deployed in DC to the “crime-ridden” … National Mall? Le Diplomate? Waste of money,” the Senate Judiciary Democrats posted on X Monday. But while homicide rates in D.C. have been declining in recent years, the city's overall crime statistics offer a far more mixed picture, one in which the threat of violent crime still feels very real to many residents. That Krispy Kreme? Two teens were stabbed in Dupont Circle and one man was shot in June just steps from its entrance, amid the city's Pride celebrations. And Le Diplomate, with its $41 steak frites and $76 Thursday special (Dover sole meunière)? A shooting in 2021, on a beautiful summer evening, sent diners fleeing. A more recent one this May, just a block away, left one man dead. And a disconcertingly large number of residents have personal crime anecdotes.



During a news conference Wednesday, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser seemed to channel her own ambivalence, and perhaps some of her city's as well. She credited Trump's federal law-enforcement surge with reducing crime in the District, but she also expressed concern about the Guard presence and the immigration crackdown. Asked about “nervous Hispanic workers,” she pointedly said that she wanted to “express to them as a neighbor how very sorry I am that they're living in this terror.”



The particulars are no less complicated for the Guardsmen themselves. When the president first ordered their deployment to the nation's capital, Pentagon officials told us that some Guard leaders asked: “Is this legal?” After all, the National Guard is usually deployed by governors to combat threats from nature—hurricanes or other natural disasters—or by the president to support U.S. military missions abroad, as it did in Iraq and Afghanistan. When the Guard shows up to protect Americans from fellow Americans, it is under extraordinary circumstances and for a limited mission, such as after the U.S. Capitol riot on January 6, 2021—the last time the government deployed the D.C National Guard to the city to address an emergency.



In their initial doubts, what some Guardsmen were really asking was existential: Are we becoming something different? After all, the National Guard appears to have a new kind of mission, one that began in Los Angeles when Trump federalized the Guard over immigration concerns; moved to D.C. under the auspices of addressing “rampant violence and disorder”; and, according to Trump, could soon expand to Chicago and Baltimore.



This ambiguity not only invites confusion and raises fears of troops conducting more police-like functions, but it also thrusts the National Guard into the middle of political disputes. The more often it is deployed in politically divisive missions—instead of the more routine apolitical assignments to disaster zones—the more perilous the Guard's standing becomes among the American public.

Read: How does Trump's federal takeover end?

There is also the concern that the Guard is not actually making much of a difference. To wit: On Wednesday around 3 p.m.—less than a week after Trump declared on social media that “Washington, D.C. is SAFE AGAIN!”—a woman was stabbed near a major intersection along the city's H Street corridor. Guard members had been passing through the intersection all day, and a trio happened to be finishing lunch on the patio of a taqueria directly across the street when the stabbing happened. Still, the suspect managed to flee. The Guard declined to comment.



“So safe,” a neighborhood resident texted us.



To some—especially undocumented immigrants—the Guard presence is disconcerting at best, terrifying at worst. But to others, they are more curiosity than conquerors, more tourists than tormentors.



“They're giving ‘Hey, pal' vibes,” one woman whispered to her companion this week, observing Guardsman ambling along the waterfront.



Often, the Guard presents with a certain Boy Scout earnestness. On Tuesday, military officials shared that the troops had completed “beautification projects,” describing the efforts not unlike a merit-badge mission: First, Guardsmen collected driftwood while clearing the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial. The following day, they turned that wood into mulch and wielded wheelbarrows as they spread it around the Tidal Basin. (Before their weapons orders came down, some—like Cub Scouts in training—were armed with only their trusty metal water bottles, jammed deep into their cargo pockets.)



Hegseth has repeatedly described his desire to create a U.S. military force focused on lethality. But Christopher Le Mon, a former Biden- and Obama-administration national-security official, joked to us that the troops' landscaping duties seemed more like a focus on “leafality.” The use of troops for such missions is “ridiculous and wasteful,” he said, adding more seriously: “Meanwhile the Chinese military probably is training to invade Taiwan.”



More than half of the troops hail from outside of D.C., and the tourism vibe is strong. On Monday, some Guard members sat resting in a patch of shade in front of the Washington Monument, alongside a group of tired schoolchildren. A few minutes later, a different group of Guardsmen boarded a charter bus, as if readying for their next sightseeing stop. At the city's Wharf, one Guardsman obligingly took a photo of a couple before two of his comrades in arms joined the couple in the picture.



“You guys are so sweet!” the woman enthused.



Yet, again, the reality is far more complicated. Yes, the Guard has demonstrated instances of admirable sweetness; one Capitol Hill resident and father of two recounted to us how troops on the Mall allowed his 4-year-old son to press the buttons on their walkie-talkies. But, this person continued, on Monday he had gotten off the Metro at the Eastern Market stop and found that a group of fare-jumping teens who regularly hop the turnstiles had been halted by a combination of Guardsmen and police officers. He said that he's long found the fare-hoppers to be a frustration of city living, yet added, “I don't know that this was a problem that rose to the level of Let's deploy the National Guard with their long guns.”



A lawyer who lives on Capitol Hill told us that she had observed something different at the Eastern Market stop Monday, when most D.C. public schools opened for the new year: A scrum of moms—or possibly teachers—standing in front of the Guard, holding up signs. “At first I thought the group of women were protesting the Guard,” she told us. “But then I looked at the signs and they literally said things like First day of school! and You got this!”



“It just struck me as an example of why this is such a farce and so unnecessary,” she continued. “This is a community where moms stand outside and encourage kids on the first day of school.” The District, she said, “is not a community that needs to be militarized.”



At Union Station, in the shadow of the Capitol, the troops got a decidedly mixed reaction as we looked on one afternoon this week. Some commuters held up phones as they passed by, recording out of curiosity or for posterity. A woman in workout gear was more confrontational, filming the Guardsmen at close range and repeatedly demanding, “What's your mission?” Others were quietly supportive: One woman flashed a quick thumbs-up, and another slipped a sentry a rose-colored Vitamin Water.



At one point, a man, head shorn, sidled up to a police officer and a Guardsman to offer explicit praise. The man said that usually at Union Station, “every breath was weed,” but he hasn't so much as smelled a hint of marijuana smoke since the Guard stationed itself in the area. He said he also normally witnesses at least a handful of fare-jumpers every trip, and enthused that those, too, have disappeared. He hoped the Guardsman were hearing the praise they deserved, he said.



By the time we headed home, after several hours spent wandering the city's various quadrants, it was clear that almost no one felt particularly good about the arrangement: not the National Guardsmen, many of whom clearly didn't want to be there, leaving their families and jobs in order to spread mulch and pick up trash; and not the residents, many of whom were furious with the occupation of their city or, worse, terrified of what the military's presence portended for them and their loved ones. Even those residents who welcomed the troops did so from a place of discontent, so fed up with crime and quality-of-life issues that they felt relieved that someone was finally doing something, anything to help.

Read: Trump's dreams for D.C. could soon hit reality



Earlier in the day, sitting on a bench at the Wharf, we watched a lone man in fatigues wander by, earbuds in. “Where's the rest of your trio?” we called out, by now accustomed to seeing Guardsmen in groups of three. “Where are your other two?” He stopped, took out his earbuds, and leaned toward us, revealing the patch on his uniform that stated his military branch.



“I'm Space Force,” he offered cheerily. He looked blissful, as if in the weeks since Trump deployed the military to Washington, he had come to understand that managing the cosmos was less complicated than being responsible for even a few blocks of the capital.

A new book shows how indie rock shaped a generation's listening preferences, with lasting effects.

As far as rock stardom goes, Grizzly Bear was never an obvious candidate. A Brooklyn-based band that formed in 2002, it specialized in subtlety—delicate riffs, choir-like singing, meandering melodies. Some musicians ask their crowds to “make some noise”; in the new book Such Great Heights: The Complete History of the Indie Rock Explosion, the music journalist Chris DeVille remembers seeing Grizzly Bear's lead singer praise an audience for being “so quiet and attentive.”

Yet by 2009, Grizzly Bear was a hot ticket. The band's album Veckatimest debuted in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 200—and would eventually sell 1.1 million copies worldwide, buoyed by its single “Two Weeks” appearing in a Super Bowl commercial for Volkswagen. When Jay-Z and Beyoncé attended one of the band's concerts, it seemed a sign that the tectonic plates of culture were shifting. Grizzly Bear was indie; Jay-Z and Beyoncé represented what indie was supposedly independent from: the mainstream. But the separation between the two worlds was becoming blurrier every day. Reacting to observers who'd been surprised to see him at the show, Jay-Z told MTV News, “What the indie rock movement is doing right now is very inspiring.”

The phrase indie rock originated in the late '70s to refer to niche, punk-influenced bands—Buzzcocks, Hüsker Dü, R.E.M.—that got their start distributing their own records and booking their own shows. But during the 2000s, it came to refer to all sorts of art and product united by a vague preference for scruffiness over polish. Indie included songs on the Billboard Hot 100, such as Modest Mouse's “Float On.” It encompassed the music on The O.C., a show watched by millions. It was a consumer economy that made vintage clothing and microbrewed beer into corporate endeavors (pour one out for American Apparel). And eventually, the term seemed to lose any meaning. Twenty-first-century indie shaped the identities of many Millennials, but it's now often talked about with pitying nostalgia—as the bygone style of hipsters with handlebar mustaches pretending to be countercultural while making easy-listening music for hotel lobbies.

DeVille's book is a meticulous recounting of that twee and heady era. A writer and editor for the stalwart music blog Stereogum, DeVille catalogs indie's permutations with the enthusiasm of a baseball-card collector, astutely sorting small developments amid larger trends. (For example: I'd never before considered how the availability of Wi-Fi internet drove demand for coffee-shop-friendly music.) But as to what indie meant—whether it was understood best as an artistic renaissance, a marketing fad, a by-product of technological change—he offers a shrug: “Multiple interpretations are valid.” The book also has a bit of an elegiac feel, suggesting that whatever indie was, it's definitively over. Yet in many ways, indie still lives—and represents an idealistic approach to art and culture that's well worth preserving.

The book opens with a reminiscence from DeVille's adolescence in the late '90s. While the girls at his high school listened to MTV stars like Britney Spears, the boys followed nu metal bands such as Korn—though DeVille never fully connected with that music's rageful essence. Eventually, he got into the artier angst of Deftones, which led him to Radiohead, which led him to full-blown music geekdom. “For me, indie wasn't about DIY ethics, avant-garde disruption, or any kind of radical worldview,” he writes. “It was about albums I could spin incessantly and organize into lists in place of a personality, songs I could burn onto mix CDs for my friends and family to show off my good taste, and bands that doubled as a secret handshake with people cooler than me.”

His trajectory mirrors my own journey from Incubus-loving tween to Shins-loving teen, but I found the explanation of his own motives a little depressing. Smug posturing and insularity were certainly part of the subculture, but so—at least we told ourselves—was serious musical appreciation. Mainstream musical offerings of the time tended toward the overly macho or overly feminine, overly loud or overly slick—but indie appeared to value complexity and smarts. Albums such as Modest Mouse's The Moon & Antarctica and Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot didn't seem like they were created to perform an identity or please a constituency; they were, instead, exploring abstract musical and lyrical ideas.

Of course, believing you're too sensitive and authentic to care about identity categories is an identity itself—as indie's transformation into a lifestyle-branding buzzword would come to demonstrate. Many of the scene's prominent artists were white and male, and the scene was brimming with naivete and privilege (making weird music for no money is a lot easier when you have a trust fund, as some artists did). But there's a reason that, as DeVille carefully tracks, the term indie evolved beyond the white-dudes-with-guitars stereotype to encompass a variety of rappers, R&B singers, and even low-wattage pop divas. Indie is, at base, an aesthetic sensibility: a belief about what music is for. It stakes out a zone between the avant-garde notion of music as pure sound and the pop notion of music as pure pleasure. Indie says it's nice to hear someone do something different.

Read: What's the appeal of indie rock's new golden boy?

What helped early-2000s indie blow up was the new way music was able to travel. The internet—listening platforms such as Napster and iTunes, emergent media such as music blogs—gave a scattered constellation of scrappy bands new reach. Indie's predecessor scenes, such as '90s grunge or '70s post-punk, were all rooted in real-life neighborhood venues where bands, listeners, and journalists mingled. Indie's bands arose from specific local conditions too. But we fans, in large part, got invested virtually. Kids scattered all over the world were listening deeply and solitarily in headphones—and swapping songs and opinions about those songs online.

Perhaps this is also why, despite the connotations of the word indie, fans didn't tend to accuse their faves of selling out when they got popular. When music is a purely aesthetic endeavor, severed from any particular material or geographical context, what does it matter if Red Bull is sponsoring a tour? Certainly, when my beloved Modest Mouse started to gain mainstream traction, I don't recall feeling defensive of the band's purity. I wasn't a follower who'd seen the band gigging in bars for years; I'd just discovered it in some online listicle. I liked the music it made, and I was glad I'd have more people to talk about it with.

Being the first mass musical movement to flourish online also explains 2000s indie's relatively dangerless aura. Previous books chronicling rock scenes, such as Michael Azerrad's Our Band Could Be Your Life or Legs McNeil and Gillian McCain's Please Kill Me, were full of juicy anecdotes set in tour buses and rock clubs. Indie bands, no doubt, have plenty of those sorts of stories to share. But DeVille has no dishy scoops to impart. Such Great Heights tells the story of indie as it was experienced by its consumers: largely through a succession of Pitchfork reviews. The publication—founded in 1996 and famous for the decimal-point precision with which it rates albums—is mentioned more than a hundred times in the book, raising the question of whether the story of indie is really the story of one website's influence.

Pitchfork has long gotten a bad rap for snottiness and tortured writing, but it's an important institution for a reason. By the early 2000s, Rolling Stone seemed overly preoccupied with Boomer artists of fading vitality; Spin, while containing punchy criticism, was a glossy consumer magazine inflected by celebrity and fashion. Pitchfork, by contrast, had a near monastic devotion to talking about music as music. In 2024, the site's founder, Ryan Schreiber, told The New York Times that he wanted to create something “that was very tough from a critical standpoint,” and that was guided by a question: “Who's making music that's truly innovative and progressive?”

Read: A dark omen for the future of music

The credibility of that description is well supported by Pitchfork's history of trashing once-praised bands whenever their new work sounded repetitive or unadventurous. And the site really does have a record of championing albums that had an evolutionary impact on the way music sounds. In the early 2000s, a vein of innovation was being mined by artists twisting folk traditions into new shapes (Sufjan Stevens's whimsical orchestration, Animal Collective's ghostly harmonizing, Joanna Newsom's harp epics). Other bands, such as Arcade Fire and the Postal Service, were turning away from the disaffection that characterized Gen X rock to express bighearted feelings in bespoke ways.

Of course, not all—or even most—indie bands were groundbreaking. DeVille traces the knockoff effect that happened over time, like when the unpredictable pop experimentalists of MGMT were succeeded—and commercially eclipsed—by bands with blander takes on their ideas (Capital Cities, Foster the People, Empire of the Sun). As the homespun sounds of early-2000s indie rock became mall-soundtrack fare, tastemakers took a new interest in rap, R&B, pop, and electronic music. This turn remains controversial—whatever's wrong with culture today, you can find someone tracing the problem back to the rise of so-called poptimism, the belief that mainstream entertainers were worthy of critical appraisal, not instinctive disdain. DeVille suggests—quite fairly—that indie's poptimist turn was sneaky snobbery, reactions against the popularity of groups like Mumford & Sons. But the underlying truth is that, by the mid-2010s, a lot of “truly innovative and progressive” music wasn't originating from bands. It was coming from genre-agnostic internet natives wielding software and a mic, like Frank Ocean.

The real reason that indie started to die, or at least felt as though it did, is Spotify. As streaming supplanted downloads and album sales, it automated music discovery. Instead of reading Pitchfork or asking a record-store clerk for recommendations, more and more people began to let algorithms suggest their next obsession. This had a variety of consequences. One is that it's become harder than ever for challenging music—music that you need to listen to a few times in order to love—to gain a foothold. The prestige associated with doing something different has started to fade.

Streaming, with its paltry pay rates, also made living off small and passionate fan bases harder for artists to sustain. But the economics of indie were always tenuous. DeVille notes that the scene's boom synced up with the brief few years when iTunes downloads drove music consumption—thereby allowing small labels to make bigger margins by focusing less on physical products. Corporate patronage, driven by the hype surrounding indie, also rained paydays on off-beat artists. But in a 2012 New York magazine feature, Grizzly Bear revealed that—for all of the band's outward success—its members weren't even making a middle-class income. The band's music remained too outré to get played on commercial radio stations, which were still important drivers of mainstream success. A decade later, the band's lead singer, Ed Droste, launched a new career as a therapist.

Still, Jay-Z's quote about Grizzly Bear proved prophetic: Pop really did take inspiration from indie. Beyoncé's rapturously acclaimed 2013 self-titled album was moody, adventuresome, dripping with hipster rhetoric: “Soul not for sale,” she sang. “Probably won't make no money off this, oh well.” Indie veterans such as Jack Antonoff, Aaron Dessner, and Dan Nigro became era-defining pop producers by helping Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo, and other celebrities make introspective, quirky, rock-adjacent anthems. Pop didn't give up the prerogative to broad appeal. But indie's values—valorizing authentic self-expression and sonic exploration—probably did shape the desires of a generation of listeners.

As for indie music itself, it's still here. It just went back to being what it was in the first place: a niche, an underground, a restless creative philosophy. Every day, Pitchfork still champions some artist—in rock or rap or some entirely new genre—whom I haven't heard of and who challenges my ears. Music nerds are, for example, currently digging into weirdos such as Geese (a Gen Z band whose songs have a polyrhythmic, semi-comic intensity) and Ryan Davis & the Roadhouse Band (imagine Jimmy Buffett doing eight-minute, science-fiction-inflected sermons). On Wednesday, Pitchfork even spotlighted a baffling hip-hop offshoot that refers to itself as … “indie rock.” The music of the margins is not likely to find the reach it did for a few fleeting years of the 2000s. But great things, indie insists, are made for their own sake.

The senator reportedly won't run again as voters in the Hawkeye State start to show their dissatisfaction with the GOP.

Heading back to the farm.

From the outside, Iowa looks to be solidly red. President Donald Trump won it handily in 2024 and the state has both a Republican governor and a GOP-controlled legislature. But that could change in 2026. On Friday, reports emerged that Senator Joni Ernst had decided, despite pleas from party leaders, not to run again. That would hand Democrats a chance at an open seat. Ernst committed an epic gaffe earlier this summer when she responded to a town hall question on Medicaid cuts — the result of Trump's budget bill — with an exasperated, “Well we're all going to die.” She has never recovered politically.

Republican Governor Kim Reynolds, who has been sinking in the polls, also will not run again, leaving another open seat at the top of the midterm ticket. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Trump signed a memorandum on Thursday ordering the termination of Harris' detail starting Monday, according to another person familiar with the matter.

Retirement funding looks very different depending on where you live.

While the United States leans heavily on voluntary 401(k)-style savings plans, other nations rely on mandatory contributions or more traditional pensions to ensure broad coverage and steady income.

Mercer CFA Institute Global Pension Index takes these structural differences into consideration when ranking some of the world's biggest retirement systems.

""We do it because we want to give a picture of the retirement landscape,"" said Christine Mahoney, global pensions leader at Mercer, a consulting firm. ""We try to look at what the public systems are, what the private systems are, and look at how people will fare in retirement across all of those.""

The U.S. retirement system received a C+ rating from the Mercer CFA Institute Global Pension Index in 2024. It ranked 29 out of 48 global pension systems assessed.

""It means that the system is solid, designed well, but there is a significant risk,"" said Mahoney. ""And if we don't clear that risk up, the system could be in some jeopardy.""

Countries around the world are raising their retirement ages, as well as requiring mandatory contributions into personal retirement savings, according to research from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Experts suggest this can help address modern problems such as people living longer and fewer workers paying into the system.

""For the U.S. system, the thing that could change that grade significantly, the most important is actually coverage,"" Mahoney said. ""Our 401(k) plans are voluntary.""

The Netherlands is frequently given a top score in the index. Mahoney says one of the key features that makes the Dutch system stand out is mandatory contributions.

There are two broad models for retirement plans, and they function very differently:

What countries like the Netherlands and Australia do differently from the U.S. is require workers to pay into defined contribution plans.

""In the Netherlands ... there's a mandatory contribution made,"" Mahoney said. ""You can't opt out of it either as an employer or as an employee. So getting money [into defined contribution accounts] in the U.S. is a real challenge because it is a voluntary system. If we're going to stay voluntary, then getting it easier to launch a plan and join a plan is the critical thing for [the U.S.] to focus on.""

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

A federal judge set a hearing for 10 a.m. ET this morning after Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook sued President Donald Trump over his move to fire her. While the case will likely make its way to the Supreme Court, today's hearing marks the latest twist in a dramatic standoff that has gripped economists and investors in recent weeks.

Here's what to know:

The S&P 500 closed at a record high for the second day in a row yesterday, finishing the session above 6,500 for the first time.

Traders received good news when second-quarter GDP data came in stronger than economists anticipated, though Nvidia's post-earnings slide put a damper on the market's good vibes. 

But don't shut down your computer for the long weekend just yet. The personal consumption expenditures price index — a closely followed gauge of inflation — is due in at 8:30 a.m. ET. Follow live market updates here.

Speaking of Nvidia, a financial filing yesterday revealed a fascinating fact about the chipmaker's business: Just two of Nvidia's clients accounted for 39% of its revenue in the second quarter.

The identities of these customers are a mystery. But as CNBC's Kif Leswing notes, the fact that only two clients make up such a sizable chunk of Nvidia's sales raises red flags around potential overconcentration.

In the same period a year ago, the chipmaker's top two customers collectively represented 25% of its revenue.

Gap's new denim ad featuring girl group Katseye may be popping off, but its second-quarter sales didn't.

The clothing maker slightly missed Wall Street's revenue expectations after the bell yesterday, though it beat analysts' earnings estimates. Gap said Athleta, its athleisure brand, had a particularly difficult quarter and warned that tariffs would hurt profits more than it previously expected.

Gap wasn't the only retailer making headlines. CNBC's Gabrielle Fonrouge exclusively reported yesterday that Nike is planning another round of layoffs as it fights to return to growth.

The symbiotic relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI is once again in flux.

Yesterday, Microsoft said it began publicly testing an internally built AI model that can enhance its Copilot assistant. As CNBC's Jordan Novet reports, the move is an attempt by Microsoft to decrease its dependence on OpenAI's models. 

The two companies are increasingly competing against each other, despite Microsoft being one of OpenAI's key backers. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and uses its artificial intelligence tools in its products. At the same time, OpenAI relies on Microsoft's cloud infrastructure to run its models but has recently turned to other providers to meet booming demand.

IREN (IREN) reported fourth-quarter results that highlighted rapid progress in both its bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence infrastructure businesses, according to a Friday research report by broker Canaccord Genuity.

The broker reiterated its buy rating on the stock and hiked its price target 60% to $37 from $24, citing stronger visibility in both mining and AI revenue streams.

In early trading, shares are higher by 25% to $28.75.

The company's mining unit reached an annualized revenue run rate above $1 billion, powered by 50 exahash per second (EH/s) of capacity and one of the industry's most efficient fleets at 15 J/TH, operating on 3.5 cent/kWh power, analysts led by Joseph Vafi wrote. That translates into a $36,000 cost to mine a bitcoin, well below market levels.

Bitcoin mining revenue came in at $187.3 million for the quarter, up 33% sequentially, while adjusted EBITDA jumped 46% to $121.9 million.

On the AI side, IREN is accelerating expansion, the report noted. The bitcoin miner quadrupled its hashrate and added another megawatt of power capacity, now totaling 3 MW, with further growth expected in fiscal 2025.

The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain, and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty.

Canaccord also noted IREN's recent designation as an NVIDIA (NVDA) preferred partner, which came almost simultaneously with the announcement of the purchase of an additional 2,400 GPUs.

With 2,910 MW of secured power capacity and some of the lowest all-in cash costs in the industry, Canaccord argues IREN is positioned to become one of the largest and most efficient publicly listed miners, with significant optionality in high-performance computing.

Investors are pouring into Ethereum. 

Exchange-traded funds for Ethereum raked in $4 billion in August alone, according to data from SoSoValue. 

If that amount stays constant, it would reach $50 billion in annualised flow — surpassing the $36 billion Bitcoin ETFs pulled in last year, according to Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management.

And there's much more money to go around, Hougan said in an August 28 interview. 

“There's a relentless bid for Ethereum ETFs,” Hougan told podcaster Scott Melker. “It's a flood of money into a relatively small asset, which is why the chart looks so good. And I think it's going to continue for the rest of the year.”

The surge in investor interest for Ethereum represents a dramatic reversal for an asset that many had written off just months ago.

Last year, broker dealers said they struggled to convince investors to bet on Ethereum ETFs.

And even though Ether's new all-time high proved short-lived, market watchers are predicting the token's price can go anywhere from $7,500 by year-end to $20,000 at some point in the current cycle. 

Instead of Bitcoin, institutional investors are deploying capital straight into Ethereum.

That's because they're drawn in by fresh regulation that should further cement its stablecoin dominance — nearly half of the $283 billion market lives on Ethereum — the potential $19 trillion tokenisation boom, and staking yields that Bitcoin doesn't offer. 

“The other day, I was on with a multi-billion dollar adviser. They wanted everything else besides Bitcoin,” Hougan said. 

“And they ended up just buying an Ethereum ETF because that's all they can access.”

Some, like Jan van Eck, CEO of investment manager VanECk, are even calling Ethereum the “Wall Street token.” 

For years, Bitcoin advocates have been calling the top crypto digital gold.

But most professional investors don't hold gold — meaning the narrative falls flat to most capital allocators, Hougan argued . 

“Maybe 15, maybe 20% of them own gold,” Hougan said. “The other 80% just own stocks. And I think there's a lot of people who look at Bitcoin and are like, yeah, it's digital gold. I don't own gold, but I do own technology stocks.”

Ethereum, meanwhile, fits their framework: it's a tech play with cash flows, real-world utility, and has become the skeleton for tokenisation projects from BlackRock to JPMorgan. 

Sprinkle the voraciousness of Ethereum treasury companies in adding Ether to their balance sheets, and a rising price should follow suit. 

For Hougan, whose watching institutional money flood in at unprecedented rates, even the recent pullback is just noise. 

“There is no market pullback for them,” he said. “They still see it in a raging bull market.”

                            The U.S. Department of Commerce just published GDP data on Bitcoin, Ethereum & 7 more blockchains. | Credit: Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images                        


Key Takeaways

In a groundbreaking move, the U.S. Department of Commerce has begun publishing official economic data directly onto public blockchains.

At its core, the initiative treats economic data as a public good, a resource that should be open, verifiable, and equally accessible to all.

Through partnerships with two leading oracle providers, Chainlink and Pyth , core indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP), real personal consumption expenditures, and private domestic sales are now verifiable on 9 blockchain networks, including:

This initiative reflects  the Trump administration's push toward greater transparency in government spending and accountability.

Instead of filtering through agency reports, news outlets, or data aggregators, citizens and institutions can now access official statistics directly from blockchain infrastructure—immutable, timestamped, and globally available.

For blockchain advocates, the significance  is twofold: government adoption of decentralized technology is no longer theoretical, and trusted economic data has become programmable within decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems.

Gross domestic product or GDP, a nation's total economic output, has always been a political and financial touchstone. Markets move, policies shift, and businesses plan around its quarterly updates.

But traditional publication methods rely on centralized servers and intermediaries—making them vulnerable to manipulation, selective access, or delays.



Publishing GDP and related metrics on-chain offers several benefits:

In this sense, the blockchain doesn't just distribute numbers—it creates a shared foundation of trust in economic reporting.

At the heart of this initiative are blockchain, middleware that bridges real-world data with decentralized networks.

Oracles solve a key problem: blockchains are self-contained and cannot natively access external information.

Together, these oracles ensure data integrity using cryptographic proofs and decentralized validation.

Their role isn't just technical—they're now custodians of government transparency, chosen to handle some of the most sensitive economic figures in the world.

For years, blockchain advocates pitched decentralized tech as a way to improve public services. Critics often dismissed it as hype.

But the Department of Commerce's adoption signals a shift: blockchain is being recognized as a serious infrastructure for distributing public information.



This isn't the first time governments have experimented with blockchain, but it is among the most impactful. Earlier efforts focused on land registries, supply chains, or digital IDs. Economic data—arguably the backbone of democratic accountability—marks a more central and politically sensitive use case.

The Department of Commerce said : “Publishing GDP on-chain is not just about embracing new technology—it's about giving citizens the tools to hold us accountable with verifiable, tamper-proof data.”

If successful, other agencies could follow. Inflation measures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, budget allocations from the Treasury, or even census data could be next.

On-chain GDP data doesn't just benefit transparency advocates. It has direct implications for decentralized finance.

 

For Wall Street, the integration is equally meaningful. Hedge funds already use high-frequency feeds from Pyth.

With government data now available, algorithmic trading strategies can consume official statistics instantly—without waiting for them to trickle through legacy newswires.

Despite the promise, putting GDP on the blockchain isn't without risks.

These caveats don't negate the value, but they highlight the need for thoughtful rollout and safeguards.

The U.S. isn't alone in experimenting with blockchain for public transparency. Countries from Estonia to Singapore have tested distributed ledgers for public registries and finance.

But the scale and symbolism of putting data on-chain set this case apart.

If the experiment succeeds, it may inspire:

In a world where trust in institutions is fragile, blockchain provides a technical solution for verifiability.

The Department of Commerce's partnership could thus become a template for governments navigating both digital transformation and public skepticism.

Why does this matter beyond crypto and finance? Because information is power.

When only a few institutions control access to economic statistics, public trust erodes—especially in times of political tension.

Publishing GDP on-chain flips that paradigm. It empowers citizens, journalists, academics, and investors to verify data independently.

It removes ambiguity over whether numbers were “massaged” for political ends. And it does so in a way that's globally accessible, not limited to those with expensive terminals or institutional subscriptions.

Douro Labs CEO, Michael Cahill, welcomed the initiative .

“Today is a historic day,” he said.

“For the first time ever, official U.S. government data has been published to the blockchain for use in smart contracts and it was done over the Pyth Network. Making the data instantly accessible to over 600 connected applications across more than 100 blockchains.”

“Secretary Howard W. Lutnick and his team are pushing the boundaries of innovation as they modernize and position the United States to be the worldwide blockchain leader,” he added.

According to Jonathon Chambless , founder of LV8RLABS, “This collaboration marks a significant step in bridging traditional government data with the world of decentralized finance.”

“This partnership is a strong signal of the growing adoption of blockchain technology by government agencies and highlights the crucial role of oracles like Chainlink in connecting blockchains with real-world data.”

The Department of Commerce's decision to publish GDP and related economic indicators on public blockchains is more than a technical milestone. It represents a cultural and political one.

Blockchain, once dismissed as niche, is now being trusted to handle some of the nation's most important data.

Chainlink and Pyth are proving that oracles are not just for DeFi price feeds—they can be the infrastructure for government transparency.

The future could see a world where inflation rates, unemployment figures, and even election results are verified on-chain. Whether this vision unfolds smoothly will depend on regulation, adoption, and education. But one thing is clear: the line between government and decentralized technology has blurred.

GDP on the blockchain is no longer a metaphor. It's a reality—and perhaps the first glimpse of a more open, accountable digital future.

What does it mean to put GDP on the blockchain?


Publishing GDP on the blockchain means that official U.S. government economic data, such as gross domestic product, is uploaded directly to decentralized networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This ensures the information is immutable (cannot be changed), globally accessible, and verifiable by anyone.




Why is the Department of Commerce using Chainlink and Pyth?


The Department of Commerce selected oracle providers Chainlink and Pyth because they specialize in securely transmitting real-world data to blockchains. Chainlink distributes data like real GDP and consumer expenditures, while Pyth publishes GDP statistics directly. These oracles act as trusted bridges between traditional government databases and decentralized systems.




How could this impact DeFi and financial markets?


By making GDP data available on-chain, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols can build products that automatically respond to macroeconomic trends. For example, lending platforms could adjust collateral requirements based on GDP growth, while synthetic assets or derivatives could track government-reported data in real time. Hedge funds and institutional traders may also plug these feeds into algorithmic strategies.




What risks or challenges come with publishing economic data on-chain?


While blockchain adds transparency, challenges remain. Errors at the source (such as revisions to GDP numbers) still propagate onto the blockchain. Concentrating trust in just two oracle providers creates potential risks if they fail or are compromised. Additionally, raw numbers without context may confuse citizens, and some lawmakers remain cautious about embedding government data into crypto infrastructure.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

The popular NFT brand Pudgy Penguins and FIFA Rivals creator Mythical Games announced the global launch of the web3 mobile game Pudgy Party on Friday.

Pudgy Party is a lighthearted party-royale title set in a world of fast-paced mini-games, featuring a cast of recognizable Pudgy Penguins characters with distinct traits, powers, and personalities, according to a statement shared with The Block. Every match is designed to feel fresh and unpredictable, with rotating challenges and unexpected twists to ensure that no two parties are the same.

""The heart of Pudgy Penguins has always been about connection and spreading good vibes,"" Pudgy Penguins CEO Luca Netz said. ""Bringing our beloved, viral characters to life in a mobile multiplayer game is an exciting step forward in our mission to create joyful, meaningful experiences for our growing global community. Pudgy Party is fun, accessible to players of all ages, and designed to bring people together.""

Players can customize their penguins with outfits, emotes, and collectibles — some non-tradable, others limited-edition and tradable via Mythical's marketplace, with the option to mint, upgrade, and fuse rare items into NFTs on Mythical's EVM-compatible Polkadot parachain, Mythos Chain. 

The game also features seasonal events with meme-inspired costumes, global leaderboards, and real-time tournaments where players compete for prizes and rankings, starting with ""Dopameme Rush"" on Aug. 29. Pudgy Party aims to combine party-game charm with blockchain-powered ownership and community-driven play.

""Pudgy Penguins is one of the few web3 brands that has successfully broken through to mainstream audiences, thanks to their strong retail presence and highly engaged community,"" Mythical Games CEO John Linden added. ""We're thrilled to launch Pudgy Party with them and bring this playful IP to gamers around the world. This is exactly the kind of project that shows how web3 can deliver fun, value, and accessibility to everyone.""

Plans for the Pudgy Party game were first unveiled in May 2024. Earlier this week, a soulbound token called ""Early to the Party"" was awarded to those who pre‑registered, offering them a non‑transferable digital badge ahead of the launch.

Pudgy Party is free to download on iOS and Android and follows Pudgy Penguins' launch of its desktop-based Pudgy Worlds game, Solana-based PENGU token, and the rollout of its penguin plushies and other collectibles in Walmart stores last year.

A Pudgy Party spokesperson told The Block that although the new game does not include the PENGU token at launch, the Pudgy Penguins and Mythical Games teams are exploring ""interesting ways"" to integrate PENGU, MYTH, and other tokens in the future.

Pudgy Penguins is currently the second-largest NFT collection by floor price, according to The Block's data dashboard. It ranks fourth by market cap, valued at $417.4 million compared to $2.1 billion for market leader CryptoPunks.

Crypto prices have cooled today, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP all in the red. However, an analyst believes that Bitcoin is poised for its next surge, with significant upside potential ahead.

And while top altcoins await Bitcoin's greenlight, a new meme coin is already experiencing a pump. TOKEN6900 ($T6900) is the SPX6900-inspired meme coin that's going viral in its presale.

It has raised a total of $3 million so far, driven not by flashy branding, but by a shared belief in something bigger: that this project represents the pinnacle of financial regression and it's ready to take over the meme coin market.

Although the presale officially ended on Wednesday, the team has offered one final opportunity to secure the remaining $T6900 at a fixed price of $0.007125. However, this offer is limited, with the official exchange listing scheduled to take place at 2 pm UTC on September 3.

Crypto whales are investing heavily, aware that the growing hype and FOMO could lead to a sudden surge once the token is listed on exchanges. Recently, one whale invested $19,000 in the ICO, showing immense belief and conviction. Does he have information that something big is coming?

According to analyst Bitcoinsensus, Bitcoin is following an identical chart pattern to one formed in 2021 before its ATH, having broken a multi-month resistance level, only to turn it into support and retest it.

In 2021, the level in question was $40,000, but today that level is $110,000. The analyst suggests that this pattern indicates the next Bitcoin uptick is near, paving the way for a “vertical rally” that could push beyond $150K.

Is $BTC about to repeat the 2020 breakout? 📈🚨🔍 Same falling wedge breakout📊 Same retest & sideways range🔥 In 2020, this led to a vertical rally… 2025 setup looks identicalAre we on the edge of liftoff?#Bitcoin #Crypto pic.twitter.com/0vEmwuoDr6

This is excellent news for TOKEN6900 investors, as Bitcoin's upward momentum is likely to cause a surge in altcoin and meme coin prices. Yet TOKEN6900's early stage and untapped potential mean it could be one of the biggest benefactors.

Unlike SPX6900 or other established meme coins, TOKEN6900 has no prior resistance levels, psychological profit-taking targets, or historical trading patterns to limit its upside.

Instead, what matters most for TOKEN6900 is the collective belief in how much people truly value this project. And if it's anything like SPX6900, which peaked at over $2 billion, there's immense upside potential from its initial listing market cap of just $6 million – and there's very little in the way of achieving it.

Regarding tangible price targets, a Cryptonews analyst is predicting 100x gains. 

Although targeting 100x returns may seem ambitious for a new project, the numbers signal why:

Rallying 100x would elevate $T6900's market cap to $600 million – less than 30% of SPX6900's peak valuation. If Bitcoin breaks out and hits new highs, meme coin prices across the board will surge, and it's likely that SPX6900 also reaches new highs.

It's reasonable to expect TOKEN6900 to follow a similar bullish trajectory, especially given its strong momentum and the absence of technical price barriers ahead.

Moreover, its low market capitalization means that liquidity inflows would have a disproportionate price impact, helping it generate gains far more quickly than SPX6900 or other large-cap meme coins.

TOKEN6900 is following the playbook that created millionaires with SPX6900. Traders like Murad turned modest investments into tens of millions of dollars, and thousands of others rode the bullish trend to secure massive gains.

Like SPX6900, TOKEN6900 offers a glimpse into the economic circus that shaped you. It's not here to save the world or sweep you away from the absurdity of late capitalism – but it can help you navigate it. 

SPX6900 has rallied over 10,000% this year on similar rhetoric, outperforming the stock market's 50-year return without any real utility or fundamental value. This shows that collective belief and vibes are enough to send a price skyrocketing.

TOKEN6900 tokenizes attention, farms virality, and embraces the chaos of social-driven finance. It's a project built for the 2025 economy, where brain rot seems to be the new currency.

But with only five days until the launch, potential investors must lock in soon or risk paying a far higher price on exchanges.

Sharps Technology, a medical device and pharmaceutical packaging company that offers smart safety syringe products, announced the closing of a private placement of more than $400 million and the launch of a digital asset treasury strategy, with the principal holding being the cryptocurrency SOL. 

The company previously announced the private placement offering of common stock and stapled warrants with a purchase price of $6.50 per unit. At the closing, the transaction generated more than $400 million, with an additional $600 million possible if all warrants are exercised, increasing the potential total proceeds to $1 billion.

Sharps Technology's stock is currently trading on the NASDAQ under the ticker STSS at around $14.40 per share. 

Investors include financial institutions and digital asset firms such as Bastion Trading, ParaFi, FalconX, Pantera, Monarq, RockawayX, Saba Capital, Syncracy, Arche Capital, Arrington Capital and others.

The New York-based company said it will primarily use the proceeds to acquire the cryptocurrency SOL, a digital asset of the Solana blockchain, and establish its digital treasury operations.

Sharps stated that it will use the additional funds for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 

A single SOL is currently trading at around $209.46, down from its high of $295 in January.  

However, Sharps said it signed a non-binding letter of intent with the Solana Foundation, which has agreed to sell $50 million SOL at a 15% discount to a 30-day time-weighted average price. 

""Solana is capable of handling any tradable asset, everywhere in the world and demand is only increasing,"" Alice Zhang, chief investment officer and board member of Sharps Technology, said in a statement. 

""With the backing of premier financial and digital asset investors, we believe we are well equipped to execute on our vision with our team's extensive experience in the Solana ecosystem.""

THE LARGER TREND

Some medtech players are turning to cryptocurrency as a vehicle for investment and ownership in digital health companies.

In June, Goldeneye 1995 LLC, an affiliate of fintech investor and Ripple's former chief risk officer Greg Kidd, purchased a controlling interest in health monitoring company Know Labs using 1,000 Bitcoin and some extra cash.

Know Labs is a U.S.-based medical device company that develops non-invasive health monitoring tools using radio-microwave spectroscopy to help identify and measure molecules inside and outside of the body. 

Goldeneye purchased the company's common stock by adding the value of 1,000 Bitcoin (selling at the time around $105,160.57 per coin) and some extra cash.

To determine how many shares the LLC received, the total value of the Bitcoin was divided by the company's share price of $0.335. 

Know Labs stated at the time that it planned to keep the 1,000 Bitcoins as part of its financial reserves or assets. 

Bitcoin has since increased in value and is currently trading at around $108,625.79.

This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

A key technical indicator is warning of an early end to the bitcoin BTC$108,517.15 bull market, even as traders continue to position for a continued rally into the year-end.

The indicator under consideration is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator that ranges from 0 to 100. It helps traders gauge the speed and magnitude of recent price movements, typically calculated over a 14-day, 14-week, or 14-month period.

BTC's 14-month RSI is now flashing a bearish divergence, a pattern that occurs when the indicator begins to decline while prices continue to rise. The occurrence of this divergence on the monthly chart indicates that BTC's bull market may be weakening and could potentially transition into a bearish trend.

The monthly chart shows that while BTC reached a new high in the July-August period, surpassing the December peak, the RSI moved in the opposite direction, forming a lower high.

The bearish divergence gains added significance as it coincides with BTC encountering resistance at a key trendline drawn from the previous bull market peaks of December 2017 and November 2021.

To cut to the chase, bulls should stay alert for potential bearish trend reversals. That said, the latest market flows suggest that traders are anticipating continued price gains.

""Blocks suggest traders are gearing up for further gains, with notable activity in December BTC call spreads ($125K/$160K). Ethereum's focus was on tighter topside, with $4,800 strikes active for September, and front-end pressure lifting,"" Jake Ostrovskis, OTC Trader at Wintermute, said in an email Thursday.

Block flows are large transactions privately negotiated over the counter and outside of the public order book. These transactions typically involve institutions and high-net-worth individuals.

The December call spread mentioned by Ostrovskis essentially bets on prices rallying to $160K and higher by the end of the year. The consensus is for a continued rally into the year-end and beyond, with prices reaching as high as $190,000. As of writing, BTC changed hands near $110,500, representing a 4.6% loss for the month, according to CoinDesk data.

Historical data around Bitcoin Magazine's annual U.S. Bitcoin Conference has shown a clear pattern of poor price performance for bitcoin during and just after the event. The indicator didn't disappoint in 2025, with bitcoin BTC$108,517.15 struggling in late May/early June alongside and then following this year's Las Vegas conference.

The logic behind that price action isn't that hard to decipher: in the weeks leading up to the show, conference organizers — looking to sell tickets and generate media coverage — overhype the speakers and what are sure to be ""massive"" announcements.

What follows is the usual cast of influencers, bitcoin OGs and newcomers to the sector (this year the Trumps) extolling ""freedom money,"" ""massive institutional and sovereign adoption,"" and ""bitcoin to the moon.""

How could the price do anything but dump?

For those not paying close attention, Bitcoin Magazine's Bitcoin Asia conference took place this week in Hong Kong.

The featured speakers included Eric Trump, CZ, Adam Back, Balaji Srinivasan and David Bailey. Among the subject matter covered — you guessed it — ""freedom money,"" ""massive institutional and sovereign adoption,"" and ""bitcoin to the moon.""

The price action: sharply lower.

At around $115,000 as attendees began arriving in Hong Kong earlier this week, bitcoin has tumbled to the current $108,400. This included about a 4% dive overnight in the U.S. (Friday in Hong Kong) as David Bailey and Eric Trump took the stage for a chat titled ""Bitcoin Takes Over the World.""

By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)

Bitcoin BTC$108,517.15 has dropped nearly 3% to $109,800 in the past 24 hours, pulling the broader market, including ether (ETH), down with it. But those losses are nothing out of the ordinary, meaning major tokens are trading near recent valuations.

What's new today is that BTC's volatility is bouncing from recent multiyear lows (See Chart of the Day). The 30-day implied volatility, as represented by Volmex's BVIV and Deribit's DVOL indices, has surged above the 100-day simple moving average for the first time since mid-June. Perhaps the price turbulence that some traders predicted for August may unfold in September.

The increase could be noteworthy for stock traders as an early indicator of a potential uptick in Wall Street's VIX. The VIX is inversely correlated with stocks, suggesting there's of a rough day ahead on Wall Street, a possibility underlined by fiat liquidity dynamics.

""Market liquidity pressures are mounting as reserve balances decline and large Treasury settlements approach, leaving equities vulnerable despite lower volatility,"" Michael Kramer, the founder of Mott Capital Management, wrote in the latest edition of the firm's markets update.

One piece of data to keep an eye on is the U.S. core PCE release, due later today.

""This PCE release will shape the Fed's future easing path rather than the September decision itself,"" analysts from crypto exchange Bitunix wrote in an email. ""If data comes in at or below expectations, risk sentiment can hold; but if significantly hotter, the Fed's forward guidance may shift toward a 'one-and-wait' stance. Investors should focus on core services and wage trends, alongside U.S. Treasury yields and the DXY as key drivers of risk appetite.""

In the event of a soft CPI, ether may outperform because traders have been increasingly focusing on Ethereum's native token. That's evident from the ETF flows. This week, the U.S.-listed ETH ETFs have registered a net inflow of over $1 billion, SoSoValue data show. That's close to double the $567 million entering the bitcoin ETFs.

In traditional markets, the spread between the U.S. 10- and two-year Treasury yields has risen to the highest since September 2022. The so-called curve steepening supports the bullish case in gold and bitcoin. Stay alert!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","Chainlink and Pyth Selected to Deliver U.S. Economic Data on Blockchain","https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/08/28/chainlink-to-provide-u-s-department-of-commerce-data-on-chain-for-smart-contract-use","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 09:33:45 GMT","

The native token of the Chainlink network, LINK, surged more than 5% after the network announced a partnership with the U.S. Department of Commerce to bring official government economic data onchain, marking a first-of-its-kind effort to bridge public data infrastructure with blockchain applications.

Pyth Network was also selected alongside Chainlink, sending its native token, PYTH, up nearly 50% after the announcement. 

Key macroeconomic statistics from the Bureau of Economic Analysis — such as Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, and Real Final Sales to Private Domestic Purchasers — are now accessible onchain through Chainlink Data Feeds, the company announced in a blog post on Thursday. Six data points in total are being published, including both absolute levels and annualized percentage changes.

The data is being made available across ten blockchain networks, including Ethereum ETH$4,350.84, Avalanche AVAX$23.48 and Optimism OP$0.6860. Chainlink says the feeds will update monthly or quarterly, mirroring the release schedules of their traditional counterparts.

Meanwhile, Pyth said it will initially offer quarterly GDP data releases going back five years, with expectations to expand the initiative to other economic datasets. 

The initiative, a first for the U.S. government, opens up new possibilities for developers building in DeFi and beyond. 

For example, lending protocols could adjust interest rates based on GDP trends, while prediction markets might incorporate the PCE Index to crowdsource inflation forecasts.

""Bringing U.S. government data onchain unlocks innovative use cases for blockchain markets, such as automated trading strategies, increased composability of tokenized assets, the issuance of new types of digital assets, real-time prediction markets for crowdsourced intelligence, transparent dashboards powered by immutable data, and DeFi protocol risk management based on macroeconomic factors,"" Chainlink's blog post said. 

Bringing economic data sets onto the blockchain also brings efficiency and transparency to data published by the government. 

""The integrity of economic data is essential to global markets, and bringing this data onchain opens up new frontiers for transparency, accessibility, and composability across DeFi, enterprise use cases, and public accountability,"" Pyth said in its statement. 

Chainlink and other crypto industry players have deepened their engagement with U.S. policymakers this year after Donald Trump won the U.S. election last year, with the promise to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world. 

Chainlink had held several meetings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to help clarify how blockchain infrastructure fits within existing broker-dealer and transfer agent rules, as well as other lawmakers to help establish the GENIUS Act, the company said.

By bringing federal economic indicators onchain, Chainlink is attempting to normalize blockchain as a destination for mission-critical public data — offering transparency and composability that traditional systems don't easily support, it said.

The move highlights the U.S. government's push to adopt blockchain technology for public data infrastructure. On Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the Department of Commerce plans to begin publishing economic statistics — including GDP figures — onchain as part of an effort to expand blockchain-based data distribution across federal agencies.

Lutnick said the initiative aims to modernize how official data is shared by making it more transparent and tamper-proof, without disclosing how the government is planning to do so. 

He said the Department hopes to set a precedent for other agencies to follow by moving key indicators like GDP to the blockchain, laying the groundwork for a more secure and interoperable system for releasing government data.

""Secretary Lutnick and the Department of Commerce's visionary stance on data innovation and willingness to embrace blockchain technology is positioning the U.S. as a world leader in finance. But this is just the first step in a long and high-yielding endeavor to rebuild the data infrastructure of the United States of America,"" Pyth said in its statement on Thursday.

UPDATE (Aug 28, 15:00 UTC): Updates the headline and story throuhgout to add more information about the government wanting to use blockchain for public data infrastructure. Also adds that Pyth Network was selected alongside Chainlink.

Quantum Physics Is Bizarre. So Why Have We Loved It for 100 Years?

A survey of Scientific American's century of quantum coverage helps explain the enduring popularity of strange physics

By Jacklin Kwan edited by Clara Moskowitz

We're celebrating 180 years of Scientific American. Explore our legacy of discovery and look ahead to the future.

This year is the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology, according to UNESCO, marking 100 years since quantum mechanics was proposed. The theory hardly needed the extra publicity, though.

Look at any science magazine's trending articles and there's a good chance quantum stories will be among the top rankings. Cute animals aside, quantum physics might be science fans' favorite cover story. But why?

I'm a science journalist with a physics degree, and this question fascinates me. It's not obvious why the public is so enraptured with quantum physics, a field that is notoriously difficult to explain and even more challenging to connect to everyday experience. Yet what I call the “quantum fixation” has prevailed almost since the theory originated.

I had the opportunity to research the perennial popularity of quantum physics for my master's dissertation in science communication, and I chose to dive into the archives of Scientific American in search of an answer. As the U.S.'s oldest continually published magazine—180 years now—it is one of the few publications old enough to have witnessed the birth of the quantum age and has helped introduce it to the public.

Over the course of a few months, I searched the archives for articles with any mention of the word quantum in the past 100 years of print coverage. In analyzing who wrote these articles, what they chose to write about and how they conveyed the often-confusing quantum world to general readers, I hoped to discover what the public found so compelling about quantum physics.

It turns out that what draws us to quantum physics are the same things its founders found repulsive about it.

You have to feel sorry for quantum mechanics sometimes. The scientists that founded it were among its harshest critics. In 1905 Albert Einstein first popularized the word quanta (derived from the Latin term for “how much”) to describe light as composed of discrete packets or bundles of energy known as photons.

At the beginning, quantum theory was just the simple idea that energy came in these discrete units. But even that notion was polarizing because experiments had already shown that light behaved, in many situations, like a wave.

Even then, established scientists struggled to communicate quantum ideas to a general audience. Quantum theory was a significant departure from simple, realist notions of science where we have a straightforward correspondence between the words we use and the objects we're referring to.

Newton's first law of motion, for instance, describes how an object moves in a straight line unless an outside force acts upon it. This mass exists as a real entity with clearly defined and consistent properties we can measure.

But enter the quantum world. When we describe the behavior of light with the same equations we use to describe waves, does that mean light is a wave the same way an earthquake or ripple in the water is? If so, how can it also be particle?

Furthermore, in this world, direct causal relationships, such as Newton's laws of motion, are rewritten into laws of probability. Even the scientists who wrote the laws of quantum mechanics struggled to interpret them.

Physicist John Gribbin, author of the 1984 book In Search of Schrödinger's Cat: Quantum Physics and Reality, covered this early period of turmoil. “I think part of quantum mechanics' appeal was that it was incomprehensible, and so it was sort of like magic,” Gribbin says.

In a 1949 article celebrating Einstein's life, quantum theory was even described as “heresy” by British mathematician and physicist Banesh Hoffmann. The word reflects scientists' discomfort with the notion that a particle could be in two places at once. Einstein himself despised the probabilistic nature of the theory that he made vital contributions to, famously saying, “God does not play dice.”

The quantum's controversy and lack of clarity might have contributed to its early popularity, but that limelight would pale in comparison to the attention it received in the next era. The volume of quantum coverage in Scientific American more than tripled between 1960 to 1980 compared with the 20 years preceding it. Much of this coverage was written by a new generation of researchers who were trained in quantum theory during their postgraduate studies.

During these years, government investment in science grew as the U.S. raced against the Soviet Union to pull off unprecedented feats of innovation. Inventions based on the insights of quantum mechanics, such as atomic clocks and the first lasers and semiconductors, also appeared.

These first quantum technologies hardly seem very “quantum” to people today, who have grown used to them in everyday life. Lasers found their way into CD players, barcode scanners and office printers, and many of us now own thousands of semiconductors in the form of a home computer.

This assumption that anything mundane and familiar, by definition, cannot be quantum also shows up in Scientific American coverage. Over the years the magazine became less and less likely to describe computer chips or lasers as fundamentally “quantum” technologies. In contrast, writers tended to describe the quantum world as “strange,” “bizarre” and “surreal.”

Of course, these are fair adjectives when it comes to quantum theory. The quantum world challenges our basic intuitions and seems to upend everything we thought we knew about how the world works. By the 1990s, quantum articles focused on exploring the fundamental nature of reality. Pieces canvased the idea that the universe is composed of tiny vibrating strings and that quantum mechanics causes it to multiply into an uncountable number of branching universes, among other wild concepts.

My foray into Scientific American's archives showed me that there is no single thing that defines the quantum world. It is not just the discrete energy levels of Einstein's photons, or the wave function that reduces objects to probabilities or the nonlocality and questionable reality of the universe. Instead quantum mechanics casts a wide net over the realm of things we do not fully understand. And therein lies its appeal: though part of us enjoys the comfort of the familiar, the enduring popularity of quantum science shows that humans love feeling challenged, destabilized and mystified about the world we live in.

How Humans Became Upright: Key Changes to Our Pelvis Found

Genetic and anatomical data reveal how the human pelvis acquired its unique shape, enabling our ancestors to walk on two legs

By Katie Kavanagh & Nature magazine 

Humans have been walking on two legs for millions of years.

All vertebrate species have a pelvis, but there is only one that uses it for upright, two-legged walking. The evolution of the human pelvis, and our two-legged gait, dates back 5 million years, but the precise evolutionary process that allowed this to happen has remained a mystery.

Now, researchers have mapped the key structural changes in the pelvis that enabled early humans to first walk on two legs and accommodate giving birth to a big-brained baby. The study, published in Nature on 27 August, compared the embryonic development of the pelvis between humans and other mammals. They found two key evolutionary steps during embryonic development — related to the growth of cartilage and bone in the pelvis — which put humans on a separate evolutionary path from other apes.

“Everything from the base of our skull to the tips of our toes has been changed in modern humans in order to facilitate bipedalism,” says Tracy Kivell, a palaeoanthropologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

Kivell says the study offers a new understanding of how some of those changes came about, not just in living humans, but also in fossils from ancient hominins such as Denisovans. “I think it's exciting in terms of moving forward this area of functional genomics,” she says.

As modern humans evolved, our pelvises developed the wide, bowl-like shape needed to allow upright, two-legged walking — but it is unclear exactly how that happened. “The human pelvis is dramatically different than what you see in chimpanzees and gorillas, so we wanted to set out to try and understand what's happening there,” says study co-author Terence Capellini, a developmental geneticist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

To investigate, the researchers studied anatomical, histological and genomic changes in samples of human pelvis from different stages of development. They then compared human pelvic development with the process in mouse embryos and other primate species, including gibbons and chimpanzees.

The researchers focussed their analysis the formation of the ilium; one of the pelvic bones that supports internal organs and anchors the gluteal muscles to stabilise walking. The team collected samples of primate embryos from museums, where they had been preserved in some cases for hundreds of years. “These museum collections are exceptionally precious; they were collected in the last hundred to two hundred years,” says Capellini.

The analysis identified two key steps in the development of the human ilium which enabled its characteristic shape and therefore its ability to support bipedalism.

The first step occurs during early development of the ilium cartilage. Early bone development begins as a vertical rod of cartilage, 7 weeks after gestation. This process is similar in non-human primates. But what happens next sets the human pelvis apart from other primates — in humans, the ilium cartilage rotates 90 degrees shortly after its formation. This ultimately makes the pelvis short and broad.

The second step unique to humans occurs later in development, at 24 weeks after gestation, when the ilium cartilage ‘ossifies' and is replaced by bone cells. In humans, some of these bone cells form much later than in other primates, which allows the cartilage cells to maintain the shape of the pelvis while it grows.

Together, these developmental quirks help to create a pelvis with the perfect shape for bipedalism.

As well as pinpointing differences between the formation of the pelvis in human and non-human embryos, the researchers identified a series of genetic factors that control how the pelvis develops. They found found five different genes that were involved in creating the molecular signals for cartilage growth and bone formation in the ilium.

“I was impressed with how much work it was, they really did some incredible things”, says Daniel Schmitt, a biological anthropologist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. “It reveals mechanisms that allow changes in [bone] shape that we never knew anything about before, and we can now consider those mechanisms all throughout the body.”

Kivell says the study left her wondering whether DNA from fossilized hominins could help to explain how different genes impact how the human skeleton grows. “I'm curious when [other bone structures] evolved.”

Scientists have pushed back LUCA's origin by hundreds of millions of years.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Life on Earth had to begin somewhere, and scientists think that “somewhere” is LUCA—or the Last Universal Common Ancestor. True to its name, this prokaryote-like organism represents the ancestor of every living thing, from the tiniest of bacteria to the grandest of blue whales. 

While the Cambrian Explosion kickstarted complex life in a major way some 530 million years, the true timeline of life on Earth is much longer. For years, scientists have estimated that LUCA likely arrived on the scene some 4 billion years, which is only 600 million years after the planet's formation. 

But a study from an international team of scientists pushes that timeline back even further to some 4.2 billion years ago, while also discovering some fascinating details about what life for LUCA might've been like. The results of the study were published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. 

The paper reads:

To zero in on exactly when LUCA appeared on Earth, scientists had to work backward. First, the team compared genes in living species and counted the mutations that have occurred since sharing a common ancestor with LUCA. Using a genetic equation based on the time of separation between species, the team worked out that LUCA must've been mucking around on Earth as early as 400 million years after its creation, which puts this organism smack in the middle of the hellish geologic nightmare known as the Hadean Eon. 

“The evolutionary history of genes is complicated by their exchange between lineages,” University of Bristol's Edmund Moody, the lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “We have to use complex evolutionary models to reconcile the evolutionary history of genes with the genealogy of species.”

Not satisfied with just learning its age, the team took things a step further and retraced the physiological characteristics of living species to understand what LUCA must've been like 4.2 billion years ago—and the results gave some surprising answers. The scientists estimate that while LUCA was a simple prokaryote, it likely had an immune system, meaning it was already fighting off primordial viruses. 

“It's clear that LUCA was exploiting and changing its environment, but it is unlikely to have lived alone,” University of Exeter's Tim Lenton, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “Its waste would have been food for other microbes, like methanogens, that would have helped to create a recycling ecosystem.”

While LUCA is the oldest common ancestor we know of, scientists still don't understand how life evolved from its very origins to the early communities of which LUCA is a part. Further studies will need to dive deeper into this primordial history and uncover exactly how you, me, and every other living thing, came to be.

Researchers at Rice University and collaborating institutions have discovered direct evidence of active flat electronic bands in a kagome superconductor. This breakthrough could pave the way for new methods to design quantum materials -- including superconductors, topological insulators and spin-based electronics -- that could power future electronics and computing technologies. The study, published in Nature Communications Aug. 14, centers on the chromium-based kagome metal CsCr₃Sb₅, which becomes superconducting under pressure.

Kagome metals, characterized by their two-dimensional lattices of corner-sharing triangles, have recently been predicted to host compact molecular orbitals, or standing-wave patterns of electrons that could potentially facilitate unconventional superconductivity and novel magnetic orders that can be made active by electron correlation effects. In most materials, these flat bands remain too far from active energy levels to have any significant impact; however, in CsCr₃Sb₅, they are actively involved and directly influence the material's properties.

Pengcheng Dai, Ming Yi and Qimiao Si of Rice's Department of Physics and Astronomy and Smalley-Curl Institute, along with Di-Jing Huang of Taiwan's National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center, led the study.

""Our results confirm a surprising theoretical prediction and establish a pathway for engineering exotic superconductivity through chemical and structural control,"" said Dai, the Sam and Helen Worden Professor of Physics and Astronomy.

The finding provides experimental proof for ideas that had only existed in theoretical models. It also shows how the intricate geometry of kagome lattices can be used as a design tool for controlling the behavior of electrons in solids.

""By identifying active flat bands, we've demonstrated a direct connection between lattice geometry and emergent quantum states,"" said Yi, an associate professor of physics and astronomy.

The research team employed two advanced synchrotron techniques alongside theoretical modeling to investigate the presence of active standing-wave electron modes. They used angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to map electrons emitted under synchrotron light, revealing distinct signatures associated with compact molecular orbitals. Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) measured magnetic excitations linked to these electronic modes.

""The ARPES and RIXS results of our collaborative team give a consistent picture that flat bands here are not passive spectators but active participants in shaping the magnetic and electronic landscape,"" said Si, the Harry C. and Olga K. Wiess Professor of Physics and Astronomy, ""This is amazing to see given that, until now, we were only able to see such features in abstract theoretical models.""

Theoretical support was provided by analyzing the effect of strong correlations starting from a custom-built electronic lattice model, which replicated the observed features and guided the interpretation of results. Fang Xie, a Rice Academy Junior Fellow and co-first author, led that portion of the study.

Obtaining such precise data required unusually large and pure crystals of CsCr₃Sb₅, synthesized using a refined method that produced samples 100 times larger than previous efforts, said Zehao Wang, a Rice graduate student and co-first author.

The work underscores the potential of interdisciplinary research across fields of study, said Yucheng Guo, a Rice graduate student and co-first author who led the ARPES work.

""This work was possible due to the collaboration that consisted of materials design, synthesis, electron and magnetic spectroscopy characterization and theory,"" Guo said.

Co-authors from Rice include Yuefei Huang, Bin Gao, Ji Seop Oh, Han Wu, Zheng Ren, Yuan Fang, Yiming Wang, Ananya Biswas, Yichen Zhang, Ziqin Yue, Boris Yakobson and Junichiro Kono.

Labor Day weekend is here, and with it comes cold beer, hot dogs, and a boatload of deals. The unofficial end of summer brings with it bargains on WIRED-tested gear, including home office essentials and some of our favorite gadgets. For the past few weeks, we've been tracking prices on the gear we recommend to our friends and bringing you the best sale prices.

Check our Best Labor Day Mattress Deals and Labor Day Outdoor Gear Deals stories for additional savings. We've also got some updated roundups for Back to School Deals and Back to School Laptop Deals.

Updated August 29, 2025: We've added 10 new deals from Therabody, Buffy, Hexclad, All-Clad, Petcube, Razer, Bruvi, and TP-Link. We've also ensured accurate pricing throughout and removed expired deals.

https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-blade-16/RZ09-05285EN3-R3U1

The Razer Blade 16 is the best gaming laptop overall. It's got a sleek, clean aesthetic with thin bezels, a fantastic keyboard, a nice OLED screen, and a slim footprint. And while the 16 doesn't feel obtrusive to travel with, it doesn't skimp on performance. Graphics options range all the way up to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090, and base storage starts at 1 terabyte—though, in a first for Razer, you can only choose an AMD CPU. Get more nitty-gritty details in our full review.

This is a match of the best price we've seen for our favorite budget mesh Wi-Fi router. It supports Wi-Fi 6, which should still be fine for most people even though Wi-Fi 7 is already a thing. The Deco X20 has solid coverage and performance, especially with the three routers you'll get with this deal (though singles and two-packs are also on sale if you're in a small space). They're easy to set up and they have optional parental controls and antivirus protection. You can also split the two 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz Wi-Fi bands, which will help if you're running any smart home devices that explicitly require one or the other.

The Sony Bravia 7 II has been on sale for this price for a little while, but we have yet to see it drop lower. It's in our Best TVs buying guide as the pick with the most immersive picture. It has natural yet vivid colors and excellent picture processing. Reviewer Ryan Waniata says it renders 4K and HD scenes “so clearly you'll feel like they're going to spill into your living room.” It could have better black levels and a few more ports, but it's still an excellent set, especially at this price.

The Apple iPad (A16, 2025) is the iPad we recommend for most people. It comes in fun colors like blue and yellow, and it's plenty powerful to handle whatever you'll throw at it on a day-to-day basis—from playing games to streaming videos to browsing the web. It doesn't support Apple Intelligence, which may be a blessing or a curse depending on whom you ask. It does have a modern bezel design around its 11-inch LCD screen, plus USB-C charging, a Touch ID sensor, and two 12-megapixel cameras—one in the back and one for selfies. It also works with many of the best iPad accessories.

The M4 Apple MacBook Air is the best MacBook for most people. This is the cheapest we've seen it. Where some MacBooks are overkill for basic everyday tasks, this lightweight model can handle them with ease—and you won't be paying for performance that you won't use. It has a bright display, long battery life, and support for up to two external displays as well as Apple Intelligence. And while you might want something else if you'll be doing heavy video editing or need a giant screen, the M4 MacBook Air will be capable of handling multiple Google Chrome tabs and apps running in the background. We do wish it had some more ports, but you can always use a USB hub to customize them further.

These are the best noise-canceling earbuds we've tried. They have excellent sound quality and battery life, plus solid control options, and they're comfortable to wear for long periods of time. But where they truly excel is in active noise canceling. They can make a busy subway car or crowded airplane disappear entirely, lending you extra focus or decompression with no effort.

The Fitbit Charge 6 is the best fitness tracker overall. It has gone on sale for $100 in the past, but $125 is a pretty good deal, since it regularly jumps up to full price. It looks nice and has all the features most folks would want, like step counting, sleep tracking, stats on calories burned and workout effectiveness, heart rate readings, and insights into SpO2 levels. It also has a long-lasting battery and integrations with Google Wallet and Google Maps (though it can be used with iOS devices as well as Android). Some of the better features are locked behind a subscription that costs $10 per month, but the gadget still works without that subscription.

This is a great deal for the best electronic sleepbuds, and you'll also get a free travel case. The earbuds are comfortable to wear while you're sleeping, and they have 10-hour battery life and passive noise cancelation as well as excellent audio quality. There's a solid companion app, too, which lets you choose from different Sleep Sounds and access biometric data (which we have not yet tested).

This is a solid deal on the best laptop docking station. The Satechi Dual Dock Stand slightly elevates your laptop for better ergonomics, and it has a collection of ports, including three monitor outputs, several USB ports, and a solid-state drive enclosure. It connects to your laptop via two USB-C cables. If you don't need a full-on docking station, check our guide to the Best USB Hubs.

Branch has made our favorite office chair for years. It has oodles of adjustable elements, including the arms, armrests, seat depth, recline, lumbar support, and seat tilt. The foam cushion seat is comfortable and the mesh backrest is supportive, too. The affordable price tag is icing on the cake, and while it doesn't go on sale very often, you can save 10 percent until the sale ends with code LABORDAY.

If you don't want to spring for the Ergonomic Chair Pro, this is the best budget-friendly office chair and an option worth considering. It's very easy to assemble. and there are a few adjustable areas for a better fit—the armrests, seat, recline, and lumbar support can all be dialed in. There are some fun fabric color options, like blue and orange, though the upholstery does tend to pill and is a magnet for pet hair. Even with its quirks, it will be a definite upgrade if you're still working from the ratty chair you picked up off Craigslist when you first built your home office.

Sitting all day is bad for you! This telescoping desk can be raised up as high as 45 inches, with simple setup and two available sizes. It comes in a few different finishes. The leg motors aren't the quietest, but they work well, and the desk looks great in any setup. For additional recommendations, check our home office buying guide.

This coupon code gets you 20 percent off almost everything on Humanscale's website. Humanscale makes some of the best office chairs. The Freedom Headrest is the best reclining office chair, and it drops from $1,743 to $1,394 with code SEMIANNUAL20. Editor Julian Chokkattu said, “This chair gracefully supports my back like a mother gently laying a baby in a crib.” We also like the Humanscale Path, which is great for tight spaces and even comes in armless versions. It falls from $1,294 to $1,035 after code.

Ettitude makes the best cooling bamboo sheets. This sheet set feels soft and silky, but stays cool to the touch, making it a great option for hot sleepers. The sheets are breathable and lightweight, and they're available in seven different colors to match your bedroom decor. There's also a 60-day trial period so you can make sure you like them before committing.

Prefer percale? This is the best lightweight percale cooling sheet set. The sheets are supremely breathable and soft, so they're perfect for summer or particularly hot sleepers. The organic cotton is crisp without being crinkly or papery, and the eight different color options will mean there's at least one to coordinate with your bedroom.

The Silk & Snow S&S Organic Mattress is our favorite organic latex mattress. The latex-wrapped coils help to alleviate any tension or pressure points while you're sleeping, and it's especially great for side sleepers. You can also get two pillows or a sheet set for free with your purchase. Check our roundup of Labor Day Mattress Deals for additional expert recommendations.

The Buffy Breeze is one of my favorite comforters. It's been on my bed since I started testing it more than 3 years ago. It's cooling in the summer, and its lightweight warmth is just the right amount of comfy for hot nights. But in the winter, it still works well to keep you warm, especially if you throw another blanket on top of it. It isn't officially marketed as down alternative, but I do like it as an alternative to down.

Need to upgrade your bedding? This sleep set from Buffy is a solid way to do it. You'll get the Buffy Cloud Comforter, Breeze Sheet Set, Breeze Duvet Cover, and two Cloud Pillows at a 30 percent discount. WIRED reviewer and bedding expert Nena Farrell uses the Cloud Comforter for almost all of her testing. She recommends the Breeze sheets in our cooling sheets buying guide, and the Cloud pillow in our pillows buying guide.

This is one of our favorite organic mattresses and it's extremely customizable. Each side can have different levels of firmness—so if you prefer firm, but your bed partner prefers soft, you'll both be set. There's a cover that zips over the whole system, and you get a 100-night trial to swap the latex layers out so you can fine-tune your desired firmness. The mattress is made of organic cotton, latex, and wool, and it has the certifications we look for in organic mattresses.

This is the bed frame I'm currently using, and I love it very much. Assembly wasn't my favorite, but once I got it all put together, I fell in love. It has a drawer at the foot of the bed that's handy for storing extra linens or off-season clothing, and it's sturdy too. I also appreciate that the platform lets me maneuver my mattress easily so I don't have to fight to change my sheets.

Brooklyn Bedding is offering 30 percent off sitewide for its Labor Day sale. If you're a retired or active military member, you can get an additional 5 percent off by verifying through ID Me. We like a few different products from Brooklyn Bedding. Its CopperFlex 401 Mattress Topper is the best mattress topper overall, and it's on sale in the queen size for $419 ($180 off). Brooklyn Bedding also makes our favorite firm mattress, the Plank—on sale for $1,072 ($460 off).

This well-made, luxurious sofa is one of the best couches you can buy online. Operations manager Scott Gilbertson called it the best-looking and most comfortable couch he's ever sat on. The website lets you order swatches and pick the layout you want, and you can even get a full-size printout to make sure the couch will look right in your living space. There are dozens of options for upholstery, legs, and cushion fill, so you can create the couch of your dreams. For a more affordable option, we also like the Benchmade Modern Laguna (pictured above) on sale for $2,397 ($599 off). “My family and I have been sitting on it for a year and a half now, and the single cushion (as well as the rest of the couch's cushions) is comfortable and supportive,” says reviewer Nena Farrell.

We've recommended the Albany Park Barton in our couch buying guide for years. It's soft and supportive, with deep seats and wide arms so you can put down your coffee cup or phone without needing an extra table. There are many different fabrics to choose from, and you can choose the stain of the wooden legs too. Assembly wasn't too difficult—just be prepared to take out a lot of recycling afterward. The couch also comes with a 30-day trial so you can try it before committing.

This sale runs the gamut from kitchenware and mattress toppers to bedding, towels, and furniture. We haven't tested most of the brands in the sale, but if you're shopping for something like guest bedroom linens or new dining room chairs, you might find what you're looking for.

The Joybird Eliot Sleeper Sofa is comfy and has a slick, MCM silhouette. It's one of the best couches you can buy online. It's custom-made for you, with dozens of options and finishes available (including bright pink velvet, which I chose.) It has deep seats that can be removed to reveal a pull-out mattress (which is also surprisingly comfortable). If you're in the market for a custom couch, this sale is worth a look. The deal ends on September 1.

This is the best budget-friendly travel pillow. The outside is covered in a soft fabric made with recycled water bottles, and the memory foam construction is nice and firm, with high sides so you can easily lean your head toward your shoulder. It also has a chin strap to prevent your head from falling forward. Make sure you choose the option with the carrying case if that's important to you!

I first started using this when I formerly tested meal kits for WIRED, and I still reach for it nearly every time I process produce in my kitchen. It's oversized, measuring 12 by 16 inches, and it doesn't slip around on my countertops. I like the built-in juice groove and the fact that I can still store it in my cupboards even though it's bigger than standard cutting boards. It has zero knife damage, is BPA-free, and is dishwasher-safe.

When I tried Hexclad, I liked it just fine. Really! A score of 5 is “recommended with reservations.” It's important to know what you're getting, and what you're getting is easy-to-clean cookware that works fine. I'd prefer to use two separate pans—a nonstick and a stainless steel—but I understand that some people want a one-and-done cooking companion. These frying pans are worth considering on sale, like they are right now. You'll get three pans in 12-, 10-, and 8-inch sizes, plus their matching lids. If you know you want hybrid cookware, check out this sale.

The All-Clad Factory Seconds sale is one of the best, most reliable ways to save on the investment that is All-Clad. You'll need to enter your email address to access the sale. There's a reason why professional chefs reach for their trusty All-Clad constantly—this cookware is simply fantastic. It's the gold standard. And it's backed by a lifetime warranty! These Factory Seconds items aren't in perfect condition. Sometimes there's packaging damage, and sometimes there are minimal scuffs. Each item has details listed on the product page. This sale is absolutely massive and worth checking out if you need a cookware upgrade of any kind. Might I suggest the 10.5-inch All-Clad Fry Pan for $70 ($80 off)? Or perhaps get ahead of the holidays with the All-Clad Nonstick Large Roaster for $130 ($90 off)? The list goes on, but the sale will end in a few days' time.

This is featured in our guide to the Best Kitchen Composters. It has the fastest compost breakdown of any model we tried. It has some quirks, like a lid that requires two hands to open and the machine's tendency to make a loud whirring noise as it works. But it's a great entry-level kitchen composter, and it doesn't drop in price very often.

The Bruvi BV-01 is the best pod coffee machine. It's super-cute and easy to use, with a large touchscreen, fast brewing times, remote scheduling, and used pod collection. The best part, though, is that the proprietary B-Pods are biodegradable. They make perfectly fine coffee, tea, or espresso, and they don't sit in a landfill forever. This price matches the best we've seen. You'll get the coffee maker itself, plus 20 B-Pods in a variety of flavors.

The Ooni Volt is the very best electric pizza oven. It can heat up to 850 degrees Fahrenheit, and the triple-pane glass door always lets you see what's going on. And while you might miss out on some of the vibes that come with a fire-powered oven, the Volt can safely be used indoors and outdoors—so you won't have to brave the coming winter chill (or supply propane refills) to get your paws on some good 'za.

Hydroviv makes one of the best shower water filters we've tested. The bacteriostatic showerhead was able to filter total chlorine down to undetectable levels in reviewer Matthew Korfhage's chloramine-treated water. This deal is for the automatically replenishing subscription bundle. Hydroviv says you should replace filters every six months, but you can pause or cancel that subscription if you decide you want to order them separately.

Our favorite feeder pet camera goes on sale relatively often, but this is still a solid deal since it regularly jumps up to full price. It has 1080p streaming video, night vision up to 30 feet, two-way audio, and 8x zoom. What sets this camera apart is its treat- or food-dispensing capabilities. Fill up the container with your pet's chosen treats, and you can use the app to toss them remotely. The best features, like motion and sound alerts and 90 days of video storage, are locked behind a Petcube Care subscription which costs $10 per month.

Our favorite electric scooter, the Apollo Go, manages to strike an excellent balance between features and price. It weighs 46 pounds and has maximum speeds of 28 miles per hour, though you can tweak top speed, brake strength, and acceleration response in the app. It also has a few extra features like turn signals, a bell, and self-healing tires. We haven't seen it sell for less.

The XPress 750 is our favorite ebike for folks on a budget. The frame is comfortable and the pedaling feels natural, so it feels more like a classic bike and less like a lean, mean electric machine. The range could be better, but you'll have no trouble zooming around your neighborhood at top speeds of 28 mph. And the LCD display and controls are simple and easy to use, so this is an especially great bike for beginners.

Breeo makes the best upgrade firepit. The American-made pit has a fire bowl that's 2 feet wide, so it'll fit pre-cut wood, and there are a ton of accessories available. (We especially like the live-fire pizza oven, on sale for $723—a $128 discount). The hefty, sturdy base and natural patina (on the Corten steel option) make this a centerpiece worthy of any backyard.

WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu tested and loved this outdoor couch and armchair set. The couches come with OuterShell, which is a built-in cover that helps protect the couch cushions from the elements (and stray bird poops). The performance fabric is made from recyclable materials, and the covers are machine washable. Julian still has to see how the couch fares in New York winters, but so far, it's sturdy and comfortable. We like that the couch is made with Forest Stewardship Council-certified wood. It's also backed by a 10-year warranty and available in four different fabric options.

This is a match of the best price we've seen for our favorite Theragun. It's the same model used by many professional sports teams, and it has heat therapy as well as an optional cold therapy attachment (the latter is a separate purchase). There's a vibration head, LED light therapy, and a guided breathwork option too. If you want to invest in your recovery routine, this is a good way to do it.

The Therabody TheraFace Mask is an LED face mask with vibration. It has red, blue, and near-infrared LEDs, plus vibration motors to help you relax during your three- or nine-minute sessions. We like the cordless, hands-free design, though we wish it had a few more bells and whistles like app controls or a battery indicator. If you've been eyeing it, though, it rarely gets cheaper than it is right now.

The Plunge Original pool being used to refill squirt guns during a water fight, which is not its intended purpose.

WIRED reviewer Martin Cizmar liked this full-featured cold plunge tub almost as much as his top pick, and it's significantly cheaper. It has a sleek, modern aesthetic, and the acrylic walls are easy to clean. We regret to inform you that while it is unpleasant to submerge yourself in near-freezing water, it has a number of notable health and wellness benefits that our testers have personally felt. If you want a great-looking cold plunge tub and you don't want to overpay for it, this deal is worth checking out.

by Todd Bishop on August 29, 2025 at 10:38 amAugust 29, 2025 at 10:50 am

A group that infiltrated Microsoft's headquarters building this week disputed the company's account of the incident — describing their sit-in as nonviolent and saying the “listening devices” allegedly left behind were phones that fell from their pockets when they were arrested.

“As Brad himself admits, if someone were to plant listening devices, this is not how they would do it,” said Hossam Nasr, one of the leaders of the group No Azure for Apartheid, referring to comments made by Microsoft President Brad Smith after seven members of the group occupied his office Tuesday afternoon. “If anything, we would like our phones back, please.”

The group, which is calling on Microsoft to cut ties with Israel over the alleged use of its technology against Palestinians in Gaza, also disputed the company's assertion that its members do not represent elements of its workforce, and questioned the sincerity of Microsoft executives in addressing the issues the protesters have raised. 

The comments at a Thursday press conference came shortly after Microsoft said it fired two additional employees — bringing the total this week to four — in connection with their actions in recent protests on the Redmond campus. 

The company said in a statement that the workers “were terminated due to serious violations of established company policies and our code of conduct, including participating in recent on-site demonstrations that created significant safety concerns for our employees.”

The statement added, “We are continuing to investigate the conduct on our campus and work with law enforcement to help ensure the safety of all our employees,” noting that “such conduct is entirely unacceptable and stands in direct opposition to our company values and policies.” 

During the occupation on Tuesday, protesters made their way into the building at Microsoft's Redmond headquarters where CEO Satya Nadella and other top executives work. Inside Smith's office, they locked arms, chanted “Free Palestine,” livestreamed their actions on Twitch, and put furniture against the door while demanding talks with company leadership. 

After resisting security personnel, seven protesters were removed by Redmond police and arrested on charges including trespassing, obstruction, and resisting arrest. 

Outside, another group of protesters was able to temporarily raise a Palestinian flag on one of the flagpoles outside Microsoft's nearby Executive Briefing Center.

Twenty protesters were arrested the prior week, on Wednesday, Aug. 20, after refusing to disperse from an encampment that they created for a second day in front of the Microsoft sign in the company's East Campus plaza, which they covered in red paint to symbolize blood. 

Speaking this week, Smith cited the company's commitment to upholding its human rights principles and terms of service in the Middle East; maintaining a culture of trust and open dialogue with its employees; and keeping the workplace safe and secure. 

He acknowledged the human toll of the conflict, citing the 1,139 people killed in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack in Israel and the 61,000 civilians who have died in Gaza, and said Microsoft's role is “to provide technology in a principled and ethical way.”

At the same time, Smith said the protesters' actions were not acceptable. 

“Obviously, when seven folks do as they did today, storm a building, occupy an office, lock other people out of the office … that's not OK,” he said. While Microsoft respects lawful freedom of expression, he said, the company also needs to keep its private workplace safe and secure.

The group on Thursday disputed the characterization that it stormed the building. Nasr said their sit-in was “completely nonviolent” and that Microsoft responded with “brute force, repression, retaliation and lies.”

A larger point of contention is the effectiveness of internal dissent and debate. Smith said Tuesday that Microsoft has a “culture of trust with our employees” and that executives read employee feedback and take it seriously. 

Smith told reporters that the protests are “not necessary in order to get us to pay attention,” and noted that they distract from the dialogue the company is having with internal groups of different backgrounds, faiths, and cultures, including Palestinian allies.

At their press conference Thursday afternoon, protesters called these assertions inaccurate, saying that extensive efforts to use “proper channels” were ignored. 

Anna Hattle, a worker who was fired this week, said a petition with more than 2,000 employee signatures demanding the company cut ties with the Israeli military was sent to every Microsoft executive in May and received no response. 

Protesters also offered other examples of what they called suppression. Nisreen Jaradat, another worker who was fired, alleged that Microsoft Security specifically targeted protesters carrying the scroll of petition signatures, and tore that scroll during one protest. 

Microsoft said earlier this year that it found no evidence its technologies were used by the Israeli military to harm civilians in Gaza. However, it acknowledged limits as to what it could verify, citing a lack of visibility into use of its technology on private servers outside its cloud.

The company recently launched a new investigation into a report from The Guardian alleging that its Azure cloud platform was used by the Israeli military in mass surveillance in Gaza. 

Smith said The Guardian “did a fair job in its reporting.” After the paper contacted the company for the story, he said, Microsoft was able to determine that some of the information was false, some was true, and “much of what they reported now needs to be tested.”

Protesters on Thursday rejected another investigation as insufficient, demanding instead that Microsoft immediately end all contracts and pay reparations to the Palestinian people.

Tesla has asked a judge to nix the $243 million verdict lodged against the company in a lawsuit involving its Autopilot system, or to allow a new trial to occur, according to a new court filing.

The company's lawyers argue that the verdict, which a jury made earlier this month, “flies in the face of basic Florida tort law, the Due Process Clause, and common sense.” This latest filing by Tesla lawyers tries, once again, to rest all of the blame on the driver George McGee, who helped cause the crash. 

The jury in the case ultimately decided that the driver deserved two-thirds of the blame, and attributed one-third to Tesla.

The high-profile case centered around a 2019 crash in Florida. McGee was driving a Tesla Model S at night and using the company's Autopilot driver assistance system — which is a less capable system than the more fully featured “Full Self-Driving (Supervised)” software. Both systems require the driver to keep their hands on the wheel.

As he approached a perpendicularly parked SUV, neither McGee nor the Autopilot system applied the brakes. McGee's car blew a stop sign and hit the SUV, killing 20-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon and severely injuring her boyfriend Dillon Angulo.

McGee was sued separately and settled with the victims. This week, we learned that Tesla rejected a settlement offer of $60 million from the victims a few months before the verdict was rendered.

Tesla's lawyers argue in the new filing that product liability law is supposed to penalize manufacturers whose cars “perform in ways that dangerously defy ordinary consumers' expectations or are unreasonably dangerous.”

“That is not this case — not in the slightest,” they wrote. They say McGee's “extraordinary recklessness” was to blame, as he was reaching for his phone when the crash occurred — a fact he admitted to in his own case. 

Allowing the verdict to stand, they argue, would “deter innovation, confound consumer expectations, and lead manufacturers to abandon safety enhancements for fear of being subjected to large punishments when a driver misuses their product.”

Tesla's lawyers also take shots at the opposing lawyers in the filing, claiming they “overwhelmed this jury with a flood of highly prejudicial but irrelevant evidence — about data preservation, Elon Musk, and dissimilar accidents.” 

“Plaintiffs' counsel ensured that this trial was never actually about the 2019 Tesla Model S or the accident caused by McGee's reckless driving,” they wrote. 

Brett Schreiber, a lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said in an email “the motion is the latest example of Tesla and Musk's complete disregard for the human cost of their defective technology.”

“The jury heard all the facts and came to the right conclusion that this was a case of shared responsibility, but that does not discount the integral role Autopilot and the company's misrepresentations of its capabilities played in the crash that killed Naibel and permanently injured Dillon,” Schreiber continued in the email. “We are confident the court will uphold this verdict, which serves not as an indictment of the autonomous vehicle industry, but of Tesla's reckless and unsafe development and deployment of its Autopilot system.”

Article updated to include a statement from Brett Schreiber, a lead attorney for the plaintiffs.

WhatsApp said on Friday that it fixed a security bug in its iOS and Mac apps that was being used to stealthily hack into the Apple devices of “specific targeted users.”

The Meta-owned messaging app giant said in its security advisory that it fixed the vulnerability, known officially as CVE-2025-55177, which was used alongside a separate flaw found in iOS and Macs, which Apple fixed last week and tracks as CVE-2025-43300.

Apple said at the time that the flaw was used in an “extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.” Now we know that dozens of WhatsApp users were targeted with this pair of flaws.

Donncha Ó Cearbhaill, who heads Amnesty International's Security Lab, described the attack in a post on X as an “advanced spyware campaign” that targeted users over the past 90 days, or since the end of May. Ó Cearbhaill described the pair of bugs as a “zero-click” attack, meaning it does not require any interaction from the victim, such as clicking a link, to compromise their device.

The two bugs chained together allow an attacker to deliver a malicious exploit through WhatsApp that's capable of stealing data from the user's Apple device. 

Per Ó Cearbhaill, who posted a copy of the threat notification that WhatsApp sent to affected users, the attack was able to “compromise your device and the data it contains, including messages.”

It's not immediately clear who, or which spyware vendor, is behind the attacks. 

When reached by TechCrunch, Meta spokesperson Margarita Franklin confirmed the company detected and patched the flaw “a few weeks ago” and that the company sent “less than 200” notifications to affected WhatsApp users. 

The spokesperson did not say, when asked, if WhatsApp has evidence to attribute the hacks to a specific attacker or surveillance vendor.

This is not the first time that WhatsApp users have been targeted by government spyware, a kind of malware capable of breaking into fully patched devices with vulnerabilities not known to the vendor, known as zero-day flaws.

In May, a U.S. court ordered spyware maker NSO Group to pay WhatsApp $167 million in damages for a 2019 hacking campaign that broke into the devices of more than 1,400 WhatsApp users with an exploit capable of planting NSO's Pegasus spyware. WhatsApp brought the legal case against NSO, citing a breach of federal and state hacking laws, as well as its own terms of service.

Earlier this year, WhatsApp disrupted a spyware campaign that targeted around 90 users, including journalists and members of civil society across Italy. The Italian government denied its involvement in the spying campaign. Paragon, whose spyware was used in the campaign, later cut off Italy from its hacking tools for failing to investigate the abuse.

Meta says it's changing the way it trains AI chatbots to prioritize teen safety, a spokesperson exclusively told TechCrunch, following an investigative report on the company's lack of AI safeguards for minors.

The company says it will now train chatbots to no longer engage with teenage users on self-harm, suicide, disordered eating, or potentially inappropriate romantic conversations. Meta says these are interim changes, and the company will release more robust, long-lasting safety updates for minors in the future.

Meta spokesperson Stephanie Otway acknowledged that the company's chatbots could previously talk with teens about all of these topics in ways the company had deemed appropriate. Meta now recognizes this was a mistake.

“As our community grows and technology evolves, we're continually learning about how young people may interact with these tools and strengthening our protections accordingly,” said Otway. “As we continue to refine our systems, we're adding more guardrails as an extra precaution — including training our AIs not to engage with teens on these topics, but to guide them to expert resources, and limiting teen access to a select group of AI characters for now. These updates are already in progress, and we will continue to adapt our approach to help ensure teens have safe, age-appropriate experiences with AI.” 

Beyond the training updates, the company will also limit teen access to certain AI characters that could hold inappropriate conversations. Some of the user-made AI characters that Meta makes available on Instagram and Facebook include sexualized chatbots such as “Step Mom” and “Russian Girl.” Instead, teen users will only have access to AI characters that promote education and creativity, Otway said.

The policy changes are being announced just a two weeks after a Reuters investigation unearthed an internal Meta policy document that appeared to permit the company's chatbots to engage in sexual conversations with underage users. “Your youthful form is a work of art,” read one passage listed as an acceptable response. “Every inch of you is a masterpiece – a treasure I cherish deeply.” Other examples showed how the AI tools should respond to requests for violent imagery or sexual imagery of public figures.

Meta says the document was inconsistent with its broader policies, and has since been changed – but the report has sparked sustained controversy over potential child safety risks. Shortly after the report released, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) launched an official probe into the company's AI policies. Additionally, a coalition of 44 state attorneys general wrote to a group of AI companies including Meta, emphasizing the importance of child safety and specifically citing the Reuters report. “We are uniformly revolted by this apparent disregard for children's emotional well-being,” the letter reads, “and alarmed that AI Assistants are engaging in conduct that appears to be prohibited by our respective criminal laws.”

Otway declined to comment on how many of Meta's AI chatbot users are minors, and wouldn't say whether the company expects its AI user base to decline as a result of these decisions.

Update 10:35AM PT: This story was updated to note that these are interim changes, and that Meta plans to update its AI safety policies further in the future.

Decentralized social network Mastodon says it can't comply with Mississippi's age verification law — the same law that saw rival Bluesky pull out of the state — because it doesn't have the means to do so. 

The social nonprofit explains that Mastodon doesn't track its users, which makes it difficult to enforce such legislation. Nor does it want to use IP address-based blocks, as those would unfairly impact people who were traveling, it says.

The statement follows a lively back-and-forth conversation earlier this week between Mastodon founder and CEO Eugen Rochko and Bluesky board member and journalist Mike Masnick. In the conversation, published on their respective social networks, Rochko claimed, “there is nobody that can decide for the fediverse to block Mississippi.” (The Fediverse is the decentralized social network that includes Mastodon and other services, and is powered by the ActivityPub protocol.)

“And this is why real decentralization matters,” said Rochko.

Masnick pushed back, questioning why Mastodon's individual servers, like the one Rochko runs at mastodon.social, would not also be subject to the same $10,000 per user fines for noncompliance with the law.  

At the time of our reporting on this exchange, Mastodon gGmbH, the community-funded nonprofit organization, didn't respond to a request for comment.

On Friday, however, the nonprofit shared a statement with TechCrunch to clarify its position, saying that while Mastodon's own servers specify a minimum age of 16 to sign up for its services, it does not “have the means to apply age verification” to its services.

That is, the Mastodon software doesn't support it. The Mastodon 4.4 release in July 2025 added the ability to specify a minimum age for sign-up and other legal features for handling terms of service, partly in response to increased regulation around these areas. The new feature allows server administrators to check users' ages during sign-up, but the age-check data is not stored.

That means individual server owners have to decide for themselves if they believe an age verification component is a necessary addition. 

The nonprofit says Mastodon is currently unable to provide “direct or operational assistance” to the broader set of Mastodon server operators. Instead, it encourages owners of Mastodon and other Fediverse servers to make use of resources available online, such as the IFTAS library, which provides trust and safety support for volunteer social network moderators. The nonprofit also advises server admins to observe the laws of the jurisdictions where they are located and operate.

Mastodon notes that it's “not tracking, or able to comment on, the policies and operations of individual servers that run Mastodon.”

“One of the reasons Mastodon was founded was to allow different jurisdictions to have social media that is independent of the U.S.,” per the statement shared with TechCrunch. “People are free to choose to have their account on a Mastodon server whose policies meet their needs.”

It's 10 o'clock somewhere. Do you know if your children are mitochondrially challenged? That's apparently one major reason why kids in America are so unwell, according to antivaxxer-turned-health-secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Kennedy made the wild claim at a bill signing ceremony in Texas held Wednesday. After saying that he knows what a healthy child looks like, he stated, “I'm looking at kids as I walk through the airports today, as I walk down the street, and I see these kids that are just overburdened with mitochondrial challenges, with inflammation—you can tell from their faces, from their body movements, and from their lack of social connection. And I know that's not how our children are supposed to look.”

Though it might go without saying, there's absolutely zero solid evidence that American kids' mitochondria are being “challenged,” whatever on Earth that's supposed to mean.

Mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell, responsible for generating most of the energy a cell uses to carry out its tasks.

There are genuine medical conditions directly caused by dysfunctional mitochondria. These are typically rare and inherited genetic disorders, though some can take until adulthood for their symptoms to manifest. Other chronic conditions may cause or are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, such as Alzheimer's disease and even the normal aging process. In Alzheimer's (and likely other diseases), damaged mitochondria could very well be a contributing factor to the progression of the disease and its symptoms.

These real conditions are not proof that everyone's mitochondria are on the fritz, however, much less the mitochondria of the nation's kids. Scientists are still trying to understand the role of our mitochondria in certain chronic health problems—research that's very much still in its infancy. In many cases, for instance, impaired mitochondria could simply be a marker of a disease, not a causative trigger, so attempting to “fix” it wouldn't even help treat someone's underlying illness.

This lack of certainty hasn't stopped alternative medicine practitioners and other flavors of medical quacks from turning so-called mitochondrial dysfunction into a popular bogeyman for all that plagues us—the same crowds that RFK Jr. is most popular with. There's now a rich world of untested supplements and other treatments marketed to boost your mitochondria.

It should also go without saying that no one, least of all a brainworm-addled health secretary, can tell whether someone's mitochondria are in trouble by staring at their faces.

Kennedy's comments are only the latest sign that the HHS chief cares little about the actual issues facing the country. And his “Make America Healthy Again” agenda has repeatedly focused on unsupported and often meaningless explanations for Americans' ailing health.

RFK Jr. and his HHS have regularly endorsed removing certain artificial food dyes from ice cream, fast food, and candy snacks, for instance. And one of the bills he celebrated during the signing ceremony will require food manufacturers in Texas to post labels warning people that their products contain some of these dyes and other common additives.

Leaving aside the weak evidence tying these dyes to health problems, these foods are primarily unhealthy due to high levels of sugar, salt, and fat. To put it bluntly, that bag of M&Ms is not suddenly going to become a health food because its colors are all naturally sourced. Other common ingredients singled out by RFK Jr., like seed oils, have even less evidence of potential harm; some seed oils are probably healthier than other popular alternatives.

The CDC Implosion Continues as Staff Plan Walkout

RFK Jr. has also succeeded in removing or heavily restricting access to several vaccines, including the mRNA covid-19 vaccines that quite literally saved millions of lives during the pandemic. These decisions have been so disastrous that they fueled the implosion of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Several top CDC officials have resigned or been fired this week, including its director, because RFK Jr. and his allies circumvented the CDC and the typical evidence-reviewing process in pushing through their vaccine policy changes.

RFK Jr.'s inane ramblings are easy to poke fun at. But his nonsensical beliefs have become the driving force behind the country's public health agenda. And everyone, including kids with perfectly healthy mitochondria, is now going to suffer as a result.

The CDC and FDA issued a recall notice on Thursday, warning consumers about brown eggs that have been linked to a salmonella outbreak in 14 states. The eggs, sourced from Country Eggs of Lucerne Valley, California, have sickened at least 95 people and hospitalized 18. No deaths have been reported.

The cage-free eggs have been sold under brand names that include Nagatoshi Produce, Misuho, Nijiya Markets, and Country Eggs, according to a notice posted by the CDC.

The eggs were also sold using the description “sunshine/omega-3 golden” yolk (1/15 Dozen fresh eggs bulk) to food service retailers with the same codes and sell-by dates listed above, according to the FDA. Consumers are encouraged to discard any recalled eggs.

The CDC provided a map showing the 14 states where they've identified illnesses from the salmonella outbreak.

The states, along with the number of cases:

The CDC notes that the actual number of people sickened by this outbreak is likely much higher than the number the agency is reporting because most people who get sick don't require medical care and are never tested for salmonella.

The people who've become sick from this outbreak range in age from 1 to 91 years old, with a median age of 29. Fifty-five percent have been identified as female, with 45% of those who've fallen ill being male.

The CDC also includes a racial breakdown for those who've become sick, with 62% white, 37% Asian, and 1% Black. Twenty-four percent are identified as Hispanic, while 76% are non-Hispanic, according to the ethnic data published by the CDC.

Public health investigators are using a system called Pulsenet to identify illnesses that might be part of this outbreak. The CDC's Pulsenet includes a national database of “DNA fingerprints of bacteria” that allows investigators to track bacteria using whole genome sequencing (WGS). 

From the CDC's website:

WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are closely related genetically. This suggests that people in this outbreak got sick from the same food.

Based on WGS analysis, bacteria from 94 people's samples had predicted resistance to nalidixic acid and nonsusceptibility to ciprofloxacin (NSC); this NSC strain is related to a strain of Salmonella Enteritidis isolated from chicken, eggs, and backyard poultry. Most people with Salmonella illness recover without antibiotics. However, if antibiotics are needed, some illnesses in this outbreak may not be treatable with some commonly recommended antibiotics and may require a different antibiotic choice. More information is available at the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) site.

FDA conducted traceback based on where sick people reported shopping or eating eggs and dishes containing eggs during the timeframe of interest. Country Eggs, LLC was identified as a common supplier.

Pretty neat, when you think about it. Too bad the Trump regime is doing everything it can to destroy the agency. Here's hoping the folks at the CDC can continue to do their important work now and into the future.

They face a 120 day deadline

The U.S. government has revoked waivers to U.S. technology exports granted to Intel, Samsung, and SK hynix that permitted these companies to export advanced wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) from America to their Chinese facilities. The companies now face a 120-day deadline before these exceptions are lifted, after which they must obtain official licenses to continue shipping tools and parts to their Chinese facilities, reports Bloomberg.

For Samsung and SK Hynix in particular, the impact could be severe as they run major 3D NAND production facilities in China and need to ensure that their Chinese fabs operate on advanced nodes. A significant share of their DRAM and NAND output comes from Chinese facilities, so without continued U.S. authorization, these production lines may face disruption, which will add pressure to global memory supply and potentially accelerate a shift of high-tech manufacturing away from China. After exiting both the 3D NAND and SSD businesses several years ago, Intel no longer produces memory in China (though the Dalian fab that belongs to Solidigm, an SK hynix company, continues to operate), but the company still has assembly and test facilities in Chengdu as well as Intel Labs R&D operations that need advanced tools from the U.S.

While the new restrictions do not immediately halt operations, they create substantial uncertainty for Samsung, SK hynix, and to some degree Intel. The option to apply for licenses exists, but there is no assurance of approval, which forces these companies to prepare for the possibility of being cut off from the essential tools that are used in their fabs. Since the possibility of getting the licenses exists, it makes these companies vulnerable to the decisions of the U.S. government and more likely to abide to demands of President Trump's administration demands during negotiations.

After the U.S. introduced new export controls in October 2022, controls that targeted China's access to advanced tools used to make logic chips under 16nm, DRAM under 18nm, or NAND with 128+ layers, all companies operating fabs in China had to obtain export licenses on WFE they shipped to their Chinese facilities. To avoid major disruptions to global memory chip supply chains, The U.S. government granted temporary waivers to select American and multinational companies, including Intel, Samsung, and SK hynix, allowing these companies to maintain and upgrade their Chinese fabs.

However, without these waivers or licenses, Chinese fabs that belong to Samsung and SK hynix will begin to trail their production facilities in South Korea, which means that they will lose their business appeal to these companies in several years. Also, without spare parts from American companies, it will be hard to maintain operations in the long-term future. It should be noted that CXMT, SMIC, and YMTC has never secured U.S. export licenses for American chipmaking equipment, and are in the U.S. Department of Commerce's Entity List, which means that they are unlikely to get an export license at all. Nonetheless, they continue to operate their fabs in China.

It is noteworthy that while Micron (assembly and test operations) and TSMC (Fab 16 that can make chips on 12nm, 16nm, and 28nm process technologies) continue to operate rather sophisticated facilities in China, the U.S. government has not revoked their export license waivers.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hi. I'm Dr Priya Jaisinghani, an endocrinologist and obesity medicine specialist. 

There's a growing but often overlooked epidemic among people living with type 2 diabetes: MASLD, or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, formerly known as NAFLD. 

While we routinely monitor for retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy in individuals living with diabetes, liver health has been left behind, but the data are striking. Over 70% of individuals with type 2 diabetes have MASLD. About half of them already have the more aggressive form, MASH, and 1 in 5 have advanced fibrosis. 

Still, awareness among patients and clinicians remains alarmingly low, and liver disease continues to be undertreated and underdiagnosed in this population.

It's time to integrate liver health into our standard diabetes care. The liver matters. Don't let it be an afterthought. Screen, stratify, and act early. 

Stay informed and stay inspired with me, Dr J.

Compared with conventional Western medicine, nonpharmacologic therapies, either alone or combined with other treatments, more effectively increased lower esophageal sphincter pressure and reduced esophageal acid exposure time in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

“Acupoint stimulation combined with [traditional Chinese medicine] and breathing training with [conventional Western medicine] are considered potential adjunctive therapeutic options for GERD, demonstrating both efficacy and safety,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Mei Huang, MMed, and Zelin Yu, MD, The Third Clinical Medical College of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University in Hangzhou, China. It was published online in the Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology.

The review was constrained by the relatively small pool of available studies, several of which had modest sample sizes, as well as the scarcity of research with certain therapeutic approaches. The umbrella term “acupoint stimulation” encompassed various intervention modalities without distinguishing between specific protocols or treatment frequencies. 

This study was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China. The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

More than 80% of patients with a confirmed allergy to amoxicillin tolerated piperacillin-tazobactam, whereas 17.8% experienced cross-reactivity.

“In [the study] sample of patients with amoxicillin allergy, 82.1% tolerated piperacillin-tazobactam, while 7% were allergic to all penicillins,” the authors of the study wrote. “In such cases, if piperacillin-tazobactam use is necessary, it is advisable to first perform ST [skin testing], followed by controlled administration by experienced allergists,” they added.

Ana Rosado-Ingelmo, MD, PhD, with the Hospital Universitario Fundación Alcorcón, Alcorcón, Spain, was the corresponding author of this study, which was published online on August 22 in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice.

This study was limited by its retrospective design and inconsistent testing for specific immunoglobulin E. Data on delayed cross-reactivity were unavailable, and the small sample size yielded wide CIs. Additionally, long-term tolerance to piperacillin-tazobactam in subsequent exposures remained unknown as this was a recent study.

The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

An international team led by researchers at Lund University in Sweden has identified the molecular tools needed to reprogram ordinary cells into specialized immune cells. The discovery, published in Immunity, could pave the way for more precise and personalized cancer immunotherapies.

The team has taken an important step toward harnessing the immune system to fight cancer. Their work describes how they identified a genetic toolkit that programs two powerful subtypes of dendritic cells – key sentinels of the immune system. Dendritic cells are a diverse group of immune cells that act as the body's ""teachers"", guiding the immune system to recognise and attack threats such as viruses, bacteria or tumours. Each subtype triggers different immune responses, adapting to the nature of the threat. Supplying patients with dendritic cells designed to target their cancer could make treatments more precise and powerful.

Understanding how this cellular diversity is generated during the process of development has long been a mystery. Scientists have known some of the so-called transcription factors – proteins that switch genes on and off – that control these cells' development, but how these factors work together to create different dendritic cell types has been unclear.

Now, the team of researchers behind this publication has carried out a systematic mapping of the routes to dendritic cell identity. By testing 70 different transcription factors and seeing how they could reprogram ordinary cells into dendritic cells, they identified two distinct toolkits that reprogrammed skin or cancer cells into powerful dendritic cell subtypes. Advanced gene analysis revealed that these factors, early in the process, open different parts of the genome and thereby determine the different cells' fate.

""Through cellular reprogramming, one cell type can be converted into another. We identified two specific combinations of three factors that act as tools to build two dendritic cell types: conventional type 2 dendritic cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells,"" says Filipe Pereira, professor of molecular medicine at Lund University, who has led the research.

When tested in mouse cancer models, one engineered dendritic cell subtype triggered strong immune responses against melanoma, while others acted against breast cancer, in ways similar to their natural counterparts. While still in the early stages, the findings suggest that supplying patients with dendritic cells tailored to their cancer could, in the future, make immunotherapy more powerful and more personal.

Immunotherapy is one of the most promising areas in medicine, but many patients still do not respond. Our work shows that by generating specific dendritic cell types, we can better match the immune response to a specific cancer. This is an early step, but it points to the potential for truly personalised immunotherapy.""

Filipe Pereira, professor of molecular medicine at Lund University

Beyond cancer, the discovery that dendritic cell diversity can be programmed may have applications in autoimmune diseases. Some dendritic cells naturally ""calm"" the immune system, and reprogramming toward these anti-inflammatory subtypes could one day help treat conditions where the immune system attacks the body.

The study provides the first systematic blueprint of the immune system's toolkit for dendritic cell reprogramming, a resource that may help researchers design better treatments for cancer and immune disorders.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Predictable music phrases found to regulate blood pressure","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250829/Predictable-music-phrases-found-to-regulate-blood-pressure.aspx","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 13:33:00 GMT","

A new study has found that blood pressure synchronises to predictable phrase structures in music. Blood pressure was more affected by loudness than tempo and was more strongly influenced by phrase structures that were more predictable.   

The researchers say the research finding could help to inform personalized music based cardiovascular therapies for those with high blood pressure in the future. 

Musicians modulate the tempo and loudness of music in understandable ways to mark phrases and phrase boundaries, which contributes to the patterns we hear. Some music has more predictable phrase structures, which can add to the enjoyment of listeners. 

Professor Elaine Chew is a pianist by training and is also a Professor of Engineering at King's College London in the UK. She explained, ""Like language, music has patterns and phrases which form expressive structures, and this is often what strikes a chord with listeners. This research tells us that more predictable music phrase structures have a bigger impact in regulating the cardiovascular system.""  

""This study follows our previous research that showed that respiration and heart rate is also influenced by phase structures,"" she continued. Stronger synchronization was observed for predictable phrases, which are more regular, of duration similar to slow-paced breathing, and in longer tracks therefore having more phrase instances.

92 participants had their blood pressure continuously monitored listening to nine out of 30 piano music tracks. A Bayesian algorithm, also by Chew's team, enabled a computer to automatically detect music tempo and loudness phrase arc boundaries. Performers denote phrases with arc-like changes in expressive music features that drive listener's responses. Sixty women and 32 men took part with a mean age of 42 years old. 

The 30 tracks used in the research were original recordings of legendary performances by master pianists, and the researchers altered their expressivity in systematic ways to observe the effect on cardiovascular variables. The music was played back to participants on a reproducing piano for consistency, and to come as close to a live performance as possible in a controlled experimental setting. 

In 25 out of 30 tracks, blood pressure entrained more to loudness than tempo.  Increased predictability of the phrase structures in the music allowed the listener to anticipate phrase changes and was found to lead to higher blood pressure-music synchronisation, which may strengthen the body's ability to regulate blood pressure.

From the playlist, the recording that had the most predictable phrase structures, and the 

biggest impact on blood pressure, was the English pianist Harold Bauer's performance of Franz Liszt's transcription of Franz Schubert's Serenade. 

The study used classical piano music because it was possible to vary the music and simulate a 'live' experience in a research setting. However, the researchers argue that the methods and strategies used are transferrable to any music with phrase indications. 

Throughout time and across cultures, humans have moved and grooved to music. There are likely to be biological and social advantages to being able to coordinate our actions to an external rhythm, such as people on a boat synchronising their rowing.""

Professor Elaine Chew, study lead 

""To coordinate our actions in this way, we need to be able to anticipate the beginnings and ends of rhythm cycles. It is this anticipation that likely influences our cardiorespiratory cycles. It feels good to synchronise to musical structures - research has found that music uses the same reward system as food, sex and drugs,"" she continued.  

The researchers measured 'entrainment', which is the synchronisation of physiological rhythms with external stimuli. This can be quantified using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to produce a similarity measure between music and physiology. The participant's blood pressure waveform was incorporated into the music's beat time.  

Blood pressure measurements for each track were shuffled with their responses to other tracks to understand their statistical significance. This helped to determine whether the blood pressure response was influenced by the music they were hearing, rather than being a random variation in the individual's physiology. 

The researchers note that music is increasingly being recognised as a potential non-pharmacological intervention to regulate the cardiovascular system. 

""This research raises the intriguing possibility that we could design music therapies to elicit specific biological responses in the future. This could be tailored specifically to individuals, bringing us closer to music as precision medicine. In the longer term, one day we may be able to use music to prevent heart disease or slow, arrest, or reverse its progression."" Professor Chew concluded.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major health issue worldwide. Many patients end up requiring regular dialysis to avoid kidney failure and stay alive. Despite the severity of the condition, there are currently no drugs available that improve kidney function. A research group led by Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine's Professor Takaaki Abe has found a remarkable solution to treat patients with CKD by co-opting a drug typically used for constipation. This is the first time that this drug (lubiprostone) was shown to prevent the decline of renal function in patients with CKD.

We noticed that constipation is a symptom that often accompanies CKD, and decided to investigate this link further. Essentially, constipation disrupts the intestinal microbiota, which worsens kidney function. Working backwards, we hypothesized that we could improve kidney function by treating constipation.""

Professor Takaaki Abe, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine

To address this issue, the group conducted a multicenter Phase II clinical trial (LUBI-CKD TRIAL) at nine Japanese medical institutions, enrolling 150 patients with moderate CKD. This study evaluated the effects of lubiprostone on kidney function. The results showed that, compared to the placebo group, the decline in kidney function (defined as the estimated glomerular filtration rate: eGFR) was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner in patients treated with 8 µg or 16 µg of lubiprostone.

The researchers also investigated the mechanism underlying how this effect occurred. They found that lubiprostone increases spermidine production, which improves mitochondrial function by promoting bacterial growth in the gut. The improved mitochondrial function was seen to exert a renoprotective effect – suppressing further kidney damage.

Going forward, the research team has plans to validate the trial results in a larger population (Phase 3 clinical trial) and advance the exploration of biomarkers that predict treatment efficacy. Their goal is to provide each patient with CKD the optimal treatment plan tailored to their needs. This discovery has the potential to significantly transform the conventional approach to CKD treatment, which primarily focuses on reducing uremic toxins.

These findings suggest a new therapeutic strategy in which laxatives suppress renal function decline. This strategy is expected to contribute to the development of treatments for not only CKD, but also mitochondrial dysfunction disorders. The results of this study were published in the scientific journal Science Advances on August 30, 2025.

ALICANTE, Spain – The U.S. U-17 Women's National Team defeated Spain, 2-0. It was the first of two matches for the teams, which are both preparing for the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup.

The teams will meet again on Aug. 31 at Stadi Olímpic Camilo Cano in Alicante.

The U.S. lost to Spain, 3-1, in the opening game of the 2024 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, albeit with different squads of players.

This is the final training camp and final matches before U.S. head coach Katie Schoepfer chooses the 21-player roster that will represent the USA at the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, taking place in Morocco from Oct. 17-Nov. 8.

With the match scoreless at half, midfielder Jaiden Rodriguez — who is a freshman at USC — put the USA up 1-0 with a goal in the 69th minute after coming on just four minutes earlier. Forward Lauren Malsom, who is a freshman at UNC, sealed the deal 11 minutes later with a goal in the 80th minute off an assist from Rodriguez. For Rodriguez, it was her third career goal at the U-17 level in her 14th cap, while Malsom opened her U-17 international camp with her first career goal which came in her fourth cap at this level.

Rodriguez didn't enter the game until the 65th minute before tallying her goal and the assist.

The age cutoff to play in the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup is players born on or after Jan. 1, 2008. This roster features 18 players born in 2008, two in 2009 – forward Maddie DiMaria and defender Meila Brewer — one in 2010 in goalkeeper Carmen O'Dea, and midfielder Loradana Paletta was born in 2011.

The U.S. U-17 WNT has several professional players from the NWSL in the pool, but none of them were available for selection for this roster.

At the 2025 FIFA U-17 WWC, the USA will play in Group C and will face Ecuador (9 a.m. ET / 2 p.m. local time) in its first match on Saturday, Oct. 18. The USA will then face China PR on Tuesday, October 21 (12 p.m. ET / 5 p.m. local) and finish group play against Norway on Friday, October 24 (9 a.m. ET / 2 p.m. local). All three of the USA's Group C games will be played at the Football Academy Mohammed VI (Pitch 3) in Sale, which is just outside of the capital of Rabat.

These matches in Spain are the ninth and tenth international matches this year for the U.S. U-17 WNT ahead of the World Cup, continuing the focus on the U.S. Way, which emphasizes increased programming for Youth National Teams to create more opportunities for young players to advance through the pathway to the senior National Team with the goal of representing their country at a world championship.

Trinity Rodman is a California native best known for her skills on the soccer pitch.

Rodman, a forward for the Washington Spirit, was a member of the gold medal-winning U.S. women's national soccer team at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

The 23-year-old has also made headlines outside of soccer with her relationship with a fellow professional athlete, American tennis star Ben Shelton.

Rodman surprised Shelton at the 2025 U.S. Open by taking a red-eye flight from California to New York to watch him play, later showing up in his post-match news conference.

After winning his second round match on Aug. 27, a surprised Shelton looked up to see Rodman asking him a question about his serve, according to a video shared on Instagram by the U.S. Open and the ATP Tour.

""How did it feel not serving faster than 135 today? ... I just know you like to serve big and it wasn't breaking 140 today,"" Rodman asked Shelton, who buried his smiling face in his hand.

""Why did you give her a question?"" Shelton joked to the organizer, before answering Rodman's question in full.

""It was cold outside,"" Shelton said with a smile. ""So I think that was the main reason. I was focused on hidden spots and I didn't hit those spots, so maybe I should just serve bigger, but something I'll definitely work on next time.""

Here is more to know about Rodman and her relationship with Shelton.

Rodman, a native of Newport Beach, California, has been playing soccer since the age of 4.

She is known for her signature ""Trin Spin"" move and also represented the U.S. and made her World Cup debut as a women's national team member at the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup.

Rodman made history in 2021, when at 18, she was drafted by the Spirit, becoming the youngest player to be drafted in the history of the National Women's Soccer League.

The 5-foot-8-inch forward is a key player for the Spirit. In 2024, she become the Spirit's all-time regular season assists leader, according to the team's website.

After a four-month break earlier this year due to an injury, Rodman returned to play for Spirit on Aug. 3, and helped lead the team to a 2-1 win.

Rodman, who wears a No. 2 jersey, said in an emotional interview after the game that coming back to the pitch after dealing with an injury over the last year wasn't easy.

""Holy cow, that was just the hardest thing I've had to go through, with injury and everything,"" Rodman said, according to a video shared online by the NWSL. ""Being back, especially at the home stadium with the crowd behind me, scoring a goal like that -- you saw I buried it. I was not going to miss it. I'm just really happy to be back.""

Rodman won gold at her first-ever Olympics with the U.S. women's national soccer team at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

She told Vogue ahead of the Paris Olympics that she was also excited to shine a spotlight on women's soccer and help push the sport forward on the world stage.

""For me, the biggest thing with the Olympics or the World Cup or any large-scale tournament in general is that I feel like each is an opportunity to change the women's game in one way or another,"" Rodman said in part at the time. ""Whether that's expanding the fan base, showing off different styles of play, [demonstrating] creativity in the way we play and the way we score, the way we celebrate; if it's fashion, if it's swag, I think all of these major tournaments are huge platforms that we can use in such an amazing way.""

Rodman and Shelton went Instagram official with their relationship in March 2025, when Shelton posted a photo dump that included a photo of Rodman kissing him on the cheek.

Rodman commented on the post, writing, ""Shooters shoot,"" while tennis star Coco Gauff also called out the couple's status, commenting, ""Hard launchhhhh.""

Since then, Rodman has been spotted at Shelton's matches around the world, including at the French Open and Wimbledon.

Both Rodman and Shelton come from athletic families.

Shelton's dad is Bryan Shelton, a former professional tennis player and college tennis coach.

Rodman is the daughter of five-time NBA champion basketball player Dennis Rodman.

In May 2022, Trinity Rodman added ""author"" to her long list of achievements with the publication of a children's book titled ""Wake Up and Kick It.""

She told Vogue in 2024 that she loves to embrace her creative side with drawing, painting, writing and connecting with fans on TikTok.

Barcelona star Robert Lewandowski has been recalled to the Poland squad for September's 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.

The decision comes following a dramatic saga over his status as Poland captain after opting against linking up with Michal Probierz's panel for June's international camp on the back of a demanding club season.

Lewandowski made the call after speaking with Probierz but the 37-year-old faced some negativity over the decision which ignited a row with Probierz.

The June games were overshadowed by the issue as Lewandowski stated would not consider playing for Poland again until there was a change of manager.

Lewandowski was ultimately the winner in the stand off, as Probierz was sacked over the summer, and promptly replaced by Jan Urban.

The new boss quickly stated bringing Lewandowski back in as captain was a crucial priority and Barcelona's No.9 accepted the olive branch.

Lewandowski has 85 goals in 158 international appearances as the leader in both lists for Poland and they will need him at full power next month despite an injury impacted start to the 2025/26 in Catalonia.

The forward missed the opening win over Mallorca, and came off the bench in the win at Levante, with a full return expected against Rayo Vallecano this weekend.

Poland won their first two qualifiers back in March, via home wins over Lithuania and Malta in Group G, and Lewandowski scored the clincher in the first game.

However, in Lewandowski's absence, they lost 2-1 in Finland in June, and they currently sit third in the group after three games played so far in qualification.

September will be crucial, with qualification squeezed into three windows in 2025, followed by playoffs in March 2026.

On the horizon is a crunch trip to the Netherlands on September 4 followed by a home tie with Finland three days later.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

As per the latest information from AS, Real Madrid's breakout talent Gonzalo Garcia could soon find himself on the path to representing Spain at the FIFA World Cup next year. 

It is to be noted that Spanish national team coach Luis de la Fuente is set to announce his squad for the upcoming qualifiers against Bulgaria and Turkey today, with Georgia also part of the group. 

As such, Spain will largely stick with the squad that reached the Nations League final, which already guarantees them a playoff spot in case things go wrong during qualification. 

Interestingly, De la Fuente is expected to use this campaign to introduce fresh names into the mix, especially in attack. That's where Gonzalo Garcia's opportunity lies.

Meanwhile, the young forward will first appear for Spain's U-21 side, but the door to the senior squad is wide open. 

De la Fuente admires his qualities as a natural goalscorer and is keen to monitor his growth under Xabi Alonso at Real Madrid. 

“It has to be an incentive for him to know that he is on our radar,” said the Spanish coach about Gonzalo in a recent interview.

If he gets minutes in the coming weeks and performs well with the U-21s, he could be fast-tracked into the senior team, and this would put him in contention for a place at the World Cup.

Meanwhile, the outlet also mentions that alongside Gonzalo, another Real Madrid youngster making waves is defender Dean Huijsen. 

His rise with the national team has been described as a success, with De la Fuente impressed by his maturity and consistency. 

The coach believes Huijsen can develop even further and sees him as a player capable of becoming a key figure for Spain over the next decade.

With the final few days of the summer window upon us, no major activity is expected at Real Madrid, with transfer business considered to be closed by the club.

However, that does not rule out the possibility of one or two late departures, particularly from the youth and reserve ranks, with a number of top-flight teams eyeing players from Castilla.

In such one case, AS reports that newly-promoted La Liga club Levante have turned their attention to Manuel Angel, a 21-year-old midfielder from Real Madrid Castilla.

The Valencian side recently received interest from Benfica for Carlos Alvarez, and while that negotiation continues to progress, the sporting department is studying the next steps in order to redirect their investment. As such, Manuel Angel has emerged as a target.

The 21-year-old Spaniard is considered one of the great prospects of La Fabrica and one of the leaders of Alvaro Arbeloa's squad. A player of notable quality, he is capable of fulfilling different roles in midfield. 

A post shared by Manuel Ángel Morán (@manuelangel_8)

In fact, Manuel Angel was primed for a first-team call-up under Xabi Alonso, but an injury prevented it, leading to Thiago Pitarch getting the opportunity instead.

Levante believe his profile, young, talented, and with strong potential, fits their project, and are weighing up a late move.

Real Madrid's policy has been clear in recent years regarding players leaving their academy. The structure of any deal would have to be drawn in a way that allows them to retain some control over the player's future. 

The most common formula has been a sale of 50 per cent of the rights, while retaining a buyback clause, ensuring an option to retain influence over the player for a certain period of time. This has been the case in practically all recent academy departures.

Whether the same happens with Manuel Angel remains to be seen.

Carlos Alcaraz suffered the first mid-match wobble of his US Open campaign on Friday, but he nonetheless refound his rhythm to defeat Luciano Darderi 6-2, 6-4, 6-0 and reach the fourth round.

Leading by a set and 4-1, Alcaraz lost serve for the first time this week and was pulled into a second-set battle, during which he appeared to land awkwardly after a serve. The 22-year-old Spaniard took a medical timeout at 5-4 to receive treatment on his right knee, but reeled off the following seven games to regain control and race through a one-hour, 44-minute victory.

“I'm feeling good, it was just a precaution that I asked for the physio,” Alcaraz said when asked about the medical timeout. “When he broke my serve, in the last point I felt something in the knee, but after five or six points it was gone. I just asked the physio to take care of the knee, so I had to be feeling good. I am going to talk to my team about it, but I'm feeling good.”

Moving on 🔥#USOpen | @usopen | @carlosalcaraz pic.twitter.com/tEZ9hKLFPl

Alcaraz, who won his first major title at the US Open in 2022, remains on track to meet four-time winner Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals. For now, though, Alcaraz faces a fourth-round clash with Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech, who rallied past countryman Benjamin Bonzi 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-2. Alcaraz leads Rinderknech 3-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

Despite his brief lapse in the second set, Alcaraz was ruthless in all departments, particularly the forehand-to-forehand exchanges that were prevalent throughout the clash. In the second set, however, Darderi produced some moments of magic of his own, including winning an epic all-court point that ended with a stunning drop volley that caught Alcaraz out to tee up two break points, eventually converting the second.

“I just tried to start awake, that was important,” said Alcaraz. “Starting at 11:30 a.m. is not a schedule that I'm used to playing, so my first goal is to start well, to start focused. I think I started really well, pushing him to the limit, playing long rallies, and after that kept it going.

“I'm not a [morning] person. For me, it's difficult to wake up in the mornings, so that's a good thing today that I woke up early, I did the warmup well, played good... It seems like I'm a Spanish guy!""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Shapovalov on Sinner US Open showdown: 'These are the matches I live for'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/shapovalov-feature-us-open-2025-friday","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 15:57:02 GMT","

When Denis Shapovalov shut down his 2023 season with a troubling knee injury, he couldn't be sure he'd ever play pain-free tennis again.

However, since his return last year, the Canadian has added three ATP Tour titles to his breakthrough Stockholm crown from 2019. His resurgence has undoubtedly fueled a new level of belief, and as he enters the US Open third round for a seventh time in his career, Shapovalov will need every ounce of that confidence in a clash against defending champion and World No. 1 Jannik Sinner on Saturday.

“I would say my confidence is very high. I would say it's different than when I was young and the confidence would be high, but it would be pretty fragile,” Shapovalov said after his second-round win against Valentin Royer. “I think now — and you can see with my results — that the confidence is there. Even if I have a bad few weeks or unlucky draws or a couple of tough matches, I'm able to bring it back and play at a high level when the next week comes.

“I think that's why I have been able to win three titles in less than 12 months, and that's why I've been able to have so many great weeks recently. I definitely think that the confidence is there. I'm playing great tennis.”



Even though Shapovalov won a five-set tussle in his only previous Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Sinner at the Australian Open in 2021, the 26-year-old admits that they have both changed a lot as players since then. Shapovalov has traversed a long road back from injury, while Sinner rose to No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings in June last year and has not relinquished his position since. 

 Shapovalov acknowledges he will have to bring his A-game if he is to challenge the defending champion, who is unbeaten at the hard-court majors since 2023.

“[I'm] definitely looking forward to another matchup with him. These are the types of matches that I kind of live for,” Shapovalov said. “I enjoy playing [them], so I'm looking forward to it.

“He's got a lot of strengths, being the player that he is. He doesn't have many weaknesses, he's solid from everywhere. I'm going to have to dictate and try to play my game and go for my strokes. He's not going to give too much away for me in the match. I just have to take what I can with him, take my opportunities as well when I get them, and try to stay aggressive and not let him dictate too much.”

After his fourth-round exit at Wimbledon in 2023, Shapovalov ended his season and slipped outside the Top 100 by year's end. The former World No. 10 did not compete for six months, and during his difficult return in 2024 fell as low as World No. 140.

Still, the Canadian — with the help of his team and family — never lost sight of his ambitions or the explosive game that he used to defeat Rafael Nadal as a teenager.

“I think I'm very grateful for going through what I did with my knee. It was definitely the toughest challenge I've ever had, not knowing if I would ever be back on court pain-free,” Shapovalov recalled. “There were a lot of doubtful days and tough moments. It was a long road to get back.

“Even when I started back up, there were a lot of difficult matches, I wasn't getting the wins, and I was up in the matches or the pain would come back in the knee. So it was a really, really tough road, but I'm very grateful for my team and the close ones around me, because they kind of kept me going forward and kept reassuring me that the results and everything will come.”

And they did. In his final tournament of the 2024 season, Shapovalov lifted his second ATP Tour trophy in Belgrade, a breakthrough that seemed to spark a new chapter. This February, Shapovalov rolled past Top 10 opponents Taylor Fritz, Tommy Paul and Casper Ruud en route to the biggest title of his career at the ATP 500 in Dallas.

Shapovalov recovers from injury to win maiden ATP 500 crown: 

Then, after an underwhelming clay-court season and first-round loss at Wimbledon, Shapovalov struck again on the hard courts in Los Cabos, winning his fourth tour-level title without dropping a set.

“I had to stay very, very patient last year. I only got the result I wanted the last week of the year with winning Belgrade,” Shapovalov reflected. “It was definitely worthwhile. Honestly, that title meant 100 times more to me than the first title that I won in Stockholm. It was huge for me.

“It's been a road to get back. It's never easy to climb back in the rankings. There's a lot of new, young guys coming up. Your name is not as fearful as when you're No. 10 in the world, it has a little bit more emphasis than when you're climbing back in the rankings. I've definitely had to work to [get to] where I am. I think I'm in a great spot, winning two titles this year, playing some great tennis, into the third round here. I have a shot against a guy like Jannik. It's great for me. I look forward to it.”

NEW YORK—Win or lose, Coco Gauff is having a US Open to remember after reaching the third round amid emotional upheaval and major technical changes to her serve.The No. 3 seed, Gauff served seven double faults and was near tears in the opening set of her second-round clash with Donna Vekic, but ultimately tightened up her technique to defeat the 2024 Olympic silver medalist, 7-6 (5), 6-2.

Lindsay Davenport called Gauff's mid-match emotions “heartbreaking” as the reigning Roland Garros champion struggled to employ changes made by biomechanic coach Gavin MacMillan, an expert hired after Gauff's serving woes carried throughout the US Open swing.MacMillan famously reworked the serve of Aryna Sabalenka, who went on to win three Grand Slam titles and rise to her current spot as world No. 1.“In tennis, what you don't want to do is overthink,” said Davenport, a fellow former No. 1 and 1998 US Open champion. “She's now trying to learn new grips and new technique, and it's just all too much for her.

“If you're trying something new and you have no idea how it's going to turn out,” advised Navratilova of Gauff's serve, “especially when you don't have any confidence, you really need to do it in a quiet space.”

“It seems like everyone's got to take a step back and just say, ‘You know what? Just go play. Go try and figure out this last major of the year. Then we can catch our breath.'”In her visit to the TC Live desk, Martina Navratilova is also waiting for Gauff to exhale, the 18-time Grand Slam champion questioning the wisdom of attempting a technical overhaul in the midst of a major tournament.“If you're trying something new and you have no idea how it's going to turn out, especially when you don't have any confidence, you really need to do it in a quiet space,” advised Navratilova. “I don't want anybody watching me except my coach and the cameras doing the video so I can figure it out.”

Chanda Rubin was more optimistic about Gauff's chances in Flushing Meadows, noting the 2023 champion's marked improvements in the second set versus Vekic, and from a tense first-round against Ajla Tomljanovic.“Overall, this was not a bad match in terms of numbers,” said Rubin, a 1996 Australian Open semifinalist. “In terms of her serving and the double faults in the first set, it was the timing of it and it was all of the stress, all of the emotion she's been dealing with. It was about much more than just the X's and O's on the court.

“I think we saw, again, how impressive Gauff is, the fact that she was able to turn that first set around. She was able to dig in and somehow win it. At times, she was visibly shaking during the changeovers and it was just so incredible how she, once again, dug in and didn't let the moment overwhelm her completely. Getting that first set was huge and she was able to run away with the second set in the end.”Gauff will be back on court on Saturday when she takes on No. 28 seed Magdalena Freçh for the chance to reach the second week of the US Open for a fourth straight year.

2025 Dutch GP FP2: Every spill, spin and crash from Friday practice at Zandvoort

TECH TALK – What's new after the summer? 

As Formula 1 returns with the Dutch Grand Prix, Need to Know is your all-in-one guide with statistics, driving pointers, strategy tips and more.

With its traditional summer break now drawing to a close, Formula 1 is back in action this weekend as the Dutch Grand Prix kickstarts the second half of the season.

First and second practice will take place on Friday, August 29, followed by final practice and Qualifying on Saturday, August 30 and the Grand Prix itself on Sunday, August 31.

*From the last four races in the Netherlands

Jolyon Palmer, former Renault F1 driver: I've only done this one on a bike! Zandvoort is actually a lovely circuit that has been adapted really well for modern F1. It's still difficult to overtake on, as expected with an old design of track, but the banking makes a huge difference.

You don't really appreciate the banking until you go around it at Turn 3. The theory is multiple lines, but everyone just bolts for the outside line and tries to get the exit right. And again, coming through the final corner as well, running the banking.

It is a nice, flowing track. You've got to have commitment, particularly in the middle sector, which is undulating, and you've got to just have it hooked up in the high speed sections. You don't want to be having random snaps of oversteer, because it's a punishing circuit as well...

“For the race in the Netherlands, Pirelli has gone a step softer in terms of compounds than last year,” reads Pirelli's weekend preview. “The teams will have a choice of the C2 as hard, the C3 as medium and the C4 as soft, whereas in 2024 the available compounds were C1, C2 and C3.

“The decision, taken in conjunction with the FIA and the championship promoter, has the aim of increasing the likelihood of a strategy based on two stops, rather than just the one-stop, which has been the predominant choice since this race returned to the calendar in 2022.

“A further step in this direction stems from the FIA's decision to increase the pit lane speed limit from 60 to 80 km/h, thus reducing the time taken for a pit stop.

“According to simulations provided by the teams, the one-stop is still quickest, partly because overtaking is notoriously difficult at Zandvoort, with very few straights apart from the main one, combined with the fact the whole track is quite narrow.

“[In 2024], 16 drivers lined up on the grid on the medium tyre, while three – Lewis Hamilton, Yuki Tsunoda and Valtteri Bottas – went for the soft, with Kevin Magnussen starting from the pit lane on hards. Three quarters of the field made just one stop during the race, taking on the hard as the second set, while Magnussen went with the medium.

“The Mercedes pair pitted twice – Hamilton used two sets of C3 and George Russell one – while the remaining three, Tsunoda, Bottas and Zhou Guanyu, ran all three available compounds, with Alex Albon choosing to run medium, hard, medium.

“Nico Hulkenberg drove the longest stint of all, completing 57 laps on the hard. Oscar Piastri topped the list with the medium on 33 laps, while Hamilton ran 24 on the soft.”

The season resumes with things still very much all to play for in the Drivers' Championship. Just nine points now separate leader Oscar Piastri and team mate Lando Norris at the top of the standings, with Norris seemingly holding the momentum after winning three of the last four Grands Prix before the summer break.

Piastri, however, has six Grand Prix victories to his name this season – one more than Norris – and has displayed solid consistency throughout the campaign, being the only driver to have scored points at every round so far.

It will be fascinating to see who comes out on top in Zandvoort, a venue that Norris triumphed at back in 2024. However, McLaren have also voiced their concerns about the possibility of the squad's rivals posing more of a challenge in the second half of the campaign.

Both Ferrari and Mercedes appeared to have found more pace last time out in Hungary and, as the two sides vie for second place in the Teams' Championship, each will be keen to seal some valuable points as the season gets underway again.

Red Bull, meanwhile, faced a challenging weekend at the Hungaroring, with the RB21 struggling to match the team's competitors. But one thing for certain is that Max Verstappen can never be counted out. Can he score a good result in front of his passionate home fans?

Elsewhere, the midfield battle remains as tight as ever. Williams' previously comfortable advantage in fifth place looks to be under threat, with Aston Martin and Kick Sauber not far behind in sixth and seventh respectively. Amid such fine margins, any of these teams could make gains – or indeed losses – depending on how they fare at Zandvoort.

James Hunt claimed 10 Grand Prix wins during an F1 career that spanned most of the 1970s, and the first of them was a piece of history not just for himself, but also the plucky Hesketh upstart team he represented.

In a 1975 encounter that started on a damp track but soon shifted to dry conditions, Hunt pitted after seven laps to change his wet tyres for slicks, but many others – including pole-sitting Ferrari driver Niki Lauda – initially stayed out.

Once the rest of the field had eventually pitted, Hunt found himself in the giddy heights of P1 – a position Lauda was desperate to reclaim. However, the inimitable Briton could not be stopped as he logged his maiden F1 win and the one-and-only triumph for Lord Hesketh's operation.

It was a remarkable, feel-good underdog tale, with the mighty Ferrari toppled by a fledgling force, and it remains at the head of the list when it comes to iconic moments at the Dutch Grand Prix.

2025 Dutch GP FP2: Every spill, spin and crash from Friday practice at Zandvoort

TECH TALK – What's new after the summer? 

It was an eventful day for Mercedes on Friday at the Dutch Grand Prix, with George Russell going fourth fastest in FP2 while Kimi Antonelli ended up in the gravel during FP1.

George Russell conceded that Mercedes were not quite as competitive as hoped for during the opening day of action at the Dutch Grand Prix, with the Briton ending FP2 in fourth while team mate Kimi Antonelli lost out on mileage in FP1 after becoming beached in the gravel.

Following a run of more challenging races during the middle of the season, things seemed to be looking more positive for the Silver Arrows last time out in Hungary after reverting to an older suspension.

As the campaign resumed again in Zandvoort post-summer break, Russell ended the day's first practice session in seventh before improving to fourth in the second hour, leading the 27-year-old to suggest that the squad had hoped for more.

“I felt good out there, to be honest,” Russell explained after jumping out of the car. “It was great to be back driving again after a couple of weeks out. Conditions for everybody were really tricky.

“It was really windy and this circuit has a lot of 180-degree corners so, when it is windy and gusty, the car is going through that whole phase of the corner, so it's more exposed than on other circuits, maybe like Silverstone, where it's a little bit in and out of the corners – I hope that makes some sort of sense!

“But, [in terms of] competitiveness, maybe not quite as close to the front as we'd like, but the race pace looks okay, sort of in the usual mix.”

Pushed on whether Aston Martin could be the team's main competition during the weekend – following an impressive performance by the squad on Friday, with Fernando Alonso ending FP2 in second place – Russell responded: “These last couple of races have been really surprising.

“Aston had a really bad run of form, and then they were really on it in Hungary and they had a great result. Here they look fast. Ferrari have seemed really off the pace today, but I'm sure that can turn very quickly as well, and same with Max [Verstappen].

“He had a tough race in Hungary, but I think that was more of an outlier. So, as it stands, it looks like a bit of a fight with the Astons, with Max and with ourselves, but I'm sure Ferrari will get in there.”

Russell also gave his take on an unusual moment with Oscar Piastri in the pit lane, during which the Mercedes driver had to brake heavily when the Australian moved back into the fast lane ahead of him after being unable to enter the McLaren pit box. The papaya outfit were later fined for the incident.

“I think he pulled in a bit too early and pulled back out,” said Russell. “A bit unfortunate but it scared me a bit! When you're on track you're ready for anything, but when you're in the pit lane going relatively very slow, you're just chilling out. I was looking at my screen and I was like, ‘Geez!' It caught me by surprise!”

On the other side of the Mercedes garage, it was a tricky day for Antonelli. The Italian ran off the track in the early stages of FP1 and became beached in the gravel at Turn 9, resulting in the red flags being thrown as his stricken car was recovered.

While this resulted in him missing the rest of the session, Antonelli returned to action in FP2 and put himself into P12 on the timesheets.

Reflecting on his day, the youngster explained: “I was pushing pretty hard early on in FP1 and then I locked up, and then I got beached and my session was over after just one lap. It was obviously not ideal because I lost some mileage and didn't do any laps basically.

“In FP2 I kind of had to build my rhythm. There's quite a bit of work to do, but we know where to improve and now looking forward to tomorrow.

“We'll see how the weather's going to be, but if it's going to be dry we'll try to improve those few things, and then I think it was a decent session. Of course there were quite a few mistakes during the lap, but we'll try to be ready for tomorrow.”

							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	This year's August dump of indie films that gathered dust for years hasn't been kind to Sydney Sweeney, one of Hollywood's most in-demand young actresses whose summer of discontent also includes a major backlash over an American Eagle Jeans campaign that even resulted in President Donald Trump giving her a shoutout for being a registered Republican.


	Sweeney has been riding a wave of enviable success since 2019, from her breakthrough work in HBO's Euphoria and a small part in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, to her Emmy-nominated role as the entitled daughter of a female tech mogul in the first season of Mike White's The White Lotus.

	Then there was Anyone But You, the Glen Powell two-hander that put studio rom-coms back on the map. It opened in theaters over the Christmas holidays in 2023 on its way to grossing north of $220 million, a sum that even caught Sony executives by surprise.


	What no one realized was that Sweeney was supposed to have another film hit theaters that year — Americana, a modern-day Western in which she plays a waitress who gets caught up in a scheme to peddle stolen Native American artifacts, and whose troubled brother believes he's the incarnation of Sitting Bull.


	The obscure indie film, directed by Tony Tost, made its debut in at SXSW in spring of 2023, but couldn't find a U.S. distributor until this year, when Lionsgate Premiere picked up U.S. rights. The film opened to a mere $500,000 from roughly 1,100 theaters over the Aug. 15-17 weekend, one of the worst showings of all time for a title going out in that many cineplexes. The film's cast also includes Paul Walter Hauser and Halsey. Insiders claim that Americana did just fine for Lionsgate Premiere, which banks more on home entertainment than theatrical, but even Tost acknowledged that the opening was a disappointment, when he wrote on X Aug. 21 that the film “gobbled up by the zeitgeist.” 

	











	The heaping on didn't end there for Sweeney. A week later, Ron Howard's indie film Eden opened in theaters to a forgettable $1 million from 664 theaters nearly a year after the period survival thriller premiered at the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival to middling reviews. Like Americana, buyers passed on picking up Eden despite its veteran director and A-list ensemble cast led by Jude Law, Vanessa Kirby, Ana de Armas, Daneil Brühl and Sweeney. Eden, which has a 57 percent critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes, is based on the true story of a tiny group of European settlers who escape to the Galápagos Island following World War I.


	Those close to the actress say she is being unfairly maligned over the box office results, considering both were ensembles pics, and especially Eden. They also say Sweeney harbors no regrets for the choices she and her team have made. The Paradigm-repped actress has been laying low, however, but won't be able to for much longer.


	She's preparing to return to TIFF for the Sept. 5 world premiere of David Michod's biographical sports drama Christy. The film follows the real-life story of queer former professional boxer Christy Martin, nicknamed “The Caol Miner's Daughter.” Sources speculate that Sweeney's performance in the Black Bear Pictures film could land her a spot in the awards race. The movie is a big swing for the star, who gained some 30 pounds for the role and was coached by Martin.


	And Sweeney will be in theaters on Christmas Day with Lionsgate's high-profile The Housemaid, a psychological thriller filmmaker Paul Feig that also stars Amanda Seyfried. The year-end holidays can be one of the most lucrative corridors of the year in terms of being able to support multiple movies in the marketplace if a title clicks with its target audience. Lionsgate (and likely Sweeney) is hoping that The Housemaid will clean up at the box office based on the 2022 book's popularity and the movie's two stars. It will also give younger females a chance to see something other than Avatar: Fire and Ash, which also opens over the year-end holidays. Given that the movie solely rests on her, rather than an ensemble, it will be a key test. 

	











	One source close to Christy says Sweeney remains a big star with enormous brand recognition, and that two small indie films tanking hasn't hurt her career. “She is not damaged,” this person says. “But outside of doing press in Toronto, she probably needs to stay quiet for a bit.”

The live-event, single-location shoot for the ABC comedy's fifth season  took place at Citizens Bank Park during a Philadelphia Phillies game on Thursday night.


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


Abbott Elementary creator and star Quinta Brunson and her sitcom cast were on hand at a Philadelphia Phillies game on Thursday night to shoot a season five bottle episode during the live event.


	Their presence at Citizens Bank Park was marked on the Instagram page for the Philadelphia Phillies mascot, the Phillie Phanatic. A bottle episode is usually done to save on production costs. But Brunson, who comes from west Philadelphia and plays Janine Teagues on the ABC workplace sitcom, first teased a live event filming for the series in July at San Diego Comic Con.

	“You can expect us to be filming at a live event,” a coy Brunson hinted at the time, before adding, “but I do think that Philly sports fans will be very happy.” Then Thursday night, with the Phillies playing the Atlanta Braves, Brunson and her fellow West Philly Abbot Elementary teachers were on hand, in the stands and on the field for a group photo, to shoot the anticipated episode.


	Brunson, a two-time Emmy winner, wore a Phillies jersey as the single-camera comedy about a small group of teachers at a chronically underfunded public school left a studio audience behind to film at the sporting event. The bottle episode shoot had the blessing of MLB Studios, Major League Baseball's in-house studio.


	“As big fans of the series, MLB Studios initiated outreach to Warner Bros. and subsequently the Phillies to get the shooting process started. Collaboration between MLB Studios, the Phillies and the show commenced to shoot a bottle episode on-location at a Phillies game, with a goal of ensuring authenticity and access to the field,” a statement from MLB Studios obtained by The Hollywood Reporter says.

	











Abbott Elementary, for which Brunson also serves as creator and executive producer, wrapped up its fourth season by nabbing six Emmy nominations, including best comedy and best writing for a comedy series, which Brunson won for the series' pilot episode in 2022.

""My Mind Is a Mountain"" is the band's first ruler, 27 years after the group's first appearance.


													By
												

	Kevin Rutherford



Deftones make a record-breaking rise to No. 1 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Airplay chart with “My Mind Is a Mountain,” the band's first No. 1 on the list.


	The song, which lifts 3-1 on the Sept. 6-dated tally, is also Deftones' first leader on any Billboard airplay chart. It surpasses three No. 3 peaks: “Change [In the House of Flies]” on Alternative Airplay in 2000 and “Tempest” (2013) and “Ohms” (2020) on Mainstream Rock Airplay.

	











	Deftones first reached Mainstream Rock Airplay in May 1998, via “Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away),” which peaked at No. 29. As such, the band's 27-year, three-month, one-week wait between a first chart entry and first No. 1 is the lengthiest in two categories over the Mainstream Rock Airplay chart's 44-year history: longest wait for a group's first leader and the longest by any act in a lead role with a first No. 1.




			Trending on Billboard		







	In July, Evanescence rewrote the record for the longest wait by a group, at more than 22 years between “Bring Me to Life” and “Afterlife.” Not only does that record fall, Deftones wrap the longest wait for any act in a lead role thanks to “My Mind Is a Mountain,” exceeding the more than 26 years for Ozzy Osbourne between “Crazy Train” in 1981 and No. 1 “I Don't Wanna Stop” in 2007.

	











	Overall, Jeff Beck went a record 37-plus years between his debut, “People Get Ready,” in 1985 and his first No. 1, as featured on Osbourne's “Patient Number 9” in 2022.


Longest Waits for First No. 1, Mainstream Rock Airplay:


	Worth noting: Deftones' feat comes a week after Yellowcard rewrote the all-time record for the same accomplishment on Alternative Airplay.


	Deftones' Mainstream Rock Airplay history includes 17 entries between 1998 and 2025, with nine top 10s, starting with “Change” (No. 9, 2000).


	Concurrently, “My Mind Is a Mountain” bullets at No. 25 on Alternative Airplay, one spot below its best so far. That's the highest the band has been since “Tempest” reached No. 20 in 2013. On the all-rock-format, audience-based Rock & Alternative Airplay chart, “My Mind Is a Mountain” jumps 13-7 with 3.1 million audience impressions in the week ending Aug. 28, up 18%, according to Luminate. It's the band's first top 10 (exceeding “Tempest,” which hit No. 13).


	“My Mind Is a Mountain” appeared at No. 5 on the most recently published multimetric Hot Hard Rock Songs chart, after debuting atop the July 26 list. In addition to its radio airplay, the song earned 1.3 million official U.S. streams Aug. 15-21.


	The song is the lead single from Private Music, Deftones' 10th studio album. It was released Aug. 22, with its first-week impact to be reflected on the Sept. 6-dated album and song charts.

	











	All charts dated Sept. 6 will update on Billboard.com Wednesday, Sept. 3, one day later than usual due to the Labor Day holiday Monday, Sept. 2.

EXCLUSIVE: The sequel to Richard Donner's '80s classic The Goonies is “moving in the right direction”, according to its writer Potsy Ponciroli.


	Speaking during a Deadline-moderated event at the Venice Film Festival, Ponciroli was asked about the status of the movie and said: “I have turned in a first draft, which was very well received, and I'm on a second draft and I'm about 95% done with that so we're moving in the right direction.”


	Ponciroli said he wasn't immune to inevitable online misgivings about a sequel to such an adored classic, but said there are few bigger fans of the original than himself and that he would treat it with utmost care.

					Potsy Ponciroli Tapped To Pen 'The Goonies' Sequel For Warner Bros		
			








	“I know there's a lot of ‘do we need a new Goonies',” he said, “but I'm the biggest fan of the original, it's my favourite movie of all time. I'd never ‘redo' The Goonies. To me it was a story that never ended so this is the movie I want to see as one of its biggest fans.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	He added he wasn't sure when the movie would be moving into production. A director has yet to be revealed.


	Ponciroli is in Venice with new Alan Ritchson action-thriller Motor City, having also been at the festival four years ago with feature debut Old Henry.


	Warner Bros, the studio behind the original Goonies, is also behind the sequel. Steven Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Holly Bario will produce for Amblin Entertainment alongside Chris Columbus, with Lauren Shuler Donner exec producing. Spielberg and Columbus penned the original.

	











	Released 40 years ago, the original introduced the world to a group of misfit kids — Mikey, Mouth, Data, Chunk, and others — who embark on a treasure hunt to save their homes from foreclosure. The journey takes them through underground tunnels, booby traps, and encounters with the villainous Fratelli crime family, all leading to the discovery of the long-lost treasure of the pirate One-Eyed Willy.


	A cornerstone of '80s pop culture, the film launched the careers of young actors such as Josh Brolin, Sean Astin, Corey Feldman, Martha Plimpton, and Quan. 


	The idea of a Goonies sequel has been floating around for decades, but despite persistent rumors and interest from fans and some of the original cast, has not yet come to fruition. Ponciroli was revealed as writer by us at the start of the year and that was last we heard. Things seem to be heating up.

This just makes me sad. It's gonna get made. It's probably not gonna be great because we'll be comparing it to our childhoods (if you're Gen X), and it'll never live up to THAT nostalgia. It'll make some money but inevitably be seen as a failure. And what will eventually happen is that it taints the original slightly just by diluting the specialness that it had. (Kinda like how Crystal Skull and Dial of Destiny sorta sullied the OG trilogy.)

Sigh. Why can't Hollywood come up with NEW ideas nowadays? Everything feels like a reboot, a remake, a retread, a requel, a reimagining, a reheat. What happened to that magic we had in the 70s and 80s where movies were NEW and FRESH and didn't just mine previous IP?

I love this original Goonies – it's probably my favorite growing up as a kid.  I'm a bit apprenhensive about a sequel though.  I'm not sure it will capture the magic of the original – we'll see.  I'm open to be surprised but…

Nobody wants this.

For the love of god – no. Quit hinging the future of Hollywood on remakes. Executives' fear drives this BS … and this is why people will gravitate to YouTube. It's so obvious but Eveyone in Hollywood lacks the backbone to voice it / do something about it. Idiots.

So long as Joe Pantoliano returns, I'm ok.

					By Damon Wise 

Film Editor, Awards


	“It happened at Yale” says the opening of Luca Guadagnino's After the Hunt, which seems a little superfluous given that the director plunges us straight into a smug, well-heeled cocktail party for academics, complete with airy, pretentious chatter about the likes of Foucault and Kierkegaard. If that — and a title font that echoes Woody Allen's go-to choice of white Windsor Light Condensed over a black background — sets anti-intellectual alarm bells ringing, then this might not be the film for you. But though its conversations about tenure can be a chore, its presentation of the modern campus as the Somme — in terms of the battleground for progressive politics — does strike a very timely chord. It's also Julia Roberts' best work in a long, long time, a superb feat of casting that genuinely sends shivers and may well bury that old America's Sweetheart image for good.

	











	Her chic, killer wardrobe alone does a lot of the talking. She plays Alma Imhoff, a professor of philosophy, and she literally takes her work home with her, inviting staff and students alike to her nightly salons where issues such as collective morality and performative discontent are vigorously debated. A very vocal participant is her close friend and colleague Henrik “Hank” Gibson (Andrew Garfield), who very much shares Alma's views on life in the social media age (“When did offending someone become the pre-eminent cardinal sin?” she wonders aloud). Representing the student body is Maggie Resnick (Ayo Edebiri), an inquiring mind who is clearly besotted with Alma.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	While the elders discuss the now-besmirched personal lives of the likes of Carl Schmitt, Hegel and Heidegger, Maggie goes looking for the bathroom, and in her quest to find a fresh toilet roll finds, instead, a mysterious envelope. Its contents are viewed only fleetingly but it appears to contain a photograph and a newspaper cutting. Maggie puts everything back bar the cutting, which she puts in her pocket before returning. (The contents of this mysterious envelope may or may not be the catalyst for what happens next.) Anyway, after bidding her guests a good night, Alma catches sight of Maggie and Hank leaving together, the latter clearly the worse for wear but in seemingly high spirits.


	Alma thinks nothing of it, until Maggie — who is gay and lives with her non-binary lover Alex (Lio Mehiel) — comes to her apartment, with a story to tell. Hank, she claims, came to her apartment, became aggressive, and sexually assaulted her. When Alma confronts him, Hank denies this and becomes defensive, echoing a guest's assertion the night before — “The common enemy has been chosen, and it is the straight, white, cis man” — by painting himself the victim of Maggie's prim, over-sensitive boundary issues in what he calls “this shallow cultural moment”.  


	Though the issue is simple enough — did he, or didn't he? — it becomes an almost Brechtian challenge for Alma, who is torn along so many lines, primarily wanting to defend her friend but also maintain her professional composure and intellectual rigor. The fact that Maggie is Black, and rich, is a secondary powder keg that will blow up later in the story, when the firings start, the litany of cancellations pile up, and recriminations ricochet through the building. Needless to say, the shadow of David Mamet's notorious 1992 play Oleanna is everywhere, but Guadagnino — working from a script by Nora Garrett — gives his story a more generously female-weighted sense of balance.  


	The excesses of political correctness — and in particular the perverse right asserted by left-wing youth to stifle anything they don't agree with — gets a very firm and sometimes wickedly funny drubbing, especially when Alma is at the end of her tether with Maggie. (Indeed, there's a very entertaining gag about embattled British rock star Morrissey.) But though it bites, After the Hunt isn't just a diatribe about “woke” culture, it's a genuine attempt to look at what's happening now and see where it might take us. Maybe the academic elite deserves to be taken down, with its mealy mouthed hypothesizing and bourgeois fetishization of education as something somehow “better” than knowledge.


	It won't be a watercooler movie in that respect, and it may be a shock to unwary audiences lured in by Roberts's star wattage. But it could mark another milestone for the actress, being her strongest role since 2000's Erin Brockovich and an astonishing performance in its very own right. Lars Von Trier, eat your heart out.

					By Katie Campione 

TV Reporter


The Summer I Turned Pretty fans are treading into unknown territory as they reach the home stretch of the third and final season.


	“Anything could happen,” Prime Video teased in a trailer released Friday morning for the last three episodes of Season 3. 


	In it, Belly (Lola Tung) is headed to Paris after calling off her wedding to Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno), unsure what the future holds for her.


	Slowly but surely, it seems, she begins to find herself again. She gets a job, makes friends, and starts a life in Paris. That is, until she gets a letter from Conrad Fisher (Christopher Briney).

	A slew of new castings were also announced Friday as new characters who will be introduced throughout Belly's Paris journey. 


	Joining the series in recurring roles are Corinna Brown (Heartstopper), Fernando Cattori (With You in the Future, Untamed Royals), Isaline Prevost Radeff (Ceux Qui Travaillent, Haute Mer), and Jahz Armando (Gangs of London).


	Based on the best-selling book trilogy from Jenny Han, The Summer I Turned Pretty is a multigenerational drama centered around a love triangle involving one girl and two brothers. It explores the complex bonds between mothers and their children, the strength of lasting female friendships, and the transformative journey of growing up. At its heart, it's a coming-of-age tale about first love, first heartbreak, and the unforgettable magic of one perfect summer.


	The third and final 11-episode season returned in July after quite a hiatus, quickly becoming a juggernaut for Prime Video. The Season 3 premiere raked in 25M viewers within a week, with series viewership tripling in the seven-day window over the course of the three seasons. 


	The final episodes of The Summer I Turned Pretty begin next week on September 3 with the finale set for September 17.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	Summer's finale is getting underway with four wide releases — Sony's Darren Aronofsky directed comedy caper Caught Stealing, Searchlight's remake of War of the Roses, entitled The Roses, Universal's 50th anniversary re-release of Jaws and Iconic Events' reboot of The Toxic Avenger. None are expected at this point to topple New Line's Weapons which will pop back up to No. 1 after Netflix's theatrical flirt with last weekend's box office; that Zach Cregger directed movie eyeing a fourth weekend of $11M-$12M over 4-days. 


Caught Stealing did $1.2M in both 4PM Thursday previews and last weekend's sneaks. The Austin Butler and Zoe Kravitz starring movie is expected to do north of $10M+ in four days at 3,578 sites. That preview figure is on par with such movies as House of Gucci ($1.3M which did a 3-day over Thanksgiving during post Covid 2021 of $14.4M) and August pre-Covid 2016's War Dogs ($1.25M previews, for a $14.6M opening). The Aronofsky directed title cost $40 million net after New York City film tax incentives. Great reviews and audience score on Rotten Tomatoes respectively with 87% and 86%. Wouldn't be shocked if it steals No. 1.

	Universal's 50th anniversary of Steven Spielberg's Jaws is expected to do $5M over the Friday to Monday period at 3,200 sites including PLFs and Imax. The shark bit $950K in previews last night, I hear. 




			Watch on Deadline		







The Roses grossed $800K in total previews box office, including limited early access shows on Wednesday. The Jay Roach directed, Tony McNamara adapted redo of the Warren Adler novel, which was also the source material for the 1989 Danny Devito directed movie/David Mamet scripted movie, is looking at $7M-$8M over 4-days. It's booked at 2,700 locations. The Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman starring title has bad reviews at 63% and a ho-hum audience score of 76%. Comps here for this title aimed at upscale older audiences are Black Bag at $850K which did a $7.6M opening and The Menu which posted $1M previews before a $9M opening. 

	











	We're waiting on Toxic Avenger‘s numbers…


	Rest of week's top 5:


	1.) Weapons (NL/WB) 3,631 theaters, Thu $1.3M (-8% from Wed), Week $21.9M (-40%), Total $122.8M/Wk 3

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Tamera Mowry-Housley Opens Up About Raising Biracial Children","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/tamera-mowry-housley-talks-raising-biracial-children/","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 19:02:11 GMT","

As an actress, Tamera Mowry-Housley is used to inhabiting different characters. The Hallmark star, who starred as Angela in “Scouting for Christmas” alongside Carlo Marks, has spent the last three decades making viewers believe she was someone else. But none of those personas is quite as vital to her as one: being mom.

A post shared by tameramowryhousley (@tameramowrytwo)

“Being a mom is the best, most important job I've ever had, and truly the greatest gift,” she wrote in an Instagram post on Mother's Day. But, in a recent Instagram video, Mowry-Housley revealed that she still sometimes has to explain why her biracial children look so different from each other. 

The video's caption reads: “Welcome to my reality. 🙃 I'm sure many parents of bi-racial kids can relate.”

It presents two sides of a conversation: Mowry-Housley's and People/Them. The song “I Have One Daughter” by Lewky plays in the background, which Mowry-Housley is singing along to while the conversation appears on the screen. 

People: “Oh my gosh cute kids! Are they yours?”

She points at herself before smiling. 

Me: “Yes. They are.”

Them: “Both of them?”

At this point, she looks puzzled by the question, and “…….” appears before she smiles.

Me: “Yes they are both my children.”

Them: “But they look so different. How is that possible?”

Mowry-Housley looks both annoyed and bewildered before she regains her composure. 

Me: “They are biracial and pulled different genes from each one of us. Cool, huh?”

Them: “They are both from the same dad? One has blue eyes and the other has brown.”

At this, she looks a bit more annoyed.

Me: “Yes. Thats how genetics work — sometimes one child inherits more genes from one parent than the other.”

As the video finishes, Mowry-Housley appears to burst out laughing. 

A post shared by tameramowryhousley (@tameramowrytwo)

Mowry-Housley and her husband, Adam, have two kids together. Their oldest son, Aden, is 12 years old, while their daughter Ariah is 10. Previously, the former “Sister, Sister” star has talked about her kids' personalities, explaining that Aden is more like Adam, and Ariah is more like her. 

A post shared by tameramowryhousley (@tameramowrytwo)

“She's my mini-me,” she told People shortly after Ariah was born. “She looks so much like me as a baby, it's scary! She has my eyes and my cheeks — I had the droopy little cheeks.”

A couple of years later, she told Momtastic that Aden's personality was more like Adam's, while Ariah's was more like hers.

He's like his dad; he can't sit still,” she said about Aden. “But he just loves to cuddle at bedtime. Ariah is my chill baby—she's more like me.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Emily Simpson Keeps ‘RHOC' Cast Guessing With Lie Detector Twist","https://entertainmentnow.com/real-housewives/emily-simpson-rhoc-lie-detector-persian-new-year/","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 05:39:12 GMT","

Emily Simpson's Persian New Year celebration on “The Real Housewives of Orange County” turned into one of the most talked-about moments of Season 19 after she surprised her castmates with unexpected guests — polygraph examiners.

During the Aug. 28 episode, Simpson invited Shannon Storms Beador, Heather Dubrow, Katie Ginella, Tamra Judge, Gina Kirschenheiter, Jennifer Pedranti, and friend Gretchen Rossi to what she described as a lighthearted activity. 

A post shared by Bravo (@bravotv)

At first, the women believed they were simply writing down anonymous “burning questions” for one another. But Simpson soon revealed her true plan: each of them would undergo a lie detector test.

The twist proved particularly difficult for Katie Ginella, who admitted she was overwhelmed by anxiety. At one point, the examiner was overheard making a private remark: “She's so full of s–t.”

After the group reconvened, the examiner revealed that Ginella not only failed her test but “did the worst out of everybody.” She specifically struggled with questions regarding Gretchen Rossi.

Even so, Ginella maintained her innocence. “I told the truth. I didn't lie,” she insisted when confronted by the group. The denial did little to convince her castmates, and Simpson ultimately asked her to leave the party.

Ginella continued to defend herself both on the episode and during “The Real Housewives of Orange County After Show.” She argued that the results were not valid, citing the stressful setting and the fact that she forgot to take her anti-anxiety medication before attending the party.

“I was anxious, not only to be in this group of women, but then sit in Emily's closet and do a random non-certified polygraphy test,” Ginella explained. “Not in a controlled environment; in her closet.”

Despite the failed results, Ginella insisted she had no reason to lie. “I had nothing to gain from lying… I didn't do anything. Why would I self-implode like that? There's literally no reason.”

A post shared by Bravo (@bravotv)

While Ginella was left defending her reputation, Gretchen Rossi received an entirely “truthful” result. Ginella expressed doubt, claiming that Rossi had repeated rumors about Tamra Judge during a dinner with Pedranti, her husband Matt Ginella, Slade Smiley, and Ryan Boyajian.

“And that's why, in that moment I pointed to Jenn and was like, ‘Jenn, you know she said that,'” Ginella said on the After Show. “We had just talked like the month before on the phone about it, with Ryan and Slade on the phone. How do you not remember this?”

Although the Bravo star voiced disappointment that Pedranti did not back her up, she still referred to her as “a very kind person.” She theorized that Pedranti stayed quiet because she wanted to avoid getting caught in the conflict.

“The most disappointing part of this whole thing is I don't know why Jenn won't just say, ‘I heard it, too,'” Ginella said. “I cried for weeks about this. Why would you wanna see me get annihilated?”

Ginella closed her comments with a firm denial: “Why would I self-implode like that? There's literally no reason.”

The moment has already become one of the standout storylines of “RHOC” Season 19, ensuring that Emily Simpson's Persian New Year party will be remembered long after the lie detector buzz fades.

Lainey Wilson is paying it forward in country music. The chart-topping star has stepped into a mentor role for rising artist Ella Langley, offering support and wisdom at a time when the 26-year-old singer is navigating both big career moments and a brief touring pause for her health.

Country queens lift each other up. 👑 Lainey's got Ella's back! #CountryNightsLive #LaineyWilson #BevRainey #EllaLangley #WomenInCountry @Lainey Wilson @Ella Langley 

Wilson, 33, has formed a strong bond with Langley, and the “Watermelon Moonshine” singer has made it clear that she has her back.

The country superstar recently appeared on “Country Nights with Bev Rainey,” and spoke about her support for the “You Look Like You Love Me” singer. Wilson credited country music legends Miranda Lambert, Reba McEntire, and Wynonna Judd for sharing their “wisdom” with her.

In a TikTok clip, which was captioned, “Country queens lift each other up. Lainey's got Ella's back!,” Rainey said, “I was talking to Ella Langley the other day, and she was telling me that she's getting advice from you, just like you were saying about Miranda. I'm like ‘Let's go girls! We got this.'”

Wilson totally agreed, replying, “I mean, Miranda was that person for me, and I know that she is also that person for Ella, too. But I just think about the wisdom people have passed on to me, I mean folks like Miranda, and Reba, and Wynonna, and like all the ladies that — it's weird, it's like, we have all experienced some of the same things, but it's been completely different times.”

Wilson added, “And I love Ella. She is like a sister. And I just see her, and I think she is one of the most talented people in this business. And so, it's important for me to, you know, to check in on her, and just be there for her if she needs me.”

Langley may need Wilson right now, as she announced on August 11 that she would be taking a break from touring amid health struggles.

In an Instagram post, Langley wrote, “I'm so sad to be posting this. The past several weeks have been tough. I've been fighting sickness and feeling more run down than ever. I've made the hard decision to take a couple of weeks to rest and focus on my health — mind, body, and heart. I want to be fully present for all the moments ahead. And I know I can't do that without first taking care of myself.”

Langley joined Morgan Wallen and Riley Green on their 2025 tours. Because of this break from touring, Langley said she would miss shows between August 15 and August 25, and return to the stage in September.

A post shared by Lainey Wilson (@laineywilson)

While Langley had to take a break from touring, Wilson continues on her 2025 “Whirlwind World Tour.” She began this tour in Zurich, Switzerland, on March 4.

The country singer continued on the European leg of the tour before heading to Phoenix, Arizona, on August 14. She continues to play in numerous cities across North America. The tour comes to an end on November 8 in Orlando, Florida.

You know you're in for an encounter with somebody who wants to start shit when the opening frames of Luca Guadagnino's “After the Hunt,” a thriller about a sexual assault scandal that rocks an intellectual community, are styled in the tradition of none other than Woody Allen: white Windsor typeface against a black backdrop, the cast including Julia Roberts and Ayo Edebiri in alphabetical order, and the credits acknowledging said alphabetical order. “It happened at Yale,” the prologue text announces, also evoking the academia-centered mysteries of someone like “The Secret History” author Donna Tartt.

 










It's an intriguing provocation from the get-go that Guadagnino would want to announce his new film by calling back to Allen, an artist who has become the poster figure for sexual abuse scandals. That Guadagnino would want to interrogate the rhetoric of how alleged abuse is positioned at all via Allen's signature is a sit-up-in-your-seat creative choice that nearly hijacks the first moments of this Yale-set drama, about a philosophy professor (Roberts) unraveling amidst her student's (Edebiri) accusation of sexual assault against a colleague (Andrew Garfield).

 








Related Stories ‘Father Mother Sister Brother' Teaser: Jim Jarmusch Raises a Teacup to Familial Awkwardness  ‘At Work' Review: A Modest, Modern Fable About a French Writer Pursuing Freedom Over Materialism 

But that's unfortunately about as dangerous as the oddly chaste “After the Hunt” gets despite characteristically invigorating direction from the visionary filmmaker behind at least two masterpieces: “Call Me By Your Name” and “Queer,” two heightened immersions into the subjective state of desire, and maybe a third, “Suspiria,” if you're willing to go there. “After the Hunt's” talky, heady unfolding — with a snaking interest in the generational divide between Gen Z youth culture and pre-woke-era Gen Xers — works from a screenplay by first-time feature writer Nora Garrett, who came to Guadagnino's attention early last year. It's an overintellectualized script that reduces its characters to broad stand-ins and mouthpieces for hot topics, bizarrely retrograde, and a few beats behind the times in interrogating both the post-#MeToo context of how assault charges are handled, reacted to, and also in untangling a tricky identity politics inquiry that brushes against race and gender issues.

Yale philosophy professor Alma Imhoff (Julia Roberts), like the filmmaker, clearly has a taste for risk, too. Hosting a party chez elle that mixes colleagues and faculty, she nurses a sizable glass of red wine while dressed in a top-to-toe white suit, and it's likely not the first drink this secretly hard-boozing, self-destructive teacher has had today. Roberts has great fun in a career-recharging dramatic performance — she's at her most dare-to-be-unlikable since Mike Nichols' 2004 “Closer” — as a fucked-up, boozing, and eventually pill-popping highbrow with a mystery chronic ailment and perhaps a too-close fondness toward her younger colleague, Hank (a raffish Garfield).

 










One of her students, Maggie (Ayo Edebiri), is the type to shoot her hand up first in the classroom even when unsure of the answer. She greatly admires Alma but has secrets of her own: In that scene-setting party, Maggie absconds to Alma's bathroom, and finds an envelope with a photo of a dashing stranger taped under the sink. (Why Alma would hide this photo here, a relic of a hidden life, in New Haven, where she lives with her husband rather than the pied-à-terre she keeps in the city, suddenly revealed in the third act, is unclear.)

In other words, as much as Maggie idolizes her teacher in the way that young people who weren't loved enough as children project parent-like silhouettes onto their mentors, Maggie also might be building a case against Alma. Soon into the movie, a rain-soaked Maggie shows up, dejected and nerve-jangled, to the home Alma shares with her psychotherapist husband Frederik (Michael Stuhlbarg). Maggie confesses that, on the night of that party, Hank forced himself upon her after walking her home. “He crossed a line,” she says. A skeptical Alma will eventually tell Maggie a very unhelpful version of “if it's real to you, then it's real” while trying to balance an allegiance to Hank, who might be in love with Alma. Or is she in love with him, or just idealizing his adoration of her, too, as she does with Maggie's?

 










Alma is a victim of her own quest for love, and pieces of information about her past that might inform her reaction to Maggie's claims unfurl in dribs throughout the movie. Meanwhile, her relationship to Hank is thrown out of orbit, as this very clear accusation of rape alienates them from each other, and Hank from his academic milieu, where he likens himself to a wild animal being chased out of the herd.

Chloë Sevigny, who madly incarnated the freakiest scene out of Guadagnino's YA cannibal romance “Bones and All” and starred in his HBO series “We Are Who We Are,” has a small role here as student liaison Kim, who keeps the pupils' confidences as well as a blank prescription notepad in her desk, acting as a kind of guidance counselor. My issue with Garrett's unsubtle inquiry into the Gen Z vs. Gen X paradigm is no more sourly demonstrated than in a scene where Kim, throwing back a few drinks with Alma at the local dive Three Sheets, gives an on-the-nose remark on just how anachronistic-for-our-times it is that said college bar is blasting music by controversy-magnet, truther-opinioned Morrissey.

In terms of subversiveness and hints at a kinkier underworld beneath the surface, “After the Hunt” feels strangely sanded down: Why not turn up the heat more on the palpable sapphic friction simmering between Alma and Maggie? Lingering close-ups on one another's hands as they embrace in moments of emotional frankness — and both painted with what seems to be the same nail polish — hint at a relationship that could've been explored with more risk. The camera handled by cinematographer Malik Hassan Sayeed, working with Guadagnino for the first time, whooshes around his subjects to indicate the shakiness of their frames of mind. Guadagnino does bring back his regular scoring collaborators, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, who might have replayed the plunking, doom-harbinging piano refrain of “Eyes Wide Shut” a few too many times during the brainstorming phase.

 










Limiting to the actress's bona fide capabilities, Edebiri's character is treated mostly as a nuisance, a fly to be swatted off, making the racial politics of her position as a queer Black student whose moneyed parents have endowed the university (thereby throwing Maggie's inherent academic worthiness into question) especially unresolved and unplumbed. That Maggie's dissertation — which Hank alleges is plagiarized as he scrambles to gain traction amid his downfall — and field of study is on the resurgence of “virtue ethics” suggests something provocative, more satirical and mischievous up Garrett's sleeve. But it's unclear, and not in a piquantly ambiguous way, what Garrett is trying to say here.

The most recent movie “After the Hunt” calls to mind is Todd Field's “Tár,” similarly a cancel-culturally minded story set within academia, and about a female educator abusing her power. That film succeeded so well, in a way that everyone seemed to get without nose-wrinkling, because of its sense of humor about itself. “After the Hunt” leaves some potential brambles of humor unpricked, like the fact that Maggie just might be dating her nonbinary, trans peer (Lio Mehiel) for the sake of clout. Or when Alma sounds off on Maggie and her partner, asking, “Don't you have some obscure protest to be publicly angry at?” while repeatedly misgendering Mehiel's character. It's more cringe because of its bluntness than intentionally funny and satiristic.

 










Guadagnino is a beautiful director of jolting power and skill, especially in capturing queer yearning and the psychic collisions of people against their station in life. “Challengers” cranked up the pansexual vibes between a trio of tennis-playing lovers with an unceremoniousness, a sneaky slyness, that actually felt revolutionary, and the supposed age-gap romance of “Call Me By Your Name” remains a subject of hot debate even as the movie now lives as a contemporary classic. The way he has also stood by “Call Me” star Armie Hammer, all but persona non grata after a surge of upsetting harassment accusations of his own, indicates a subversive artist unafraid to go against the grain.

But “After the Hunt” ultimately isn't against-the-grain enough. It strives for moral ambiguity, but ends up startingly morally stark, pampering the viewer against discomfort in a final coda that feels taped on, after-the-fact reassurance. It pains me to take down a Luca Guadagnino movie — he is one of the best filmmakers working — but “After the Hunt” isn't enough, its ideas ripped from an earlier time, transposed onto our own with a broad-strokes equivocation about what they want to say.

“After the Hunt” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. Amazon/MGM Studios opens the film in theaters October 10.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:rollingstone.com","Team Trump Probes Dissent at CDC as ‘F-CK RFK' Sign Goes Up at Agency","https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/cdc-chaos-team-trump-investigate-vandalism-1235418546/","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 16:53:33 GMT","


	Earlier this week, staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received a message from the higher-ups, vaguely informing them of an “obscene” placard and some “vandalism” on government property. 


	“We received a report of vandalism on Roybal Building 18, where an obscene sign was placed in the window,” the alert reads, per a copy reviewed by Rolling Stone. “We are investigating this incident and want to remind staff that vandalism of any kind will result in disciplinary action.”


	The notice and warning came just before President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. set off another round of tumult at the CDC over the attempted ouster of Director Susan Monarez, and the rewriting of vaccine policies. On Thursday, hundreds of CDC employees staged a walk out at the agency's Atlanta offices in support of four senior staff who resigned in protest of Kennedy's reforms and the administration's attempt to remove Monarez. 

	











	It was not immediately clear to some recipients of this email what the “obscene” sign was, but multiple former and current government personnel shared with this magazine photos of a highly visible, apparently hand-written “FUCK RFK” sign that sources say appeared recently on that building.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Matters only degenerated from there. As this work week came to a close, former and current CDC staff assured Rolling Stone that the internal rank-and-file animus toward the president, Kennedy, and their allies in the federal government has only intensified in recent days. Some staffers are actively plotting their escape strategies, and how best to give RFK Jr. the middle finger (figuratively or literally) on the way out the door. Meanwhile, a senior Trump administration official adds that the CDC and other agencies will continue to aggressively investigate, and punish, the ongoing “mischief” and so-called “deep state activity” that Team Trump expects to flare up again, and that such actions “won't be tolerated.”

	The Trump administration is currently attempting to remove Monarez, a career microbiologist and infectious disease expert, from her position as head of the CDC. According to a Thursday report from The New York Times, the move to fire Monarez came after she refused to endorse Kennedy's plan to restrict public access and narrow recommendation guidelines for safe and effective vaccines. 


	Monarez is challenging her dismissal. One of her lawyer's told Rolling Stone this week: “When CDC Director Susan Monarez refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts, she chose protecting the public over serving a political agenda. For that, she has been targeted.”


	The standoff led to a wave of resignations within the CDC, including Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; Debra Houry, CDC chief medical officer; Daniel Jernigan, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases director; and Jen Layden, director of the CDC Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance and Technology.


	“We agreed to do this together. We've been talking about it for months, and the past few days, it was just escalating,” Houry told reporters at a protest on Thursday. “If one of us retired, it would have been a blip. When the three of us do it together, it's more powerful and just shows the state of our agency.”


	On Thursday, Kennedy sent an email to staff at the CDC — which was reviewed by Rolling Stone —  in which he announced that Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services Jim O'Neill would serve as acting CDC director. O'Neill is a tech investor with no educational background in health or medicine who has spent the last several years promoting dubious anti-aging treatments and amplifying skepticism about the Covid-19 vaccine. 


	Kennedy wrote that “President Trump and I are aligned on the commonsense vision for the CDC: strengthening the public health infrastructure by returning to its core mission of protecting Americans from communicable diseases by investing in innovation to prevent, detect, and respond to future threats.”

	Within the organization, however, staff feels differently. 


	“MAHA craziness is gonna run the table,” one source told Rolling Stone of the resignations. “It's really bad now, but things can always get worse.” A former CDC staffer adds: “This is the work of a death cult.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","‘More to this story': Conspiracies fly","https://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/more-to-this-story-conspiracies-fly-about-alleged-cop-killer/news-story/092b1d6d25679fc1e31adbcac9b6dce2","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 06:45:00 GMT","

The hunt for alleged cop killer Dezi Freeman has sparked a wave of conspiracy theories among a fringe group of Australians that flourished during Covid.

The hunt for alleged cop killer Dezi Freeman has sparked a wave of conspiracy theories among a fringe group of Australians that flourished during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Freeman's wife, Mali Freeman, and a 15-year-old boy were arrested at a home in Porepunkah township on Thursday night as the hunt continued.

The pair were questioned that night and then released pending further inquiries. 

On Friday, the search entered its fourth day, after Detective Leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson and Senior Constable Vadim De Waart were fatally shot at Freeman's property on Tuesday morning. They and eight other officers from the sexual offences and child abuse investigation team served a warrant on Freeman.

After the shooting, the fugitive fled into the Porepunkah bushland, while heavy rain and frigid temperatures descended on the area, hampering search efforts.

The saga has raised disturbing questions about the sovereign citizen movement, online radicalisation, and simmering distrust since the pandemic. 

Many Australian conspiracy theorists, colloquially referred to as “cookers”, have shared theories about Freeman since he vanished into the bush.

One commentator falsely claimed that Freeman had been due in Myrtleford Magistrates Court on Friday for a case he had lodged against former Victorian Premier Dan Andrews.

“There is so much more to this story and now it is being used to target those that question government tyranny and police conduct,” the person claimed in a widely circulated post.

“I wouldn't expect any different from Victoria, the most corrupt state in Australia.”

Victorian court lists showed there was no case involving either Mr Andrews or Freeman scheduled for Friday.

Instead, the theory appeared to be a muddled reference to a private prosecution brought against Mr Andrews in 2021, alleging he was “concealing an overt act of treason”. Freeman helped to lead the attempted case, which was struck out by the court. 

The baseless claim showed how eager some Aussies have been to tie the manhunt for Freeman to Victoria's lockdowns during the pandemic. It was also a reminder of the anti-authority sentiment that lingers years later. 

Another post claimed Freeman was already in custody - or deceased - and the manhunt was a piece of “theatre” so that the state of Victoria could introduce new laws.

Yet another conspiracy theorist argued Freeman was facing bogus sexual assault charges and had been the victim of a years-long campaign of intimidation by Victorian Police. 

“He was a freedom fighter, a man who genuinely believed in resisting tyranny,” the man, who described himself as a friend of Freeman, claimed.

“That's why I can't stomach the way this is already being spun, as if he's some deranged terrorist, when the truth is much harder to swallow.”

Freeman himself had extremist views. A self-proclaimed sovereign citizen, he believed he should be immune to Australia's laws - and changed his surname from Filby in a nod to his ideology. In rants on social media he called police “the new Gestapo,” and added, “the only good cop is a dead cop.”

His behaviour appeared to turn more erratic during the pandemic, leading to his arrest at a protest outside court in 2021, on the day the private prosecution filed against Mr Andrews was due to be heard. 

‘Struck at the heart'

In the whirl of conspiracies online, there was little sympathy shown for the grieving families of the two police officers who had lost their lives.

Constable Thompson, 59, was a seasoned detective who was due to retire next month. He was chosen to serve the warrant on Freeman because he had dealt with him previously and they had developed a rapport. His colleague Constable De Waart, originally from Belgium, was 35 years old.

In a statement, Chief Commissioner Mike Bush said the loss of the two officers “struck at the heart of Victoria Police, the broader policing family and the community of Porepunkah”.

PM pledges ‘every support required'

On Friday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said national resources were at the police's disposal in the hunt for Freeman.

“What's occurred here is that we have offered the premier, Jacinta Allan, every support that is required,” Mr Albanese said.

“This guy clearly is dangerous. He's on the run and we want him caught. And we want people who are traumatised in that northeast community of Victoria to feel safe again.

“Porepunkah is a small community and this has devastated them. It's devastated the families of the police officers who've lost their lives.”

Mr Albanese reiterated the dangers of police work.

“The entire police family, the police have a bond and it's a reminder of all of us that the men and women who put on blue to defend us and to look after safety in our local communities, take a risk each and every day, so they are heroes,” he said.

“Detective Thompson and Senior Constable De Waart are heroes, and we also give our thoughts to those who have been injured during this incident.”

Victoria's top cop has issued a direct message to alleged cop killer and self-proclaimed sovereign citizen Dezi Freeman, as his wife was released after being arrested.

A fierce cold front is delivering winds strong enough to shred roofs, bringing blizzards, power outages and rare snowfalls as winter makes a dramatic final stand.

Police have made a desperate plea for alleged cop shooter Dezi Freeman to surrender as the manhunt enters its fourth day without a single confirmed sighting.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A grand jury refused to indict a man who was captured on video hurling a sandwich at a federal agent. Prosecutors dropped another case after complaints that police illegally searched a man's satchel and found a gun. Judges, too, have balked at keeping several defendants in jail, citing weak evidence and dubious charging decisions.

President Donald Trump's crackdown on crime in the nation's capital has generated a torrent of charges against people caught up in a surge of street patrols. Judges, defense attorneys and even grand jurors are already poking holes in many cases.

“I've seen things over the past 72 hours that I've never seen in federal court,” U.S. District Judge Zia Faruqui said Wednesday during a hearing for a man who was jailed for five days on a misdemeanor marijuana possession charge. Later, he added: “It feels like some sort of bizarre nightmare.”

Trump has framed the three-week-old operation as a campaign to eradicate rampant crime and “take our capital back.” The judges and lawyers adjudicating the criminal cases say they're striving to strike a delicate balance between protecting public safety and preserving civil liberties.

Teams of federal agents and troops are patrolling the streets of Washington, D.C., helping police arrest hundreds of people. The courts are struggling to keep up with the burgeoning caseload. Some people have been held in jail for days while waiting to appear before a federal judge in district court.




Edwin Jonathan Rodriguez, a 25-year-old recent college graduate, has a permit to carry a concealed firearm in Maryland. But he spent eight days in jail after police stopped his car near The Wharf neighborhood in Washington on Aug. 19 and said they found his registered gun, around 20 ounces of marijuana and drug paraphernalia.

U.S. Magistrate Judge G. Michael Harvey wasn't buying the government's contention that Rodriguez is a dangerous drug dealer.

“The cases in which drug dealers register their guns are exceptionally rare,” Harvey said as he ordered Rodriguez's release. “The government's case has got some challenges.”

Police officers and unspecified “federal partners” stopped Rodriguez because he was driving a Lexus with a license plate on the back but not the front of the vehicle, prosecutors said in a court filing. Defense attorney Joseph Scrofano accused law enforcement of jumping to baseless conclusions about the contents of the car.

“We don't hold people based on assumptions,” Scrofano said. “We hold people based on evidence.”

Rodriguez, a budding architect who graduated from Morgan State University in December, doesn't have a criminal record. But he faces a charge that carries a mandatory minimum prison sentence of five years if he's convicted.

The White House says over 1,200 people have been arrested and 135 firearms have been seized since the surge started on Aug. 7. The city's police department says crime rates have plunged in the district, including a 60% decrease in carjackings, a 56% drop in robberies and a 58% reduction in violent crimes as of Wednesday compared to the same one-week period in 2024.

Over 30 people arrested during the crackdown have been charged in district court, where the most serious crimes are prosecuted. Approximately half of them are charged with assaulting officers, agents or National Guard members, according to an Associated Press review of court records. The rest are charged with illegally possessing guns, drugs or both.

The volume of cases in district court pales in comparison to the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, which led to charges against nearly 1,600 people in the same courthouse. But the riot arrests were staggered across four years and all 50 states, easing the burden on the court.

Former federal prosecutor Michael Romano, who spent more than 17 years at the Justice Department and helped supervise Capitol riot prosecutions, said he never had a grand jury refuse to return an indictment in one of his cases. He said the Trump administration's efforts to appear tough on crime may have backfired with many D.C. residents, who serve on federal grand juries.

“Sometimes when you arrest people with scant evidence and you overcharge them, the community doesn't like it and the evidence won't support it,” said Romano, who resigned from the department earlier this year. “This illustrates the danger of having a Justice Department where attorneys can't do their job and can't properly evaluate whether cases are going to be good or not.”

At least three people have been arrested on assault charges for spitting on federal agents or troops on patrol. A viral video captured a Justice Department attorney hurling a “sub-style” sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection agent. But a grand jury refused to indict him on a felony charge — an extraordinarily rare failure for prosecutors.

“Grand juries, judges, we will not simply go along with the flow,” Faruqui said.

He questioned why people have been locked up for days for relatively minor offenses that typically aren't handled in district court. Faruqui said he shared his concerns with the leadership of U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro's office and hopes they can reduce the waits for detention hearings and initial court appearances.

Earlier this week, Pirro and Faruqui verbally sparred over her office's handling of a case against a man who was arrested at a Trader Joe's supermarket last month. Police officers said they followed Torez Riley into the grocery store and found two unregistered guns inside his satchel. He was charged with being a felon in possession of firearms, but Pirro's office dropped the case a week later.

During a hearing Monday, Faruqui said he was “absolutely flabbergasted” that Riley was jailed for a week before his case was dismissed. He said it was “without a doubt the most illegal search I have ever seen in my life.”

Pirro, a former Fox News host whom Trump appointed in May to lead the nation's largest U.S. Attorney's office, responded with a statement accusing Faruqui of having “a long history of bending over backwards to release dangerous felons in possession of firearms.”

On Thursday, Harvey ordered the release of a man who was arrested on Aug. 16 after a traffic stop by members of the U.S. Park Police and U.S. Marshals Service. The magistrate pressed a prosecutor to explain why the driver, Amarian Langston, was charged with illegally possessing a handgun that officers found beside a road after he crashed the vehicle. The prosecutor, Kyle McWaters, acknowledged that nobody saw Langston toss the weapon.

Prosecutors separately charged Langston's girlfriend in D.C. Superior Court, which hears less serious cases and is handling the bulk of the surge-related arrests. McWaters said the law allows the government to charge both with illegally possessing the same gun even though it allegedly belonged to the girlfriend.

Said McWaters: “I'm not saying it's an easy hill to climb, your honor.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Wes Moore would ‘absolutely welcome' federal support to lower crime in Baltimore","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/crime/3787259/wes-moore-would-absolutely-welcome-federal-support-to-lower-crime-in-baltimore/","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 16:15:54 GMT","

Gov. Wes Moore (D-MD) said he would “absolutely welcome” federal support to help lower crime in Baltimore after pushing back on President Donald Trump's comments about the city's high crime rates. 

“I would absolutely welcome federal support, but I also know that federal support is going to be necessary and required,” Moore said on Fox News's the Will Cain Show on Thursday.

Moore's comments came after a back-and-forth between him and Trump regarding Baltimore's crime rate. When Trump deployed federal troops in Washington, D.C., he also highlighted crime in Baltimore. 

Moore reiterated he would not activate the Maryland National Guard and wrote a letter to Trump, inviting the president to join him for a public safety walk in September to show Baltimore's progress in lowering crime. 

“If there's anything Maryland has proven over the last two years, it's that we can achieve performance without being performative,” Moore said. “Progress requires the right tool for the right mission. Asking the patriotic citizen soldiers of our National Guard to police our cities doesn't meet that test.”

Trump responded to Moore's invitation, saying he “would much prefer that [Moore] clean up this Crime disaster before I go there for a ‘walk.'”

Baltimore ranked third in “violent crime” per capita, which is 347.3% above the national rate, according to FBI crime data released in 2024. 

TRUMP SAYS HE HAS ‘RIGHT' TO SEND NATIONAL GUARD TO FIGHT CRIME IN CITIES ‘IN DANGER'

Moore said in the Thursday Fox News interview that the only federal support he “questions” is the deployment of the National Guard. 

“We would love to have additional support for license plate readers, things that we know that can actually stop crimes as they're happening and making sure people are brought to justice,” Moore said. “And not have $30 million cut from public safety budgeting that is coming from the federal government.” 

Baltimore recorded 68 homicides this year, as of July 1. The midyear Baltimore Police Department report said this was a 22% year-over-year decrease in homicide and 19% decrease in nonfatal shootings. 

The Maryland governor also said he would love to see the federal government ban ghost guns, as well as investments in local law enforcement. 

TRUMP'S CLASHES WITH DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS SET STAGE FOR 2028 RACE

Moore said safety was one of the reasons he ran for governor. 

“When I became the governor, I said our No. 1 priority was going to be public safety,” Moore said. “While we still have very real work to do, we are also very clear that the results we have started to see in the past 2 1/2 years are deeply encouraging.”

According to a new Harvard Center for American Political Studies-Harris poll, a majority of people support Trump's actions in Washington, with 54% saying it's “justified” and “necessary.” The poll was conducted online from Aug. 20-21 among 2,025 registered voters within the United States.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Meet Bill Pulte, the Trump housing official at the center of the latest Fed controversy","https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-bill-pulte-housing-lisa-cook-federal-reserve-2025-8","Fri, 29 Aug 2025 18:17:00 GMT","

You may have heard Bill Pulte's name a lot as of late.

Pulte is the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or FHFA under President Donald Trump, serving in a role that gives him regulatory authority over the country's mortgage industry.

He's been using that authority in unusual ways — including getting involved in Trump's clashes with the Federal Reserve.

Pulte has been an outspoken critic of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, has called on him to resign, and reportedly gave Trump a drafted letter that would fire Powell.

And earlier this month, Pulte accused Federal Reserve Board Gov. Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud, leading Trump to attempt to fire her and kicking off a legal battle that remains ongoing, with implications for the US economy.

Here's what you should know about Pulte.

Pulte's family has been involved in housing for a long time: Bill Pulte is the grandson of William J. Pulte, the founder of the home-building company PulteGroup.

The younger Pulte founded his own investment firm, Pulte Capital Partners, in 2011, shortly after he graduated from Northwestern University. In addition to being CEO of Pulte Capital, he also served on the board of PulteGroup and was based in Michigan, near Detroit.

In 2019, he gained a following on Twitter, now known as X, for engaging in ""Twitter Philanthropy,"" in which he gave away thousands of dollars to various followers in need.

That involved things like investing in small businesses, paying for some users' groceries, or offering a reward to find a missing person. He even once partnered with the make-up artist Jeffree Star on a $30,000 cash giveaway.

He's also a major political donor, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to support Trump and other GOP candidates during the 2024 election cycle.

Pulte's nomination to be FHFA director was confirmed by the Senate in March by a 56-34 vote, mostly along party lines.

He made some early moves at FHFA, including consolidating the agency's control over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Pulte announced earlier this year that he was directing both companies, which are under a government conservatorship, to consider cryptocurrency as an asset in mortgage lending.

But he's garnered even more notoriety for his role in Trump's war with the Fed.

According to the New York Times, Pulte drafted a letter for Trump that would have fired Powell. Trump reportedly showed off the letter to a group of GOP lawmakers at the White House in July, when the president was considering firing the Federal Reserve chair.

Pulte has also been a loud critic of Powell, and he accompanied Trump during his high-profile tour of the Fed later in July.

Pulte's focus on Powell drew the ire of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who in a July letter to Pulte said that he appeared ""distracted"" from his main job.

More consequentially, Pulte helped spur Trump's attempted firing of Lisa Cook, a Federal Reserve Board governor appointed by President Joe Biden.

Trump called for her to resign, and then said he was removing her, citing Pulte's allegations that she had committed mortgage fraud.

Cook refused to step aside, saying that Trump has no authority to fire her. That kicked off a legal battle that remains ongoing.

In addition to his allegations against Cook, Pulte has also used his position to accuse Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California and New York Attorney General Tish James — both prominent Trump critics — of mortgage fraud.

The Department of Justice is now investigating both officials, who have denied Pulte's allegations and characterized them as baseless attempts at political retribution.

Trump's Tariffs:

Trump cabinet officials told a federal appeals court that ruling the president's global tariffs illegal would seriously harm US foreign policy, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warning of “dangerous diplomatic embarrassment.”

The administration on Friday filed statements by Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington. The court is expected to decide soon whether President Donald Trump exceeded his authority to impose tariffs under a 1977 emergency powers law.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

In this article

Meta on Friday said it is making temporary changes to its artificial intelligence chatbot policies related to teenagers as lawmakers voice concerns about safety and inappropriate conversations.

The social media giant is now training its AI chatbots so that they do not generate responses to teenagers about subjects like self-harm, suicide, disordered eating and avoid potentially inappropriate romantic conversations, a Meta spokesperson confirmed. 

The company said AI chatbots will instead point teenagers to expert resources when appropriate.

""As our community grows and technology evolves, we're continually learning about how young people may interact with these tools and strengthening our protections accordingly,"" the company said in a statement.

Additionally, teenage users of Meta apps like Facebook and Instagram will only be able to access certain AI chatbots intended for educational and skill-development purposes.

The company said it's unclear how long these temporary modifications will last, but they will begin rolling out over the next few weeks across the company's apps in English-speaking countries. The ""interim changes"" are part of the company's longer-term measures over teen safety.

TechCrunch was first to report the change.

Last week, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said that he was launching an investigation into Meta following a Reuters report about the company permitting its AI chatbots to engage in ""romantic"" and ""sensual"" conversations with teens and children.

The Reuters report described an internal Meta document that detailed permissible AI chatbot behaviors that staff and contract workers should take into account when developing and training the software.  

In one example, the document cited by Reuters said that a chatbot would be allowed to have a romantic conversation with an eight-year-old and could tell the minor that ""every inch of you is a masterpiece – a treasure I cherish deeply.""

A Meta spokesperson told Reuters at the time that ""The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed.""

Most recently, the nonprofit advocacy group Common Sense Media released a risk assessment of Meta AI on Thursday and said that it should not be used by anyone under the age of 18, because the ""system actively participates in planning dangerous activities, while dismissing legitimate requests for support,"" the nonprofit said in a statement.

""This is not a system that needs improvement. It's a system that needs to be completely rebuilt with safety as the number-one priority, not an afterthought,"" said Common Sense Media CEO James Steyer in a statement. ""No teen should use Meta AI until its fundamental safety failures are addressed.""

Massimo Sandal

 August 28, 2025  

According to a longitudinal study published in Tobacco Control, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) may erase five decades of progress against smoking.

Researchers found that young people who vape are just as likely to take up traditional cigarettes as teens were half a century ago.

Rather than offering a safe substitute, e-cigarettes pose health risks of their own and may normalise smoking behaviours, making the transition to regular cigarettes more likely.

The hypothesis that e-cigarettes can help individuals quit smoking remains controversial.

Studies have shown that dual use is common, and switching from e-cigarettes to traditional cigarettes is easier than switching from traditional cigarettes to e-cigarettes, raising questions about their role as a risk factor for smoking.

In fact, switching from e-cigarettes to traditional cigarettes is easier than switching from traditional cigarettes to e-cigarettes. Therefore, it is reasonable to question whether e-cigarettes are a risk factor for traditional smoking.

The study analysed data from three UK cohort studies: the National Child Development Study (NCDS), which tracked 11,969 individuals born in 1958; the British Cohort Study (BCS), which tracked 6222 participants born in 1970; and the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS), including 9733 individuals born between 2000 and 2002.

Researchers assessed smoking rates among 16- and 17-year-olds in 1974, 1986, and 2018.

They examined individual risk factors such as alcohol consumption, school engagement, verbal ability, and parent-reported externalising behaviours.

Family factors included paternal occupation status such as unemployed or self-employed, the age at which the mother left education, and parental tobacco use, including maternal smoking during pregnancy. The MCS also collected data on e-cigarette use (never, past/experimental, and current).

Adolescent smoking has declined by two thirds over the past 50 years, from 33% in 1974 to 12% in 2018.

Key risk factors have remained consistent: Alcohol use increased the odds of smoking by 2.87-fold in the NCDS, 4.37-fold in the BCS, and 3.15-fold in the MCS.

Meanwhile, many risk factors have decreased over time: Teen alcohol use fell from 94% to 83%, mothers' average school-leaving age rose from 15.5 to 17.7 years, and parental smoking dropped from 72% to 27%.

In the most recent cohort, 11% of the youth reported current e-cigarette use, 41% reported past or experimental use, and 48% had never vaped.

Young individuals who have never used e-cigarettes have a very low chance of starting to smoke (approximately 1.4%).

In contrast, individuals who currently use e-cigarettes face a much higher risk of around 32.6% comparable to smoking rates in the general population in 1974. In practice, nonusers are extremely unlikely to start smoking, while current users face a risk similar to that of adolescents over 50 years ago.

The data do not prove causation but suggest that vaping may act as a gateway to tobacco, or that shared risk factors may predispose some youth to both behaviours.

Researchers have warned that long-standing reductions in youth smoking could be reversed by increasing the use of e-cigarettes. The number of youth using e-cigarettes is even more striking. “Indeed, it may be that youth who would have historically been considered ‘low risk' for combustible cigarette use become ‘at risk' through their nicotine exposure by experimenting with or using e-cigarettes,” the authors wrote.

In 2024, Italy's National Institute of Health (ISS) reported that one third of adolescents smoke or vape, with 60% using multiple nicotine products, including tobacco, heated tobacco, and e-cigarettes.

The European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) data show that 23.6% of 15- to 16-year-olds smoked cigarettes in 2024, a declining but still common rate of cigarette smoking.

“The increasingly aggressive marketing of nicotine products towards this age group, which moves from tools such as packaging and the increasingly ‘attractive' appearance of the devices to the creation of ‘fruity' flavours closer to the tastes of young people, is causing their use to become increasingly widespread,” emphasised Simona Pichini, director of the National Centre for Addiction and Doping at the ISS.

Social media platforms, such as Instagram, and large networks of influencers extensively promote these products.

Italy is facing rising concerns regarding nicotine use among the youth. ESPAD data show that nearly 15% of 16-year-olds still smoke, more than 20% use tobacco, and 40% of e-cigarette users begin smoking before the age of 15 years. In the past month, e-cigarette use surged to 20%, up from 7% in 2018.

ROME (AP) — Giovanni Leoni, the 18-year-old Liverpool centre back, was one of three players given their first national team call-up by new Italy coach Gennaro Gattuso on Friday.

Also named to the Azzurri squad for the first time were Inter Milan forward Francesco Pio Esposito and Bologna midfielder Giovanni Fabbian.

It's the first time Gattuso has named his squad since taking over for the fired Luciano Spalletti in June.

Italy has three points from two matches. Norway, which has played four matches, leads Group I with 12 points, and Israel is next with six points from three matches.

Leoni transferred from Parma to Liverpool this month but has not played for the Premier League champion yet.

Atalanta forward Gianlunca Scamacca has returned to the squad after a series of injuries, as has Roma center back Gianluca Mancini, who had been excluded by Spalletti.

Forward Mateo Retegui was included despite his recent move to Saudi Arabia, as was Newcastle midfielder Sandro Tonali despite a shoulder issue.

2025 Dutch GP FP2: Every spill, spin and crash from Friday practice at Zandvoort

TECH TALK – What's new after the summer? 

With record-breaking attendance, unprecedented digital engagement and a blockbuster film captivating audiences worldwide, Formula 1's momentum shows no signs of slowing.

The first half of the 2025 Formula 1 season has delivered drama, innovation and record-breaking achievements, both on and off the track.

From thrilling wheel-to-wheel racing and sold-out Grands Prix to the global success of F1 The Movie and ground-breaking activations, the sport continues to accelerate into an exciting new era.

As the sport returns from the summer break, refreshed and raring to go racing once again, let's look at some of the highlights from the season so far.

The 2025 season began with a spectacular celebration of Formula 1's 75th anniversary at London's O2 Arena – F1 75 Live.

Tickets sold out in just 20 minutes, as the event brought together all 10 F1 teams – for the first time ever – to unveil their liveries ahead of the new campaign. 16,000 fans enjoyed an incredible evening that combined the glamour of Formula 1 with world-class entertainment, featuring performances from global music stars such as mgk, Take That, Tems, Kane Brown and Brian Tyler's Are We Dreaming.

The response to the event was phenomenal and helped the sport reach new audiences. Live broadcast coverage from 42 broadcast partners spanned 37 territories across the world, while 7.5 million viewers tuned in across Formula 1's social channels.

The F1 YouTube livestream alone, watched in 211 territories, was the most successful in the channel's history – setting a new record with over twice as many views as the previous best performing stream.

June saw the global release of F1 The Movie, which has become the largest-grossing sports film of all time and the highest-grossing Apple film to date, surpassing $600 million at the box office.

Directed by Joe Kosinski and starring Brad Pitt, the movie – Pitt's highest grossing film – has been praised for its authenticity, earning a 97% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes and an ‘A' CinemaScore rating.

The production captured over 185 hours of footage at iconic circuits during actual Grand Prix weekends and was supported by more than 1,900 crew members – with roughly 400 members of the crew at each event.

More than 2,000 hours of F1 broadcast footage was recorded for the movie, which saw New York's Times Square transformed into a Formula 1 showcase for its world premiere in front of huge crowds. The European premiere in London's Leicester Square followed a week later, with both events attracting Hollywood icons, A-list celebrities, award-winning global music stars and, of course, F1 superstars.

Fan enthusiasm to attend a Grand Prix has reached unprecedented levels, with 3.9 million fans attending the first 14 races of 2025 – the highest mid-season total in Formula 1 history.

Eleven events sold out completely, with six setting new attendance records. Silverstone and Albert Park drew crowds of 500,000 and 465,000 people respectively, while Belgium, Canada, Spain and Austria also recorded attendances exceeding 300,000.

Formula 1's digital footprint has continued to expand, particularly among younger audiences, with the sport's social media following growing to 107.6 million — a 21% increase year-on-year, and up from 18.7 million in 2018.

Fans continue to watch race weekend action after events, with YouTube views for highlights climbing by 30%. The Australian Grand Prix highlights alone attracted 13 million views within the first week, making it the second largest audience on the channel after the Abu Dhabi 2021 season finale.

More time is also being spent on F1.com and the official Formula 1 app, with total content views up 17% compared to last year.

Television audiences have remained strong across key markets, with 13 of the 14 races recording year-on-year growth in live viewership.

The season-opening Australian Grand Prix weekend had over 60 million cumulative linear TV viewers worldwide, while in the United States, live race viewership is up 23% vs. the 2024 season average – the Miami Sprint also setting a new viewership record since the format was introduced in 2021.

Twelve of the 14 races this season have seen year-over-year viewership growth on ESPN in the US, with seven of them setting event viewership records. The broadcaster has also seen a 14% increase in its younger demographic (between 18-49) in comparison to 2024.

The growing global appeal of F1 has resulted in several extensions and agreements with broadcast partners around the world.

Tencent were renewed as the broadcaster for Formula 1 in mainland China, while there was a long-term extension agreed with Bell Media in Canada and Globo was confirmed as the Brazilian broadcaster from 2026.

Formula 1 now boasts a global fanbase of 827 million, cementing its position as the world's most popular annual sporting series with a year-on-year increase of 12% – and a 63% increase compared to 2018.

The fanbase is becoming younger and more diverse too, with 43% of fans now under the age of 35 – a growth of 51 million year-on-year – and female representation rising to 42%, up from 37% in 2018.

Interest in F1 continues to grow in heritage markets such as the UK (+24%), Italy (12%) and Brazil (+9%), and in growth markets including the US and China where interest has surged by 11% and 39% respectively.

The United States fanbase, supported by three unique races, has reached 52 million and is the largest F1 market for YouTube viewership (135 million) and social media followers (5.8 million), with social followers up 26% year-on-year.

Meanwhile, a sold-out Chinese Grand Prix weekend saw 220,000 fans attend earlier this year — up 9% vs. 2024 — as China reached over 221 million claimed F1 fans, up +39% year-on-year. Over half have started following the sport in the last five years, while 46% are female and 40% are aged between 16-34.

F1 holds an increasing number of prestigious partnerships, specialising in a wide variety of sectors and appealing to markets across the world, that has more than doubled since 2020 – going from 12 to 27 partners in just five years.

The first half of 2025 saw Formula 1 strengthen its commercial portfolio with major global brands. A 10-year deal began with luxury group LVMH, bringing Louis Vuitton, TAG Heuer and Moët Hennessy – and a range of their brands including, Moët & Chandon, Belvedere, Whispering Angel and Glenmorangie – into the sport.

In May, PepsiCo joined as an Official Partner until 2030 with brands including Doritos and Sting Energy, plus Gatorade became the Official Partner of F1 Sprint. Disney's Mickey & Friends also announced a partnership set to begin in 2026.

At the start of the year, Michelin-starred chef Gordon Ramsay became a partner of the sport, delivering a world-class culinary experience in F1 Garage across 10 Grands Prix this year. Barilla, the world's biggest pasta producer, also became the Official Pasta Partner at the Bahrain Grand Prix.

Elsewhere, multi-national lottery-led entertainment company Allwyn became an Official Partner in a multi-year deal, PwC signed up as the sport's Official Consulting Partner and ALT Sports Data became the Official Betting Data Supplier, while MSC Cruises agreed a partnership extension until 2030.

There was a host of innovative partner activations that captured global attention too. At the Miami Grand Prix, for example, the Drivers' Parade featured 10 life-sized LEGO F1 cars, each built from nearly 400,000 bricks and capable of reaching 20 kph, driven – or, more accurately, raced – by the F1 drivers.

The activation received an incredible reception from media, fans, and the drivers themselves, becoming the most viewed partner content on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook ever.

The British Grand Prix also saw LEGO-designed trophies presented on the podium, celebrating the sport's 75th anniversary, while other highlights included Barilla's culinary showcase with Massimo Bottura – holder of three Michelin stars and a green Michelin star – in Bahrain, and Qatar Airways' pop-up barbershop with celebrity hair stylist Sheldon Edwards (HD Cutz) at Silverstone.

F1 ACADEMY announced multiple new partnerships too, as it continues to grow. TAG Heuer became the series' first ever Official Timekeeper, while TeamViewer, More than Equal, Wella Company and PepsiCo's Gatorade also partnered with the all-female series.

2025 has seen several Formula 1 events get long-term extensions, with the majority of the F1 calendar now contracted into the 2030s and Miami and Austria contracted until 2041.

An extension through 2028 was agreed with the Mexico City Grand Prix, while the Canadian Grand Prix was extended through 2035 and the Belgian Grand Prix was renewed on a multi-year extension.

The calendar for the 2026 season has also been announced, including further improvements to the geographical flow of races and a new circuit in Madrid – adding to the excitement of next year's new era of regulations.

There are any number of movies about people who try to reinvent themselves in the face of a crisis. There are many fewer movies about people who violently refuse to even consider that idea — people who would rather kill someone else than become someone else. Park Chan-wook's bleak, brilliant, and mordantly hilarious “No Other Choice” is the exception that proves the rule. 

Plotted with ornate precision but unfolding with the panic of a desperate man, this Vantablack comedy tells the story of a mustached paper manufacturing specialist (“Squid Game” villain Lee Byung-hun as Man-su) who achieves the suburban idyll just in time to be let go from the company where he's worked for the last 25 years. Some American investors have bought a piece of the business, and with it the right to restructure things as they see fit.

The high-end eel meat that Man-su received in the mail should've been his first clue that he was on the chopping block. Instead, Man-su saw it as proof that he'd finally made it. “I've got it all,” he sighs over the grill as he barbecues for his smiling wife Miri (Son Yejin) and their two children on the lawn of the brutalist manse he bought as a monument to his success. 

 










But it's already gone. “Off with your head” is a common refrain in Korea when someone gets fired, and Man-su truly reacts to the loss of his job as if it were an execution. He struggles to find another gig in the rapidly contracting paper industry (and to wave away dark thoughts about his dutiful wife fucking her tennis instructor), but there's too much competition for the few spots that remain, and he refuses to consider another career path. 

Man-su's only hope: A position at the ascendant Moon Paper, where he'd work as a subordinate to one of his former underlings. The interview is a disaster, but just as his old company had “no other choice” but to let him go, Man-su conspires to give the Moon Paper executives “no other choice” but to bring him aboard. The paper business is a rather specialized field, and Man-su reasons that he would only have to murder a measly three people to become the only hirable candidate for the job. That doesn't seem like an unreasonable body count for someone who's about to default on his mortgage — someone who's already suffered the indignity of being forced to cancel his family's Netflix account. So Man-su publishes an ad for a fake new company as bait for his competition, and orchestrates a plan to kill his way back to the top.

 










Or to stay in the upper-middle, I should say. Among the more tragic ironies of “No Other Choice” is that Man-su goes to wild extremes just to avoid the horror of falling into a slightly lower tax bracket. To his mind, the line between heaven and hell is as thin as the glass walls of the spectacular greenhouse where Man-su tends to his bonsai trees at night. 

But Park's film — despite skewering capitalism with much of the same wit, sadness, and slapstick buffoonery that made Bong Joon Ho's “Parasite” so resonant around the world — is pointedly not about poverty. While Miri can no longer afford to put meat in the noodle soup she makes for dinner, her kids are never at risk of going hungry. This is a story about sustenance of a different sort; it's a “Looney Tunes”-like fable about how capitalism exerts itself by feeding our self-images as it fattens our wallets, and by conflating what we do with who we are to the point that one becomes dependent upon the other. 

That feeling infects society on almost every level. The movie's first life is so much funnier when it happens to other people snicker — a staple of Park's darkly humane sense of humor — comes from the sight of Man-su being stripped naked of a store uniform as he quits a retail job in order to attend his Moon Paper interview. But in focusing on an upwardly mobile striver like Man-su, “No Other Choice” eschews both need and entitlement in order to dramatize the more broadly relatable dilemma of rooting your entire identity in a system that will tear you out of the soil without a second thought. 

 










Immaculately spacious for a story this unsubtle, Park's film toys with the idea that capitalism is an engine for moral impunity — that it's a universally accepted excuse for the kind of thoughtless cruelties that would seem beyond reproach in any other context. And even though we understand the general outline of Man-su's plan from the start, it's so riveting to watch it play out (and go wrong) because “No Other Choice” sees his murder spree as a natural extension of capitalism, rather than a bizarre aberration from it. Demented, yes. Insane, not so much.

The result is the rare film that feels sympathetic toward its protagonist without ever rooting for him, and Lee's elastic performance as Man-su — clumsy, pathetic, cucked by osmosis, and still only a hair worse than we are — is key to the balancing act of Park's tragicomic tone. Easy to roll your eyes at from the opening scene and increasingly pigheaded in all of the ones that follow, Man-su starts off a long way from likable and tumbles much lower in our estimation from there. But the high-wire nature of the movie's plot requires us to appreciate the credibility of Man-su's conviction without necessarily sharing it ourselves (there's a terrific scene where an oblivious Man-su lectures one of the men he wants to kill with all of the same perspective we've been screaming at him in our heads), and no one on Earth can match Park's signature ability to make characters more endearing as they stumble toward the void.

 










In much of the filmmaker's previous work, that ability has been expressed with the sweep of a symphony and the precision of a Swiss watch, but however tempting it is to bemoan the fact that Park's work has been growing less hyper-stylized since 2016's “The Handmaiden” (the ultimate display of his Vivaldian genius), there's a unique thrill in watching one of the world's most fastidious directors adapt a story (from Donald Westlake's 1997 novel “The Ax”) about a half-witted moron whose first idea is to drop a flower pot on someone's head. Imagine Wes Anderson collaborating with Joaquin Phoenix and you'll have a vague idea of the tension inherent to Park Chan-wook building a movie around a guy like Man-su, who plots like the villain from “Oldboy” or the heroine of “Lady Vengeance” but executes with all the grace of Wile E. Coyote. A bottomless wellspring of physical comedy, Man-su is so bad at killing people that it eventually starts to seem as if he might be the only person who doesn't survive this movie.

“No Other Choice” is unmistakably still a Park Chan-wook project on its face (I lost count of all the diabolical match cuts, devious transitions, and delirious zooms that he sets to another string and harpsichord masterpiece from his long-time composer Cho Young-wuk), but it's meant to exist in a workaday register, and feels naturalistic even compared to the relatively, and I stress relatively, stripped down romanticism of “Decision to Leave.” Not only does that rawer approach offer a metatextual twist on the tension that's pulling Man-su apart at the seams (that between resistance and reinvention), it also creates a more immediate tension of its own: that between a delicately arranged movie and a main character so chaotic that you almost can't imagine him doing anything right. It allows “No Other Choice” to be both larger than life and also just a few missed paychecks away from a conceivable reality. 

 










But the Man-su we see at the end of his rope isn't the same Man-su who won his industry's most coveted and meaningless award just a few years prior. He's better in some ways and worse in several others. More importantly, he was more practical then. Having a steady job can have that effect. Now it's up to his wife Miri, another of Park's indelible female leads, to be the family's last bastion of logic. 

As Man-su's arc begins to wilt toward the end of the story, the crude violence of his plan gradually overgrown with gardening metaphors and magical thinking, Miri's presence becomes stronger to balance things out. Although “No Other Choice” lacks the emotional gutpunch of Park's best films (much as its devastatingly ironic final shot leaves a lasting bruise in its own right), Miri becomes a poignant vessel for all of the movie's conflicted feelings about self-worth and survival. It's Miri who's forced to account for what matters to their family, and for what they might be willing to live with or without. It's Miri who makes the hardest choices in a movie where everyone else refuses to accept that they have any choices to make at all. 

Miri's final decision to [redacted] is as easy to rebuke as Man-su's initial decision to become a serial killer, but — to the immense credit of a slaphappy movie with a surprisingly powerful sting — it's also just as difficult to dismiss outright. She holds onto the only choice that all of this madness has left her with, and as the world around her surrenders its last measure of agency to the demands of an apathetically efficient future (shoutout to AI!), Miri's refusal to abandon what's left of her own almost feels like its own fucked up kind of heroic act. Capitalism won't ever care about you, but people will always be full of surprises. 

 










“No Other Choice” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. NEON will release it in the United States.
