                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major health issue worldwide. Many patients end up requiring regular dialysis to avoid kidney failure and stay alive. A research group led by Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine's Professor Takaaki Abe has found a remarkable solution to treat patients with CKD by co-opting a drug typically used for constipation. This is the first time that this drug (lubiprostone) was shown to prevent the decline of renal function in patients with CKD. We noticed that constipation is a symptom that often accompanies CKD, and decided to investigate this link further. Essentially, constipation disrupts the intestinal microbiota, which worsens kidney function. Professor Takaaki Abe, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine To address this issue, the group conducted a multicenter Phase II clinical trial (LUBI-CKD TRIAL) at nine Japanese medical institutions, enrolling 150 patients with moderate CKD. This study evaluated the effects of lubiprostone on kidney function. They found that lubiprostone increases spermidine production, which improves mitochondrial function by promoting bacterial growth in the gut. The improved mitochondrial function was seen to exert a renoprotective effect – suppressing further kidney damage. This discovery has the potential to significantly transform the conventional approach to CKD treatment, which primarily focuses on reducing uremic toxins. These findings suggest a new therapeutic strategy in which laxatives suppress renal function decline. This strategy is expected to contribute to the development of treatments for not only CKD, but also mitochondrial dysfunction disorders.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An international team led by researchers at Lund University in Sweden has identified the molecular tools needed to reprogram ordinary cells into specialized immune cells. Their work describes how they identified a genetic toolkit that programs two powerful subtypes of dendritic cells – key sentinels of the immune system. Dendritic cells are a diverse group of immune cells that act as the body's "teachers", guiding the immune system to recognise and attack threats such as viruses, bacteria or tumours. Supplying patients with dendritic cells designed to target their cancer could make treatments more precise and powerful. Understanding how this cellular diversity is generated during the process of development has long been a mystery. Scientists have known some of the so-called transcription factors – proteins that switch genes on and off – that control these cells' development, but how these factors work together to create different dendritic cell types has been unclear. Now, the team of researchers behind this publication has carried out a systematic mapping of the routes to dendritic cell identity. "Through cellular reprogramming, one cell type can be converted into another. We identified two specific combinations of three factors that act as tools to build two dendritic cell types: conventional type 2 dendritic cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells," says Filipe Pereira, professor of molecular medicine at Lund University, who has led the research. When tested in mouse cancer models, one engineered dendritic cell subtype triggered strong immune responses against melanoma, while others acted against breast cancer, in ways similar to their natural counterparts. Immunotherapy is one of the most promising areas in medicine, but many patients still do not respond. Our work shows that by generating specific dendritic cell types, we can better match the immune response to a specific cancer. This is an early step, but it points to the potential for truly personalised immunotherapy." Filipe Pereira, professor of molecular medicine at Lund University Beyond cancer, the discovery that dendritic cell diversity can be programmed may have applications in autoimmune diseases. Anchored screening identifies transcription factor blueprints underlying dendritic cell diversity and subset-specific anti-tumor immunity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anorexia is a serious mental health disorder that typically begins during adolescence. A study, conducted by the Research Unit of Population Health and Oulu Business School at the University of Oulu, examined how anorexia in adolescence affects labor market position in adulthood compared with peers. Many mental health disorders have previously been linked to a weaker position in the labor market, but research evidence relating to anorexia has been very limited and, in many respects, inadequate. Generalizing these findings to the present day is difficult, as in recent decades there have been major changes in working life, the availability of psychiatric services, and the recognition of young people with anorexia within the service system.The results of the newly published study showed that both men and women with anorexia had lower income levels and more days of unemployment in adulthood compared with their peers. The effects on labor market position were particularly pronounced in men. Although anorexia often has a favorable long-term prognosis in terms of general health, its impact on working life can be significant." Tuomas Majuri, lead author of the research article, Postdoctoral Researcher The study utilized data from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 and national registry data on income, unemployment days and sickness absence days at ages 25-33.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>About 1 in 10 COVID-19 survivors develop a range of long COVID symptoms that can last from months to years. How and why these symptoms develop isn't completely known, but they have been linked to activated immune T cells getting into organs and tissues. These events can be related, because blood vessels become leaky when T cells are activated nearby, but may also be coincidental because leaky blood vessels allow more immune cells to leave the blood and enter tissues. Negar Omidvari, assistant project scientist at the UC Davis Department of Biomedical Engineering and principal investigator on the grant, will use total-body positron emission tomography (PET) technology, originally developed by Professors Simon Cherry and Ramsey Badawi at UC Davis, and kinetic modeling to look at both processes simultaneously in patients with long COVID. PET imaging usually uses short-lived radioactive tracers to measure metabolic activity inside the body. Omidvari will collaborate with CellSight Technologies Inc. of San Francisco to use a tracer called 18F-AraG, which specifically tags activated T cells. Using dynamic total-body PET imaging and sophisticated modeling, she aims to see how activated T cells collect in different organs at different times, where blood vessel damage is occurring, and whether these processes are related to each other. If we can separate the vascular damage from the presence of activated T cells in tissue, we should be able to get a much better picture of what's going on." Negar Omidvari, assistant project scientist, UC Davis Department of Biomedical Engineering The study will work with patients from UCSF's long COVID program (LIINC - Long-term Impact of Infection with Novel Coronavirus) who will be scanned at baseline, four and eight months.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UNSW research has shed light on how cells in the body manage and store fat, potentially offering new insights into health. Fat, or lipids, are stored inside cells in small compartments called lipid droplets. These droplets are essential for energy storage and other cellular functions. Our findings provide a clearer picture of the intricate machinery that controls how cells store fat. Understanding this process is a critical step towards developing new strategies to address a range of metabolic disorders like obesity and diabetes." The study reveals that CHP1 directly influences key enzymes, called microsomal GPATs, responsible for creating fat molecules. Not only does CHP1 help stabilize and activate these enzymes, but it also directs them to the right location-the surface of the lipid droplets-where they are needed most. This discovery advances our basic knowledge of how cells regulate fat metabolism and opens new avenues for future research into conditions related to abnormal fat storage. CHP1 promotes lipid droplet growth and regulates the localization of key enzymes for triacylglycerol synthesis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We can apply this method to make multiple natural products, including novel vinylic ethers." San Pham, an Emory PhD candidate and first author of the paper These enhancements greatly expand the reaction's potential for the synthesis of complex, biologically active compounds for drug research. "San Pham demonstrated that our new method works for several combinations of reactants, producing at least 15 new compounds that were previously unknown and would likely have been quite difficult to prepare using other known synthetic strategies," says Frank McDonald, senior author of the paper and Emory professor of chemistry. McDonald is also a member of the Discovery and Developmental Therapeutics Research Program at Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University. The McDonald lab explores new and improved methods for preparing organic compounds - particularly bioactive compounds that may become new pharmaceutical agents. Preliminary studies suggest plasmalogens are involved in a range of beneficial biological activities, including anti-oxidation and anti-inflammation. Vinylic ethers - which consist of an oxygen atom directly attached to a carbon atom that's bonded to another carbon atom - are important synthetic intermediates for the synthesis of many bioactive compounds. The few known methods for synthesizing vinylic ethers with an attached alkene, however, have limited their applications. For nearly six years, the McDonald lab worked on developing a good way of making these key building blocks. While the reaction works well with simple reactants, the McDonald lab found it produced only low yields when linking two structurally complex reactants. "This reaction is also a little bit capricious," McDonald says. "It's not so easily reproducible and it didn't seem to be fine tunable for our needs." Then San Pham agreed to take on the project. One problem the lab encountered with the Chan-Evans-Lam reaction is that the copper acetate catalyst is what is known as a dimer complex - two molecules bonded together. "I started reading organic chemistry papers about breaking up this dimer, papers that weren't even related to this reaction," Pham says. She spent months doing this research, scouring countless papers. "Running random experiments is a waste of time and resources, so I'm strategic about my reaction design," Pham explains. She ran experiments using this new catalyst activator to synthesize the test compound. Pham screened several more catalyst activators with similar chemical properties. "No matter what I tried I couldn't improve the yield beyond 50 percent, which is still not good enough," she says. Pham ran painstaking experiments to track and analyze every step in the process of the reaction to further understand its weaknesses. "At that point I was trying out oxygen gas as the reagent to regenerate the catalyst," Pham says. "I was using a balloon to pump in the oxygen. Pham dove back into the scientific literature, spending months reading through mechanistic papers about catalytic turnover and regeneration. "I hit the jackpot, basically," Pham says. She ran more experiments with this final piece of the puzzle in place. She also achieved good yields for at least 15 different compounds new to the literature - demonstrating that her method applies to a wide range of complex structures important to drug discovery. "San's improvements make this reaction a much more reliable and useful method," McDonald says. "The new catalyst and reaction components are all relatively inexpensive and safe to use, and we hope other researchers will also explore its potential for synthetic applications." "I hope that when other people run into a problem working with similar substrates and are close to giving up," Pham says, "they will read our paper and hit on a clue that helps them keep going."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inspired by an urgent need to improve timely defibrillation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) in dense urban settings, a team of investigators developed a simulation that explored the potential of leveraging an existing food delivery network in Taipei City, Taiwan, to help address this challenge. Their findings in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology, published by Elsevier, suggest that deploying food delivery riders to deliver defibrillation may reduce automated external defibrillator (AED) response times by approximately three minutes-about 50% faster than a traditional emergency medical system (EMS)-and might be particularly beneficial during peak hours. Our approach leverages an existing, widespread urban workforce to address a well-known weak link in the chain of survival. We found that it offers a cost-effective and scalable strategy for improving OHCA outcomes in high-density cities, where EMS cannot always provide immediate defibrillation." Densely populated Taipei has a high concentration of food delivery (FD) scooter riders. To examine the feasibility of utilizing these FD riders as first responders for AED delivery in OHCA incidents investigators conducted a city-scale simulation using real-world OHCA data from the Registry of the Taipei City Fire Department between 2017 and 2019, public defibrillator locations, and food delivery patterns and hotspots using the Uber Eats platform. The simulation assumed that every open restaurant in a hotspot had one FD rider waiting and ready to respond to OHCAs within a two-kilometer radius. FD riders' response rates were varied, and simulated defibrillator arrival times were compared to documented fire department delivery times of six to seven minutes. Differences in defibrillator arrival times during peak and off-peak hours were also assessed. Achieving 80% coverage during peak hours required 13.4% of FD riders to respond.According to co-corresponding investigator Albert Y. Chen, PhD, Department of Civil Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei City, Taiwan, "Integrating FD riders into the EMS system could reduce defibrillator arrival times, decreasing patient waiting time for defibrillation. This approach is particularly effective during peak hours, when a higher proportion of OHCAs can be addressed." We were encouraged to see that even low response rates might yield meaningful time savings, and that the model appeared effective during off-peak hours despite reduced availability."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Can tomorrow's doctors learn with AI without losing their critical thinking? A NEJM review offers DEFT-AI and new collaboration models to help educators harness AI while protecting clinical skills. Review: Educational Strategies for Clinical Supervision of Artificial Intelligence Use. In a recent review published in The New England Journal of Medicine, researchers elucidate the challenges of supervising early-career medical learners who use powerful large language models (LLMs) as education aids. The review proposes a structured educational framework called "diagnosis, evidence, feedback, teaching, and recommendation for AI engagement (DEFT-AI)" to counter these potential AI demerits by scaffolding critical thinking. The review also introduces the "cyborg" and "centaur" models of human-AI collaboration, urging clinicians to adopt an adaptive practice where they learn to engage critically with AI-generated outputs rather than unquestioningly trusting them. Recognize the "leap of faith": The paper defines AI interactions as moments where clinicians receive outputs they cannot fully retrace, prompting a critical pause to assess trustworthiness before acting. Large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini are increasingly being used in medical learning, raising both opportunities and risks for clinical reasoning. A growing body of literature suggests that AI tools are fundamentally reshaping medical learning and practice. However, integrating AI into clinical practice presents unprecedented opportunities and significant risks for medical education. This can be extremely dangerous for inexperienced medical trainees. Medical educators thus face a novel and urgent challenge – guiding and supervising trainees who might be more proficient at leveraging AI than the educators themselves, creating an 'inversion of expertise' where teachers become learners too. The present review highlights three specific hurdles ("deskilling," "never-skilling," and "mis-skilling") that must be overcome before AI can cement its role in ensuring a safer and healthier future. Model co-management of uncertainty: Educators should openly acknowledge their own AI learning curve alongside trainees, turning discomfort into shared inquiry and explicit teaching moments. It collates and synthesizes the outcomes of more than 70 prior publications across existing educational theory, cognitive science, and emerging research on human-AI interaction and uses these insights to develop novel conceptual frameworks for the clinical supervision of AI: Diagnosis, evidence, feedback, teaching (DEFT), and recommendation for AI engagement (DEFT-AI) – An adapted framework for promoting critical thinking during educational conversations around AI use. Cyborg vs. Centaur Models: A new typology to describe two distinct modalities of human-AI collaboration. These models are designed to help educators and learners adapt their use of AI to the specific clinical task and associated risk. The review identifies and addresses several cognitive traps imposed on medical education by today's AI age. "Cognitive offloading", the process of over-relying on AI for complex tasks like clinical reasoning, is highlighted for its link to "automation bias", subsequent over-reliance on the AI's output, and a failure to catch its mistakes. Alarmingly, cognitive offloading and automation bias are not just theoretical concerns. Another study reported a significant negative correlation between the frequent use of AI tools and critical thinking abilities, mediated by increased offloading, and this effect was especially pronounced among younger participants. ", and "How did the AI's suggestion influence or change your diagnostic approach?" Educators are also encouraged to teach evidence-based appraisal of AI outputs using Sackett's framework (ask, acquire, appraise, apply, assess) and effective prompt engineering techniques, such as chain-of-thought reasoning. For example, institutional scorecards or model leaderboards may be used to judge tools, while evidence-based medicine appraisal steps should be applied to each individual output. In centaur mode, tasks are strategically divided so that the clinician delegates low-risk, well-defined tasks (such as summarizing data or drafting communications) to the AI, while retaining complete control over high-stakes clinical judgment and decision-making. This mode is recommended when addressing complex or uncertain cases. This mode is efficient for low-risk, routine tasks but carries a higher risk of automation bias if not used with ongoing reflective oversight and justification. The review also warns that performance heterogeneity and bias in LLMs can exacerbate health inequities. AI systems may underperform for certain populations, and uncritical adoption could widen disparities rather than close them. It highlights that medical education must proactively address the risks of deskilling, never-skilling, and mis-skilling by fundamentally changing how clinical reasoning is taught, particularly against the backdrop of AI. Critical thinking remains foundational for "adaptive practice" – the ability to shift between efficient routines and innovative problem-solving when faced with the unpredictability of AI. In summary, this review demonstrates that the ultimate goal is not to create doctors who are dependent on AI, but to cultivate clinicians who can skilfully and safely leverage it as a powerful tool to augment, but not replace, their own expertise through a "verify and trust" paradigm.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers have reported results from the first-ever clinical trial of a new class of targeted therapy in pet cats with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)-a cancer which is notoriously deadly and difficult to treat. Publishing in the Cell Press journal Cancer Cell on August 28, the study found that 35% of the cats who received treatment had their disease controlled with minimal side effects-and the drug will likely be effective for humans with HNSCC as well. There are two major findings from this study. Also, it demonstrated that pets with cancer can be a good representation of human disease and that clinical trials in pets may yield more reliable results than tests in mouse models." This drug, which was initially conceptualized to treat human head and neck cancers, is the first to target the transcription factor STAT3. STAT3 is present in a range of both solid and liquid tumors, including a majority of HNSCC cases. The idea to test the HNSCC drug on pet cats came from a discussion first author Jennifer Grandis had with her sister, a veterinarian. Grandis learned that oral cancers like HNSCC in pet cats are extremely difficult to treat and that most animals die within 2 to 3 months of diagnosis. One cat who benefited from the trial was a 9-year-old black domestic shorthair named Jak. "It was just a gut punch," says his owner, Tina Thomas. During that time his symptoms-mainly, a watery eye-greatly improved. He ultimately lived more than 8 months after his diagnosis. He was worth every bit of the effort." Of the 20 cats that were enrolled, 7 of them exhibited either a partial response or stable disease during the study period. When the investigators looked at tumors and blood samples from the cats who underwent treatment, they saw that the compound was working in two ways: It not only blocked the activity of STAT3 but it also raised levels of PD-1, a protein associated with an immune response to cancer. "This study is a great example of how we can think more carefully about spending our very limited resources on studies in lab mice that are not even the best models of human cancers," Grandis says. "By partnering with veterinary oncologists and doing clinical trials in companion animals, we can learn an enormous amount about how these drugs work while also helping people's pets. The researchers say that conducting clinical trials in pets can be a much better model of how drugs will work in humans compared with lab mice. They are currently working with a small biotech company to advance the new compound in clinical trials for both pets and humans. "These animals breathe the same air that we breathe and are exposed to all the things we're exposed to," says Johnson. "Their tumors are much more heterogeneous, which makes them a better mimic of human disease."
