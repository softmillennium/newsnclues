While the Cambrian Explosion kickstarted complex life in a major way some 530 million years, the true timeline of life on Earth is much longer. But a study from an international team of scientists pushes that timeline back even further to some 4.2 billion years ago, while also discovering some fascinating details about what life for LUCA might've been like. First, the team compared genes in living species and counted the mutations that have occurred since sharing a common ancestor with LUCA. “We have to use complex evolutionary models to reconcile the evolutionary history of genes with the genealogy of species.” Not satisfied with just learning its age, the team took things a step further and retraced the physiological characteristics of living species to understand what LUCA must've been like 4.2 billion years ago—and the results gave some surprising answers. The scientists estimate that while LUCA was a simple prokaryote, it likely had an immune system, meaning it was already fighting off primordial viruses. “It's clear that LUCA was exploiting and changing its environment, but it is unlikely to have lived alone,” University of Exeter's Tim Lenton, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. “Its waste would have been food for other microbes, like methanogens, that would have helped to create a recycling ecosystem.” While LUCA is the oldest common ancestor we know of, scientists still don't understand how life evolved from its very origins to the early communities of which LUCA is a part. Further studies will need to dive deeper into this primordial history and uncover exactly how you, me, and every other living thing, came to be.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For people with macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel), an orphan retinal disorder that gradually destroys central vision, there have long been no approved treatment options. But now, a new study sponsored by Neurotech Pharmaceuticals and spearheaded by investigators at Scripps Research and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) offers compelling evidence that vision loss can be slowed with a neuroprotective surgical implant. "This is a step toward redefining how we think about vision loss," says one of the corresponding authors, Professor Martin Friedlander of Scripps Research. Published in in NEJM Evidence, the study reports results from two phase 3 clinical trials evaluating ENCELTO (revakinagene taroretcel-lwey), a surgically implanted device that continuously releases a therapeutic protein to preserve vision. Conducted across 47 sites internationally, the randomized trials enrolled 228 participants with MacTel, following their progress over a 24-month period. The trials followed identical designs but enrolled participants at different times and locations. While both trials showed that ENCELTO slowed the loss of light-sensing retinal cells, the effect was stronger in one trial, likely due to variations in disease severity and other factors among participants. "It confirms that neuroprotection can be a powerful strategy to preserve vision in degenerative retinal conditions." Friedlander, who's also president of the Lowy Medical Research Institute, has spent nearly two decades studying MacTel and helped lay the biological foundation for ENCELTO. The device delivers ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a naturally occurring protein known to protect retinal neurons. In addition to changes in retinal cells, the study evaluated several measures of visual function: how well the eye can actually see and perform everyday vision-related tasks. These included microperimetry (a sensitive test of retinal light response) and reading speed. Results from microperimetry showed statistically significant slowing of visual function loss, particularly in the trial where ENCELTO provided greater preservation of photoreceptor cells. However, reading speed and retinal sensitivity outcomes were more mixed, with one trial showing improvement and the other showing no significant difference from the control group. "These differences highlight just how complex it is to measure functional vision loss in a slow-progressing disease like MacTel," points out Friedlander. "If you look at certain functional outcomes from just one of the trials, they're not statistically significant. But when you pool data from both trials -- which were conducted the same way -- then you see statistically significant results, so we'll continue to investigate what's driving that." Furthermore, ENCELTO was effective regardless of the participant's baseline vision or disease stage, suggesting that earlier intervention may help preserve more functional vision as MacTel progresses. Next, Friedlander and his team will assess whether benefits continue or even improve beyond 24 months. There are also plans to explore why some individuals experienced greater gains than others, which may help identify patient subgroups that are most likely to benefit. Moreover, because ENCELTO delivers sustained, targeted doses of therapeutic proteins directly to the retina, it represents a versatile platform technology. This same approach could potentially be adapted to treat a wide range of neurovascular degenerative diseases beyond MacTel, including other blinding conditions where protecting vulnerable nerve cells is key.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Why was it gravitationally kicked out of its own star system? Something like Oumuamua, 21/Borisov and now 3I/ATLAS (the latest space rock to go viral) doesn't exactly appear like the starships of science fiction. But, to be fair, we Earthlings really have no idea what spacecraft from other intelligent civilizations (if they do exist) would actually look like. Controversial astrophysicist Avi Loeb from Harvard University—founding director of the Black Hole Initiative and increasingly known for frequently crying “alien”—continues to be curious about what is really out there. Maybe aliens are eluding us by launching probes or ships that only appear to be chunks of rocky debris. Along with colleagues Adam Hibberd and Adam Crowl (both from the Initiative for Interstellar Studies in London), Loeb came up with a thought experiment that tested the idea of 3I/ATLAS being a piece of extraterrestrial technology. He was inspired by the “dark forest hypothesis,” which suggests that aliens are trying to hide from each other because space is crawling with hostile civilizations. While Loeb stresses that this thinking is only hypothetical, there are some especially strange aspects of 3I/ATLAS and its journey that—while they most likely don't mean the object itself is flown by aliens—could give away an actual starship if intelligent beings ever do decide to visit. Even though Loeb is aware that the debate about this possibility is “mired in bitter controversy,” as he said in a study recently submitted to Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society, the “hypothesis is an interesting exercise in its own right, and is fun to pursue, irrespective of its likely validity.” It could be that there are beings out there who are just trekking from star to star, possibly seeking out a new home or just enjoying the scenery, without intending to deploy any, say, missiles that could vaporize an entire planet. Whether or not our defensive capabilities are enough to take on a hostile civilization is unknown, because we are unaware of what kind of technology they might threaten us with. Its orbit is retrograde (meaning it travels in the opposite direction that objects in our Solar System orbit the Sun), but its orbital plane (the imaginary flat plane its orbit creates) is within only five degrees off of Earth's. That is an extraordinarily unlikely coincidence which, as Loeb estimates, has only a  2% chance of occurring. The object is thought to be an asteroid or comet, but it is oddly bright for an asteroid of its size (20 km, or about 12.4 miles, wide). If an asteroid is ruled out, then it might be a comet, but Loeb points out that observations from the MUSE spectroscopic instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope showed no spectral signs of the gas usually resealed by comets. It is incredibly dusty, however, which very well could have obscured some of its features. If a starship were to follow 3I/ATLAS's trajectory and behavior, Loeb estimates that it wouldn't need much effort from (hypothetical) velocity thrusts to launch missiles or some other kind of alien ammunition at Venus, Mars, or Jupiter. At least we haven't seen anything peculiar raining from the sky yet, except a few meteorite fragments. “By far, the most likely outcome will be that 3I/ATLAS is a completely natural interstellar object, probably a comet, and we await the astronomical data to support this likely origin,” said Loeb. “Nevertheless, when viewed from an open-minded and unprejudiced perspective, our paper includes many compelling insights that could be applied to tens of interstellar objects that are expected to be detected over the next decade.” Her work has appeared in Popular Mechanics, Ars Technica, SYFY WIRE, Space.com, Live Science, Den of Geek, Forbidden Futures and Collective Tales.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For 500 years, classrooms have relied on a distorted view that minimizes the continent's scale. Hanging in classrooms and government buildings the world over, the 16th-century-drawn map from Flemish cartographer Geradus Mercator—originally created for navigational purposes—has become so accepted that many people don't know about the give-and-take process the cartographer went through to represent a globe onto flat paper. To get evenly distributed longitudinal and latitudinal lines, Mercator enlarged land areas near the poles and shrunk spots near the equator. “It might seem to be just a map, but in reality, it is not,” Selma Malika Haddadi, AU Commission deputy chair, told Reuters. “Africa is misrepresented on the world's maps, and it's not just a matter of geography,” according to a Correct the Map statement. The Mercator projection has served as a global baseline for centuries. As Equal Earth Map noted on its website, Greenland appears bigger than Africa on the Mercator projection, but Africa is actually 14 times larger than the island. Accurate map projections are vital not only for education and geography but also for fostering a deeper understanding of Africa's role in the global community.” As National Geographic's Education department wrote on its website: “There are three basic kinds of projections: planar, conical, and cylindrical. The groups Africa No Filter and Speak Up Africa collectives both told Reuters that the use of the Mercator is misinformation that impacts Africans' identity and pride. “We're actively working on promoting a curriculum where the Equal Earth projection will be the main standard across all [African] classrooms,” said Fara Ndiaye, co-founder of Speak Up Africa. Moky Makura, executive director of Africa No Filter dubbed the Mercator projection the “world's longest misinformation and disinformation campaign.” Tim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chemists at UCL have shown how two of biology's most fundamental ingredients, RNA (ribonucleic acid) and amino acids, could have spontaneously joined together at the origin of life four billion years ago. But proteins cannot replicate or produce themselves -- they require instructions. These instructions are provided by RNA, a close chemical cousin of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). Senior author Professor Matthew Powner, based at UCL's Department of Chemistry, said: "Life relies on the ability to synthesize proteins -- they are life's key functional molecules. "Our study is a big step towards this goal, showing how RNA might have first come to control protein synthesis. "Life today uses an immensely complex molecular machine, the ribosome, to synthesize proteins. The ribosome then, like a factory assembly line, reads this RNA and links together amino acids, one by one, to create a protein. "We have achieved the first part of that complex process, using very simple chemistry in water at neutral pH to link amino acids to RNA. For the new study, the researchers took inspiration from biology, using a gentler method to convert life's amino acids into a reactive form. In order to form these thioesters, the amino acids react with a sulfur-bearing compound called pantetheine. Last year, the same team published a paper demonstrating pantetheine can be synthesized under early Earth-like conditions, suggesting it was likely to play a role in starting life. Lead author Dr Jyoti Singh, from UCL Chemistry, said: "Imagine the day that chemists might take simple, small molecules, consisting of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms, and from these LEGO pieces form molecules capable of self-replication. This would be a monumental step towards solving the question of life's origin. "Our study brings us closer to that goal by demonstrating how two primordial chemical LEGO pieces (activated amino acids and RNA) could have built peptides**, short chains of amino acids that are essential to life. This discovery could potentially link metabolism, the genetic code and protein building." The reactions are too small to see with a visible-light microscope and were tracked using a range of techniques that are used to probe the structure of molecules, including several types of magnetic resonance imaging (which shows how the atoms are arranged) and mass spectrometry (which shows the size of molecules). *The Nobel laureate Christian de Duve proposed that life began with a "thioester world" -- a metabolism-first theory that envisages life was started by chemical reactions powered by the energy in thioesters. ** Peptides typically consist of two to 50 amino acids, while proteins are larger, often containing hundreds or even thousands of amino acids, and are folded into a 3D shape.

A new study led by investigators from Mass General Brigham, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard suggests that a Mediterranean-style diet may help reduce dementia risk. The study, published in Nature Medicine, found that people at the highest genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease benefited more from following a Mediterranean-style diet, showing a greater reduction in dementia risk compared to those at lower genetic risk. "One reason we wanted to study the Mediterranean diet is because it is the only dietary pattern that has been causally linked to cognitive benefits in a randomized trial," said study first author Yuxi Liu, PhD, a research fellow in the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system, and a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Chan School and Broad. "We wanted to see whether this benefit might be different in people with varying genetic backgrounds, and to examine the role of blood metabolites, the small molecules that reflect how the body processes food and carries out normal functions." These are among the most common causes of cognitive decline in older adults. To explore how the Mediterranean diet may reduce dementia risk and influence blood metabolites linked to cognitive health, the team analyzed data from 4,215 women in the Nurses' Health Study, following participants from 1989 to 2023 (average age 57 at baseline). Researchers evaluated long-term dietary patterns using food frequency questionnaires and examined participants' blood samples for a broad range of metabolites. Genetic data were used to assess each participant's inherited risk for Alzheimer's disease. Participants were then followed over time for new cases of dementia. A subset of 1,037 women underwent regular telephone-based cognitive testing. "These findings suggest that dietary strategies, specifically the Mediterranean diet, could help reduce the risk of cognitive decline and stave off dementia by broadly influencing key metabolic pathways," Liu said. "This recommendation applies broadly, but it may be even more important for individuals at a higher genetic risk, such as those carrying two copies of the APOE4 genetic variant." In addition, although the study reveals important associations, genetics and metabolomics are not yet part of most clinical risk prediction models for Alzheimer's disease. More work is needed to translate these findings into routine medical practice. "In future research, we hope to explore whether targeting specific metabolites through diet or other interventions could provide a more personalized approach to reducing dementia risk," Liu said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For decades, researchers around the world have searched for alternatives to iridium, an extremely rare, incredibly expensive metal used in the production of clean hydrogen fuels. Invented and developed at Northwestern University, that tool is called a megalibrary. The world's first nanomaterial "data factory," each megalibrary contains millions of uniquely designed nanoparticles on one tiny chip. In collaboration with researchers from the Toyota Research Institute (TRI), the team used this technology to discover commercially relevant catalysts for hydrogen production. Then, they scaled up the material and demonstrated it could work within a device -- all in record time. With a megalibrary, scientists rapidly screened vast combinations of four abundant, inexpensive metals -- each known for its catalytic performance -- to find a new material with performance comparable to iridium. This discovery doesn't just make affordable green hydrogen a possibility; it also proves the effectiveness of the new megalibrary approach, which could completely change how researchers find new materials for any number of applications. "We've unleashed arguably the world's most powerful synthesis tool, which allows one to search the enormous number of combinations available to chemists and materials scientists to find materials that matter," said Northwestern's Chad A. Mirkin, the study's senior author and primary inventor of the megalibrary platform. "In this particular project, we have channeled that capability toward a major problem facing the energy sector. As the world moves away from fossil fuels and toward decarbonization, affordable green hydrogen has emerged as a critical piece of the puzzle. OER is most effective when scientists use iridium-based catalysts, which have significant disadvantages. Iridium is rare, expensive and often obtained as a byproduct from platinum mining. More valuable than gold, iridium costs nearly $5,000 per ounce. "There's not enough iridium in the world to meet all of our projected needs," Sargent said. "As we think about splitting water to generate alternative forms of energy, there's not enough iridium from a purely supply standpoint." Mirkin, who introduced the megalibraries in 2016, decided with Sargent that finding new candidates to replace iridium was a perfect application for his revolutionary tool. While materials discovery is traditionally a slow and daunting task filled with trial and error, megalibraries enable scientists to pinpoint optimal compositions at breakneck speeds. Each dot contains an intentionally designed mix of metal salts. When heated, the metal salts are reduced to form single nanoparticles, each with a precise composition and size. In the new study, the chip contained 156 million particles, each made from different combinations of ruthenium, cobalt, manganese and chromium. A robotic scanner then assessed how well the most promising particles could perform an OER. Eventually, one composition stood out:a precise combination of all four metals (Ru52Co33Mn9Cr6 oxide). "Our catalyst actually has a little higher activity than iridium and excellent stability," Mirkin said. The ability to screen particles for their ultimate performance is a major new innovation. "For the first time, we were not only able to rapidly screen catalysts, but we saw the best ones performing well in a scaled-up setting," said Joseph Montoya, a senior staff research scientist at TRI and study co-author. In long-term tests, the new catalyst operated for more than 1,000 hours with high efficiency and excellent stability in a harsh acidic environment. It is also dramatically cheaper than iridium -- about one-sixteenth of the cost. "There's lots of work to do to make this commercially viable, but it's very exciting that we can identify promising catalysts so quickly -- not only at the lab scale but for devices," Montoya said. Northwestern, TRI and Mattiq, a Northwestern spinout company, have already developed machine learning algorithms to sift through the megalibraries at record speeds. With AI, the approach could scale beyond catalysts to revolutionize materials discovery for virtually any technology, such as batteries, biomedical devices and advanced optical components. It's time to truly find the best materials for every need -- without compromise." This material is based on research sponsored by the Air Force under agreement number FA8650-21-2-5028.
