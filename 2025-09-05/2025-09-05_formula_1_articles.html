                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2025 Italian GP FP2: Onboard as Norris sets the fastest lap of second practice at Monza It was an early end to Friday practice for Kimi Antonelli at his home Grand Prix in Italy with a spin into the gravel trap. Kimi Antonelli has admitted that he simply “pushed a bit too hard” too early during second practice for the Italian Grand Prix, with a spin ending his session after just 10 minutes of running. Talking through the moment, which followed a similar off during FP1 at Zandvoort last time out, Antonelli said: “I mean, I just pushed a bit too hard for the grip in the moment. “My confidence is still high, just obviously tomorrow I will have to do a bit of a different programme [in FP3]. As for Saturday's action and what might be possible when it comes to Qualifying, Antonelli is hoping the “amazing” home atmosphere can spur him on to a strong result in what looks set to be another ultra-close session. “I think Qualifying is going to be very tight, as always,” he said. “But as I said, the pace felt pretty good today. “It was a tricky day to be honest,” Russell said afterwards. “I think always when you come to Monza, you're back on that low downforce [package], so the car's sort of floating around and the rear's pretty loose. It didn't feel spectacular out there for us today. “Obviously it's very close on the leaderboard; I think I was P10 but only three-tenths off – usually three-tenths would be just behind the McLarens.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>'It was tough' - Lawson admits Racing Bulls 'missed a little bit' in Friday practice Dunne ‘learned a lot' in FP1 outing for McLaren at Monza Lando Norris and McLaren were the combination to beat as practice continued at Monza on Friday afternoon. After Lewis Hamilton led a Ferrari 1-2 in first practice, to the delight of the passionate Tifosi packing Monza's grandstands and grass banks, drivers and teams returned to the track for another hour of running on Friday afternoon – FP2 getting under way at 1700 local time. All 20 cars were quick to emerge from their garages when the green light switched on at the end of the pit lane, with Oscar Piastri reclaiming his McLaren from F2 racer Alex Dunne and Franco Colapinto taking his Alpine back from reserve Paul Aron following their FP1 outings. Despite a cracked mirror, Piastri posted the fastest time of the opening minutes with a 1m 21.212s, before team mate Norris (who had coincidentally lost one of his mirrors altogether) lowered the benchmark to a 1m 21.012s – both drivers initially running medium tyres. A brief stoppage followed as marshals cleared Antonelli's car, allowing McLaren to carry out some mirror repairs on Piastri and Norris' cars, with 45 minutes still remaining on the FP2 clock when Race Control declared that the circuit was clear once more. Elsewhere, Piastri and Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto were shown clattering the kerbs at the exit of Lesmo 2, while Albon just about held onto his Williams after a dramatic mid-corner snap through Lesmo 1 – the latter two asking for checks to be carried out on their floors. Albon underlined Williams' strong start to the weekend in seventh, despite his earlier dramas, ahead of Nico Hulkenberg's Sauber, Yuki Tsunoda's Red Bull and George Russell's Mercedes, which returned to the track for the start of FP2 after his early-day hydraulic issues. Isack Hadjar was the quickest Racing Bulls driver in 11th, from Bortoleto (also noted by the stewards for an apparent yellow flag breach) and the Aston Martin and Haas machines of Lance Stroll, Oliver Bearman, Fernando Alonso and Esteban Ocon.</p>

TECH TALK – The best Monza mods in the quest for speed 

2025 Italian GP FP2: Onboard as Norris sets the fastest lap of second practice at Monza

While Ferrari has yet to win a race this season, the loyal Tifosi will be hoping drivers Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton can use the positive energy around Monza to come out on top

Monza's Temple of Speed, nestled in the dense woodland of a royal park, is the home of Italian motorsport and a place where Ferrari's faithful – the Tifosi – come to pay homage to the racing team whom they worship.

Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton knows what this place means to Italy, having made 18 Grand Prix appearances here, but he's about to experience it in a very different way at the 19th time of asking.

This time, he'll be dressed in red, Ferrari red, and he will be one of two drivers who Italy will want to win. The Briton knows a little of what it feels like already, having received the adoration of the Ferrari fans at Imola earlier this year for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, but Monza is another level.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>'It was tough' - Lawson admits Racing Bulls 'missed a little bit' in Friday practice Lewis Hamilton is preparing for his first race weekend at the historic Monza circuit as a Ferrari driver. Lewis Hamilton is embracing the “good energy” from Ferrari's passionate fans as he aims to give them something to cheer about at the Italian Grand Prix – despite heading into it with a grid penalty. Indeed, Hamilton and team mate Charles Leclerc were greeted by a huge crowd of Tifosi at a Ferrari gathering in Milan on Wednesday, underlining the incredible support both drivers and the team will have behind them this weekend. “It was such a unique experience,” said Hamilton during Thursday's driver press conference. “Already from yesterday morning, getting to [the Ferrari factory in] Maranello, when you walk in and see the Ferrari logo… I still have to pinch myself. I've never seen fans outside the factory before, in any of my years. There's clearly just so much love for this brand, and what it means to people. “To be in Milan, really in the heart of it all, seeing the fans and just how passionate they were, it was intense, but very, very positive. As for what Ferrari might be able to achieve at Monza, Hamilton expressed cautious optimism following the “loads of positives” he felt at the Dutch Grand Prix last time out. “I think Ferrari have generally gone pretty well [here] in the past years. “I'm just really keen to see how the car works here. “Then, on top of that, to be set back five places is not great when you're going into your first Monza [race] with Ferrari, but it gives me more to fight for and I'm very motivated to make up those places.”</p>
