Hugo Hernandez-Mendez, 35, of Bowie, Maryland, was arrested Thursday in the killing of Dacara Thompson, Prince George's County Police Department said. Hernandez-Mendez is an illegal immigrant and had a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer issued on Thursday, according to WJLA-TV. Prince George's County Police Department told Fox News Digital that the department was not releasing the immigration status of Hernandez-Mendez. ICE did not immediately respond when Fox News Digital reached out. Hugo Hernandez-Mendez, 35, was charged with first- and second-degree murder in Thompson's death. The news outlet also reported that U.S. Park Police had arrested Hernandez-Mendez for a DWI in April, but that he was subsequently released pending a court appearance. Fox News Digital reached out to the Park Police but did not immediately hear back. On Sunday, her body was discovered dumped in a grassy area near Route 50 in Anne Arundel County. Police said they believe she was murdered. Investigators combed through security footage that showed Thompson had approached a black sport utility vehicle (SUV) in the early hours of Aug. 23. The driver then drove to a home in Bowie. Detectives executed a search warrant on the home Thursday and uncovered evidence that suggested Thompson had been killed in the bedroom of the home, police said. Police said he also has access to the black SUV that Thompson was seen entering. Hernandez-Mendez was charged with first- and second-degree murder in Thompson's death. Wes Moore released a statement on the death investigation on Friday, calling Thompson a "bright light" who was "committed to public service." "Our entire state mourns the horrible loss of Da'Cara Thompson, who was taken from us by an act of senseless violence," the governor said in the statement, vowing to use "every tool at our disposal" to hold those responsible for her death accountable. The 19-year-old's cause of death has yet to be determined, though police said it may be ruled a homicide based on the evidence collected. As the investigation remains active, police said detectives are working to determine whether Hernandez-Mendez and Thompson knew each other before the day she went missing. Hernandez-Mendez is currently being held without bond by the Maryland Department of Corrections. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Labor market deterioration: Just 22,000 jobs were added in August, dramatically lower than economists' expectations for 76,500 new roles. • Negative job growth: For the first time in nearly four years, the economy lost jobs, with a decline of 13,000 positions in June. Our live coverage of the August jobs report has ended. The US dollar broadly weakened on Friday after a softer-than-expected jobs report stoked concerns about a labor market slowdown. The dollar index, which measures the dollar's strength against six major foreign currencies, dropped 0.7% and hit its lowest level in over a month. Fed rate cuts can lower Treasury yields, making the bonds relatively less appealing for global investors and leading to less demand for dollars. “Another soft nonfarm payrolls report has put the dollar on the back foot again,” Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. Although the dollar fell, Goltermann said he expects it to rebound because US economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, is still relatively robust, and expectations for lower rates in other major economies could limit the dollar's decline. The dollar index is down almost 10% this year. The weaker dollar has also been a boon for gold. The yellow metal is priced in dollars, so a weaker dollar makes it relatively cheaper for global investors, boosting demand. Gold prices on Friday rose roughly 1.4% and hit an all-time high. Younger Americans seeking work are facing trouble getting hired in today's job market. The findings underscore how there are fewer opportunities for younger workers. The jobless rate is slightly higher, at 10.8%, for high school graduates aged 20 to 24 without college experience. Even recent college graduates are having serious trouble landing a job these days. “The ‘low hiring, low firing' environment has disproportionately hit the younger cohort of new college grads,” Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told CNN. “We're now likely seeing the impact of AI on this cohort, especially as companies start turning to technology to save on costs.” Antoni, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics after he fired the prior BLS commissioner following last month's dismal jobs report, recently floated temporarily suspending monthly job reports. Instead, Antoni, who does not have any official sway at the BLS while awaiting Senate confirmation, advocated for publishing quarterly job reports until fixes are implemented to ensure the government-produced data is more accurate. Without a monthly report, Federal Reserve officials, for instance, would likely have a much harder time deciding where interest rates should be. But, in reality, hiring rates could be much lower and could have been somewhat higher, had they cut sooner. It would also mean a lack of data to support one half of its dual mandate (price stability and full employment), which, in turn, would send shockwaves through financial markets and thoroughly disrupt businesses' abilities to plan. However, Antoni, if confirmed, and White House officials, said that monthly job reports would continue getting published. Friday's job report was a signal the economy is weakening, investors say, spurring a rally in Treasury bonds and gold while stocks and the dollar fell. Bank of America revised its expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. The bank now expects a quarter-point cut in September and December, after previously forecasting zero cuts this year. “The August jobs report is likely to amplify the Fed's concerns about labor market weakness,” Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at Bank of America, said in a note. “The shift in our view is motivated by both the softer labor data and [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell's reaction function, as stated at Jackson Hole.” “The underlying details within the report showed broad-based weakness, with a continued lack of breadth in industries seeing positive payroll gains,” Guha said. Thomas Simons, chief US economist at Jefferies, said the report confirms his call for quarter-point cuts in September, October and December. At investment firm BTIG, Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician, said a September rate cut is “locked,” but cautioned against overoptimism from investors who are eager for rate cuts. “When you are rooting for weaker data to support rate cuts, it's a fine line and sometimes it's a function of ‘careful what you wish for,'” Krinsky said. The Dow was down 290 points, or 0.64%, as of 12:35 p.m. “The Current Population Survey, which underlies the unemployment rate, is not designed to take up sudden changes in population, including changes to immigration policy,” Daniel Zhao, chief economist at employment website Glassdoor, told CNN in an interview Friday. Because of how the jobs report is structured, it's impossible to attribute the employment gains to any particular demographic. However, on Friday, White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett appeared to blame the weak job gains changing immigration dynamics. The foreign-born labor force has declined somewhat after peaking earlier this year, BLS data shows. However, the drop-off can be attributed to people refusing to answer surveys or not indicating their nativity status, economists note. The employment-to-population ratio for foreign-born workers was 63.5% in August, up slightly from July. For native-born workers, that ratio dipped to 58.8% from 59.1. Economists were already expecting an unimpressive set of data for the August jobs report. Stocks initially rose after the weaker-than-expected jobs report, as traders ramped up bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this fall. This reaction to the downside is more logical than the initial cheer, Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, told CNN. No, that's bad news for the economy and market.” The Dow was down 400 points, or 0.88%, as of 11:10 a.m. US stocks moved into the red Friday morning, with the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all erasing earlier gains. While stocks had opened higher, confidence wavered as investors digested the prospect of a weakening economy and also grappled with news from the crucial tech sector. Shares of the chipmaker were under pressure after the Financial Times reported that OpenAI is set to partner with Broadcom (AVGO) to produce its own artificial intelligence chips. But in August, the jobless rate moved higher — in part because more people re-entered the labor force looking for work, BLS data showed. The labor force, which shrank for three months in a row, increased by 436,000 people in August, BLS' latest household survey data shows. The labor force participation rate moved higher as well, ticking up to 62.3% from 62.2%. President Donald Trump is on a mission to make American manufacturing jobs great again by deploying historically high tariffs on imports. That effort is off to a slow start, at best, and at worst is backfiring by causing job loss. US manufacturers shed another 12,000 jobs in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That marks the fourth consecutive month of job loss for US manufacturers. The industry has slashed 42,000 jobs since April, when Trump shocked investors with massive tariffs that he later paused and dialed back. While it's far too early to deliver a verdict on Trump's use of tariffs to reshore manufacturing jobs, economists say the chaotic nature of trade policy to date is undermining his efforts. “What we're seeing is a sector paralyzed by uncertainty,” Matthew Martin, senior US economist at Oxford Economics, told CNN on Friday. Faced with immense uncertainty on where tariffs will settle, some manufacturers are laying off workers. Others are struggling from higher costs caused by Trump tariffs on key inputs including steel, aluminum and copper. Surveys of manufacturers reveal frustration over the volatile trade policy. “Tariff Bingo is tough,” one furniture manufacturer told the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas in a survey released last week. “We are probably going out of business within 90 days.” “There is absolutely no activity in the transportation equipment industry. Appearing to react to Friday's underwhelming jobs report, President Donald Trump took a pointed swipe at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for keeping interest rates high. “Jerome ‘Too Late' Powell should have lowered rates long ago. August's job report also included a downward revision to June, which showed the US economy lost 13,000 jobs that month. It's the first negative employment month since December 2020, and brings to an end what was the second-longest period of employment expansion on record. The US economy is in a hiring slump, but Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Friday signaled an optimistic note on America's job market. “A year from today, you're going to see employment numbers you'd never imagine,” Lutnick told CNBC Friday just before the jobs report was released. Lutnick said tariffs will incentivize manufacturing job growth (the industry has lost jobs for four straight months), and the administration will train people to take on new jobs that tariffs will create in the United States. “What it's going to do is it's going to take the 6.9 million Americans who are capable of working who are sitting on the sidelines now because they just haven't had the jobs they were looking for, they're going to come into the workplace,” Lutnick said. “We're going to train 5 million Americans for these jobs.” The Fed has kept rates high because it feared tariffs could boost prices, and job growth had until recently remained robust. “We're going to see employment numbers that you've never imagined if only, and what would help it, is if finally, [Federal Reserve Chair] Jerome Powell does his job and lowers rates,” Lutnick said. “It is outrageous that the Fed keeps its rates this high. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett conceded Friday the jobs numbers were a “bit of a disappointment” but said he expects that later revisions will show more jobs were added. “There was a Goldman Sachs study that came out yesterday that showed that — because the [Bureau of Labor Statistics] hasn't really done a good job on its seasonal adjustment in August — that they tend to revise this number up by almost 70,000 jobs when they give you a revised number a month later.” “It's a little bit of a disappointing job number, but I pretty much expect it's going to revise up,” Hassett added. When the BLS issued a disappointing jobs report for July, including sharp revisions for May and June, Trump fired Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, saying without evidence that the numbers were “RIGGED.” Hassett said officials are looking at the “capital spending boom” and high industrial production as indicators that “the economy is sound and inflation is low.” Job growth and opportunities are cooling for US workers. While the deceleration can be partly attributed to “base effects” (year-over-year comparisons), they're also a symbol of a broader shift occurring in the labor market, noted economist Lydia Boussour. “Employers' continued focus on wage containment amid a slowing economy may lead to a further deceleration in wage growth toward 3.5% by the fall,” Boussour, EY-Parthenon senior economist, wrote in a note Friday to investors. And with inflation heating back up, workers' paychecks are not going as far as they recently did, according to the most recently available data. Through July, real (inflation-adjusted) average hourly wages were up 1.2%, BLS data shows. “Jerome Powell should be embarrassed by this report, because he has not done his job,” Chavez-DeRemer said on Fox Business. Pressed if she's even a little disappointed by the numbers, Chavez-DeRemer conceded slightly, but said the Trump administration is in a net positive with jobs numbers. “It's going to take some time, but again, when everybody is working for the American people and the American worker, and somebody chooses not to, and they're instrumental in those decisions that affect the market, that affect the wage growth, that affect all of those things, do your job,” Chavez-DeRemer added, referring to Powell. Because companies are reinvesting in the American workforce. Over the past year, through July, real (inflation-adjusted) average hourly earnings were up 1.2%. Through August, average hourly wage growth, not adjusted for inflation, was up 3.7%, a slowing from the 3.9% rate in July. US stocks opened higher on Friday after August jobs data came in softer than expected, boosting expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September to stimulate the economy. Investors are eager for rate cuts: The Dow rose 119 points, or 0.26%. Investors also recalibrated their expectations for the Fed's rate-cutting cycle and snapped up bonds to lock in current high rates. Bond prices and yields trade in opposite directions. The two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to Fed rate cut expectations, dropped sharply to 3.47%, its lowest level since 2022. The US dollar index sank 0.75% on signs of a slowdown and future rate cuts. Gold prices jumped 0.9% and hit a fresh record high. There were more industries that lost jobs last month than those that gained, according to the government's latest tally. That wide-ranging industry — encompassing roles such as accountants and engineers — has lost jobs throughout the year. There were eight other industries that lost jobs last month, such as government, which shrank by 16,000; and manufacturing, which shed 12,000 jobs. In contrast, there were only five sectors that gained jobs last month. With signs of America's job market continuing to weaken, investors are expecting the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates at each of its three meetings the rest of the year. After the Friday jobs report was released, the CME Group's FedWatch Tool showed an 87.8% probability that the Fed will reduce its benchmark rate by a quarter point at its September 16-17 meeting. The central bank has held steady since December. Investors now see a 70.5% probability of a quarter-point cut in October, according to the FedWatch Tool, up from 53.6% on Thursday. For the Fed's December meeting, investors see a 67.2% chance of another quarter-point cut, compared with 45.8% yesterday. Friday's jobs report painted a miserable picture of the labor market in practically every metric.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON (AP) — It's an ideological faction transforming the Republican Party in President Donald Trump's second term. Now firmly in power, its leaders gathered this week beneath a downtown Washington hotel to bask in their triumph — and to chart what comes next. “National conservatism is an idea whose time has arrived.” Members of Congress, Trump administration officials, donors and right-wing pundits gathered this week for the annual National Conservatism Conference — a gathering once seen as fringe, now asserting itself as the GOP's dominant ideological force. Schmitt, a first-term senator, followed a GOP donor's speech on “The Problem of Our Time: White Guilt” with a talk of his own titled “What is an American?” In it, Schmitt criticized some legal immigration, declared that “America doesn't belong to them — it belongs to us,” and insisted, “We can no longer apologize for who we are.” In July 2024, then-Sen. JD Vance used his Republican National Convention speech after accepting the vice presidential nomination to declare: “America is not just an idea. Its founder, Israeli political theorist Yoram Hazony, defines national conservatism as a political philosophy centered on the restoration and preservation of national and religious traditions — ideals he says are essential to a nation's long-term strength and cohesion. Vance has spoken at multiple National Conservatism Conferences and in 2021 credited Hazony as “quite influential to me.” His elevation to vice president — and the policy shifts that followed — signaled that the movement had fully arrived in power. High-profile speakers included Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, White House budget director Russell Vought, Trump border czar Tom Homan, and three U.S. senators. The speaker list also featured more controversial figures, such as John Eastman — an ex-Trump attorney central in efforts to overturn the 2020 election after Trump's loss to Democrat Joe Biden — and Calvin Robinson, a Michigan priest who lost his license after mimicking a straight-arm gesture interpreted by some as a Nazi salute. Many of the top speakers used their time to defend Trump administration policies and lash out at critics. Vought declared that the Government Accountability Office “shouldn't exist” after it said his latest effort to claw back funds already approved by Congress is illegal. On the broader push for the rollback of appropriated funds, or rescissions, he said, “If Congress has given us authority that is too broad, then we're going to use that authority aggressively to protect the American people.” Your legal relationship to the children you've begotten is weaker than it was a decade ago.” “Many Americans voted for President Trump in 2016 because he told them what they knew but needed to hear: America could be great again,” said Klingenstein. “Now, Trump must tell them something else they know but need to hear: America is no longer guilty of systemic racism, or most any racism for that matter.” But no one made a louder entrance than Missouri's junior senator, Schmitt. “At this point, it should be clear that the fact that something is sanctioned by our government does not mean it's good for our country. “That much is obvious with various forms of legal immigration today.” That heritage, he said, is one of pilgrims and settlers who repelled “wave after wave of Indian war band attacks.” He said “every great feat of the modern world bore American fingerprints,” calling those who built skyscrapers, split the atom, invented the airplane and walked on the moon. “America, in all its glory, is their gift to us, handed down across the generations. Though the ballroom was only half full, Schmitt's remarks quickly reverberated online, as his team pushed out clips across social media. In just over two years, he has built a close alliance with Trump, helping move key legislation through the Senate. Why would we be sorry?” Schmitt said in closing. “America is the proudest and most magnificent heritage ever known to man.”</p>

Jacksonville State University forensics scholar Joseph Scott Morgan discusses police probing a death at the Burning Man festival as a homicide on 'America Reports.' Vadim Kruglov, a 37-year-old Russian national who had been living in Washington state, was named as the victim found "lying in a pool of blood," according to the Pershing County Sheriff's Office. His death cast a grim shadow over the annual event held in Nevada's Black Rock Desert. Vadim Kruglov, a 37-year-old Russian national who had been living in Washington state, was named as the victim found "lying in a pool of blood," according to the Pershing County Sheriff's Office. "I'm proud of my son, now known worldwide," Igor Kruglov, speaking in Russian, said in the video. "He felt injustice deeply and fought for fairness always. I believe a similar situation occurred here. This world is often unfair, but as a peaceful man, I seek justice. I want those responsible to face consequences." Igor Kruglov also expressed gratitude to his son's friends for reaching out to him in the aftermath of the tragedy, noting, "Everyone's helping however they can." The Pershing County Sheriff's Office told Fox News Digital on Friday it had no new updates to share regarding the investigation. Burning Man organizers have issued their condolences, saying, "Our hearts go out to Vadim's family and friends, and we grieve the loss of a community member." Organizers also confirmed they were fully cooperating with law enforcement. "Burning Man Project is doing everything we can to assist the Sheriff's investigation so the perpetrator can be caught and brought to justice," the organization said. A fire burns during the Burning Man festival in Nevada on Aug. 30, 2025. This includes a coordinated donation to the Secret Witness program, which offers rewards for tips aiding the investigation. The annual event, which attracts tens of thousands of participants, known as "Burners," transforms the desert into a temporary city complete with large-scale art installations, themed camps and the iconic ceremonial burns. Authorities were alerted to the scene when an attendee flagged down an officer on Saturday evening, leading to the discovery of the victim, whom police described in a Monday news release as "obviously deceased." A person records during the annual Burning Man festival on Sept. 4, 2023. The area was immediately secured, and investigators have since interviewed several individuals who may have been nearby. The sheriff's office said earlier this week that it is continuing its investigation and seeking public assistance. They believe that witnesses from the community could hold vital clues. Police are asking anyone with information to call them at 775-273-2641 and reference case # 25-318. Support services are also reportedly available to participants who may be affected.

Fox News correspondent Garrett Tenney has the latest on the University of Kentucky student under arrest after a dead baby was found at her house on ‘America's Newsroom.' The University of Kentucky student-athlete accused of hiding her dead newborn inside a closet was described as a "serial bully," according to a former classmate. Laken Snelling, 21, was taken into custody on Sunday after officers with the Lexington Police Department responded to an unresponsive infant, according to officials. Police said Snelling was the infant's mother. The Fayette County Coroner's Office in Lexington, Kentucky, said in a statement that an autopsy on the male infant was inconclusive, adding extensive microscopic analysis is needed to determine how the infant died. Snelling was charged with tampering with physical evidence, concealing the birth of an infant and abuse of a corpse. University of Kentucky student Laken Snelling was arrested Aug. 31, 2025. Sydney Kite, who went to high school with Snelling, accused the athlete of bullying her friends and sister, according to the Daily Mail. My sister was one of them," Kite said. "While in high school, she tried to run over one of my closest friends with her Jeep. The bullying got so bad, my friend had to be pulled out of school and transferred to another because Laken had taken it so far." School officials confirmed Laken Snelling was a senior at the University of Kentucky. Snelling also "admitted to giving birth," the police document indicated. Other similar cases have gained national attention. Grossberg fell sick after returning to her dorm at the University of Delaware and needed to be hospitalized. Once at the hospital, doctors determined she delivered a baby. Melissa Drexler gave birth to a baby while in a bathroom at her New Jersey high school prom in 1997, according to The New York Times. Officials said Drexler wrapped the infant in plastic bags and put him in a trash bin. Fox News Digital reached out to Snelling's attorney for comment.

Fox News contributor Donna Rotunno explains the legal hurdles victims' families face in trying to permanently block the release of Bryan Kohberger crime scene photos on 'America Reports.' Quadruple murderer Bryan Kohberger claimed in court documents that he was diagnosed with four mental health disorders in the months leading up to his guilty plea in the killings of four University of Idaho students. Kohberger, 30, was diagnosed with "autism (level 1)," obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), which he wrote in a mental competency waiver obtained by the New York Post. Kohberger had filled out the form before pleading guilty in July. He also noted that, at the time, he was taking a prescription drug called levothyroxine, which is used to treat hypothyroidism. Bryan Kohberger appears at the Ada County Courthouse for his sentencing hearing July 23, 2025, in Boise, Idaho. Kohberger pleaded guilty in exchange for being spared the death penalty for the stabbing of four University of Idaho students nearly three years ago. Kohberger's attorneys argued his autism diagnosis should be a factor in removing the death penalty, but a judge denied that request in April. His lawyers also didn't want prosecutors to describe him as a "psychopath" or in other specific terms if his case went to trial. Digital forensics experts who dug into Kohberger's phone and computer told Fox News Digital recently that the criminology Ph.D. student regularly searched the term "psychopath" and related terms like "psychopaths paranoid." They said he also looked up wiretapping and spent Christmas night reading in depth about serial killers. In July, Kohberger pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder in the killings of University of Idaho students Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Xana Kernodle, 20, Madison Mogen, 21, and Ethan Chapin, 20, in November 2022. Madison Mogen, top left, smiles on the shoulders of her best friend, Kaylee Goncalves, as they pose with Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and two other housemates in Goncalves' final Instagram post, shared the day before the four students were stabbed to death in November 2022. Kohberger ultimately accepted a plea deal, avoiding the death penalty and receiving four consecutive life sentences, plus additional years, a move that split the victims' families between those who welcome closure to those who say justice was thwarted.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America is seen on March 26, 2025, in Ellabell, Ga. (AP Photo/Mike Stewart, File) Some 475 people were detained during an immigration raid at a sprawling Georgia site where South Korean auto company Hyundai manufactures electric vehicles, according to a Homeland Security official. Steven Schrank, Special Agent in Charge, Homeland Security Investigations, said at a news briefing Friday that the majority of the people detained were from South Korea. “This operation underscores our commitment to jobs for Georgians and Americans,” Schrank said. South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lee Jaewoong described the number of detained South Koreans as “large,” though he did not provide an exact figure. Brian Kemp says he's sending the Georgia National Guard later this month. Kemp said he will mobilize roughly 300 guard members in mid-September to relieve soldiers from other states. Seven other states have sent National Guard troops so far. Kemp said Georgia's soldiers may be armed and will support law enforcement. Kemp said he already sent 16 soldiers this week to perform non-policing support roles. That's because lower interest rates tend to give prices for investments a boost. But Friday's weaker-than-expected jobs report may have caused some doubt, and stocks fell in midday trading. If inflation goes up too much, however, that would hurt companies because the Fed could be compelled to raise interest rates, a move that often hurts prices for investments. The New York Democrat also criticized the Republicans' signature tax and spending law as “saddling the economy with trillions of dollars in debt” and cutting health and social welfare programs “in order to enact massive tax breaks for their billionaire donors.” Over a recent two-year period, the Pentagon funded hundreds of projects done in collaboration with universities in China and institutes linked to that nation's defense industry, including many blacklisted by the U.S. government for working with the Chinese military, a congressional investigation has found. “Failing to safeguard American research from hostile foreign exploitation will continue to erode U.S. technological dominance and place our national defense capabilities at risk,” it said. The Pentagon and didn't immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is delaying a requirement for automakers to begin hitting minimum sales levels for electric vehicles next year, an official familiar with the matter said Friday. Carney is set to announce later Friday measures for workers and businesses in those sectors most impacted by the U.S. tariffs and trade disruptions. Pentagon officials were slated to brief congressional national security staff on Friday but no top-level session for Hill leaders was expected. Congress has already adjourned for the week and many lawmakers have left town. House Speaker Mike Johnson is in Canada attending the G7 summit of global leaders. Senate Foreign Relations Chairman James Risch has acknowledged being in touch with the administration about the military strike, but provided no further details. But House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries had called on the Trump administration to provide a full briefing for Congress. They were detained during an immigration raid at a sprawling Georgia site where South Korean auto company Hyundai manufactures electric vehicles, according to the Homeland Security official. “This operation underscores our commitment to jobs for Georgians and Americans,” Schrank said. South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lee Jaewoong described the number of detained South Koreans as “large” though he did not provide an exact figure. At 2 p.m., he'll sign executive orders, followed by an announcement at 4 p.m., then a 7 p.m. dinner in the Rose Garden, according to the White House. “It should always be clear to anyone who would harm our people: Americans don't just play defense,” Lee said in a statement earlier this week. Only Congress has the power to establish, shutter and rename federal departments, meaning the legislation is required to formalize Trump's name change. The statement from Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, came in response to Friday's jobs report that said U.S. employers added just 22,000 jobs last month amid uncertainty over Trump's economic policies. “Donald Trump's chaotic tariffs, failed policies, and fake trade deals have slowed job growth and continually raised prices on American families,” Schumer said. U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson got a major boost Friday in her bid to succeed Iowa's Republican Sen. Joni Ernst just days after Ernst confirmed she wouldn't run for a third term. Within hours of Ernst's announcement Tuesday, Hinson said she would run for the open seat. Senate Majority Leader John Thune and National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Tim Scott handed Hinson an endorsement Friday in a joint statement. Thune said Hinson would bring to the Senate her “unrelenting energy” working for President Trump's agenda. Hinson, who represents Iowa's northeastern corner, joins two other Republicans in a primary for Ernst's seat. During a Cabinet meeting last week, he likened it to “one of the greatest achievements ever.” Sitting at the table as a proud Trump spoke was Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who came under fire at a congressional hearing Thursday for his work to restrict access to vaccines, including the very COVID-19 shots still touted by his boss. The three-hour hearing exposed an odd dichotomy: One of Trump's most universal successes in his first term remains Operation Warp Speed, yet his handpicked health chief and a growing cadre of Trump's “Make America Great Again” supporters are distrustful of the very mRNA vaccine technology that the president has championed. But it was canceled without explanation, according to a person familiar with the plans who wasn't authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Futures for the S&P 500 rose 0.2% in premarket trading Friday, while Nasdaq futures gained 0.6%, propelled by another strong earnings report from chipmaker Broadcom. An announcement of a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting Sept. 16-17 could reduce other borrowing costs in the economy, including mortgages, auto loans, and business loans. South Korea on Friday expressed “concern and regret” over a major U.S. immigration raid at a sprawling Georgia site where South Korean auto company Hyundai manufactures electric vehicles. South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lee Jaewoong described the number of detained South Koreans as “large” though he didn't provide an exact figure. Hyundai's South Korean office didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. President Trump's administration has undertaken sweeping ICE operations as part of a mass deportation agenda. Immigration officers have raided farms, construction sites, restaurants and auto repair shops. The Trump administration is taking its immigration crackdown to the health care safety net, launching Medicaid spending probes in at least six Democratic-led states that provide comprehensive health coverage to poor and disabled immigrants living in the U.S. without permanent legal status. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is scouring payments covering health care for immigrants without legal status to ensure there isn't any waste, fraud or abuse, according to public records obtained by KFF Health News and The Associated Press. While acknowledging that states can bill the federal government for Medicaid emergency and pregnancy care for immigrants without legal status, federal officials have sent letters notifying state health agencies in California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington that they are reviewing federal and state payments for medical services, such as prescription drugs and specialty care. That's partly because of the lingering effects of 11 interest rate hikes by the inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve in 2022 and 2023 and partly because Trump's policies, including his trade wars, have created uncertainty that leaves managers reluctant to make hiring decisions. “The labor market is showing signs of cracking,” said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. “It's not a red siren alarm yet, but the signs keep growing that businesses are starting to cut workers.‘' The Labor Department said Friday that hiring decelerated from 79,000 in July. Talking to reporters Thursday night at a dinner with wealthy tech executives, Trump had seemed to shrug off whatever hiring numbers would come out Friday. “The real numbers that I'm talking about are going to be whatever it is, but will be in a year from now,'' the president said. The president's daughter-in-law will present an interview with the vice president on Saturday evening for her Fox News show, “My View with Lara Trump.” Vance has served as a pitchman for the White House, traveling to swing states like Georgia and Wisconsin to promote administration policies like recent tax legislation. He's also expected to talk about the upcoming midterms and the next presidential election, when he's been floated as a potential successor to Trump.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Thousands of newborn stars sparkle and dazzle in the latest snapshot by NASA's Webb Space Telescope. Released this week, the picture provides a breathtaking view of a nearby star-birthing center, 5,500 light-years away. Besides baby stars in a variety of sizes and colors, the photo reveals a dramatic cloud of star-forming dust and gas. This cloud — the so-called Lobster Nebula — is so massive that it spills beyond the camera lens. The cluster of infant stars, named Pismis 24, is located deep inside. Launched in 2021, Webb is the largest and most powerful telescope ever sent into space. It views the universe in the infrared, spending more than five hours to capture this one shot.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This image provided by Fabian Mosele shows A.I.-generated animation of Italian Brain Rot characters created by visual artist Fabian Mosele in 2025. This image provided by Fabian Mosele shows an undated self-portrait photo of A.I. animator Fabian Mosele, sitting in front of the A.I. This undated image provided by Fabian Mosele shows Fabian Mosele's collection of toys that were inspired by Italian Brain Rot characters, which went viral in 2025. In the first half of 2025, she racked up over 55 million views on TikTok and 4 million likes, mostly from tweens glued to their cellphones. Her smiling, girlish face is accompanied by a deep, computer-generated male voice singing in Italian — or, at least, some Italian. She is one of the most prominent characters in the internet phenomenon known as “Italian Brain Rot,” a series of memes that exploded in popularity this year, consisting of unrealistic AI-generated animal-object hybrids with absurdist, pseudo-Italian narration. Experts and fans alike say the trend is worth paying attention to, and tells us something about the youngest generation of tweens. This image provided by Fabian Mosele shows an undated self-portrait photo of A.I. animator Fabian Mosele, sitting in front of the A.I. The first Italian brain-rot character was Tralalero Tralala, a shark with blue Nike sneakers on his elongated fins. Early Tralalero Tralala videos were scored with a curse-laden Italian song that sounds like a crude nursery rhyme. Content creators around the world have created entire storylines told through intentionally ridiculous songs. Fabian Mosele, 26, calls themselves an “Italian brain rot connoisseur.” An Italian animator who lives in Germany and works with AI by trade, Mosele created their first Italian brain-rot content in March. Shortly after, Mosele's video of Italian brain-rot characters at an underground rave garnered about a million views overnight, they said. Sometimes, the games' administrators — who are also players — cheat to steal the characters, a move called “admin abuse” that sent many kids and teens into a frenzy. In the non-virtual world, some have made physical toy replicas of the characters, while others have created real-life plays featuring them. The nonsensical songs have at times gestured to real-world issues: One clip of Bombardiro Crocodilo sparked outrage for seemingly mocking the war in Gaza. But ultimately, the majority of videos are silly and absurd. Mosele said Italian brain-rot consumers largely don't care about how the images relate to what is being said or sung. “Seeing something so dark, in a way, and out of the ordinary, that breaks all the norms of what we would expect to see on TV — that's just super appealing.” This undated image provided by Fabian Mosele shows Fabian Mosele's collection of toys that were inspired by Italian Brain Rot characters, which went viral in 2025. Italian brain rot didn't go viral in a vacuum. It can also be used to describe the brain-rotting content itself. Lots of content falls into that category. Consider videos of the game “Subway Surfer” split-screened next to full episodes of television shows, or “Skibidi Toilet,” an animated series featuring toilets with human heads popping out of their bowls. Those not chronically online might instinctively recoil at the term brain rot, with its vaguely gory connotations, especially as concern about the potential harms of social media for adolescents mounts. When brain rot was crowned word of the year, Oxford Languages President Casper Grathwohl said the term speaks to “one of the perceived dangers of virtual life, and how we are using our free time.” Emilie Owens, 33, a children's media researcher, agreed that endless scrolling poses dangers for young people. But she said that the concern about brain rot is misguided. It's normal to “view the thing the newest generation is doing with fear and suspicion,” she said, pointing to how past generations have had similar concerns about the detrimental effects of comic books, television and even novels at one time. Concerns about brain rot — that it is unproductive and pointless — actually reveal a great deal about their appeal, Owens said. Brain rot is an acute rejection of the intense pressures on young people to self-optimize.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The government, which is under intense American and regional pressure to disarm the powerful Iran-backed militia, had asked the army to present its plan by early August, despite a rejection by Hezbollah and its allies. At a cabinet meeting on Friday, five ministers from Hezbollah and its allied Amal party withdrew as the government began discussing the plan, according to Lebanon's official National News Agency. The Lebanese army's plan is an unprecedented effort to disarm Iran's most powerful regional proxy and one of the biggest non-state threats to Israel. Despite being significantly weakened by Israel over the past two years, Hezbollah remains Lebanon's most powerful armed group and has a large support base among the country's large Shiite community. Observers warn that any attempt to disarm it by force risks plunging the country into civil conflict. “This is a very, very pivotal moment,” a senior Lebanese official told CNN on Friday, before the plan was presented. Aside from being a militant group, Hezbollah also functions as a political party that has lawmakers in the legislature and a social services arm that serves many of its constituents, primarily in the south of the country. Some opponents of Hezbollah have insisted that it disband its armed wing and function solely as a political party. After Lebanon's civil war ended in 1990, Hezbollah expanded its influence across politics and society by remaining armed – unlike other militias, it was exempted from disarmament under the Taif Agreement due to its role in resisting Israeli occupation. Lebanon was devastated by a year-long conflict between Hezbollah and Israel, triggered by the militia's backing of Hamas after the Palestinian militants attacked Israel on October 7, 2023. Israeli strikes severely weakened Hezbollah – culminating in the assassination of its revered leader, Hassan Nasrallah – and significantly curtailed the group's domestic clout. A US-mediated ceasefire last year was meant to halt Israel's attacks on Lebanon, but near daily strikes by Israel and its occupation of five positions in southern Lebanon have hardened Hezbollah's refusal to disarm – raising the prospect of a clash with the army if it moves to disband the group. Lebanon's government, led by Salam, a former head of International Court of Justice, has been accused by Hezbollah supporters of treason for conceding to US demands to disarm the group while Israeli forces remain present in Lebanese territory remain. US envoys Tom Barrack and Morgan Ortagus, appointed by President Donald Trump, have capitalized on Hezbollah's weakened state to launch shuttle diplomacy aimed at negotiating frameworks between Lebanon and Israel, centered around Hezbollah's disarmament and Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon. They appear to be aware of the risks involved. US and Lebanese officials have offered few details about how they envision convincing Hezbollah to disarm voluntarily. “So long as Israel maintains military positions inside Lebanese territory and bombs the entire border area until all homes, fields, crops and any form of life are destroyed, Hezbollah will continue to say that their weapons are to defend themselves and the country,” the official said. “It's important for them (Israel) to get out of here.” Israeli officials have previously said that troops in Lebanon would remain there “indefinitely,” but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last week that the military would begin a phased withdrawal from Lebanon if the Lebanese army disarms Hezbollah.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Ronny Jackson announced that the Navy has restored his retired rank of rear admiral, overturning a 2022 demotion that followed a scathing investigation, which found major issues with his behavior while he was the top White House physician. The Texas Republican on Wednesday posted a June 13 letter from Navy Secretary John Phelan saying he had reinstated Jackson to the retired rank of a one-star admiral following a “review of all applicable reports and references.” The Navy confirmed the move, with a spokesperson for Phelan saying he “greatly appreciates Congressman Jackson's decades of distinguished naval service.” The decision to restore Jackson's rank comes as the Pentagon has become increasingly transparent in offering benefits and consideration to those it sees as personally loyal supporters of President Donald Trump, while those who are seen as unsupportive of Trump have been pushed out of senior roles across the military. Two weeks ago, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth fired Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, who oversaw the intelligence agency that produced an initial intelligence assessment of US damage to Iranian nuclear sites that angered Trump. Following his 2019 retirement from the Navy, Jackson was retroactively demoted following a yearslong investigation into his behavior when he was a physician to Trump and former President Barack Obama. An inspector general's report found that he made “sexual and denigrating” comments about a female subordinate, violated the policy on drinking alcohol on a presidential trip and took prescription-strength sleeping medication that prompted worries from his colleagues about his ability to provide proper medical care. He was elected to Congress in 2020 following a failed effort in the first Trump administration to appoint him the secretary of Veterans Affairs in 2018. “I was, and still am, a retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral, and Joe Biden is a retired old FOOL,” Jackson said this week on social media, where he has called himself an admiral despite his demotion. Last week, military officials revealed that Ashli Babbitt, the rioter who was killed by a police officer during the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, would be offered military funeral honors. Babbitt was a US Air Force veteran from California who was shot and killed wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders while trying to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker's Lobby inside the Capitol as rioters interrupted the counting of electoral votes certifying Trump's 2020 loss to Biden.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. That kind of journalism isn't easy. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? ﻿The greatest grand slam in the world has become an etiquette nightmare — and it's not alone. At the US Open's Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong stadiums, there's a hum that never goes away. It sort of sounds like the murmur cicadas make. The closer you listen, though, you realize that instead of insects erupting from the ground to breed and scream in the woods, it's actually thousands of people spending hundreds of dollars to descend upon a tennis tournament to…chat. So what's going on with the crowd? Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online. “We're talking about people who are not at all interested in the tennis,” says Caitlin Thompson, the founder of Racquet, a media company that focuses on tennis and culture. But if you look a bit deeper, the undulating murmur is a result of both the deliberate effort to woo the kind of attendee who's there just to gab, and a breakdown in the larger social contract when it comes to how we act in public. Those fans, it turns out, have other priorities when they're seated courtside. The gourmet chicken nuggets topped with bumps of green caviar that cost $100, the $40 blue hat that everyone wants, the social media-famous $23 Honey Deuce, served in a cup you can take home; the photo opportunities, giveaways, and interactive games in sponsored activation booths from big brands like Chase, Cadillac, and Emirates; the box seats saved for Anna Wintour, Jeremy Allen White, and Christine Baranski — it's all part of what makes the US Open an event that transcends sports, and the greatest grand slam in the world. The US Open has long had a reputation for its electric atmosphere — for being a tournament that embodies the brash, chaotic, rugged attitude of New York City. It's never been a particularly silent experience; its history is punctuated by the crowd reacting (groans, oohs, aahs, etc.) That's all to say, one singular conversation in the nosebleeds isn't going to ruin an entire match, but that's not what's happening. This year, Open-goers are treated to a multitude of concurrent conversations about what everyone had for lunch or which player is which, a nonstop cacophony of whispers about how people's days were, and an endless onslaught of how everyone got out to Queens (either the 7 train or the Long Island Railroad) and what time they're going to leave. The experts I spoke to outlined two reasons why the US Open's racket (no pun intended) feels so inescapable in this and recent years. David Kane, a producer at Tennis Channel, explained to me that while the roofs on Ashe (completed/renovated in 2016) and Armstrong (completed in 2018) have saved matches from rainouts, they've also created an acoustic problem where the sound is trapped. He also notes that the clamor of people buying concessions and drinks nearby, as well as those milling about to their seats, add to the hum. The other half of this equation is that the US Open has crossed over from a typical sporting event into a social celebration. “People are having a night out in New York and chatting away, oblivious to the fact there's a grand slam tennis match happening in front of them that they have ostensibly bought tickets to go see,” says Ben Rothenberg, a tennis journalist and podcast host, tells Vox. Courtside seats can go for $5,000 and higher. Rothenberg cited Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift's appearance last year, as well as Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner's soft launch in 2023, as evidence of the US Open achieving new levels of celebrity attendance and using glitz to court a bigger fan base. Rothenberg notes the spike in influencers in the last few years, musing that it might now be more of a place to spot celebs than an event for die-hard tennis fans. Adding to the Open's mystique is the extremely photogenic Honey Deuce, a $23 fancy lemonade made with Grey Goose vodka. Never mind that the drink tastes neither like honey or honeydew melon, last year the event sold roughly $13 million worth of sweetened alcohol in the form of 550,000 Honey Ds. Somehow, it seems like even more were posted on social media. Also available this year are the $21 Ace Paloma, and the equally Instagrammable Watermelon Slice, a $39 Moët & Chandon champagne cocktail. “You'd think, with the crazy amount of money that people are actually spending on tickets, that I'd be surrounded by die-hard tennis fans,” says Jon Guerrica, the host of the Fantastic Tennis podcast. “Instead, I really felt like I was surrounded by like, a sea of influencers talking over points and just waiting for changeovers to take selfies with their Honey Deuces.” Coupled with stunt food like the aforementioned caviar-topped chicken nuggets and exclusive restaurants on site (only available to courtside and suite guests), it's easy to have a US Open experience that doesn't necessarily prioritize tennis. Even if the stands aren't full of the sport's most devoted observers, however, this chatty, self-interested behavior seems more than a little, well, rude. It all comes back to the post-2020 problem of not quite knowing how to act like grown-ups in the real world. One TikToker called the Open an “adult Disney World,” which he ostensibly meant as a compliment. The US Open's armada of fancy drinks are probably a little bit to blame for that inevitable murmur. Even though Americans are drinking less overall, the US Open might be one of those liminal spaces — the aforementioned adult Disneyworld — where they don't feel tethered to rules of polite society. There are reports that Broadway is experiencing something similar, and some people's chattiness is directly proportional to the number of drinks they're consuming. Journalists and fans I spoke to mentioned fans collecting multiple Honey Deuce souvenir cups and greedily stacking them into towering plastic spires, prompting observers to both do the math on how much money they spent and how much alcohol is in their bloodstream. That is this behavior and content are just symptoms of a bigger cultural shift where everyone sees themselves as the main character. In this configuration, these spectators become the main attraction, and players like Coco Gauff, Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner, and Naomi Osaka are their supporting co-stars. I heard the infamous US Open hum at a Taylor Fritz match this past week. During a second round match a group of girlfriends dressed as if they were going to be called to the court themselves, piled in a row behind me. They talked as players lined up to serve. They talked during rallies and through a tiebreaker. They never stopped talking, even as the usher asked them to keep it down. “Should I go to the bathroom now?” Involuntarily, I was plunged into their back and forth rather than the one happening on court. The goal shouldn't just be bringing in new audiences, it should be getting those potential fans to care about the incredible display in front of them. The United States Tennis Association has done a superb job of making the US Open a tremendously cool, luxurious, and highly expensive event that everyone wants to go to.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prince William joked about “getting drunk” with Canadian actor Eugene Levy during a brief appearance in a trailer for the latest season of the actor's Apple TV+ travel series. “I've challenged myself to complete my own bucket list, before actually kicking the bucket,” Levy, who is known for his dry wit and deadpan delivery, said in the trailer, which was released on Thursday. In the trailer, Levy can be seen exploring Windsor Castle, one of King Charles and Queen Camilla's residences, west of London. “Oh my, it doesn't get much better than that,” Levy says in a voiceover as he walks through the castle's grounds. Other stars joining Levy on his quest for the world's top travel destinations include Canadian singer Michael Bublé, rising K-pop boy band NOWZ and former Indian top cricketer Rahul Dravid, according to an Apple TV+ press release. Levy, who has been able to travel all over the world throughout his acting career, previously admitted that he's “not fond of traveling” at all, describing himself as more of “the great indoors type of guy.” (Hate) is a very strong word,” Levy told CNN in 2023. Prince and Princess of Wales set to move into new home in Windsor “But before he can claim that title, he's challenging himself to experience some of the most iconic adventures the world has to offer,” it continued. The new series is set to premiere globally on September 19.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? One was François Chollet, creator of the widely used Keras library and author of the ARC-AGI benchmark, which tests if AI has reached “general” or broadly human-level intelligence. Chollet has a reputation as a bit of an AI bear, eager to deflate the most boosterish and over-optimistic predictions of where the technology is going. But in the discussion, Chollet said his timelines have gotten shorter recently. Researchers had made big progress on what he saw as the major obstacles to achieving artificial general intelligence, like models' weakness at recalling and applying things they learned before. Chollet's interlocutor — Dwarkesh Patel, whose podcast has become the single most important place for tracking what top AI scientists are thinking — had, in reaction to his own reporting, moved in the opposite direction. While humans are great at learning continuously or “on the job,” Patel has become more pessimistic that AI models can gain this skill any time soon. “It doesn't seem like there's an easy way to slot this key capability into these models.” All of which is to say, two very plugged-in, smart people who know the field as well as anyone else can come to perfectly reasonable yet contradictory conclusions about the pace of AI progress. In that case, how is someone like me, who's certainly less knowledgeable than Chollet or Patel, supposed to figure out who's right? One of the most promising approaches I've seen to resolving — or at least adjudicating — these disagreements comes from a small group called the Forecasting Research Institute. XPT was intended to “produce high-quality forecasts of the risks facing humanity over the next century.” To do this, the researchers (including Penn psychologist and forecasting pioneer Philip Tetlock and FRI head Josh Rosenberg) surveyed subject matter experts who study threats that at least conceivably could jeopardize humanity's survival (like AI) in the summer of 2022. But they also asked “superforecasters,” a group of people identified by Tetlock and others who have proven unusually accurate at predicting events in the past. The superforecaster group was not made up of experts on existential threats to humanity, but rather, generalists from a variety of occupations with solid predictive track records. This gap persisted even after the researchers had the two groups engage in structured discussions meant to identify why they disagreed. In the case of AI, subject matter experts thought the burden of proof should be on skeptics to show why a hyper-intelligent digital species wouldn't be dangerous. Luckily for us observers, each group was asked not only to estimate long-term risks over the next century, which can't be confirmed any time soon, but also events in the nearer future. In a new paper, the authors — Tetlock, Rosenberg, Simas Kučinskas, Rebecca Ceppas de Castro, Zach Jacobs, and Ezra Karger — go back and evaluate how well the two groups fared at predicting the three years of AI progress since summer 2022. In theory, this could tell us which group to believe. If the concerned AI experts proved much better at predicting what would happen between 2022–2025, Perhaps that's an indication that they have a better read on the longer-run future of the technology, and therefore, we should give their warnings greater credence. Alas, in the words of Ralph Fiennes, “Would that it were so simple!” It turns out the three-year results leave us without much more sense of who to believe. Across four benchmarks, the actual performance of state-of-the-art models in summer 2025 was better than either superforecasters or AI experts predicted (though the latter was closer). “Overall, superforecasters assigned an average probability of just 9.7 percent to the observed outcomes across these four AI benchmarks,” the report concluded, “compared to 24.6 percent from domain experts.” They put slightly higher odds that what actually happened would happen — but when they crunched the numbers across all questions, the authors concluded that there was no statistically significant difference in aggregate accuracy between the domain experts and superforecasters. What's more, there was no correlation between how accurate someone was in projecting the year 2025 and how dangerous they thought AI or other risks were. We may not know which of these soothsayers are smart, but the crowds remain wise. Perhaps I should have seen this outcome coming. Ezra Karger, an economist and co-author on both the initial XPT paper and this new one, told me upon the first paper's release in 2023 that, “over the next 10 years, there really wasn't that much disagreement between groups of people who disagreed about those longer run questions.” That is, they already knew that the predictions of people worried about AI and people less worried were pretty similar. So, it shouldn't surprise us too much that one group wasn't dramatically better than the other at predicting the years 2022–2025. There is, perhaps, some valuable information in the fact that both groups underestimated the rate of AI progress: perhaps that's a sign that we have all underestimated the technology, and it'll keep improving faster than anticipated. Then again, the predictions in 2022 were all made before the release of ChatGPT in November of that year. Does that tell us anything about whether the technology might not be slowing down, which, in turn, would be key to forecasting its long-term threat? Reading the latest FRI report, I wound up in a similar place to my former colleague Kelsey Piper last year. Piper noted that failing to extrapolate trends, especially exponential trends, out into the future has led people badly astray in the past. The fact that relatively few Americans had Covid in January 2020 did not mean Covid wasn't a threat; it meant that the country was at the start of an exponential growth curve. A similar kind of failure would lead one to underestimate AI progress and, with it, any potential existential risk. At the same time, in most contexts, exponential growth can't go on forever; it maxes out at some point. It's remarkable that, say, Moore's law has broadly predicted the growth in microprocessor density accurately for decades — but Moore's law is famous in part because it's unusual for trends about human-created technologies to follow so clean a pattern. “I've increasingly come to believe that there is no substitute for digging deep into the weeds when you're considering these questions,” Piper concluded. “While there are questions we can answer from first principles, [AI progress] isn't one of them.” I fear she's right — and that, worse, mere deference to experts doesn't suffice either, not when experts disagree with each other on both specifics and broad trajectories.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? What will come next in the Trump administration's war on “narcoterrorism”? With this week's unprecedented deadly military strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat in the Caribbean, it's clear that the US plans to use tactics it has long employed against terrorist groups against Latin American criminal organizations — up to and including threats of regime change against governments accused of backing the “terrorists.” President Donald Trump has talked about firing missiles at drug labs in Mexico as far back as 2020, according to former aides, and discussed the idea of using military force against cartels on the campaign trail. In February, shortly after taking office, the Trump administration designated several criminal groups, including the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, as foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs) and specially designated global terrorists (SDGTs), putting them in the same legal category as al-Qaida and ISIS. Then, on Tuesday, Trump announced that the US had carried out a “kinetic strike” against “Tren de Aragua narcoterrorists,” killing 11 on board. Trump administration officials have suggested that there may be more strikes to come. The administration has also accused President Nicolas Maduro's government in Venezuela of controlling Tren de Aragua, a highly contested claim. US officials haven't exactly denied this, with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth calling it a “presidential decision” and one Trump official telling Axios, “This is 105% about narco-terrorism, but if Maduro winds up no longer in power, no one will be crying.” Taken together, the Trump administration's new approach could mark a major shift in the more than 50-year history of America's “war on drugs,” its relationship with Latin America, and the increasing militarization of a wide range of policy. The group is primarily known for crimes like extortion and human trafficking, and while it has been involved in selling drugs at the local level and in some cases smuggling small amounts across borders, experts are skeptical about US accusations that it is bringing drugs in large quantities into the US. “Tren de Aragua and MS-13 [a Salvadoran gang also now listed as a terrorist organization] are what you could call poor organized crime groups,” said Adam Isacson, a defense and drug policy analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America. If they were actually operating a boat carrying many kilos of cocaine, that would be something new.” The administration has not yet presented evidence of how it knew who was on the boat, though Trump did say, “We have tapes of them speaking.” But using deadly force against these ships is more unusual, particularly when — as it appears in the video shared by the Trump administration — there was no effort to warn the vessel or take it into custody. This, to put it mildly, raises some legal issues. Though Trump and other officials have referred to Tren de Argua as “narcoterrorists” and officially listed it as a terrorist group, this is not actually a death warrant, notes Brian Finucane, a former State Department legal adviser now with the International Crisis Group. The FTO and SDGT listings authorize an array of sanctions and criminalize legal support to these groups, but do not authorize military force against them, though, as Finucane notes, “it is widely misunderstood within the US executive branch to do so, and bureaucratically it can help pave the way for military action.” “It helps further this narrative of theirs where the US is engaged in a war on terror in Latin America,” Finucane said. The question now is what that war might look like. WOLA's Isacson suggested that the strike, taken in international waters, could be a means of “turning up the dial” toward more provocative actions, such as striking alleged cartel targets on the sovereign territory of other countries, or against governments accused of backing them. The idea of taking military action against cartels in Mexico is popular among Republican members of Congress, and the boat strike overshadowed a highly anticipated visit by Rubio to Mexico this week. After a meeting between Rubio and President Claudia Sheinbaum, the two countries agreed to expand cooperation to combat drug cartels while respecting each other's “sovereignty.” There's certainly a possibility the idea could return. One US official told Axios, “This could be Noriega part 2,” referring to the US military operation that ousted and arrested Panamanian dictator and narcotrafficker Manuel Noriega in 1990. Venezuela is a much larger country, and given Trump's penchant for avoiding long, drawn-out military deployments, a Panama-style invasion seems pretty unlikely. During the first Trump administration, the US backed opposition leader Juan Guaidó and recognized him as Venezuela's legitimate president after the disputed 2019 presidential election, even after it became clear that despite hopes in Washington, Maduro had the support of his military and Guaidó had little hope of taking power. Michael Shifter, professor of Latin American studies at Georgetown University, was skeptical of the notion, advanced by some analysts and Venezuelan opposition figures, that the regime could collapse in the face of escalating US pressure. “We've always underestimated Maduro and his capacity to hold things together,” he said. What is clear is that the speculation early in the Trump administration that the US and Venezuela could be headed for a rapprochement, particularly after a negotiated hostage release in January, was premature. While experts, including US intelligence agencies, have cast doubt on the Trump administration's claims that Maduro directly controls Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan regime's links to organized crime are well documented. That may be one reason why, with the notable exception of Colombia's left-wing president Gustavo Petro, who called the boat strike a “murder,” reaction in the region has been pretty muted, even from governments normally quick to raise alarm about US intervention. Early in the Trump administration, when the president was publicly feuding with Petro and demanding the return of the Panama Canal to US control, it appeared that Latin America was going to be an unusually large focus of American foreign policy, leading to speculation about a “Monroe Doctrine 2.0.” That hasn't quite panned out, as attention has shifted to events in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. But given the focus on crime and immigration, it does appear that the region is taking on a greater role in America's military priorities. A memo from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to military commanders earlier this month referred to “the President's determination to restore our neglected position in the Western Hemisphere.” It also listed “sealing our borders” and counternarcotics as priorities for the Pentagon above deterring China, which has for several years now been considered the department's overarching “pacing challenge.” Whatever their feelings about drug gangs or Venezuela's corrupt and dictatorial regime, that's likely to make leaders in the region nervous. However, he added, “there is nervousness about it and trepidation. They're all wondering, what is this guy doing, and are we next?” In addition to a greater emphasis on Latin America, the strike suggests a willingness by this administration to expand the scope of what military force can be used for. The strike was announced the same week that Trump is publicly discussing sending the National Guard to more cities, including Chicago and New Orleans, following their deployment to Washington, DC, last month — another dramatic application of the military to what has traditionally been civilian law enforcement. Though the US has, over several administrations, wound down what was once called the “Global War on Terror,” many of the legal authorities and institutions that emerged as part of that conflict remain. That never happened, but in his second term, the government has spent millions deporting migrants there. America isn't retreating from the world under Trump. The global humanitarian system was not set up for a crisis like this one.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Last month, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dropped an inflammatory allegation on most of her colleagues. On August 21, the Supreme Court handed down a baffling order that required researchers, who claim that the Trump administration illegally cut off their federal grants, to navigate a convoluted procedural maze in two different courts. Jackson labeled this decision “Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist.” Calvinball, an ever-changing game featured in the Calvin and Hobbes comic strip, “has only one rule: There are no fixed rules.” Under the Versailles-like norms that constrain lawyers and judges, this kind of allegation is simply verboten. While Jackson's Democratic colleagues often criticize the Court's decisions, they frequently go out of their way to say that all of the justices “are operating in good faith.” Law students are trained to never suggest that a judge acted for partisan reasons, largely because judges take great umbrage at this allegation. And there is real danger in Jackson's decision to speak of her Republican colleagues as if they are Republicans. That opinion triggered another from Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Yet, while reasonable minds can disagree about whether Jackson's “Calvinball” accusation was a wise way to navigate the Court's internal politics, it's tough to argue with her conclusion. The Court's Republican majority now hands Trump several victories every month, only explaining themselves when they feel like it. Their decision permitting Trump to commit crimes doesn't even attempt to argue that presidential immunity can be found in the Constitution — instead making a policy argument that Trump should not be chilled from taking “bold and unhesitating action” for fear of prosecution. Nor is Trump the only litigant who receives this Court's special treatment. The Republican justices favor religious conservatives so much that they will make up fake facts to bolster Christian conservative litigants. Meanwhile, they hate abortion providers so much that they once handed down an anti-abortion decision that, if taken seriously, would permit every state to neutralize any constitutional right. If any other government official behaved this way, it would be obvious they were placing partisanship ahead of the law. It is no less obvious when these six specific government officials do so. I could post a citation to Trump v. United States (2024), the decision immunizing Trump from prosecution for his official acts in office, and walk away with a mic drop. It joins a widespread pattern of decisions treating the GOP leader as if he is special. Before Trump's first term, the Supreme Court heard cases almost exclusively through a slow process that maximized the justices' ability to consider every implication of their eventual decision. Even then, they'd often wait until two appeals courts divided on the answer to the same legal question (what's known as a “circuit split”). So it made sense for the nation's final adjudicators to wait, letting parties on both sides of an issue figure out their best arguments in lower courts, before the justices issued a decree that was likely to stand forever. Indeed, the Court was historically so hostile to litigants who attempted to jump in line, that — outside of death penalty cases, where someone would die if the justices didn't immediately intervene — most attorneys wouldn't even ask the Supreme Court to hear a case before an appeals court handed down its final decision. In the Supreme Court's 2018–'19 term alone, Trump's DOJ filed 10 petitions asking the justices to block a lower court's decision on its “shadow docket,” a forum for emergency motions and other matters that receive the Court's expedited review. Rather than enforce its longstanding norms, the justices abandoned them to accommodate Trump. effectively permits Trump to neutralize the Convention Against Torture. The Court handed Trump even more victories by exempting him from formal rules. As the Court explained in Nken v. Holder (2009), for example, a party asking an appellate court to block a lower court decision while the case is still being litigated normally cannot prevail, even if they show they're likely to win the case. They also must show that they “will be irreparably injured absent a stay,” and that a decision blocking the lower court's order won't do too much harm to the public interest or to third parties. But, as Jackson pointed out in a pair of dissents this year, the Republican justices appear to have exempted Trump and his administration from this requirement. This Court has also embraced a divide-and-conquer strategy that weakens lower court judges and prevents litigants from obtaining lasting relief against Trump's illegal actions. The most high-profile example of this strategy is Trump v. CASA (2025), where the Republican justices held that lower courts may only issue so-called nationwide injunctions — orders that toss out a federal policy rather than exempting a particular litigant from having to comply with it — in rare circumstances. CASA, in fairness, is one of this Court's more defensible Trump-related decisions. President Joe Biden spent his presidency being tormented by right-wing judges who issued nationwide injunctions against him on dubious grounds, and his DOJ fought to halt them until the bitter end. And CASA is hardly the only case where the Republican justices placed new — and sometimes, ridiculous — procedural barriers in front of litigants challenging Trump policies. The worst example is National Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Association, the case where Jackson levied her “Calvinball” accusation against her Republican colleagues. J.G.G., five Republican justices voted to vacate a lower court order blocking many of Trump's illegal deportations. Trump cut off due process for many immigrants by unlawfully relying on a federal statute that only permits him to do so if a foreign military invades the US. But the Supreme Court held that no judge could block these illegal deportations on a nationwide basis, and instead required the impacted immigrants to bring many lawsuits in many different courts using a process known as “habeas.” This Court, in other words, has favored Trump by giving him broad exemptions from normal procedures, while simultaneously erecting new barriers in front of anyone who challenges him. Notice how, in many of these decisions, the Court achieved partisan results simply by manipulating procedure. It played a similar game, with opposite results, when Biden was president. In August 2021, Matthew Kacsmaryk — the Trump judge best known for his failed attempt to ban the abortion medication mifepristone — ordered the Biden administration to reinstate a Trump policy that required many migrants to remain in Mexico while their immigration cases were being processed. His decision had no basis in law, and rested on an egregious misreading of federal immigration statutes. Kacsmaryk was the de facto US border czar for nearly an entire year. Once again, the Supreme Court eventually conceded that Tipton's order was lawless, but it sat on the case for 11 months before reaching this obvious conclusion. And the Republican justices do not limit their partisan shenanigans to procedural orders. To the contrary, they invented a new limit on executive power that they have only ever applied to one president: Joe Biden. Their attempts to justify the doctrine are childish and silly; Barrett, for example, once defended it with a parable involving a babysitter. Again, the major questions doctrine has only been applied to one president in American history: Joe Biden. The student loans decision, Biden v. Nebraska (2023), was particularly poorly reasoned. The secretary could use this power “notwithstanding any other provision of law, unless enacted with specific reference to” the statute authorizing him to cancel loans. When the Republican justices applied this fake doctrine to Biden, they showed none of the compunctions about nationwide orders that they repeatedly expressed under Trump. The Republican justices did not require individual landlords to file individual lawsuits seeking to exempt a single tenant from the eviction moratorium. Nor did they require loan servicers to comply with a years-long process in two different courts. And there are already signs that at least one of the Republican justices plans to exempt Trump from this major questions doctrine. If anything counts as a question of “vast ‘economic and political significance,'” it's Trump's decision to unilaterally impose a massive tax hike that, according to Yale's Budget Lab, will cost the average American household $2,400 in 2025 alone. And yet, in a concurring opinion in FCC v. Consumers' Research, Justice Brett Kavanaugh signaled that he will exempt Trump's tariffs from the major questions doctrine by declaring that it does not apply in “foreign policy contexts.” Kavanaugh, in other words, has decided to invent a new limit on a brand-new legal doctrine, which was itself invented by himself and his Republican colleagues, and that has no basis in any law. It just so happens that this new limit will rescue a Republican president's signature policy from invalidation. If Kavanaugh pursues this plan when the tariffs case reaches his Court, how could anyone possibly conclude that he is engaged in a good faith effort to apply the law without favoring either political party? Though Trump has benefited more from this Court's partisanship than anyone, he's hardly the only beneficiary. Justices are not appointed to the Supreme Court as representatives of a political party. In today's America, both parties have a very sophisticated understanding of how they want judges to act, carefully select judges who can be relied upon to predictably pursue their party's goals, and once confirmed, their Supreme Court appointees consistently act in accordance with their party's vision for the courts. It hasn't always been this way; indeed, as recently as 2010, Justice John Paul Stevens was a liberal justice appointed by a Republican president. A fuller explanation of why I label the justices “Republicans” and “Democrats” can be found here. One of the Court's first actions after Barrett's confirmation gave Republican justices a supermajority, for example, was to overrule months-old Supreme Court decisions establishing that churches and other houses of worship must comply with the same public health restrictions that apply to similar institutions, such as movie theaters and lecture halls, where people tend to gather in large groups. The Republican justices have even claimed separating church and state is unconstitutional in many contexts. The Court's Republicans have shown extraordinary impatience in religion cases, even when moving too quickly risks harming important institutions. In Mahmoud v. Taylor (2025), the Court considered a conflict between conservative religious parents and a school district that approved books with queer characters for use in some classrooms. An appeals court, in an opinion by George W. Bush-appointed Judge Steven Agee, had previously ruled that the judiciary needed more information before it could decide how to proceed. As Agee wrote, the record in the case provided no information “about how any teacher or school employee has actually used any of the Storybooks in the Parents' children's classrooms, how often the Storybooks are actually being used, what any child has been taught in conjunction with their use, or what conversations have ensued about their themes.” So it wasn't yet possible to determine if these parents' constitutional rights were violated. Rather than wait for lower courts to determine what actually happened, however, the Republican justices rushed out a sweeping decision declaring that parents with a religious objection to any lesson taught in a public school must be given advance notice of that lesson and the ability to opt their child out of it. Parents previously sued public schools because they objected, on religious grounds, to lessons touching on topics as diverse as divorce, interfaith couples, “immodest dress,” evolution, pacifism, magic, women achieving things outside of the home, and “false views of death.” Thus, under Mahmoud, a school district can potentially be held liable if it does something as innocuous as assigning a book where one of the characters is a woman who works as a police officer. Or for assigning a biography of President Ronald Reagan, who was divorced. So in Mahmoud, the Republican justices bypassed the judiciary's ordinary fact-finding process to give religious conservatives what they were seeking as quickly as possible. In another case, Kennedy v. Bremerton School District (2022), they went even further: making up fake facts and then relying on them to rule in favor of a Christian conservative. Kennedy involved Joseph Kennedy, a public school football coach who incorporated “motivational” prayers into his coaching, led after-game prayer sessions, and who would walk out to the 50-yard line after games to kneel and pray in front of students and spectators. We know that Kennedy conducted these very public prayer sessions because both the school district's brief and Sotomayor's dissenting opinion incorporated pictures of them. But Justice Neil Gorsuch's majority opinion claims that Kennedy “offered his prayers quietly while his students were otherwise occupied,” and describes them as a “brief, quiet, personal religious observance.” No one questions that the Constitution permits government employees, including those in positions of authority over young people, to quietly pray. In 2021, back when Roe v. Wade was still good law, Texas enacted a Rube Goldberg-like scheme to shut down abortion clinics without due process. The basic idea was to force the state's abortion providers to choose between being bankrupted by either a court order or by legal fees. Successful plaintiffs collected a bounty of “not less than $10,000”; there was no cap on how much a court could force abortion providers to pay. Moreover, because virtually anyone could file such a lawsuit, abortion providers risked being sued by thousands or even tens of thousands of plaintiffs. When there is no ambiguity in the law, the Republican justices often make something up so they can rule in favor of Republicans anyway. And yet, in Whole Women's Health v. Jackson (2021), five Republican justices ruled that the only way abortion providers could defend against these suits is to hire a small army of lawyers to contest each of these thousands of lawsuits. A segregationist state legislature could sic bounty-hunting plaintiffs on any Black parent who sends their child to an integrated public school. To be clear, I don't actually think that these justices would allow a state to segregate its public schools — but that's because the most likely explanation for Whole Women's Health is that the five Republicans who decided it were playing Calvinball. They wanted Texas to be able to ban abortion, so they reached for any argument that would support that outcome without caring about the consequences if that argument were applied to any other case. Consider, as well, the Court's decision in Medina v. Planned Parenthood (2025). One of the most important questions in US poverty law, possibly the most important question, is whether private litigants can enforce their rights under federal Medicaid law and similar statutes governing federal anti-poverty programs. An earlier case, Health and Hospital Corporation v. Talevski (2023), involved a list of requirements that Medicaid law imposes on nursing homes, including the right of patients “to be free from physical or mental abuse, corporal punishment, involuntary seclusion, and any physical or chemical restraints imposed for purposes of discipline or convenience and not required to treat the resident's medical symptoms.” Some of the federal laws governing state Medicaid programs are intended to protect patients, and thus may be enforced through those patients' private lawsuits. Others impose reporting and paperwork requirements on states, or otherwise place obligations on states and Medicaid providers that should not be enforced through private lawsuits. There have been many decades of litigation to distinguish the laws that can be enforced in court from the ones that cannot. Talevski held that federal law creates enforceable rights when it is “‘phrased in terms of the persons benefited' and contains ‘rights-creating,' individual-centric language with an ‘unmistakable focus on the benefited class. Thus, a law stating that “no state may prevent a hungry person from eating a hamburger” may be enforced in court, because it is phrased in terms of the people whom the law benefits (hungry people). A different law stating that “states may not impede access to hamburgers” would not be enforceable, because it lacks the “focus on the benefitted class” demanded by Talveski. Medina was an easy case, because the law at issue in that suit provided that “any individual eligible for medical assistance (including drugs) may obtain such assistance from any institution, agency, community pharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service.” The law focused on the persons benefited: individuals eligible for medical assistance under Medicaid. Rather than reach this obvious conclusion, however, the Republican justices delivered a garbled opinion that didn't even quote the relevant language from Talevski. And why did the Republican justices repeal this law? The answer cannot be found in case law. The most obvious explanation is they did so because Medina was a case about whether Medicaid patients may choose Planned Parenthood as their health provider. Some of the decisions discussed above are individually defensible. When Trump goes 16-for-16 on the shadow docket, when the Court invents entire legal doctrines to spite Biden, when it applies one set of rules to Democrats and another to Republicans, or when it puts off important legal questions for years, until resolving them will benefit a Republican president, those decisions cannot be explained because judges are sometimes forced to choose among multiple acceptable options. And when there is no ambiguity in the law, the Republican justices often make something up so they can rule in favor of Republicans anyway. There are structural reasons why professionals who work closest with the justices are unwilling to openly state what the Supreme Court has become. Lawyers don't want to antagonize judges and justices who may decide their cases. But it is getting harder and harder to take an honest look at the Supreme Court's recent behavior without reaching the same conclusion that Justice Jackson reached. Trump's decision to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook is a test of the Republican justices' submissiveness. The court finally lifted a two-year ban on drag performances. Don't expect the courts to keep ICE under control. The Court has a special set of rules for Trump.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK, NY — Justice Amy Coney Barrett pushed back on partisan portrayals of the Supreme Court during a conversation in Manhattan on Thursday, saying it's a “mistake” to view the justices as aligned with the political Left or Right. “Judges wear black robes because we are not partisan,” Barrett, one of three high court appointees of President Donald Trump, said. “I think the Constitution is alive and well,” Barrett said during the interview, adding, “I don't think that we are currently in a constitutional crisis.” She continued, “I think our country remains committed to the rule of law. A constitutional crisis, she said, would be marked by the collapse of the rule of law — “but that is not a place where we are.” Barrett addressed her recent high-profile clash with Jackson in the Supreme Court's emergency ruling in a case that arose from a challenge against Trump's curb to birthright citizenship, saying she would not apologize for her words toward the liberal justice appointed by former President Joe Biden. Barrett, in turn, called Jackson's opinion a “startling line of attack” and said her “extreme” arguments clashed with centuries of legal precedent. Asked about the exchange on Thursday, Barrett stood by her sharp tone, saying, “I'm not going to be spicy for the sake of being spicy, but I am pointed. There's a time and place for everything.” She added, “I attack ideas, not people,” quoting the late Justice Antonin Scalia. “What I do is a great privilege … but anybody who's paid attention to confirmation hearings in the last 25 to 30 years knows they're not a pleasant experience.” She said her family knew what they were getting into. Circuit Court of Appeals nomination, when then-California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein remarked that “the dogma lives loudly within you.” She outlined the court's approach to stare decisis, a term representative of high court precedent, noting that precedent can be overturned only when additional factors, like legal disruption or flawed reasoning, are present. Barrett cautioned when asked how the court should consider public opinion, saying, “I think prudence plays a part in deciding when to overrule precedent. But it's pretty risky to take popular opinion into account when deciding cases.” I personally worked hard not to let it make me paranoid or change how I relate to people … but it was shocking.” Barrett also revisited her views on the death penalty, which she has personally opposed for decades. But she said her moral beliefs did not disqualify her from ruling in a 2022 case involving a Boston Marathon bomber sentenced to death. “My role is simply to say: Was the law followed?” she said. “Sometimes what the law requires is in conflict with a judge's personal beliefs.” She cited the Catholic doctrine of “cooperation with evil” to explain why she did not recuse, adding, “Reviewing that sentence for consistency with the law did not trigger a moral obligation on my part.” Barrett defended her separate opinion in the recent Skrmetti v. United States case, where the court upheld a state law banning gender-transition procedures for minors. Barrett also discussed the court's Trump v. United States ruling, where the majority held that former presidents enjoy some immunity from prosecution for official acts taken while in office. But she emphasized that such immunity is “a narrow category” and does not shield presidents from accountability for private conduct. She defended the court's recent skepticism toward nationwide injunctions, saying such remedies are efficient but raise thorny separation-of-powers questions. Barrett acknowledged criticism from the political right, particularly from supporters of Trump, who have accused her of being too moderate, and in some cases referred to her as a “DEI judge” due in part to Trump's commitment to appoint a woman to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. We have a ‘need-to-know' policy,” she said, admitting that the “DEI” comment did not make the cut of material that came to her attention. “We don't share a common religion,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson told the Associated Press that agents were focused on the electric vehicle battery plant construction site. The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that agents executed a search warrant “as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other serious federal crimes.” It did not say whether anyone was detained or arrested. “We need construction to cease immediately,” the man said. “We need all work to end on the site right now.” Operations at Hyundai's EV manufacturing plant weren't stopped, a spokesperson said. “To assist their work, we have paused construction,” they added. The administration has targeted other businesses in large raids as well. Two California cannabis farm raids in July yielded more than 300 arrests. One farm worker died after sustaining injuries during the raid. The Trump administration has made deporting numerous illegal immigrants and migrants a top priority. So far, the administration has around 60,000 illegal immigrants in ICE detention, according to NBC News.</p>
