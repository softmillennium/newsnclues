                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to launch a trade investigation to "nullify" what he said were discriminatory fines being levied by Europe against U.S. tech firms such as Google and Apple. "We cannot let this happen to brilliant and unprecedented American Ingenuity and, if it does, I will be forced to start a Section 301 proceeding to nullify the unfair penalties being charged to these Taxpaying American Companies," Trump wrote on Truth Social. He issued the threat hours after Google caught a nearly $3.5 billion penalty from the European Union in a major antitrust case centered on the search giant's advertising technology business. Google CEO Sundar Pichai thanked Trump after a U.S. judge issued a favorable ruling in the landmark antitrust case against Alphabet. Pichai said he appreciated the administration's "constructive dialogue." The president complained in his social media post that Europe was "effectively taking money that would otherwise go to American Investments and Jobs." "This is on top of the many other Fines and Taxes that have been issued against Google and other American Tech Companies, in particular," Trump wrote. "Very unfair, and the American Taxpayer will not stand for it!" In a follow-up post Friday afternoon, Trump claimed that Google has previously paid $13 billion in "false claims and charges." It was unclear where that figure came from, though the company has recently faced a series of hefty regulatory fines. He also called out the EU for squeezing billions of dollars from Apple in back taxes and fines for alleged anticompetitive practices. The post claimed that Apple has been fined $17 billion, but that figure appears to include a 2024 court ruling in Ireland ordering the company to pay over $14 billion in back taxes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares of Kenvue fell more than 10% on Friday after a report that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will likely link autism to the use of the company's pain medication Tylenol in pregnant women. HHS will release the report that could draw that link this month, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. That report will also suggest a medicine derived from folate – a water-soluble vitamin – can be used to treat symptoms of the developmental disorder in some people, according to the Journal. In a statement, an HHS spokesperson said "We are using gold-standard science to get to the bottom of America's unprecedented rise in autism rates." "Until we release the final report, any claims about its contents are nothing more than speculation," they added. Tylenol could be the latest widely used and accepted treatment that Kennedy has undermined at the helm of HHS, which oversees federal health agencies that regulate drugs and other therapies. Kennedy has also taken steps to change vaccine policy in the U.S., and has amplified false claims about safe and effective shots that use mRNA technology. Kennedy has made the disorder a key focus of HHS, pledging in April that the agency will "know what has caused the autism epidemic" by September and eliminate exposures. In a statement, Kenvue said it has "continuously evaluated the science and [continues] to believe there is no causal link" between the use of acetaminophen, the generic name for Tylenol, during pregnancy and autism. The FDA website says the agency has not found "clear evidence" that appropriate use of acetaminophen during pregnancy causes "adverse pregnancy, birth, neurobehavioral, or developmental outcomes." But the FDA said it advises pregnant women to speak with their health-care providers before using over-the-counter drugs. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists maintains that acetaminophen is safe during pregnancy when taken as directed and after consulting a health-care provider. Some previous studies have suggested the drug poses risks to fetal development, and some parents have brought lawsuits claiming that they gave birth to children with autism after using it. Some research has also found no association between acetaminophen use and autism. -- CNBC's Angelica Peebles contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ahead of its IPO next week, Klarna is rolling out a return-to-office policy and explained that its new requirement is partly due to losing talent to firms that prioritize in-person working. Employees based in Stockholm, Berlin, Warsaw, and Nykøbing, are expected to come into the office three days a week starting September 29, the company informed workers in an internal Slack post Thursday, which was seen by Business Insider. Klarna's announcement comes as more Big Tech companies and startups are unveiling their return-to-office plans for workers. Last September, CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a memo that Amazon would end remote work starting at the beginning of this year. Dell also said in January that it was "retiring" hybrid work and told employees to be in the office five days a week from March.Klarna also said in the Slack post, written by the company's director of people and HR, Mikaela Mijatovic, that it tested out an office week in Stockholm during the spring. Many employees shared how much they enjoy reconnecting with colleagues, sharing ideas naturally, and working side by side, Mijatovic wrote in the message. "At the same time, we have seen some of our top talents leave for companies where in-person collaboration is a fundamental part of daily work," Mijatovic wrote. "This is a signal we cannot ignore, as our success depends on being a company where people thrive and grow together. Once Europe's most valuable startup, Klarna offers short-term financing to customers online and in stores at checkout. In 2021, it was valued at $45.6 billion, but its valuation fell to $6.7 billion in 2022 during a wider market downturn for startups. During the pandemic, Klarna implemented a hybrid work policy that allowed employees to work from home up to three days per week. In 2022, Klarna transitioned to a fully flexible work arrangement, giving employees complete flexibility to work from home or the office, with no mandatory in-office days. Klarna previously considered rolling out a three-day-a-week return-to-office policy in 2023, according to a document discovered by an employee at the Swedish fintech company, according to internal Slack posts seen by Business Insider. "The proposed RTO policy was met with backlash from some staff at the time, according to five Klarna employees BI spoke to and internal Slack comments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Roblox on Friday announced new short-video and AI features that come amid increasing lawmaker scrutiny into how the company protects children on its platform. With Roblox Moments, users 13 and older will be able to create and share video clips of their gameplay with others on a feed within the platform. ET: Roblox CEO Dave Baszucki joins CNBC TV to discuss the company's latest announcements coming out of its developer conference. Watch in real time on CNBC+ or the CNBC Pro stream. Although users can share video clips from mature games on Moments, users who do not meet the age requirements of those experiences will be unable to view them, the company said. Roblox will moderate each video shared on Moments and will allow users to "flag content that they find is inappropriate," said Matt Kaufman, Roblox safety chief. Moments is launching in a limited release on Friday. Roblox users will be able to use the artificial intelligence tools to create objects, like futuristic monster trucks, that match the aesthetics of the games users build on the platform, said Anupam Singh, Roblox's senior vice president of engineering. Those creations will also be moderated, Kaufman said. Roblox faces a number of lawsuits alleging that its design enables online predators to exploit underage victims. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill sued Roblox in August, alleging the company fails to implement robust safety protocols to "protect child users from predators." At the time, Roblox said, "any assertion that Roblox would intentionally put our users at risk of exploitation is simply untrue." The company on Wednesday announced it would expand an age estimation program that Roblox debuted in July. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google was on Friday hit with a 2.95-billion-euro ($3.45 billion) antitrust fine from European Union regulators for anti-competitive practices in its lucrative advertising technology business. It also ordered Google to "bring these self-preferencing practices to an end" and "implement measures to cease its inherent conflicts of interest along the adtech supply chain." "Today's decision shows that Google abused its dominant position in adtech harming publishers, advertisers, and consumers. This behaviour is illegal under EU antitrust rules," EU competition chief Teresa Ribera said in a statement Friday. "Google must now come forward with a serious remedy to address its conflicts of interest, and if it fails to do so, we will not hesitate to impose strong remedies." Google's global head of regulatory affairs, Lee-Anne Mulholland, said the EU decision is "wrong" and the firm will appeal. "It imposes an unjustified fine and requires changes that will hurt thousands of European businesses by making it harder for them to make money," Mulholland said. "There's nothing anticompetitive in providing services for ad buyers and sellers, and there are more alternatives to our services than ever before." The case dates back to 2021 when the EU first opened a probe into Google to assess whether the tech giant favors its own online display ad technology services. The news comes after Reuters reported earlier this week that the Commission had delayed the fine as regulators were waiting for the U.S. to cut tariffs on European cars as part of a trade deal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The outlook seems to be getting worse for job seekers. Meanwhile, a data revision showed the economy lost 13,000 jobs in June — the first month of job losses since December 2020. That loss ends the consecutive-job-growth streak that had lasted 53 months, from January 2021 through May 2025, according to Daniel Zhao, chief economist at Glassdoor, a career site. The report piles on top of other data issued this week showing a frozen labor market for job seekers, economists said. Employers have been hiring at the slowest pre-pandemic pace since about 2013. Meanwhile, layoffs have been low by historical standards, suggesting employers are in a holding pattern amid economic uncertainty and policy changes like tariffs, economists said. Of course, the unemployment rate — which is at its highest in almost four years — is still at a "perfectly healthy level" relative to historical standards, Saunders wrote. Hiring in certain sectors like healthcare and hospitality also remains "decent," Ullrich wrote. But there's risk ahead that healthcare hiring slows further amid reduced federal Medicaid and social assistance funding in coming months and years, she wrote. "That's kind of how it feels these days." While it's harder for workers to find new jobs right now, there are ways to enhance the odds of success, Woodruff-Santos said. Those relationships may help get your foot in the door when a job opportunity becomes available, she said.

Even sending emails to former college professors and teachers could be productive, Indeed's Ullrich told CNBC. It's also important to keep your skills "sharp," by staying current on new software your industry may be using, for example, Woodruff-Santos said. Show off the skills and knowledge you already have to your professional network, leveraging online platforms like LinkedIn to talk about what you do or are passionate about, she added. It's a good way to get attention from people who may not remember you. "You can create your own platform," Woodruff-Santos said. The main thing is to keep "moving forward and doing something," perhaps by getting a part-time job in the meantime or broadening your job search to sectors in which your skills are transferrable, Ullrich said. Even volunteer opportunities can look like work experience on a resume, which may show hiring managers you are adaptive, she added. Additionally, don't overlook "pivoting in place," Woodruff-Santos said. Seek out opportunities to advance internally at your current company, whether taking on more responsibility, seeking a promotion or shadowing someone to pick up new skill sets, she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There is more than enough focus on Wall Street about what the Fed will do next, and Friday's weak nonfarm payrolls report will add to expectations for a rate cut. But maybe there is not enough planning among investors about what they should do to preserve the hefty gains embedded in market portfolios since the April low gave way to a new S&P 500 record. Global equities are at all-time highs, 401(k) and IRA millionaire account numbers have surged to their own record, flows into equity ETFs are picking up, and investor sentiment data is getting "a little hotter," according to Strategas Securities' technical strategist Todd Sohn, all signs that there could be a tipping point ahead for the market where bullishness becomes its own sign of overconfidence. September has had some rocky trading days already, and its long-term track record as a market month going back decades is not good, but "the real lull," if it comes, will happen further into Q4, he said. "That's when people can get hit with a speed bump like April, maybe not as quick or as big of a drawdown," Sohn shared on this week's "ETF Edge." But he stressed that there are "no signs of massive risk yet." The market initially headed higher on Friday to yet another new record as traders bet a rate cut is coming, but then gave up those gains. Fed chair Jerome Powell has himself signaled that a rate cut may be ahead, but that isn't really signaling anything the market didn't already know, and according to Bryant VanCronkhite, Allspring Global Investments' senior portfolio manager and co-head of its special global equity team — who joined Sohn on "ETF Edge" — the market may be overpricing the odds of a Fed rate cut even with the weakening labor market. Inflation, with core CPI at 3.1% in July, remains "safely above target," he said — a reference to the Fed's longstanding policy approach of aiming for 2% inflation — and the uncertainty related to tariff impact on prices throughout the economy gives the Fed more reason to wait for more data before committing to a big change in policy. They broke down that analysis into a few key points for investors to consider. Nothing new here, but your portfolio still likely has too much techFor years, investors have been warned that mega-cap tech stocks have become too dominant in the cap-weighted S&P 500, and that problem has not gone away, with Sohn noting that the weighting of the top eight mega-cap stocks is now close to 40% of the index (in an index of 500 stocks). Nvidia, the biggest of them all, was lower on Friday, its sixth losing day out of the last seven, and on track for its worst week since April, and fourth-consecutive losing week, according to CNBC data. Sohn says the first step in dealing with tech concentration risk is for investors to make sure they don't have a core stock market index fund in addition to large-cap growth and tech stock growth funds, which in the end, are all more or less replicating the same exposure and risk profile. It should be said, this concentration warning has been issued for years and the mega-cap, tech-led stock market has mostly continued up and to the right. Nevertheless, it makes sense to evaluate a portfolio's overall concentration risk with the prospect of major changes in rate policy and overall economic conditions ahead. Sohn and VanCronkhite both say that heading into 2026 it makes sense for investors to reposition ahead of any tilt in the market cycle towards value. Sohn says that "leaves us with lots of opportunities away from tech." "Now is the time to begin shifting and broadening exposure," said VanCronkhite. "Take some capital out of the past winners, like tech and financials," he said. Where exactly to move market money, starting with health care "Buy something different" from among the "desolate" sectors of the market, Sohn said, adding that transports and small-caps are, on a relative basis at least, at attractive valuations. Health care, in particular, is a focus for both ETF strategists. It has also been a recent focus for Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. While there are significant political and cyclical issues for the health care sector, VanCronkhite described it as "being ignored" right now by the market. "There has been a mass exodus from health care," said Sohn, referring to flows out of the health care sector as its performance relative to the S&P 500 has hit "bottom-decile" on a historical basis. As a result, it would be "hard to get much worse for health care," he said. There won't be any "sustained" move in health care without a cost for "everything else." He is not betting that there is any wholesale move into health care anytime soon because that would require a breakdown in the broader market. But he says it still makes sense "as a differentiation hedge going forward, especially because no one is there."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Broadcom shares soared 11% on Friday after the chipmaker said on its earnings call that it had secured a new $10 billion customer. Following a better-than-expected earnings report late Thursday, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan told analysts that a fourth large customer had put in orders for $10 billion in custom artificial intelligence chips, which the company calls XPUs. "One of these prospects released production orders to Broadcom, and we have accordingly characterized them as a qualified customer for XPUs," Tan said. He added that the order increased Broadcom's forecast for AI revenue next year, when shipments will begin. Analysts at Mizuho, Cantor Fitzgerald and KeyBanc all said they think AI startup OpenAI is the customer. OpenAI declined to comment on the report. While Broadcom doesn't name its large web-scale customers, analysts have said dating back to last year that its first three clients were Google, Meta and TikTok parent ByteDance. "During the call, the company surprised us by noting that it had secured a $10B order from a fourth XPU customer (we believe this is OpenAI), adding significant upside to the company's three current XPU customers (Google, Meta, and ByteDance)," analysts at Cantor wrote in a note late Thursday. The stock is up about 130% in the past year, lifting Broadcom's market cap past $1.6 trillion. For the fiscal third quarter, Broadcom reported earnings and revenue that topped estimates. But news of an incoming $10 billion customer is what got Wall Street excited. Tan said on the call that "immediate and fairly substantial demand" boosts the outlook for next year, "and really changes our thinking of what 2026 would be starting to look like." The company didn't provide specific guidance for next year, but Tan suggested that growth in its AI could be above the 50% to 60% range he'd offered on the prior call. Analysts at Mizuho raised their AI revenue growth estimate for next year to 76% up from about 60%, which would bring the total to $35 billion. Total revenue for the year ending in October 2026 is expected to increase about 30% to $81.8 billion from $63.1 billion this fiscal year, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG. In addition to hardware, Broadcom has a large software business, keyed by its $61 billion acquisition of server virtualization software vendor VMware in 2023. Revenue in the infrastructure software business, which includes VMWare, rose 43% to $6.79 billion. — CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett called Friday's new jobs report number "a little bit disappointing," but added, "I expect it's going to revise up." Hassett's comments on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" came shortly after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that nonfarm payrolls rose by only 22,000 in August. That is less than one-third of the 75,000 new jobs expected by economists who were surveyed by Dow Jones ahead of the report. When Hassett was asked if he was concerned about a sluggish hiring rate, he responded with a personal anecdote. "Members of my family have been hired," he said. "Both of them started their new jobs about a week ago. Hassett later Friday told Fox News that the BLS has been "struggling with bad response rates" to surveys about jobs. He also pointed to a Goldman Sachs study on Thursday, which he said shows that August seasonal jobs reports for a decade or more have had to be revised upward by 70,000 or so jobs. President Donald Trump on Aug. 1 fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, accusing her of manipulating jobs report data for political purposes. McEntarfer was terminated hours after the BLS reported that just 73,000 nonfarm jobs were added in July, which was below market expectations. Earlier Friday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC's "Squawk Box" that BLS jobs reports will be more accurate with McEntarfer gone, because "you'll take out the people who are just trying to create noise against the president."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anthropic's Dario Amodei is doubling down on his warning to entry-level workers. "Specifically, if we look at jobs like entry-level white, you know, I think of people who work at law firms, like first-year associates, there's a lot of document review. He also said many CEOs privately view AI as a way to cut costs — not just "augment" workers. The technology, he said, is "already very good at" entry-level work and "quickly getting better now." He added that his conviction stems in part from conversations with CEOs already rolling out AI tools, many of whom have said they want to use AI to reduce head count. Amodei has been sounding the alarm bell for months. In May, he told Axios he believes AI could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level office jobs within five years, potentially pushing unemployment to 10-20%, and that industry and governments are "sugarcoating" what's coming. He's also argued that the automative wave won't be limited to back-office work. In March, Amodei said at a Council of Foreign Relations event that AI could write 90% of software code within three to six months and "essentially all" of it within a year, with human engineers increasingly focused on design constraints rather than line-by-line programming. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed Amodei's bleak outlook at VivaTech in Paris in June, saying he disagreed with "almost everything" the Anthropic chief had said and predicting AI would change jobs rather than erase them. OpenAI's Sam Altman struck a similar note, saying society won't allow half of jobs to vanish and that new, better roles will emerge. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said he sees no evidence of a near-term jobs apocalypse, while Ford CEO Jim Farley forecast that AI would replace "literally half" of US white-collar workers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The dinner guest list includes Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, alongside more than a dozen other executives from leading AI and tech firms. Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO and once the face of Trump's White House DOGE office, did not attend, though the White House said a representative for Musk would be there. Musk had a public falling out with the president earlier this year. Trump has said he thinks Musk will return to the GOP fold. The administration's new Artificial Intelligence Education task force, chaired by first lady Melania Trump, held an event earlier in the day that was attended by top executives of Google and OpenAI. Here is a list of tech leaders spotted at the White House. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, is collaborating with the White House on a $500 billion project to build more AI infrastructure. The endeavor, dubbed Project Stargate, is jointly developed by SoftBank and Oracle. "Thank you for being such a pro-business, pro-innovation president. It's a very refreshing change," Altman said to Trump over dinner. "I think it's going to set us up for a long period of leading the world, and that wouldn't be happening without your leadership." OpenAI also launched a special initiative for government adoption of AI. The US Department of Defense awarded OpenAI a $200 million contract to develop AI tools for military and national security applications. Trump once threatened to jail Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg ended a collaboration with third-party fact-checking organizations earlier this year, shortly after Trump signed an executive order banning federal officials from engaging in censorship. Earlier this year, Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, pledged to invest $600 billion in US manufacturing during Trump's push for tariffs. "I want to thank you for setting the tone such that we could make a major investment in the United States and have some key manufacturing, advanced manufacturing here," Cook said during Thursday night's dinner event. "I also want to thank you for helping companies around the world," he added. "This is a very key, key thing, and I really enjoy working the administration on those topics as well, because I think they're so important to the country. I want to thank the First Lady focusing on education." Gates again pushed for both advancements and access to healthcare and advocated for AI's role in curing diseases like sickle cell or HIV. "But I think the thing that ties my first career that I still spend some time on, because AI is so phenomenal, and my second career is innovation, and innovating in health, in areas like vaccines or gene editing, and the president and I are talking about taking American innovation to the next level to cure and even eradicate some of these diseases," Gates said. "AI, for our foundation, is that we want a doctor for everyone in Africa through AI, we want farmers to have incredible advice, and kids to have a chance to learn," Gates added. Despite disagreeing over funding cuts, Gates thanked Trump for his "incredible leadership" over the White House dinner and said that people at that table are "changing the world." Alexandr Wang, the 28-year-old former CEO of Scale AI, was in attendance. Wang joined Meta as its chief AI officer as part of the company's AI spending spree and heads Meta Superintelligence Labs. The Trump administration also recently announced negotiations with AMD and Nvidia, which involve a proposed 15% levy on GPU exports to China. David Sacks, a South African-American entrepreneur and investor in internet technology firms, was named the chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology in December 2024. He is otherwise known as the White House AI and crypto czar. Cameron Wilson is the president of Code.org, a prominent nonprofit dedicated to expanding access to K-12 computer science education in the US. As part of Google's AI education funding commitment, Code.org will receive $3 million from the company. "I think that everything that you're doing in terms of setting in place the platform where the rest of the world can not only use our technology, but trust our technology more than any other alternative is perhaps the most important issue, and you, and you and your policies are really helping a lot," Nadella added.</p>
