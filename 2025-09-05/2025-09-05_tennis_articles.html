                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the third year running, Aryna Sabalenka has played her way into the US Open final, outlasting Jessica Pegula in three sets. Pegula had her moments, but Sabalenka's 42 winners and eight aces made the difference. Once again, Aryna Sabalenka has played her way into the US Open final. On Thursday night she fought back from a set down, beating Jessica Pegula 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 with the kind of grit and serving power that has come to define her run at the top. She'll face Amanda Anisimova for the trophy on Saturday. "In this match I was actually just trying to take one step at a time," Sabalenka said afterward. The roof was closed over Arthur Ashe Stadium as the rain arrived, creating still conditions that suited both players. Pegula took full advantage early, playing a sharp, measured opening set that kept Sabalenka off balance. She limited herself to only three unforced errors, stayed aggressive on return and drew the crowd into every rally. Her game grew sharper, while Pegula's level dipped, producing nine errors in that set alone. Pegula carved out four break points but couldn't convert, as Sabalenka's serve again held firm. That reliance on her serve would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. Rubbing shoulders with tennis legends üòç@SabalenkaA üëè#USOpen pic.twitter.com/SvBdZQbs7H Pegula gave credit to the level on both sides, admitting she couldn't find the breakthrough late. "Yeah, I thought it was really high-level," she said. "I don't really know what else to say. She upped her level, started serving a lot better in the second. Then I felt like it was really even in the third. Like, there wasn't that much difference. I felt like we were both serving pretty well." Obviously executing it is a different story. If she's going to come out and I was hitting some good returns and she's going to blast first-ball winners, literally some of them on the line, I don't know what I'm supposed to do about that." I'll be just the happiest person on earth probably." For the third year running, Aryna Sabalenka has played her way into the US Open final, outlasting Jessica Pegula in three sets. Pegula had her moments, but Sabalenka's 42 winners and eight aces made the difference.</p>

A zoning Sabalenka was simply too good, defending her turf with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory that puts her in the US Open final for the third straight season. "She came up with some ridiculous shots," an incredulous Pegula said in her post-match press conference. So, yeah, it seemed like the level was really high, and we were pushing each other every single game."

So, yeah, it seemed like the level was really high, and we were pushing each other every single game." Under constant attack, the fourth-ranked American battled throughout the two-hour and five-minute battle, often from deficits. "She played incredible tennis as always," the defending champion said in her on-court interview. "Pegula had lost her last three collisions with Sabalenka, all in massive finals, including at last year on this court. She had lost seven of their nine meetings overall, each in straight sets. And as a result, this meeting was the most competitive, and compelling, of their rivalry. "She played incredible tennis as always," the defending champion said in her on-court interview.

A picture perfect pass from Jess üñºÔ∏è@JPegula | #USOpen pic.twitter.com/Q8JzAb9ASo It didn't appear to be heading in that direction from the onset. In total command of her service games, Sabalenka took a brisk, 4-2 first-set lead. The pressure on Pegula to take care of her own service games was enormous.Then, a plot twist: Pegula broke. Now she led 5-4.Riding a wave of momentum, Pegula held another time at love to cap an unexpected four-game run. The crowd, which included plenty if a minority of Sabalenka support, responded. "The crowd was insane, as always," Pegula said. "Arthur Ashe, 7:00 p.m., there is no place better to play as an American. The atmosphere is incredible, like always. "Pegula needed two things, in my mind, to make an upset possible: a fast start, and the crowd to become a factor.

Pegula served brilliantly, winning 71 percent of her first serves‚Äîjust one percentage point behind Sabalenka‚Äîand 62 percent of her second-serve points. But only converting two break points proved pivotal.¬© 2025 Getty Images But none of it fazed Sabalenka, who at 27 after three major titles may still be approaching her peak. This time, though, she followed with an easy hold.Emblematic of the entire match, Pegula didn't go away, forcing the best from her opponent. It took Sabalenka three set points, but she took this semifinal to a third set. "It maybe dipped a little bit in the second," Pegula said of her serve. "I mean, she served a lot better in the second, as well. "Then I felt like it was really even in the third." Emblematic of the entire match, Pegula didn't go away, forcing the best from her opponent.

When Sabalenka took a 2-0 lead in the decider, the pressure on Pegula's service games somehow intensified. She answered the call repeatedly, winning 18 of 22 points on serve in the third set (9 of 11 on both first and second serves), including love holds in her last four service games. "The first game, unfortunately, ended up being the difference," Pegula said of the final set, "but after that I was holding really easily and I felt like just putting so much pressure on her serve every single time. Pegula would also reach break point four times in the set, including three times in the 3-2 game.Sabalenka didn't blink.

The only time Sabalenka did blink was on her first match point: Scrambling behind the baseline, Pegula hit a defensive lob to keep her chances alive. They remained so when Sabalenka, with plenty of time, bashed an overhead into the net. "I was just, like, 'Oh, my gosh, no way it's happening. As she told TENNIS.com's David Kane, "Because I badly wanted to give myself another opportunity, another final, and I want to prove to myself that I learned those tough lessons and I can do better in the finals."

As she told TENNIS.com's David Kane, "Because I badly wanted to give myself another opportunity, another final, and I want to prove to myself that I learned those tough lessons and I can do better in the finals." She plays really fearless, and that works for her. Sabalenka gave Pegula a lifeline, but she didn't give away much else. The Buffalo, N.Y. native saved a second match point with a crisp backhand Sabalenka couldn't handle, but she not earn another break point. "I thought it was really high-level," said Pegula, who hit 21 winners against 15 unforced errors, and won just two fewer total points than Sabalenka. "I don't really know what else to say. Once again, the third time was a charm for Sabalenka.And now, she's into her third consecutive US Open final.
