                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How can data be processed at lightning speed, or electricity conducted without loss? This work, published in Science, opens new avenues for quantum electronics. Future technologies depend on high-performance materials with unprecedented properties, rooted in quantum physics. New quantum phenomena that defy established models are still being discovered today. It plays a crucial role in many phenomena at the microscopic scale of matter. Yet detecting its presence and effects remains a major challenge. ''Its presence can be revealed by observing how electron trajectories are distorted under the combined influence of quantum metric and intense magnetic fields applied to solids,'' explains Giacomo Sala, research associate in the Department of Quantum Matter Physics at the UNIGE Faculty of Science and lead author of the study. Observing this phenomenon makes it possible to characterise a material's optical, electronic and transport properties with greater precision. The research team also demonstrates that quantum metric is an intrinsic property of many materials -- contrary to previous assumptions. ''These discoveries open up new avenues for exploring and harnessing quantum geometry in a wide range of materials, with major implications for future electronics operating at terahertz frequencies (a trillion hertz), as well as for superconductivity and light-matter interactions,'' concludes Andrea Caviglia.

Scientists have bred the world's first horses with CRISPR-mediated genomic edits to enhance their muscle power and speed.Credit: Agustin Marcarian/Reuters They are the first of their species to have their DNA edited using CRISPR–Cas9, a technique that cuts the genome at a specific location to change gene expression and achieve a desired trait. The horses are clones of the prize-winning steed Polo Pureza, but they have a tweak to myostatin — a gene involved in regulating muscle development — that is designed to quicken their pace. CRISPR was used in fetal fibroblasts (connective tissue cells) to generate embryos through cloning, and then the embryos were implanted into mares. The development of these five CRISPR-edited horses ten months ago, by the non-profit research organization Kheiron Biotech in Buenos Aires, Argentina, is proving controversial among horse breeders in Argentina, where polo is extremely popular, Reuters reported on 30 August. Critics are concerned that the technology threatens people's livelihoods and that it will compromise the tradition of using selective breeding to generate elite horses. “It's cool to show that CRISPR works and you can create CRISPR-altered horses,” says Molly McCue, a veterinary clinician scientist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. “Horse[riders] often feel very strongly about breeding as an art and not a science, but really it is both together,” she adds. The CRISPR horses join a menagerie of gene-edited animals that have  wide-ranging applications — mostly with the goal of improving agriculture. Such efforts have now transformed from a research promise to a commercial reality, says Tad Sonstegard, chief scientific officer at Acceligen, a company in Eagan, Minnesota that specializes in the precision breeding of livestock. Biological engineering ethicist Jeantine Lunshof, at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, puts the rise of the technology in animals down to improvements in CRISPR techniques and “a broader acceptance of gene editing”. Its ‘PRLR-SLICK' cattle have an edit in the prolactin receptor gene that gives them shorter, slicker hair, providing tolerance to heat stress. With a similar goal, researchers in India announced the first CRISPR-edited sheep earlier this year. Disease resistance is another reason that scientists are producing CRISPR animals. Genus, a company based in Basingstoke, UK, has used CRISPR to generate pigs that contain a mutation in the CD163 gene. This makes them resistant to a virus that causes porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), which can be deadly for suckling pigs. GalSafe pigs, made by Revivicor in Blacksburg, Virginia, are designed to be a source of hypoallergenic meat. Researchers use CRISPR to inactivate the GGTA1 gene, which produces alpha-gal, a sugar molecule found in most mammals that can cause allergic reactions in humans who eat red meat.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Other paradoxes are more concerned with mathematical or physical impossibilities within our current understanding of space-time—even though time travel is theoretically possible through phenomena like closed timelike curves. Unfortunately, when it comes to the ins and outs of something immensely complicated like time travel, things are rarely so simple. In a new study, Andrew Jackson—a research associate from the School of Informatics—explores reasons beyond the scientific or technological as to why time travel appears to be impossible (at least, in this reality). “I conclude that, assuming my model, time travel is self-suppressing: the timeline is continually rewritten until it inevitably reaches a timeline with no time machines ever being constructed, “ Jackson wrote. “At this point, no further changes to the timeline are possible.” Jackson illustrates this idea with what's known as a Markov chain, named after Russian mathematician Andrey Markov, which describes a sequence of possible events wherein the probability of those events depends only on the current state. In the paper, Jackson shows that introducing time travel into any timeline would create dynamic instability that would eventually (at least, statistically) create a timeline where time travel was never invented, which is the most stable state for any timeline. The process of this continuous timeline change would, however, feel instantaneous to non-time travelers such as you and I. Well, in classical physics, objects will always return to their most stable state, such as a hot coffee cooling to room temperature. If time machines introduce temporal instability, then timelines will similarly default to the most stable state, which would be a timeline with no time machines at all. “[The paper] shows that time travel—by enabling timeline alterations—induces a dynamic instability that—with very high probability—leads to its own erasure,” Jackson wrote. Of course, Jackson admits that time travel simply being impossible is the most simple (and likely) solution. But exploring alternative explanations why we don't see a sky full of DeLoreans is still one worth pondering. “It may simply not be possible to travel through time,” Jackson wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How the Math of Shuffling Cards Almost Brought Down an Online Poker Empire Card dealers create a unique deck with each shuffle, something computers cannot replicate Although this claim sounds incredible, it's a great illustration of how quickly large numbers can creep into everyday situations—with occasionally challenging consequences, as the developers of an online poker game painfully discovered in the late 1990s. The mathematics of card shuffling is quite easy to explain. To calculate how many arrangements 52 playing cards can have, you must go through all the possible shuffles. So logically, one of the 52 cards is placed on top, and once that's determined, there are only 51 possibilities for the card below it. The next card has only 50 possible options, and so on.

And yet to find out how likely it is that another person in the world will randomly create the same sequence of cards by shuffling, it's not enough to simply calculate 1 / 52! That number simply indicates how likely it is to get one very specific shuffle of cards. There's a more subtle question to consider: How likely would it be for any two or more people in the world to randomly shuffle a deck of cards in the same way? This question is reminiscent of the birthday paradox. The reason for this apparent discrepancy is that people usually underestimate how many possible pairs of students there are. The probability that each pair of students was born on a different day then doesn't seem so high. If you want to find out how likely it is to randomly shuffle a deck of cards in the same way as any other person in the world, there are several ways to do it. This means that you first examine how likely it is that all people in the world create a completely new arrangement when mixing: the first person has a probability of 1, the second a probability of (52! Therefore, I have to rely on a very rough estimate of this probability: But you have probably shuffled cards many times in your life, not just once. So how does the result change if we assume that each person shuffles approximately 100 decks of cards in their lifetime? In other words, the odds don't change by much. Even if each person in the world shuffles a deck of cards 100 times, it is very unlikely that the same deck will appear twice. For that matter, if we consider every person who lives or has ever lived on earth—by some estimates, about 117 billion people—each of whom has shuffled a deck of cards about 100 times (which is unlikely, given that our species has not had playing cards for very long), then the probability that the same arrangement was created multiple times is less than 1.7 × 10−40 percent. This makes it clear: it is truly extremely unlikely that two people in the entire history of humanity have ever shuffled a deck of cards the same way—at least assuming they shuffled the cards with great care. is and how enormously many possibilities there are for arranging 52 cards. is not only inspiring to contemplate—it has also posed some significant practical problems for online game developers. Online poker can involve large sums of money, so it's critical that these games are as secure and fair as possible. Digital cards should be well shuffled and dealt randomly, just like real ones. But no computer has enough memory to evaluate all of these possibilities, and a perfect random number generator doesn't yet exist. Therefore, developers generally rely on algorithms that simulate card shuffling. In the late 1990s the development platform ASF Software supplied several online poker providers, such as Planet Poker, with card-shuffling algorithms. And this post caught the attention of some employees at Reliable Software Technologies, an IT company. The algorithm started with an ordered deck of cards and then swapped two cards at a time in several steps. But there are several constraints on this method. For one, the swapping mechanism was implemented such that certain card arrangements were favored and more likely to appear than others. Only about 86 million arrangements could be generated this way, the Reliable Software Technologies team discovered. “After that move, the system is ours, since searching through this tiny set of shuffles is trivial and can be done on a PC in real time,” they wrote. Recall that this was back in the 1990s, when computers were significantly less powerful than they are today. It's easy to implement and delivers satisfactory results. Of course, these algorithms are constrained in other ways—random generators simply aren't good enough to do what people can do with an actual deck. But even the most skillful human dealer cannot provide a perfect hand every time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A region in Finland displays many of the traits shared by “Blue Zones,” where residents live longer, live healthier lifestyles, and embrace living in a community more than other parts of the world. Ostrobothnia in Finland may not yet be a certified Blue Zone just yet, but researchers from Abo Akademi University believe it's well on its way. A Blue Zone is loosely defined as a geographical area in which an unusually large proportion of people live significantly longer and healthier lives than people in other parts of the world. The phenomenon is hotly debated, and some even claim it to be a myth entirely, but it continues to fascinate people worldwide. The qualifications have evolved over the years—coming to include lifestyle traits and community attitudes—but what all Blue Zones have in common is populations that consistently live notably longer lives. “Swedish-speaking Ostrobothnia,” they wrote, “showed preliminary tendencies to be a longevous Blue Zone in terms of high levels of longevity, health, and adherence to the Blue Zone lifestyle principles.” The team researched various areas in Finland and found that Swedish-speaking Ostrobothnia showed good health and adherence to the Blue Zone lifestyle. Common Blue Zone populations share lifestyle traits like eating healthy, maintaining strong community bonds, engaging in moderate physical activity, and living with a sense of purpose. But could the Blue Zone definitions be overly simplistic? This suggest that life expectancy and health may be impacted by other factors on the islands. Even though it didn't adhere the most strictly to Blue Zone lifestyle choices, with life expectancy in Ostrobothnia averaging 83.1 years—higher than the Finnish average of 81.6 years and well outpacing the global 73.1-year average—the world may still have another Blue Zone on its hands.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. [CLIP: Chris Hayes appearing on MSNBC's All In with Chris Hayes:“We're following breaking news out of the CDC, where top officials are resigning en masse.”] Feltman: As you've probably noticed, things at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are pretty chaotic right now. Last week the Department of Health and Human Services announced that CDC head Susan Monarez would no longer be leading the agency, an announcement that Monarez and her legal team had plenty to say about. On September 1 a group of nine former CDC directors and acting directors penned a guest essay in the New York Times denouncing HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership. The group of CDC veterans, who have served presidents of both major parties and collectively carry more than a century of experience at the agency, called Kennedy's recent moves “unacceptable” and said his actions should “alarm every American, regardless of political leanings.” Additionally, a group of more than 1,000 past and present HHS employees put out a letter this week calling for Kennedy to resign. Here to update us on the situation is Lauren Young, associate editor for health and medicine at Scientific American. Feltman: So big picture, what's going on at the CDC right now? Young: Yeah, so it's a bit chaotic, and a lot of it is confusing in the sense that we've been getting information rolled out, you know, minute by minute. We've had several other top officials submit resignations, and at the end of last week RFK Jr. announced an acting director for the CDC. So it's a lot of things up in the air. With these several resignations of top officials a lot of branches of the CDC are currently leaderless, so it's gonna take some time to figure out who's filling in where, and there's a lot of concern among experts on, like, how this is going to roll out with regular just functioning at the CDC, just day-to-day operations. So we're kind of sitting in a hot seat right now trying to see how this is all gonna shake out in just daily operations. Could you tell us about her background, who appointed her, how long she served and what's been happening in the last week or so? Young: Yeah, so Susan Monarez has actually been a public health figure for quite some time. She's actually served [in] multiple presidential administrations prior to this. Prior to that she was serving as the acting director, but for some time the CDC had actually been leaderless—for several months. Feltman: And so within the last few weeks we've, you know, gotten news that she was supposedly stepping down, but that's been quite legally contentious. Young: Right, so last Wednesday, during the day, the Department of Health and Human Services posted on X that Monarez was no longer CDC director. Shortly after that Monarez's lawyers, her legal team, posted a statement saying she had not received any notice that she had been fired and she was not planning on resigning or stepping down. And shortly after that [laughs] the White House spokesperson basically confirmed that she had been dismissed and had been terminated. This was confusing because then her legal team came back again and posted, “Well, actually, since the president was the one who appointed her and she is Senate-approved, only the president can be the one to dismiss her formally.” So technically speaking, and from my reporting as of Tuesday, I haven't seen anything that has indicated that the president has changed his mind or made any decisions [about] whether to reappoint her or to support the decision. But theoretically, because she is a presidential appointee and was approved by the Senate, President Trump can come in and overturn this decision. Young: Yeah, so far there's been four big-name resignations of several different branches, and I'll also mention, too, there was a huge walkout on the, the subsequent day that all of this has happened. So a lot upset amongst all staff, even among these top officials. And that's huge because this year we saw one of the highest years of pediatric deaths from influenza, so it's really, you know, terrifying that we have one of the top leaders who's resigned from that position. And we've also seen the CDC chief medical officer resign. So those are just a few of [the] folks who've decided to step down from their positions. A big theme has been just the sheer amount of misinformation and disinformation that's come out ... That's been, to me, one of the biggest themes. A lot of the, you know, just sudden, confusing explanations around vaccination schedules. There was a lot of citations, too, of the measles outbreak and, again, some confusing information about how you should be treated for it, about vaccinations. Feltman: You know, I think some listeners might hear that these experts are resigning and think, you know, “How could they leave an organization that they feel like is in so much trouble?” And I think the point that [the experts] seem to be making is: the CDC has drifted so far from its mission statement and become such a chaotic, you know, misinforming, disinforming organization that they don't believe they can help public health by staying there. [CLIP: Debra Houry appearing on PBS NewsHour: “I thought my voice and the voice of my colleagues that also resigned with me would be more powerful on the outside.”] Young: And that it really just was a tipping point. Another thing she mentioned—and I've seen this, too, from several reports—[with] some of the violence that's been taking place against public health and directly against CDC's staff, you know, they are fearful of speaking out, and they feel that they have targets on their backs. Feltman: Well, and I know you talked to a couple of folks who are experts in the public health space. Young: Yeah, so I've spoken to a couple public health experts. And he also mentioned, he was like, you're seeing these people leaving because they've essentially just had enough, you know? They've had enough of trying to push for the evidence, following where the data's leading them but then not being listened to. I've been hearing a lot of that in the conversation. Another person I talked to, Jennifer Nuzzo, who's an epidemiologist and the director at the Pandemic Center at Brown University, she's really concerned about how the lack of cohesion in these leadership spaces, in these public health agencies, what they are saying to other nations. The emergence of that threat is potentially growing, and what she told me, which I think really sits [at the heart of the issue], is: “No one is home to watch out for health threats to the nation, and no one will be there to respond.” And, you know, these are what our public health agencies do; they're looking out for us 24/7, whether that's a foodborne-illness outbreak, whether that's measles, whether that is a biological threat. So I think that's something that I know all these experts on the outside and on the inside are thinking about right now. So he's going to be, right now, the acting director of the CDC, and like Monarez [O'Neill is] also not a physician. He was a Silicon Valley investor and entrepreneur; worked in, like, aging, longevity spaces; and during the pandemic he was pretty critical of the CDC's response. So we're just gonna have to wait and see what happens. Feltman: Thanks so much for coming on to talk us through this, Lauren.

Nature Materials (2025)Cite this article Within most tissues, the extracellular microenvironment provides mechanical cues that guide cell fate and function. Changes in the extracellular matrix such as aberrant deposition, densification and increased crosslinking are hallmarks of late-stage fibrotic diseases that often lead to organ dysfunction. Biomaterials have been widely used to mimic the mechanical properties of the fibrotic matrix and study pathophysiologic cell function. However, the initiation of fibrosis has largely been overlooked, due to challenges in recapitulating early stages of disease progression within the native extracellular microenvironment. Here, using visible-light-mediated photochemistry, we induced local crosslinking and stiffening of extracellular matrix proteins within ex vivo mouse and human lung tissue. In ex vivo lung tissue of epithelial cell lineage-traced mice, local matrix crosslinking mimicked early fibrotic lesions that increased alveolar epithelial cell mechanosensing, differentiation, and nascent protein deposition and remodelling. However, the inhibition of cytoskeletal tension, mechanosensitive signalling pathways or integrin engagement reduced epithelial cell spreading and differentiation. Our findings emphasize the role of local extracellular matrix crosslinking and nascent protein deposition in early stage tissue fibrosis and have implications for ex vivo disease modelling and applications to other tissues.

Since Hans Driesch's pioneering work in 1891, it has been known that animal embryos can develop into complete individuals even when divided. However, the developmental processes and molecular mechanisms enabling this self-organization remain poorly understood. In this study, we revisit Driesch's experiments by examining the development of isolated 2-cell stage blastomeres in the sea urchin, Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus. Contrary to intact embryos, these isolated blastomeres initially form a flat, single layer of dividing cells that eventually round up to be a blastula. Live imaging and knockdown experiments reveal that actomyosin activity at the basal side of the cells and septate junctions drives this process. Intriguingly, we observed temporal disorganization of the anterior-posterior (A-P) and dorsal-ventral (D-V) axes, where the original A-P poles come into contact after sphere shape formation. The disrupted A-P axis is subsequently corrected as the embryos employ the Wnt/β-catenin signaling mechanisms assumed to be used in intact embryos to re-establish a normal axis. These findings suggest that axis re-organization through pre-existing developmental mechanisms is essential for the successful regulative development of divided embryos. In 1891, Hans Driesch demonstrated that isolated 2-cell and 4-cell stage sea urchin blastomeres can each develop into a complete individual, highlighting the remarkable self-organizing capacity of early embryos1. Following this seminal discovery, researchers observed similar self-organization abilities in early embryos across various taxa2,3,4,5,6. Even in humans, this phenomenon underpins the formation of identical twins when early embryos split accidentally. In contrast, animals relying on mosaic development, where maternal factors predetermine cell fate during early stages, lack this self-organization capacity (e.g., comb jellyfish, solitary ascidians, tusk shells)7. Despite Driesch's experiments being referenced in textbooks for over a century, the molecular mechanisms governing this self-organizing ability remain poorly understood. Moreover, detailed morphological and developmental analyses of separated early embryos are scarce (Fig. Echinoderms, especially sea urchins, offer an ideal model system to study self-organization due to their external fertilization, ease of manipulation, and transparency—making them suitable for high-resolution live imaging. Additionally, the extensive genomic and gene regulatory data available for sea urchins further supports their utility in unraveling these mechanisms8,9,10,11,12. Remarkably, sea urchins were the original model system used by Driesch to demonstrate self-organization. While there is one report on isolated blastomere development in sea stars13, detailed studies on sea urchins remain elusive, and this gap must be addressed. Eggs were fertilized, then 2-cell stage embryos were divided into half after removing fertilization envelope. Developmental stages specific to halved embryos were named as flat, cup and sphere. Images shown are representative of nine independent experiments performed with similar results. Here, we revisit Driesch's classic experiments using modern molecular biology techniques to define the self-organization phenomenon in sea urchins. Focusing on the Japanese species Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus, we describe the developmental trajectory of isolated 2-cell stage blastomeres, with particular attention to the molecular forces driving morphological changes. Initially, we examined the morphology of H. pulcherrimus embryos bisected at the 2-cell stage (Fig. During early cleavage, each isolated blastomere followed a cleavage pattern similar to that of intact embryos (Fig. For example, at the 16-cell stage, when intact embryos formed 8 mesomeres, 4 macromeres and 4 micromeres, halved embryos generated 4 mesomeres, 2 macromeres and 2 micromeres. However, after the 16-cell stage, while intact embryos continued cleaving to form a blastula (Fig. 1p–s), the halved embryos unexpectedly developed a flat, plate-like structure instead (Fig. The edges of this flattened structure then lifted, forming a cup-like shape (Fig. 1k), which gradually closed at the opening (Fig. 1l, m), eventually creating a sphere (Fig. At this stage, the blastocoel was difficult to discern in the spherical embryos. Ultimately, the halved embryos developed a clear blastocoel (Fig. 1o), becoming miniature versions of an intact blastula (Fig. Given the essential role of the extracellular matrix (ECM), hyaline layer, which we removed during blastomere isolation, in normal sea urchin development14,15, we considered whether its absence caused the irregular morphology. However, this possibility was ruled out, as isolated blastomeres with an intact hyaline layer exhibited the same morphological changes (Supplementary Fig. This indicates that the observed developmental process is an intrinsic feature of bisected embryos. We named these distinct stages of halved embryo morphology as flat, cup and sphere (Fig. Although the development of halved embryos progressed more slowly than intact embryos, once the blastula was formed, the subsequent developmental processes—such as mesenchyme cell ingression, gastrulation, and pluteus formation—proceeded in a manner similar to that of intact embryos (Supplementary Fig. During our observations, we identified two key biological questions regarding the developmental re-organization of halved embryos. First, how does the flat morphology transition into a sphere? Second, how is a normal body axis established in the resulting sphere, given that the original axis could be disrupted during this shape transformation? To investigate the mechanism driving the flat-to-sphere transition, we examined whether this morphological change was accompanied by additional cell proliferation. Our analysis showed no significant difference in cell number between intact embryos and double-counted halved embryos, indicating that the shape change is not due to increased cell proliferation but rather a result of cell shape changes (Fig. To further understand these cell shape dynamics, we closely observed the transition from cup to sphere using the membrane probe FM1-43 (Fig. Similar to intact blastulae, both the cup-shaped and sphere-shaped halved embryos were composed of a single layer of cells. However, the cells in halved embryos were notably more elongated along the apical-basal axis compared to those in intact embryos, forming a distinct cone-like shape (indicated by magenta double-headed arrows in Fig. The cell length in cup-shaped halved embryos was significantly greater than that in control embryos at 8 hours post fertilization (hpf) (corresponding to the flat stage of halved embryos), 10 hpf (cup stage equivalent), and 14 hpf (blastula stage equivalent) (Supplementary Fig. Therefore, cell elongation along the apicobasal axis appears to be a specific feature of halved embryos. During the subsequent transition from sphere to blastula, the elongated cells shortened to adopt a columnar shape, similar to those found in intact blastulae (Fig. This series of coordinated cell shape changes underlies the morphological re-organization from a flat structure to a spherical blastula-like form in halved embryos. a, b Cell number comparison between intact embryos and double-counted halved embryos at flat and sphere shape stage. Statistical significance was determined using the two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test. [a control vs half x2: p value = 0.88, N = 4, b control vs half x2: p value = 0.087, N = 4].

Results are based on three succeeded live-imaging. k Cell length comparison along apicobasal direction between each stage of halved embryos and control (N = 3). Statistical significance was assessed using a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test for multiple comparisons. All tests were two-sided and adjusted for multiple comparisons (control vs cup: p = 0.001, control vs sphere: p = 0.001, control vs Bl: p = 0.061). l–o Actin polymerization and myosin II activity inhibition in halved embryos with cytochalasin D (cytoD) and (-)-blebbistatin (bleb), respectively [N = 2 in (l, m) and N = 3 in (n, o)]. Percentage in images indicates the ratio of individuals that showed the same morphology with pictures at the timing of observation. Bl blastula, hpf hours post fertilization. Outliers are plotted as individual points. To identify the factor(s) regulating the drastically morphological transition from flat to spherical shape, we first perturbed several signaling pathways known to play key roles in embryonic development. This suggested that the morphological change in halved embryos might be driven by cell-autonomous mechanisms. We therefore focused on the cytoskeleton and performed live imaging of actin dynamics in halved embryos by injecting lifeact-mCherry mRNA (Fig. To visualize the nuclei and determine the apicobasal axis, we co-injected histone2B-Venus mRNA, as nuclei localize to the apical side of cells in normal sea urchin blastulae16. In control blastula, actin accumulation was observed both apical and basal side and the accumulation at apical side is stronger than that at the basal side (Fig. To determine if this basal actin polymerization is essential for the morphological change, we treated halved embryos with cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, and (-)-blebbistatin, an inhibitor of myosin-II ATPase, from the flat stage (Fig. While over 90% of control halves successfully formed a spherical shape, 100% of cytochalasin D-treated halves were arrested at the cup stage and never formed spheres. Additionally, 94% of blebbistatin-treated embryos exhibited significant delays in sphere formation, resulting in incomplete spherical blastulae (Supplementary Fig. In both treatments, cell elongation along the apicobasal axis was not observed. These results suggest that actomyosin-generated forces on the basal side of cells are crucial for cell elongation along the apicobasal axis, and this cell shape change is essential for the proper formation of the blastula. To identify additional factors involved in the shape transition of halved embryos, we examined the role of septate junctions, which are septa-like structures between cells that function as occluding junctions in invertebrates17. In Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, septate junctions are formed at the 8th cleavage stage18. Notably, the timing of the flat-to-cup shape transition in halved embryos coincided with the initiation of septate junction formation, prompting us to investigate the role of septate junction-related genes, particularly Tetraspanin19. in situ hybridization revealed that tetraspanin was ubiquitously expressed across the entire embryo in the flat stage, and this expression persisted through the sphere stage (Fig. This expression pattern was identical to that in control embryos. To assess whether septate junctions are required for the shape transition in halved embryos, we attenuated tetraspanin function using a morpholino anti-sense oligo (MO) and analyzed the resulting phenotypes (Fig. While 82% of control halved embryos successfully transitioned to the sphere stage, only 8% of tetraspanin-deficient halved embryos achieved this transition. Most tetraspanin-deficient halved embryos exhibited a “bumpy” flat shape, where cells were misaligned and failed to form a single cell layer. By 24 hpf, a small percentage of tetraspanin-deficient embryos eventually adopted a spherical shape. A similar phenotype was observed in halved embryos where ZO-1, another component of septate junctions19, was knocked down using a specific morpholino (Supplementary Fig. These results strongly suggest that the mechanical forces provided by septate junctions contribute significantly to the shape transition from flat to spherical in halved embryos. Based on these observations, we identified two molecular mechanisms regulating the shape transition in halved embryos: actomyosin constriction and the adhesive force of septate junctions. Surprisingly, neither mechanism relies on the signaling pathways typically associated with body axes formation. Instead, shape transition depends on an intrinsic system. The cells themselves actively adhere to each other via septate junctions, and this strong cellular adhesion facilitates the morphological change from a flat to a spherical structure as the cells reorganize to form a cohesive, unified shape. Next, to characterize the gene expression feature of halved embryos, we performed bulk RNA-seq and compared the gene expression profile between intact embryos and halved embryos by principal component analysis (PCA) (Fig. Halved embryos were sampled at 4 stages: cup, sphere, 6-8 hours after sphere formation and early gastrula. Intact embryos were sampled at 2-cell stage and corresponding timing with each stage of halved embryos. At cup shape stage, the gene expression profile of control and halved embryos were similar. At the sphere stage, a large difference was detected between control and the halves. Surprisingly, the difference between control and halves was rapidly compensated 6-8 hours after the sphere shape formed. This result implies that some critical event for accomplishing self-organization occurred after sphere formation. We especially focused on genes which is involved in body axes formation and compared gene expression amount of 5 anterior specification genes (foxQ2, homeobrain, six3, sFRP1/5, dkk-1), 4 posterior specification genes (wnt8, wnt1, frizzled5/8, blimp1) and 4 lateral ectoderm specification gene (nodal, lefty, chordin, bmp2/4) between control and halves, and the only detectable difference was foxQ2 expression amount (at cup stage: cup/control = 4.63). Therefore, we focused on foxQ2 and traced the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis formation in halved embryos. We analyzed gene expression patterns in halved embryos using in situ hybridization chain reactions with foxQ2 (an anterior marker) and alx1 or foxA (posterior markers) (Fig. In intact embryos, foxQ2 and foxA were expressed at opposite poles, and halved embryos initially exhibited similar patterns with control (Fig. However, immediately after the halved embryos formed a spherical shape, foxQ2 and foxA were expressed in close proximity, almost adjacent to each other (Fig. 3e), indicating a complete disruption of the A-P axis. Remarkably, six hours later, the expression sites of foxQ2 and foxA had returned to opposite poles, resembling normal A-P axis (Fig. These observations show that the A-P axis temporarily collapses when the spherical shape was formed but is subsequently reorganized to restore normal axis patterning. a PCA analysis in halved embryos (triangles) and control (circles).

Both lateral view (q, v) and cup rim view (inserted images in q, v) were observed at cup shape. Images shown are representative of ten independent experiments performed with similar results. Bl blastula, MG mid gastrula, hpf hours post fertilization. Since no aberrant cell proliferation was observed during the formation of the spherical shape (Fig. 2a, b), we hypothesized that A-P axis re-organization occurs through one of three possible mechanisms: (1) shifting the anterior end specification site from its original to its final position, (2) shifting the posterior end specification site from its original to its final position, or (3) shifting both the anterior and posterior end specification sites to their final positions. To determine the most likely scenario, we labeled the animal-pole cells of halved flat-stage embryos with DiI (Fig. In intact sea urchin embryos, animal-pole cells typically contribute to the anterior end region12. However, in 78.8% of halved embryos, the labeled cells were found in the lateral ectoderm, suggesting that the anterior end was specified in a different position from the original. We also performed the same labeling experiment on posterior cells of halved embryos (Veg2 lineage, which give rise to secondary mesenchyme cells and archenteron cells12). In 75% of halved embryos, the labeled cells contributed to the archenteron or became secondary mesenchyme cells at the gastrula stage (Supplementary Fig. 7), indicating that the posterior region was specified at its original site. These results suggest that A-P axis re-organization is primarily accomplished through the shift of the anterior end specification site from its original to its final position, while the posterior end maintains its original position. To investigate whether the Wnt/β-catenin, which is the first and the most responsible signaling for A-P patterning20,21, plays a role in the shifting of the anterior end specification site in halved embryos, we blocked the pathway by injecting mRNA encoding a truncated form of cadherin's cytoplasmic domain (Δcad). This truncated cadherin prevents β-catenin from entering the nucleus and functioning as a transcription factor22,23. As a result, the labeled cells remained at the most anterior end, indicating that the animal-pole cells retained their original fate (Fig. This result strongly suggests that endogenous Wnt/β-catenin signaling is necessary for the anterior end shift in halved embryos. Intriguingly, at the timing of the anterior-fate shifting in halved embryos, Wnt/β-catenin originally does not play a role in restricting the anterior end region in intact embryos. Thus, we hypothesized that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is reactivates irregularly in halved embryos at this stage. To test this, we performed live imaging of halved embryos injected with β-catenin-Venus mRNA, which allowed us to trace where Wnt/β-catenin signaling was active22,24. In these embryos, we observed a temporal nuclear β-catenin signals in a region adjacent to the original posterior site after the halved embryos formed a sphere (white asterisks in Fig. To confirm whether canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling is truly reactivated after the embryo has reached the sphere stage—at a time point when it would normally be too late to suppress foxQ2, we treated embryos with the Wnt inhibitor C59 from cup shape stage and analyzed the expression patterns of foxQ2 and foxA at blastula stage. While C59 does not achieve the same level of canonical Wnt inhibition as ∆cadherin injection in H. pulcherrimus, it has a relatively strong inhibitory effect and was thus used in this experiment. In control halved embryos, 100% (16/16) showed polar expression of foxQ2 and foxA at opposite ends (Fig. In contrast, 44% (7/16) of C59-treated halved embryos exhibited foxQ2 and foxA expression in adjacent regions, indicating a failure of foxQ2 to shift to the opposite pole after initial proximity to foxA after being formed sphere (Fig. Overall, these results indicate that a transient Wnt/β-catenin signal plays a crucial role in shifting the anterior end region from its original to the final position, facilitating the re-organization of the A-P axis in halved embryos following sphere formation. In addition, non-canonical Wnt signaling has been reported to restrict anterior neuroectodermal fate downstream of canonical Wnt in normal sea urchin embryos20,25, we next investigated whether this pathway is involved in anterior fate shifting in halved embryos. We inhibited c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a key component of non-canonical Wnt signaling, using the JNK inhibitor SP600125, and observed the positional relationship between foxQ2-positive anterior regions and foxA-positive posterior regions in halved embryos (Supplementary Fig. In 97% of control halves, the anterior and posterior regions were located at opposite poles, similar to intact embryos. However, in 27% of JNK-inhibited embryos, the anterior and posterior regions were adjacent to each other, suggesting that non-canonical Wnt signaling is partially required for anterior end shifting. These findings suggest that signaling pathways, which normally restrict the anterior-most region in intact embryos, are also utilized during A-P axis re-formation in halved embryos. Considering the organization of body axes, we next focused on the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis. During sea urchin embryogenesis, D-V axis formation is regulated by members of the TGF-β superfamily, including Nodal, Lefty, Chordin, and BMP2/426,27,28. To determine whether the D-V axis forms normally in halved embryos, we performed in situ hybridization with nodal and lefty (Fig. In halved embryos, although the precise expression position was challenging to completely identify in the flat stage, we detected biased nodal expression. Intriguingly, from the cup stage onward, nodal was ubiquitously expressed across the entire embryo, except at the anterior and posterior ends, this pattern that persisted until the spherical stage. Four hours after the halved embryos formed a sphere, nodal expression became re-biased toward the future ventral side, resembling that of intact embryos. We also observed nuclear phosphorylated-Smad2/3 (pSmad2/3), a downstream transcription factor of the Nodal signaling pathway29, throughout the embryo at the cup stage, except at the anterior and posterior ends (Supplementary Fig. 9), supporting the notion that ectopically expressed Nodal functions as a signaling ligand. The expression pattern of lefty closely mirrored that of nodal during the cup stage, though it was less prominent immediately after the embryos reached the sphere stage; however, the precise mechanism responsible for this transient reduction remains undetermined in the current study (Fig. To investigate BMP signaling, we performed immunohistochemistry to detect phosphorylated-Smad1/5/8 (pSmad1/5/8), a transcription factor downstream of BMP29, which marks the region where BMP2/4 functions (Supplementary Fig. In halved embryos, pSmad1/5/8 signals were first observed at 16 hpf, coinciding with the timing in intact embryos, and were localized on one side, as in normal embryos. Notably, no pSmad1/5/8 signals were detected before the embryos reached the sphere stage (Supplementary Fig. These findings suggest that the D-V axis is initially present in halved embryos and is later reorganized after the spherical shape is established. Our data revealed that H. pulcherrimus 2-cell halved embryos undergo a unique developmental process, progressing through flat, cup and sphere stages (Figs. This specific sequence had never been reported in any sea urchin species, making it an intriguing discovery for us. We also observed this developmental pattern in other sea urchins, such as S. purpuratus and Strongylocentrotus intermedius, when embryos were halved at the 2-cell stage (Supplementary Fig. In contrast, 2-cell blastomeres of Temnopleurus reevesii developed directly into a blastula without passing through the flat or cup stages. A key difference in T. reevesii development is the lack of compaction until the 60-cell stage, while other echinoderms exhibit strong cell-cell adhesion from early cleavage stages30. Further studies with additional echinoderm species will help elucidate whether this developmental process is completely common across the phylum. Interestingly, previous research demonstrated that 2-cell stage sea urchin embryos, in which one blastomere was killed while maintaining the membrane structure, could still form a blastula31 (Supplementary Fig. This led to the hypothesis that sea urchin embryos “actively” recognize their individual boundaries through cell-cell signal communication31. At first glance, the pronounced morphological changes from the flat or cup to the sphere in our study might suggest an ‘active' reorganization of individual cell boundaries, contributing to the formation of the spherical blastula body through cell-cell signaling. However, no major signaling pathways were involved in this shape transition and there is no difference between control and halves in gene expression profile at cup shape stage (Fig. Therefore, we propose that the establishment of embryonic boundaries during development is governed primarily by cell-autonomous mechanisms in halved embryos, rather than by active cell–cell signaling. The observed morphological outcome—the formation of a spherical blastula—appears to emerge as a cumulative result of individual cells autonomously regulating their own shape and behavior. In this view, the overall halved embryo shape is not sculpted by coordinated, long-range intercellular signaling, but rather by the local, self-organized activities of individual cells acting independently, yet coherently. a Schematic summary of halved H. pulcherrimus development. Grey bars indicate the time frame that each event which we argued in this article occurs. b Two crucial events in sea urchin self-organization which we discussed. (Upper row) Making sphere shape: At the timing for shape transition from flat to cup, actomyosin activity at the basal side of the cells (red) contribute to cells elongate along apicobasal axis direction and make cells cone chape. Apex of each cell is bundled and becomes the center of the embryo. Simultaneously, septate junction (blue) gives each cell the ability to adhere each other on the lateral side. As a result, the free edge of the cup can bind each other and form sphere. (Lower row) A-P axis re-organization: At the cup shape stage, presumptive anterior pole (magenta) and posterior pole (green) are in their original positions. When sphere shape is formed, presumptive anterior and posterior region are temporarily placed very close together and anterior-posterior (A-P) axis is temporarily disturbed. Triggered by anterior and posterior pole contact, Wnt/ß-catenin signal is newly activated at adjacent region of original posterior pole, and the signal makes the anterior-most region shift to the opposite side. Finally proper A-P axis is formed. In sea urchin and sea star eggs, the first cleavage establishes apical-basal polarity, where the apical side adheres to the ECM and the basal side to other cells. This polarity is maintained even when 2-cell stage blastomeres are separated32,33,34,35, indicating that apical-basal polarity maintenance is a cell-autonomous event. Our data suggest that septate junctions play a crucial role in the transition from flat to sphere shape in halved sea urchin embryos (Fig. Septate junctions are rapidly formed following cell reaggregation, as seen in hydra regeneration from dissociated cells36, and dissociated cells from sea urchin blastulae can also regenerate a whole organism from cell aggregates37,38. Although the precise mechanisms of septate junction assembly in sea urchin embryos remain unclear, it is plausible that this process is cell-autonomously initiated in early development. In addition, halved embryos never fuse to other halves after they make sphere. Thus, we propose that septate junctions are part of a cell-autonomous mechanism determining the individual boundary in halved embryos. We also suggest that actomyosin activity at the basal side of cells contributes to the dynamic morphological changes in halved embryos by facilitating cell shape alterations, although we cannot completely rule out a potential contribution from apical actin. Since extreme cell elongation along the apical-basal axis was not observed in halved sea star embryos6,13, nor in other sea urchin species (Supplementary Fig. 11), we hypothesize that the cell elongation observed in H. pulcherrimus halved embryos may be a species-specific feature. In addition, it is implied that actin accumulation on basal side of the cell is halved embryos specific response because actin accumulation at the apical side was stronger than the basal side in normal blastula (Fig. We cannot definitively determine whether the accumulation of actin at the basal side is cell-autonomous. However, it is implied that halved embryos utilize some intrinsic mechanisms to regulate the actin accumulation and cell shape change because halved embryos could make sphere with any signaling perturbation (Supplementary Fig. This research revealed that the temporarily disrupted A-P axis during the flat-to-sphere transition is gradually restored afterward. This study provides the first experimental evidence of the molecular mechanism underlying axis re-formation during self-organization. 3o–x, nodal and lefty is broadly expressed in the lateral ectoderm, even after halved embryos form a sphere. Given that FoxQ2 selectively represses the autoregulatory loop of nodal but does not block its initial expression21, we hypothesize that the Nodal/FoxQ2-free region is formed by the positional shift of the foxQ2-expressing anterior end in response to posterior signals. Support for this model comes from the observation that BMP2/4 becomes active after sphere formation (Supplementary Fig. While the A–P axis does not directly instruct D–V specification, its proper reconstruction appears to create a necessary permissive condition for the initiation of D–V polarity. One possible mechanistic explanation for this is based on previous studies showing that the D–V axis can only be established once the Nodal repressor, FoxQ2, is cleared from the ectoderm21. During the ambiguous period of A–P axis re-formation, FoxQ2 expression is transiently detected and then disappears. Although FoxQ2 does not prevent the initial activation of nodal, its presence is thought to interfere with the autoregulatory loop required for sustained Nodal expression21. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the autoregulatory loop of Nodal—required for robust D–V axis formation26—can only be stably activated after the anterior shift and clearance of FoxQ2 have been completed. In this way, A–P axis re-formation indirectly triggers D–V axis establishment by ensuring a cellular environment conducive to stable Nodal expression. A similar phenomenon has been observed in Xenopus laevis, where dorsal and ventral ends are juxtaposed during wound healing, and both ends shift from their original positions when blastulae are bisected39. Since β-catenin is stabilized at the dorsal end by cortical rotation in Xenopus, inducing a morphogen gradient along the D-V axis40, it is possible that a similar mechanism triggers self-organization in sea urchins. In sea urchins, β-catenin is stabilized at the vegetal pole, and the adjacency of the anterior and posterior ends initiates self-organization. Indeed, stable A-P axis formation is important for D-V axis formation, since A-P axis deficient halved embryos, in which ∆cadherin was injected into, are covered with long and immotile cilia (Supplementary Fig. 13) as in reported ∆cad embryos, indicating that they are composed only of anterior neuroectoderm20. The reason for the broad nodal and lefty expression during the cup and sphere stages is unclear and should be addressed in future studies. One report suggest that redox state regulate the D-V axis formation41. Live imaging of mitochondria distribution in halved embryos may provide further insights into this process. Based on the molecular mechanisms of self-organization revealed in this study, we define self-organization as the process in which axes and molecular gradient information is reorganized within a newly defined individual boundary, without de-differentiation, in response to signals from the organizer. This study not only demonstrates the first experimental proof of axes re-formation during self-organization but also highlights the robustness and flexibility of embryonic developmental programs. The fact that sea urchin embryos, and potentially other species, can autonomously re-establish their developmental axes and molecular gradients in response to disruptions suggests that these systems are hardwired for resilience. This intrinsic ability to re-form body axes without external cues points to the evolutionary significance of self-organization, likely as a safeguard against environmental or developmental perturbations. Understanding these molecular mechanisms provides new insights into how early embryonic systems maintain developmental fidelity. Moreover, the parallels between sea urchin and Xenopus embryos hint at conserved evolutionary pathways regulating self-organization, possibly extending to other deuterostomes. In a broader context, our findings may have implications for regenerative biology and artificial tissue engineering, where inducing or harnessing similar self-organizing principles could be critical for tissue repair and organ regeneration. The discovery of species-specific features, such as the cell elongation observed in H. pulcherrimus, further suggests that there may be as-yet-undiscovered diversity in self-organization mechanisms across species. Investigating these variation and/or similarity in depth could open new avenues for understanding developmental plasticity and robustness, providing valuable insights into both evolutionary biology and biomedical applications. Adults of Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus and Temnopleurus reevesii were collected around Shimoda Marine Research Center (University of Tsukuba) and Marine and Coastal Research Center (Ochanomizu University) under the special harvest permission of prefectures and the Japan Fishery cooperative. Strongylocentrotus intermedius were gifted for experimental purposes from Chirippu Fishery Cooperative, and the experiment using Strongylocentrotus purpuratus was supervised by Prof. Gary Wessel (Brown University, Providence, RI, USA). Gametes were collected by injecting 0.5 M KCl into the body cavity. The embryos were cultured in plastic dishes or glass beakers filled with filtered natural seawater (FSW) containing 50 µg/ml of kanamycin sulfate (Nacalai Tesque Inc., Kyoto, Japan) and kept at 15 °C until an appropriate stage. FM1-43 FX (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was treated with a final 4 µM in FSW from 1 h before observation. Cytochalasin D (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Co., Osaka, Japan), (-)-blebbistatin (FUJIFILM), cyclopamine (FUJIFILM), and 4-aminopyridine (FUJIFILM) were treated with 2 µM, 30 µM, 6.25 µm, and 2 mM, respectively, from the flat or cup shape stage. Actinomycin D (FUJIFILM) and cycloheximide (FUJIFILM) were treated with 25 µg/µl and 2 mM from 20 min after fertilization. U0126 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and Y27632 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) were added with 10 µM and 1 mM from 2-cell stage. C59 (Funakoshi Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was treated from the cup stage at 0.8 mM. SP600126 (FUJIFILM) was treated from the sphere shape stage at 2 µM. All reagents were diluted with FSW, and the same volume of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as a negative control. For cell counting in embryos, the embryos were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in FSW for 10 minutes and washed several times with PBS-T ([PBS] Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan 0.1% Tween-20). Nuclei were then stained with DAPI. The embryos were observed under a confocal microscope, and the number of cells was determined. To avoid miscounting, nuclear signals were marked digitally during analysis. All gene information is available at HpBase (Genome & Transcriptome database for H. pulcherrimus8). Tetraspanin (tspn: HPU_14020) and ZO-1 (HPU_12399) of H. pulcherrimus were cloned with primers written in below. Forwerd primers have EcoRI sequence, and Reverse primer have XhoI sequence for inserting PCR products to pCS2+ vector with in-fusion cloning kit (TAKARA BIO INC., Shiga, Japan). Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed as previously described42. Embryos were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in FSW for overnight at 4 °C. Fixed embryos were washed with MOPS buffer (0.1 M MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) for 7 min x 7 times, then pre-hybridized with hybridization buffer (70% formamide, 0.1 M MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 1% BSA) at 50 °C for 1 h. Samples were hybridized with 0.4 ng/µl Digoxygenin (Dig)-labeled RNA probes in hybridization buffer at 50 °C for 5–7 days. Subsequently, samples were washed with MOPS buffer 7 min x 7 times and blocked with 2.5% skim milk (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) in MOPS buffer at room temperature (R.T) for 1 h. Specimens were incubated for overnight at 4 °C with 1/1500 anti-Dig antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (AP) (Roche Holding AG, Basel, Switzerland) in MaxBlot Solution 2 (MBL, Tokyo, Japan). Samples were washed with MOPS buffer, and MOPS buffer were substituted with AP buffer (0.1 M Tris, pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 1 mM Levamisole) by 2 times for 7 min each. Dig was detected by the reaction of AP with Staining solution (10% dimethylformamide, 3.15 µl/ml NBT and 2.45 µl/ml BCIP [Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA] diluted in AP buffer) in the dark until the signal was visualized under the microscope. Whole-mount in situ hybridization chain reaction was performed as described in previous study43 with small modification. Immunohistochemistry was also performed as previously described42. Fixed embryos were washed with PBS-T 7 min x5 times and blocked with 5% lamb serum (ThermoFisher Scientific) in PBS-T for 1 h. Specimens were incubated for overnight at 4 °C with each antibody in MaxBlot Solution 1 (MBL). Anti-FoxQ2 (in-house made44), anti-pSmad2/3 (Abcam) and anti-pSmad1/5/8 (Cell Signaling Technology) antibody was diluted to 1/100, 1/100 and 1/1000 in MaxBlot solution 1, respectively. Samples were washed with PBS-T buffer and reacted with 1/2000 diluted secondary antibody (ThermoFisher Scientific) in MaxBlot Solution 2 for 2 h at R.T in dark. Micro-injection into fertilized eggs and blastomeres was performed as previously described45. Each morpholino anti-sense oligo nucleotides (MO) and mRNA for micro-injection were dissolved in the injection buffer (24% glycerol, 20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, and 120 mM KCl). The concentration in needle and the sequence of morpholino and mRNA were as follows: BMP2/4-MO (400 µM): 5'- GACCCCAATGTGAGGTGGTAACCAT -3' (Specificity was previously confirmed44); FoxQ2-MO (200 µM): 5'- TCATGATGAAATGTTGGAACGAGAG -3' (Specificity was previously confirmed42); Nodal-MO (200 µM): 5'- AGATCCGATGAACGATGCATGGTTA -3' (Specificity was previously confirmed46); Lefty-MO (400 µM): 5'- AGCACCGAGTGATAATTCCATATTG -3' (Specificity was previously confirmed42); Embryos were fertilized in the FSW containing 1 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (ATA) to prevent the fertilization envelope from hardened47. Fertilized eggs were cultured at 15 °C until 2-cell stage and removed fertilization envelope by pipetting. Fire-burned and pulled thin-wall glass capillary (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA, USA) was used for cutting embryos. The protocol for making a manipulation needle was previously described45. All plastic dishes and glass capillaries for cutting embryos were coated with 3% BSA or lamb serum. Total RNA was collected from 100 control embryos and 200 halved embryos with RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) at each developmental stage. For total RNA sequencing, we utilized the Macrogen Total RNA sequencing service. We performed Trimmomatic (v0.39) against 54 of FASTQ files and trimmed Illumina adapter sequences with our original list (https://bioinformatics.riken.jp/ramdaq/ramdaq_annotation/mouse/all_sequencing_WTA_adopters.fa). FeatureCounts (v2.0.1) was used to quantify the gene expression levels of each sample. The gene expression matrix was generated by counting the number of reads mapped to each gene. Data quality control (QC): FastQC (v0.11.9) was used to check the quality of raw and trimmed reads. MultiQC (v1.12) was used to summarize the results of FastQC. Using R (v4.4.2), we generated a heatmap of the correlation between samples using the R package ggplot2 (v3.5.1). prcomp is used to perform PCA and the mapping rate and the number of detected genes were evaluated on the score plot. edgeR (v4.4.1) and DESeq2 (v1.46.0) were used to detect DEGs. Reproducibility: All the data analyses were performed on a workflow using Snakemake (v6.5.3) (https://github.com/kokitsuyuzaki/urchin-workflow). All the tools are pre-installed in the following three Docker containers, and executed via Singularity (v3.5.3), so that data analyses are reproducible in any computational environment. - koki/urchin_workflow_r:20250116: Dimensionality reduction, DEGs analysis, visualization CellTrackTM CM-DiI (DiI) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was dissolved into 100% EtOH to final 1 µg/µl concentration. Diluted DiI was loaded into the glass capillary, which is used for micro-injection. DiI that flows into the seawater becomes a small crystal at the tip of the capillary, since DiI is not dissolved in water/seawater. DiI crystal was pressed to the target portion of halved embryos on poly-L-lysin (Sigma-Aldrich) coated plastic dish for 2 min. After the stained signal is confirmed by a fluorescent microscope (IX70 [Olympus, Tokyo, Japan]), the labeled embryos were kept at 15 °C until the appropriate stages. No statistical methods were used to predetermine the sample size. All n numbers are described in figure. To compare the two groups in Fig. To compare the four groups in Fig. 2k, we used one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test with a significant level of 0.01 or 0.05, and following F value (F) and degrees of freedom [d.f.].

(2025)Cite this article The unique properties of stereogenic sulfur centres make sulfoxides highly valuable in medicinal chemistry, organic synthesis and other fields. Axially chiral sulfoxides are a class of complex organosulfur compounds with promising applications, but their synthesis remains challenging. Here we report a streamlined synthetic strategy for axially chiral sulfoxides. By leveraging the combination of rationally designed reagents and tailored catalytic systems, the method simultaneously establishes chiral sulfoxide and axial chirality in a single reaction step. This method was applied to a wide variety of substrates and resulted in products with broad functionality. The sulfinylation reaction was studied through a series of mechanistic experiments. This study provides a route to chiral sulfoxides with underexplored functionalities for potential future applications.

Huntington's disease (HD) is a rare, neurodegenerative disorder for which only symptomatic treatments are available. The PROOF-HD study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of pridopidine, a selective Sigma-1 receptor agonist, in HD. The primary and key secondary endpoints, change in total functional capacity (TFC) and composite Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (cUHDRS) score at week 65, were not met in the overall population. The TFC least-squares mean difference between pridopidine and placebo was −0.18 (95% confidence interval −0.49 to 0.14; P = 0.26). The cUHDRS least-squares mean difference between pridopidine and placebo was −0.11 (95% confidence interval −0.40 to 0.18; P = 0.45). Sensitivity analysis in a subgroup of participants not treated with antidopaminergic medications at any time demonstrated a consistent pattern favoring pridopidine across multiple measures, including TFC and cUHDRS. Notably, pridopidine 45 mg twice daily demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Taken together, pridopidine has the potential to address a critical unmet need in HD. Huntington's disease (HD) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by a genetic mutation in the huntingtin gene. HD progresses over 10–20 years, causing motor abnormalities, cognitive decline, psychiatric symptoms and progressive loss of independence that ultimately result in death1,2,3. Symptomatic treatments exist, but therapies to modify disease progression are urgently needed2,4,5. Standard treatments for HD include antidopaminergic medications (ADMs) such as vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitors (VMAT2 inhibitors) for chorea and off-label antipsychotics (neuroleptics), which may help reduce involuntary movements and behavioral symptoms4,5,6,7. However, mounting evidence suggests ADM-related side effects may interfere with accurate measures of disease progression, especially in outcomes like cognition and function widely used in HD clinical trials5,8,9,10. By targeting S1R, pridopidine modulates multiple pathways in HD and other neurodegenerative diseases11. Preclinical evidence demonstrates that pridopidine exerts neuroprotective effects through a multimodal action—reducing endoplasmic reticulum stress, promoting calcium homeostasis and stimulating neurotrophic-dependent restoration of synaptic plasticity12,13,14,15,16,17,18. A positron emission tomography study in humans confirms pridopidine's engagement with S1R in key HD-affected brain regions, including the striatum19. Clinical trials show oral pridopidine is well-tolerated with a benign safety profile20,21,22 and may have the potential to preserve functional capacity, cognition and motor function in HD20,21,22,23,24,25,26. In early clinical studies, including the HART and MermaiHD trials21,22,26,27, motor-related endpoints were primary outcomes but were not met. However, exploratory analyses indicated pridopidine 45 mg twice daily (bid) showed motor benefits with significant improvements in total motor score (TMS). In PRIDE-HD23,24, pridopidine 45 mg bid was associated with a slower rate of decline in total functional capacity (TFC), a key measure of functional abilities in HD, over 52 weeks compared with placebo, with potential benefits lasting up to five years in the Open-HART extension study20,21. In the phase 2 HEALEY ALS Platform Trial, pridopidine 45 mg bid showed numerical trends suggesting slowed decline in ALSFRS-R, respiratory, bulbar and speech functions in a post hoc analysis of a subgroup of participants meeting El-Escorial Criteria for definite or probable amyotrophic lateral sclerosis within 18 months of symptom onset28. These findings supported further evaluation of pridopidine in PROOF-HD (Pridopidine-Outcome-on-Function), a global phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in early adult-onset HD. A key secondary endpoint was the change in composite Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (cUHDRS), a sensitive global measure of function, cognition and motor assessments29. However, given their known side effects, such as parkinsonism, sedation and cognitive impairment, which may confound trial outcomes5,8,9,30, a sensitivity analysis was conducted in a subgroup of participants who remained off ADMs (no VMAT2 inhibitors or antipsychotics at any time during the study)31. In the overall population, pridopidine did not significantly outperform placebo in the primary or key secondary endpoints. However, in a sensitivity analysis of the off-ADMs subgroup, pridopidine was associated with favorable trends across measures of function, cognition, motor performance and cUHDRS scores. These findings underscore the importance of minimizing potential ADM-related confounding in HD trials and support further investigation of pridopidine in defined patient subgroups. Between October 2020 and March 2023, 594 participants were screened across 59 international sites. Of these, 499 were randomized 1:1 to receive either pridopidine 45 mg bid or placebo (intent-to-treat (ITT): placebo, n = 249; pridopidine, n = 250) (Fig. The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population excluded ten participants because of missing post-baseline efficacy data (mITT: placebo, n = 247; pridopidine, n = 242). Twenty-eight participants in the pridopidine group and 22 in the placebo group discontinued for various reasons (Fig. The flowchart illustrates participant disposition across study populations. ‘Off ADMs' refers to participants who were not treated with ADMs at any point during the study. The ITT population includes all randomized participants. The mITT population consists of ITT participants who received at least one dose of the study drug and had valid TFC scores at baseline and at least one post-baseline visit. The SP population includes randomized participants who received at least one dose of the study drug. The W65PP and W78PP subsets include mITT participants with valid TFC scores at weeks 65 and 78, at least 80% compliance with the study drug and no major protocol deviations. aPatients who did not receive ADM treatment at any point during the study; bthe analysis set consisting of patients from both W65PP and W78PP. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were comparable across populations. The mITT group showed similar distributions (Table 1). Randomization was stratified by baseline HD stage and antipsychotic use. VMAT2 inhibitor use, which was not a stratification factor, was by chance slightly higher in the pridopidine group (22.3%) versus placebo (15.4%). ADM use was permitted post-baseline, if deemed necessary by the treating physician. Antipsychotics (a stratification factor) were used by 33.2% (placebo) and 31.8% (pridopidine) of participants; VMAT2 inhibitors were used by 15.4% (placebo) and 22.7% (pridopidine) of participants. During the study, 45.3% (placebo) and 39.7% (pridopidine) of participants remained off ADMs. In the ITT population (placebo, n = 249; pridopidine, n = 250), pridopidine did not outperform placebo (Fig. a,b, TFC (primary endpoint) (a) and cUHDRS (key secondary endpoint) (b) are presented as LSMean changes from baseline to week 65 for the ITT and mITT populations. LSMean differences between the placebo and pridopidine treatment arms are shown at each time point. Statistical analyses were performed using a maximum likelihood-based mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM). No significant difference in cUHDRS was observed at week 65 (mITT: LSMean difference −0.11 (95% CI −0.40 to 0.18); P = 0.454). The change in cUHDRS was −0.88 (95% CI −1.09 to −0.66) for placebo and −0.99 (95% CI −1.20 to −0.77) for pridopidine (Fig. Pridopidine 45 mg bid was well-tolerated, with a safety profile broadly comparable with placebo22,23,26, and consistent with previous clinical trial experience (Table 2 and Extended Data Table 4). Compliance in the safety population (SP) was 94.5%, with an average treatment duration of 70.7 weeks. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 85.9% of participants in the placebo population and 82.8% of participants the pridopidine population, with >70% of TEAEs classified as mild or moderate. Common TEAEs included COVID-19, falls, diarrhea and headache. Suicidality rates were comparable between groups (0.4% in each). Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 11% of participants (8.4% placebo, 13.6% pridopidine), with none assessed as related to study treatment. No safety signal indicating increased mortality risk with pridopidine treatment was identified. Suicide attempts occurred in three participants in the pridopidine group, all of whom had pre-existing psychiatric comorbidities. These events are consistent with the elevated background risk of suicidality in HD36. Severe treatment-related TEAEs were rare (0.4% placebo, 1.2% pridopidine), with no treatment-related serious events in the pridopidine group and no evidence of a broader safety signal, as reported previously35. Pridopidine caused no clinically meaningful changes in renal function or Q-T interval duration. Q-T interval corrected using Fridericia's formula (Q-TcF) changes >30 ms but ≤60 ms occurred in 9.2% of participants in the pridopidine group and 3.6% of in the placebo group, with no post-baseline Q-TcF values >480 ms or change >60 ms, indicating no cardiac safety concerns. A subgroup analysis evaluated pridopidine's effects in participants not treated with ADMs, which may confound measures of clinical outcome30,31. Because the primary endpoint was not met, all analyses for the off-ADM subgroup report P values as nominal and unadjusted for multiplicity. 1 and 2 present outcomes from the off-ADM subgroup analyses in the mITT and PP populations, respectively, with summaries below. a, In the off-ADM mITT population, pridopidine treatment was associated with a slower rate of decline in cUHDRS scores compared with placebo. Statistical analyses were performed using a MMRM with two-sided nominal P values. Data are presented as LSMean, with error bars indicating 95% CI. In the mITT population off ADMs, pridopidine demonstrated a trend favoring slower TFC decline compared with placebo to week 78, with the strongest effect at week 52 (maximal difference: 0.25 versus placebo) (Extended Data Fig. Confidence intervals overlapped at all time points. Whereas pridopidine showed a trend for slower decline, participants in the placebo group showed the expected pattern of progressive TFC decline. In the PP population, pridopidine showed a showed a numerically favorable trend (a 0.37-point difference versus placebo at week 78), but this was not significant (Extended Data Fig. In the mITT population off ADMs, pridopidine showed nominally significant benefits in maintaining cUHDRS scores compared with placebo, with the largest differences (Δ) at week 26 (Δ = 0.46, P = 0.004; placebo n = 112, pridopidine n = 95), week 39 (Δ = 0.45, P = 0.014; placebo n = 107, pridopidine n = 90) and week 52 (Δ = 0.41, P = 0.035; placebo n = 104, pridopidine n = 91) (Fig. Improvements from baseline were most pronounced to week 39. A key assumption in using the multicomponent cUHDRS is that therapies targeting disease progression should lead to improvements across multiple components of the cUHDRS29,37. To evaluate this, a forest plot analysis assessed the contributions of TFC, Stroop Word Reading test (SWR), Symbol Digital Modality Test (SDMT) and TMS among participants off-ADMs (Fig. The analysis showed that differences favoring pridopidine were evident across all four cUHDRS components, rather than being driven by any single one. TFC and SWR showed trends favoring pridopidine at all time points. Although TFC did not reach significance, point estimates favored pridopidine up to week 78 in both the mITT and PP populations. SDMT and TMS did not show differences, but TMS trended in favor of pridopidine at weeks 26, 39 and 52. These findings suggest that the observed cUHDRS treatment effect differences in the off-ADM subgroup were supported by contributions from multiple outcomes, across function, cognition and motor measures. In the mITT population off ADMs, pridopidine was associated with a consistent pattern of slowing cognitive decline compared with placebo to week 52. For SWR, between-group differences favored pridopidine across multiple time points (Fig. For SDMT, trends also favored pridopidine to week 39, with score trajectories remaining stable to week 78 (Fig. Motor outcomes in participants in the off-ADM subgroup showed a pattern of numerical improvements with pridopidine treatment, based on Q-Motor measures including the finger tapping inter-onset-interval (FT IOI) (Fig. For Q-Motor task pronation–supination tapping inter-tap-interval (Pro-Sup ITI), pridopidine improved function at weeks 26 and 65 compared with placebo (Extended Data Fig. Although improvements at week 52 (−20.21 ms, P = 0.109) and week 78 (−22.23 ms, P = 0.104) did not reach statistical significance, the overall trend favored pridopidine. In the PP population, these effects in FT IOI and Pro-Sup ITI were more pronounced, with larger LSMean differences observed throughout the study. Results consistently favored pridopidine over placebo at time points between weeks 26 and 78, supporting a potential treatment effect on motor performance (Extended Data Fig. Additional variability data from finger tapping (FT IOI s.d.) 1c) also showed a beneficial effect of pridopidine at week 26, with a nominally significant improvement over placebo. At later time points, weeks 52, 65 and 78, the treatment effect persisted as a numerical trend in favor of pridopidine. In the PP population, results were more robust, with larger treatment effects observed consistently across all time points (Extended Data Fig. Results for Pro-Sup IOI show similar trends favoring pridopidine, particularly at weeks 26 and 65 (Extended Data Fig. Effects were more pronounced in the PP population (Extended Data Fig. Together, although these motor findings suggest pridopidine's potential to improve motor function and mitigate motor decline in HD, these outcomes were secondary, and should therefore be interpreted cautiously. To further characterize the treatment effect in the off-ADM subgroup, two post hoc analyses of cUHDRS scores were conducted to explore clinically meaningful response patterns. These analyses provided a complementary view to mean change estimates, highlighting potential differences in individual participant trajectories in a population that typically experiences progressive decline in HD2,29,38 (Methods). The first approach used cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) in the mITT population and showed consistently greater response rates for pridopidine than placebo across all time points (Fig. The CDF provides a comprehensive view of the distribution of treatment responses without relying on a predefined cutoff, thereby reducing potential bias and allowing for objective comparison of clinical benefit across groups. In the PP population, effects were more pronounced at week 78 (P = 0.035) (Extended Data Fig. a, Post hoc responder analyses in the mITT population show that pridopidine led to higher CDF response rates than placebo at all time points, with significant differences at weeks 26 (AUC = 0.60, P = 0.013; KS test P = 0.0093) and 39 (AUC = 0.61, P = 0.0054; KS test P = 0.024). b, A threshold-based analysis revealed that a ≥5% improvement in cUHDRS was achieved in approximately twice as many participants receiving pridopidine compared with placebo at weeks 26 (P = 0.004) and 39 (P = 0.003). All statistical tests were two-sided and unadjusted for multiple comparisons. In the second approach, a post hoc threshold-based analysis using a ≥5% improvement cutoff in cUHDRS score consistently showed higher response rates for pridopidine compared with placebo across all time points (Fig. At weeks 26 and 39, response rates nearly doubled for pridopidine (week 26: 40% versus 21%, P = 0.004; week 39: 40% versus 20%, P = 0.003). This pattern persisted to week 78, suggesting potential durability. The PP population showed similar findings, with significant differences observed at weeks 26, 39 and 78. Together, these responder analyses provide additional insight into a potential treatment effect of pridopidine in participants off ADMs, particularly with favorable trends sustained to week 78. The PROOF-HD study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of pridopidine over 65 weeks, with a variable 13-week extension for a total of 78 weeks. The trial evaluated pridopidine's impact on functional, motor and cognitive decline in participants with HD. Completion rates were high, with 91.8% of participants completing the 65-week main study. These findings underscore the feasibility and robustness of long-term pridopidine treatment. In the overall population, the study did not meet its primary endpoint of change in TFC from baseline to week 65, or the key secondary endpoint of change in cUHDRS. Several factors may inform interpretation and underscore the limitations of this trial. As observed in other neuropsychiatric trials, a higher-than-expected use of ADMs was observed39,40,41. This may have introduced confounding, because many ADMs are associated with side effects such as sedation, parkinsonism and cognitive impairment that are well-documented in regulatory labels42,43,44,45 and can mimic or mask HD symptoms8,30,31. In addition to these symptomatic effects, the complex relationship between prolonged D2 antagonism from ADMs and the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) varies among participants46,47,48; further complicating the interpretation of treatment effects in trials like PROOF-HD, where symptomatic overlap may obscure true drug-related benefits. Given that many ADMs are metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 (refs. 42,43,44,45,49,50) and that pridopidine inhibits cytochrome P450 2D6, it is also possible that pharmacokinetic interactions in the active treatment arm could have further interfered with measures of clinical outcome in the overall population51. These limitations suggest that ADM-related confounding may reduce the sensitivity of functional and cognitive measures in HD trials, and support the need for future studies to stratify randomization by ADM use or to prespecify subgroup analyses based on ADM exposure status. Although this study was not designed to test dosage strategies for ADMs, findings also raise the possibility that ADM dose minimization (as recommended in regulatory labeling) or careful ADM and dosage selection in combination with pridopidine may offer a viable strategy for symptom management20,24,31. To assess the potential effect of pridopidine treatment in the absence of ADM interference, we performed a sensitivity analysis of an off-ADM subgroup, which excluded participants who received VMAT2 inhibitors or antipsychotics at any time during the trial. Although no significant difference with treatment was observed in the off-ADM cohort for TFC, this cohort was smaller than anticipated, and consequently may have limited statistical power. By contrast, nominally favorable trends were observed across multiple other outcomes, including in cUHDRS, TFC, SWR and Q-Motor23,24,52, particularly baseline to week 52, suggesting the potential for slowed progression relative to placebo over 1 year. These findings were based on nominal P values without correction for multiplicity and should be interpreted with caution. Here, participants off ADMs treated with pridopidine may have experienced numerically smaller declines in cUHDRS scores over 78 weeks. Note that modest annual reductions in cUHDRS (0.1–0.3 points) have been associated with a clinical meaningful benefit in HD29, underscoring the potential importance of these trends. In complementary post hoc responder analyses of cUHDRS, data further suggested higher response rates for pridopidine compared with placebo over time53. Improvements in SWR, reflecting cognitive flexibility and processing speed were also observed at early time points, consistent with possible cognitive benefit in a disease with relentless decline. Objective Q-Motor results also provided rater-independent insight of motor function, aligning with clinical outcomes23,54. FT IOI, in particular, has been shown to detect motor impairments up to 20 years before clinical onset in HD gene carriers and to track longitudinal progression across disease stages23,55. These motor outcomes paralleled trends in cUHDRS and support the internal consistency of treatment effects across clinical measures, although these are secondary endpoints and require cautious interpretation. Overall, participants treated with pridopidine in the off-ADM subgroup showed less decline than participants treated with placebo across multiple outcomes, but the subgroup size was limited, and the findings were not powered to support definitive conclusions. Nonetheless, the consistency of trends across function, motor and cognition suggests a treatment effect. To date, no approved therapy has demonstrated a definitive, consistent effect on global progression endpoints like TFC or cUHDRS in HD. Although preliminary, observed trends with pridopidine treatment highlight pridopidine's potential to address HD progression beyond symptom-specific treatments like VMAT2 inhibitors for chorea. Consistent with earlier trials like PRIDE-HD21,22,23, pridopidine was well-tolerated, and with a safety profile comparable to placebo. Open-label data from Open-HART also support the long-term safety of pridopidine20, with no treatment-related deaths or cardiac risk signals identified in PROOF-HD. Rates of psychiatric events and suicidality were in line with background HD risk, and no new safety concerns emerged6,25,35. Pridopidine's therapeutic effects are closely tied to its potent and highly selective S1R agonist activity56. S1R is a chaperone protein involved in cellular stress adaptation, neuroprotection and synaptic function57. Activation of S1R by pridopidine has been shown to reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress, support calcium homeostasis and promote neurotrophic signaling14,16,58,59. These effects are particularly relevant to HD pathophysiology, which involves progressive striatal degeneration and impaired cellular resilience. However, the consistent safety profile, pharmacologic rationale and the coherence of treatment effects across multiple outcomes in the off-ADM sensitivity analysis—findings not previously observed in any HD trial—identify a biologically plausible and clinically relevant patient population in which treatment benefit was observed. This merits further evaluation in confirmatory trials. Future studies should refine patient selection and account for the potential impact of ADM exposure through stratification and dosage strategies, which may preserve pridopidine's effects while also managing symptoms. This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, multicenter clinical trial (PROOF-HD; ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT04556656, EudraCT number 2020-002822-10) aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pridopidine at a dose of 45 mg bid in participants with a TFC score range of 7–13 at screening. Recruitment took place across 59 international sites in Austria, Canada, Czechia, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, the UK and the USA. The study enrolled 499 participants, and participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either pridopidine or placebo (ITT population n = 249 placebo and n = 250 pridopidine). Randomization was stratified based on baseline HD stage (HD1 TFC 11–13 versus HD2 TFC 7–10) and antipsychotic use at baseline (yes or no). The randomization sequence was generated by the Sponsor's designated statistical team, and allocation was concealed from site investigators, participants and study staff throughout the trial. The study was conducted over a period of 65–78 weeks, with the primary analysis taking place at 65 weeks to assess primary efficacy, key secondary and other outcomes, as well as safety. An additional variable 13-week double-blind treatment period was included to evaluate the durability of the treatment effect up to 78 weeks. Following the baseline visit, participants underwent a 2-week titration period of 45 mg once daily, followed by 63 weeks of full-dose maintenance treatment (45 mg bid or matching placebo). Participants in the active arm received pridopidine at the clinically recommended dose of 45 mg bid orally administered as hard gelatin capsules, whereas those in the placebo arm received indistinguishable matching placebo capsules. Participants who completed the 65-week maintenance period entered a variable double-blind extension period of up to 13 weeks, concluding when the last randomized participant completed 65 weeks of treatment. In this common closing design, all participants remaining between weeks 65 and 78 completed ‘end of study' visits once the final participant reached week 65. This approach allowed for the collection of extended double-blind, controlled data to evaluate efficacy up to 78 weeks, while ensuring consistent double-blinding for all participants and investigators throughout the study. Most participants were followed for 78 weeks, including the mITT population of 490 participants (98.2%), which comprised those who received at least one dose of the study drug and had valid baseline and post-baseline assessments. Of all participants, 458 (91.8%) completed at least 65 weeks in the main study period. The week 65 per protocol (W65PP) population comprised 414 patients (83.0% of the ITT) and included participants from the mITT group who had valid TFC data at week 65, maintained >80% compliance with the study drug and had no substantial protocol deviations impacting TFC assessment. The week 78 per protocol (W78PP) population comprised 318 participants (63.7% of the ITT) and was defined similar to W65PP but included participants with valid TFC data at week 78. This study demonstrated the potential efficacy of pridopidine at this dose, particularly in early-stage HD patients. The 45 mg bid dose aimed to optimize efficacy while maintaining an acceptable safety profile, as observed in the PRIDE-HD study. The PRIDE-HD study also highlighted pridopidine's potential to maintain functional capacity in participants with TFC scores ranging from 7 to 13 over a 52-week period, with the most significant benefits observed in those classified as HD1 or HD2. Considering that individuals with HD1 and HD2 (TFC 7–13) typically experience an annual decline in TFC of roughly 0.8 to 1.0 points, the PROOF-HD phase 3 study was designed with a 65-week observation period24,29. This extended timeframe was chosen to allow sufficient opportunity to detect a potential maintenance effect of pridopidine compared to the natural decline anticipated in the placebo arm. Sex and gender were self-reported by participants at screening and documented in the electronic case report forms. The study was not stratified by sex or gender, and no subgroup analyses were conducted for this study based on these characteristics. Additional reimbursement for transportation or lodging costs was considered on a case-by-case basis with prior approval by the study contract research organization (CRO). Inclusion and exclusion criteria were established to enroll participants with early to moderate HD, defined by motor, functional and genetic parameters. These criteria prioritized participant safety and facilitated the creation of a homogeneous study population, enabling accurate assessment of pridopidine's effects. Detailed protocol information is available on ClinicalTrials.gov (accessed 23 January 2025; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04556656). Participants had to meet all of the following criteria: Age ≥25 years at the time of signing informed consent Diagnosis of HD based on clinical features and the presence of ≥36 CAG repeats in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, confirmed historically or at screening Diagnostic confidence level of 4 (≥99% certainty) on the UHDRS-TMS Stage 1 or stage 2 HD, defined by a United Huntington's Disease Rating Scale-Total Functional Capacity score ≥7 at screening Met all criteria required for randomization authorization flow and was considered eligible by the randomization authorization flow reviewer Female participants of childbearing potential must have had a negative β-human chorionic gonadotropin test at screening and baseline, or must have been sterile or post-menopausal. Female participants with potentially fertile male partners must have used highly effective birth control methods stable for at least 3 months before screening, during the study and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. Male participants must have been sterile or used effective birth control with female partners throughout the study and for 90 days after discontinuation. Allowed psychotropic medication dosing (for example, antipsychotics, antidepressants) must have been stable for at least 4 weeks before baseline and throughout the study, unless clinically necessary to change. Allowed concomitant medication dosing must have been stable for at least 4 weeks before baseline (amiodarone must not have been used within 6 weeks of baseline). Capable of providing signed informed consent and complying with study requirements. Participants were excluded if any of the following applied: Clinically significant heart disease within 12 weeks before randomization, including: History of arrhythmia, symptomatic or uncontrolled atrial fibrillation, confirmed ventricular tachycardia or left bundle branch block Known congenital long Q-T syndrome or family history of same Clinically significant bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome, atrioventricular block, congestive heart failure or electrolyte disturbances (hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia) History of epilepsy or seizures within the past 5 years Use of medications that prolong Q-T interval within 4 weeks of baseline (amiodarone prohibited within 6 weeks) Use of pridopidine within 12 months before baseline Treatment with any investigational product within 6 weeks (or five half-lives, whichever is longer) before screening Receipt of gene therapy at any time Prior participation in any study involving tominersen Laboratory abnormalities at screening that were clinically significant or: Total bilirubin >1.5 mg dl−1 (unless caused by Gilbert's syndrome without liver dysfunction) Alcohol or substance use disorder within 6 months before screening (per Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-5 Text Review (TR)) Active suicidal ideation (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale score of 4 or 5) within 1 year of screening or positive suicidal behavior items, or judged to be at serious suicide risk by the Investigator Known allergy to any ingredient in the study drug (pridopidine, silicified microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate) Vulnerable participants (for example, detained individuals) or those unfit because of living circumstances The stopping rule specified that participants had to discontinue the study drug if their Q-TcF exceeded 500 ms or was over 480 ms with an increase of more than 60 ms from baseline (as determined by electrocardiogram). In addition, participants with CrCl <30 ml min−1 were required to discontinue. Additional stopping criteria included suicidal ideation (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale score ≥4 or Problem Behaviors Assessment-Short Version (PBA-s) suicidal ideation >3), seizures, symptomatic or uncontrolled atrial fibrillation, confirmed ventricular tachycardia, presence of left bundle branch block, intracranial issues, cerebrovascular events, substance use disorders or pregnancy. Other reasons included adverse events, noncompliance, consent withdrawal or study termination. Discontinued participants were encouraged to attend scheduled visits. Participants could withdraw at any time, and the reasons for withdrawal were recorded. Scores range from 0 to 13, with 13 indicating no functional impairment and 0 representing complete incapacity. The scale assesses a participant's ability to manage domestic chores, activities of daily living, finances, care needs and occupation. The scale is designed to detect changes in the early stages of HD (HD1 and HD2) and exhibits a floor effect in advanced stages of the disease. The key secondary endpoint was the change in cUHDRS score from baseline at 65 weeks (ref. The cUHDRS is a composite measure comprising four components: TFC, TMS, SDMT and SWR. These components collectively assess functional, motor and cognitive outcomes, offering a comprehensive evaluation of clinical progression in HD. A key assumption in using the cUHDRS in clinical studies is that neuroprotective therapies targeting disease mechanisms should result in concordant improvements across all components of the cUHDRS29,60. To evaluate this assumption and explore the contribution of each cUHDRS component at each study visit, post hoc forest plot analyses were conducted in the mITT and PP populations off ADMs. The components were rescaled using standardization factors from Schobel's formula (1.9, −14.9, 11.3 and 20.1 for TFC, TMS, SDMT and SWR, respectively) to visualize their relative contributions4. Additional endpoints included Q-Motor measures, which provide objective, rater-independent quantifiable assessments of motor performance, in which an increase in performance indicates improvement with minimal or no placebo effects23,55,61. These tests evaluated motor skills essential for daily activities, including FT IOI Mean and FT IOI Standard Deviation (digitomotography), FT ITI, and Pro-Sup IOI and Pro-Sup ITI (dysdiadochomotography) measures. FT IOI, FT ITI, Pro-Sup ITI and Pro-Sup IOI were analyzed to determine motor performance. Cognitive performance was evaluated using the SWR and the SDMT, which assesses attention, processing speed and cognitive flexibility. The SWR evaluates attention and mental flexibility through the Stroop effect, where participants to read color names (for example, ‘red') printed in black ink, with accuracy and speed recorded over 45 s. Higher scores reflect better performance. SWR was evaluated both as an individual cognitive measure and as a prespecified component of the composite cUHDRS endpoint. The SDMT assesses psychomotor speed and working memory by having participants match symbols to corresponding numbers within 90 s, with scores reflecting the total correct responses (maximum of 110). Both assessments were administered alongside motor tests. TMS evaluates motor features of HD including gait, balance, oculomotor function, dysarthria, dystonia and postural stability and chorea, where lower TMS scores indicate improvement. All study raters were trained and certified through UHDRS-TMS online certification provided by the European Huntington Disease Network Motor Working group in collaboration with the ENROLL-HD study platform55,62. For the European Union (EU) regions, the primary endpoint was United Huntington's Disease Rating Scale-Total Functional Capacity change from baseline at 65 weeks. The primary estimand was a composite of treatment policy and hypothetical strategies, defined in the ITT population, which included all randomized participants. In non-EU regions, the primary analysis was conducted using a treatment policy strategy-based estimand in the mITT population, which included all participants in the ITT population who received at least one dose of the study drug and had valid in-clinic TFC scores at both baseline and at least one post-baseline time point. Here we present all data from the mITT, which excluded nine patients from the ITT population. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the PP population, which included participants from the mITT population who were on the study drug at week 65 (W65PP) or week 78 (W78PP), maintained compliance >80% during the study and did not have major protocol deviations impacting efficacy. The null hypothesis stated that there was no difference between pridopidine and placebo in improving TFC at week 65. A restricted maximum likelihood-based MMRM was used to analyze in-clinic observed change from baseline at each post-baseline visit based on the primary estimand. The MMRM model included fixed effects for treatment, baseline value of the endpoint, region (Europe, North America), two randomization stratification factors (antipsychotic or neuroleptic use (yes, no) and baseline HD stage (HD1, HD2)), categorical week and treatment-by-week interaction. A random intercept for participant was included. An unstructured covariance matrix was used to model within-participant correlations. Kenward–Roger approximation was used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom. Hypothesis testing was conducted hierarchically for the primary and key secondary endpoints, maintaining a two-sided Type I error level of ≤0.05 to control for multiple comparisons. Change from baseline to week 65 in TFC (primary endpoint) Change from baseline to week 65 in cUHDRS total score (key secondary endpoint) Proportion of participants with improvement or no worsening (≥0-point change) at week 65 in TFC Change from baseline to week 65 in Q-Motor FT IOI Mean Change from baseline to week 65 in UHDRS-TMS Change from baseline to week 65 in SDMT Change from baseline to week 52 in TMS Proportion of participants with improvement or no worsening in Clinical Global Impression of Change at week 65. Because the primary endpoint was not met, no further formal multiplicity adjustment was applied beyond the hierarchical testing procedure. Subgroup analyses, including those in the off-ADM population, were reported with point estimates, 95% CI and nominal P values, and were interpreted with appropriate caution. Prespecified sensitivity analyses included subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint (TFC) by baseline ADM status, as outlined in the SAP. Post hoc analyses were subsequently performed to evaluate cUHDRS and responder thresholds in the off-ADM subgroup. Following the primary analysis, missing data were handled using a control-based pattern mixture model (PMM) under a Missing Not at Random (MNAR) assumption. In this approach, missing post-discontinuation outcomes were imputed based on placebo group trajectories. The assumed delta adjustment reflected a weighted estimate based on observed dropout patterns across treatment groups. Sensitivity analyses using PMM were performed for TFC, cUHDRS and other key endpoints. The sample size determination aimed to ensure sufficient power to detect a statistically significant difference in change from baseline in TFC between pridopidine and placebo at week 65 at 90% power and a two-sided significance level of 0.05. Specifically, a total sample size of 372 participants provided 94% power to detect a between-group difference of 0.7 points in mean change from baseline to 65 weeks in TFC, assuming an s.d. To accommodate a projected dropout rate of 22.5%, the final target sample size was set at 480 randomized participants. This dropout assumption was empirically derived from the PRIDE-HD trial23, in which the combined dropout rate for the placebo and pridopidine 45 mg bid groups was 22.3% among participants with baseline TFC scores between 7 and 13. Under a MNAR assumption, modeling discontinued participants to follow the trajectory of placebo after withdrawal, the estimated treatment difference of 0.565 (a weighted average of 0.7 for completers and 0.1 for dropouts) with an s.d. of 1.9 yielded 90% power to detect a statistically significant effect. Continuous variables were summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, s.d., quartiles); categorical variables were summarized using frequency counts and percentages. Using control-based PMM, sensitivity analyses were conducted under an MNAR assumption to evaluate robustness. Continuous outcomes were analyzed using MMRM, accounting for repeated observations and assuming data were missing at random. Continuous outcomes were analyzed using MMRM, accounting for repeated observations and assuming data were missing at random. The SP included all participants who received at least one dose of study drug and was analyzed according to treatment received. We performed a post hoc responder analysis of pridopidine's impact on cUHDRS. To address this limitation, two complementary approaches were adopted. First, a post hoc CDF analysis was used, which does not require a specific responder cutoff but instead evaluates the entire range of responses, spanning from −10% to +10% change from baseline in cUHDRS score. The AUC difference between the pridopidine and placebo groups was assessed using a logistic model with a fixed effect for treatment. Second, a specific threshold was analyzed, defined as at least a 5% improvement from baseline on the cUHDRS, a threshold considered reasonably likely to represent clinical significance given the progressive decline typically observed in HD. All statistical tests were two-sided, with a significance threshold of 0.05. Subgroup analyses were prespecified to evaluate treatment effects by baseline HD stage, ADM use and other factors. For efficacy and safety outcomes, baseline was defined as the last nonmissing assessment before the first study drug dose. Change from baseline at scheduled visits to week 65 (weeks 26, 39, 52, 65) and to week 78 were analyzed using separate MMRM models to reduce potential bias from participants who did not reach week 78. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS v.9.4. Given the potential of ADMs (antipsychotics or neuroleptics and VMAT2 inhibitors) to mask clinical measures of HD and potentially mask the efficacy outcomes of pridopidine8,65, subgroup analyses were conducted on participants who were off ADMs at any point during the study, including both at baseline and throughout its duration. The SAP included stratification at baseline based on antipsychotic use (yes or no) and, considering the biological plausibility that ADMs could negatively impact function and cognition in HD, subgroup analyses excluding antipsychotics and VMAT2 inhibitor use any time during the study were defined. These analyses were conducted in both the modified intent-to-treat mITT and PP populations (Fig. Participants were closely monitored throughout the study to ensure proper adherence to the dosing regimen. Adverse events were collected and reported in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Safety monitoring included tracking the incidence of TEAEs, SAEs and any events leading to treatment and study discontinuation (Table 2; Extended Data Table 1). Investigators assessed the severity of all adverse events, and their causality to determine whether they were related to the treatment with the study drug. An independent safety monitoring committee reviewed unblinded data during the trial to ensure participant safety. The monitoring approach ensured a comprehensive evaluation of treatment exposure, adherence and safety. This trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences International Ethical Guidelines, as well as the International Council for Harmonisation guidelines for Good Clinical Practice66.

Sensitivity analyses of the change in (a) TFC show that pridopidine treatment showed a numerical trend favoring pridopidine, slowing TFC decline as compared with placebo through Week 78 with maximal TFC difference at Week 52 (difference: 0.26 vs. placebo; n = 104 placebo, n = 91 pridopidine). (b) Skilled Motor Performance (Pronation-Supination Inter-Tap Interval [Pro-Sup ITI] Mean): Improvements were significant at Week 26 (LSMean difference = -38.06 msec; p = 0.007; n = 112 placebo, n = 95 pridopidine) and Week 65 (LSMean difference = -23.92 msec; p = 0.04), with numerical trends favoring pridopidine at other timepoints. Specifically: (c) Motor Variability (Finger Tapping IOI Standard Deviation [SD]): Significant reductions in variability were observed at Week 26 (LSMean difference = -0.43; p = 0.035; n = 112 placebo, n = 95 pridopidine), with trends favoring pridopidine at later timepoints. (d) Pronation-Supination Inter-Onset Interval (Pro-Sup IOI) Mean: Significant improvements were observed at Week 26 (LSMean difference = -17.2 msec; p = 0.044; n = 112 placebo, n = 95 pridopidine). Each panel represents mean change from baseline with 95% confidence intervals. All statistical tests are based on mixed-effects models for repeated measures (MMRM) applied to the mITT population off ADMs. Negative values indicate improvement for all motor outcomes. (a) Pridopidine showed a 0.37-point difference in TFC versus placebo at Week 78 (placebo: n = 160; pridopidine: n = 158). (d–g) For motor outcomes, negative values indicate improvement. (e) Motor Variability (FT IOI Standard Deviation [SD]): Significant reductions were observed at Week 26 (p < 0.01; n = 99, n = 78) (**p < 0.01). (f) Skilled Motor Performance (Pronation-Supination Inter-Tap Interval [Pro-Sup ITI]): Improvements were significant at Week 26 (***p < 0.001), with trends favoring pridopidine through Week 78 (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; n = 99, n = 78). All data represent mean change from baseline in the PP population off-ADMs. Statistical significance was assessed using mixed-effects models for repeated measures (MMRM). P values are nominal and unadjusted for multiplicity. (a) This post hoc analysis presents the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of percent change from baseline in cUHDRS scores through Week 78 in the PP population of participants not receiving antidopaminergic medications (ADMs). Pridopidine consistently demonstrated higher response rates compared with placebo, with significant differences observed at Week 26 (AUC = 0.63, p = 0.003; KS Test p = 0.008; placebo n = 99, pridopidine n = 78) and Week 39 (AUC = 0.63, p = 0.001; KS Test p = 0.02; n = 99, n = 76). These results highlight pridopidine's potential to improve or maintain function in participants off ADMs, with pronounced effects observed during the first 39 weeks. All statistical tests were two-sided and unadjusted for multiple comparisons.
