                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anthropic has agreed to pay at least $1.5 billion to settle a lawsuit brought by a group of book authors alleging copyright infringement, an estimated $3,000 per work. For every additional work, the artificial intelligence company will pay an extra $3,000. “This landmark settlement far surpasses any other known copyright recovery. It will provide meaningful compensation for each class work and sets a precedent requiring AI companies to pay copyright owners. This settlement sends a powerful message to AI companies and creators alike that taking copyrighted works from these pirate websites is wrong,” says colead plaintiffs' counsel Justin Nelson of Susman Godfrey LLP. “Today's settlement, if approved, will resolve the plaintiffs' remaining legacy claims. We remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery, and solve complex problems,” Anthropic deputy general counsel Aparna Sridhar said in a statement. Authors Andrea Bartz, Kirk Wallace Johnson, and Charles Graeber alleged that Anthropic trained its large language models on their work without permission, violating copyright law. This June, senior district judge William Alsup ruled that Anthropic's AI training was shielded by the “fair use” doctrine, which allows unauthorized use of copyrighted works under certain conditions. As it gathered materials to train its AI tools, Anthropic had relied on a corpus of books pirated from so-called “shadow libraries,” including the notorious site LibGen, and Alsup determined that the authors should still be able to bring Anthropic to trial in a class action over pirating their work. (Anthropic maintains that it did not actually train its products on the pirated works, instead opting to purchase copies of books.) “Anthropic downloaded over seven million pirated copies of books, paid nothing, and kept these pirated copies in its library even after deciding it would not use them to train its AI (at all or ever again). Authors argue Anthropic should have paid for these pirated library copies. This order agrees,” Alsup wrote in his summary judgement. Since this was an “opt-out” class action, authors who are eligible but dissatisfied with the terms will be able to request exclusion to file their own lawsuits. Authors and rights holders have been directed to provide their contact information to the plaintiffs' counsel through a dedicated website. “I am hopeful that the settlement will receive wide support from copyright owners,” Maria Pallante, President and CEO of the Association of American Publishers, said in a statement. “Terms seem fair,” says Edward Lee, a law professor at Santa Clara University who closely follows AI copyright litigation. This is not the end of Anthropic's copyright legal challenges. The company is also facing a lawsuit from a group of major record labels, including Universal Music Group, which alleges that the company used copyrighted lyrics to train its Claude chatbot. The plaintiffs are now attempting to amend their case to include allegations that Anthropic used the peer-to-peer file sharing service BitTorrent to illegally download songs, and their lawyers recently stated in court filings that they may file a new lawsuit about piracy if they are not permitted to amend the current complaint.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The massive raid highlights growing tensions between President Donald Trump's anti-immigration policies, his tariff-fueled trade negotiations, and his promise to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. Schrank said 475 people were arrested, most of them South Korean nationals. He added that those detained had either crossed the border illegally, overstayed their visas, or were under a visa waiver program that kept them from being able to work. However, The Wall Street Journal reports that some of those arrested were LG Energy Solution employees who were in the U.S. on business travel. South Korea's foreign ministry spokesperson Lee Jaewoong was quick to criticize the raid. Trump has repeatedly used the threat of tariffs to pressure foreign governments and corporations into pledging more investments in the United States. Companies like Apple and  OpenAI have all committed billions in recent months, hoping to secure favorable treatment from the administration. Despite this, the raid specifically targeted the construction site of a new EV battery plant, a joint venture between Hyundai and LG Energy Solution. Hyundai has said the EV complex is expected to create 8,500 jobs by 2031. Hyundai did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo. The U.S. unemployment rate went up to 4.3% in August, its highest level since 2021, according to a new report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft's Satya Nadella and Bill Gates were at the White House on Thursday night, part of a high-profile gathering of tech leaders who combined praise for President Donald Trump with promises to invest in U.S. infrastructure, manufacturing, and artificial intelligence. The discussion felt at times like a high-stakes poker game, with Trump pressing each executive to reveal the size of their bets on America's future, like a dealer asking players to ante up. Nadella told Trump that America's tech leadership depends on innovation and global trust in U.S. technology, praising the administration for creating conditions where “the rest of the world can not only use our technology, but trust our technology more than any other alternative.” Gates focused on what he called his “second career” of philanthropy, linking it back to the innovation that defined his years at Microsoft. He told Trump that AI could help accelerate progress in global health — acting as “a doctor for everyone in Africa,” giving farmers better advice, and expanding opportunities for children to learn. Gates did not reference the congressional hearing earlier in the day with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Health and Human Services secretary who has voiced skepticism about vaccines and clashed with public health officials over U.S. immunization policy. Others at the table included OpenAI's Sam Altman; AMD CEO Lisa Su; Apple's Tim Cook; Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg; Google's Sundar Pichai and Sergey Brin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chatbots are great, but good old human-to-human contact can't be beat, and Thursday night at GeekWire's Seattle HQ, we caught up with several startup leaders for a party deck version of “Geek on the Street.” RELATED: Inside the minds of Seattle startup founders: Fundraising, hiring, and navigating their biggest challenges And finally, in an age of generative AI, agents, and other technologies that are blurring the lines between who really does what work, we asked our guests what the most human element is that they bring to work each day. It's inspiring to hear about their appreciation for trust, humor, energy, passion and more. Seattle-based Augmodo helps retailers track inventory and manage data via a variety of tech, including specially designed “Smartbadges” worn by store employees. “For myself, personally, it's actually doing research on individual customers. We work in the retail space, so if you wanted to get every address of every store that would be a very long process to try and mine that. You can actually do that as a deep research task in Gemini and compile that report in a couple minutes. … I'm a little bit skeptical of a lot of the use cases now, but in every area of excitement or hype cycle that you have, it takes a while for things to distill down.” The more you can AI-a-fy things from an investor pitch, you have to say, ‘Here's how everyone thinks about AI, and here's our unique twist on it.' Customers, at least in the retail space, they don't care what technology [you're using]. They're just like, ‘Does it provide an ROI or not?' What's something you as a human still provide to your company that AI doesn't? And even with the customer, there's a reason why, even post-Covid, people get on planes and visit customers in person.” Wavely Diagnostics is a University of Washington spinout that developed a smartphone app that uses acoustic signals to detect signs of an ear infection. “I have two examples of how I used it in the last 24 hours, and both of them were hugely time saving. The first one, we needed to create an unsubscribe link in our emails and a landing HTML page where people go to confirm their unsubscribe and tell us why. I went to ChatGPT and less than two minutes later we were done. … Another way I use it as CEO is to write. I don't ask it to write for me. It is an expectation that you build with AI right now in order to get venture funding. My reaction to that is I think that a couple of years from now, there's gonna be a heck of a lot of tech debt that companies are going to be wading through if they're relying too much on GenAI to write everything for them. What's something you as a human still provide to your company that AI doesn't? A little bit of … we all talk about our kids not letting us sleep at night. HouseWhisper a Seattle-based startup that relies on generative AI to help real estate agents stay organized with help on following up with clients, scheduling, CRM updates and more. “I've been using it a lot for creating product ideas. We are actually explaining a lot to our customers about what AI is, so from a customer perspective I don't. From an investor perspective, maybe to use it in certain other parts of the business, for example, doing more marketing with AI tools. What's something you as a human still provide to your company that AI doesn't? Seattle-based startup Loti helps celebrities, politicians, and other high-profile individuals protect their digital likeness in a chaotic world of deepfakes and IP rights. “Well, we built over 40 different proprietary machine learning models. Without AI I guess we could do what Google does with a reverse image search, but that's not very effective. “I definitely get that it's easier to fundraise if you talk about AI a lot. There's a certain amount of words you can use. Essentially we try to sell fundamentals of our business. And AI is just sometimes a cheaper way to get it done.” — Luke What's something you as a human still provide to your company that AI doesn't? “I don't think you can have self-regulation of nearly anybody — companies or AI. I think that it does require some level of human oversight. But ultimately there still needs to be a human to say, ‘This is a tool that's gonna be useful for humanity,' and today AI isn't gonna be able to do that.” — Rebekah Seattle-based Caddi uses generative AI to automate basic business operations such as customer onboarding, email management, document organization, data entry and invoicing. I've built some automations that automatically draft follow-up emails to all the clients and all the conversations that I've had. I've used AI to prepare for meetings with customers. I have Claude and ChatGPT and all these AI tools open all the time in my phone, in my laptop. “I think a lot of companies feel that pressure. In our case, there is a component that is heavily AI and if these models didn't exist our company couldn't exist. And that is becoming increasingly more important than the AI component. You can have a chip for your laptop, but if you don't have a keyboard or screen or anything, it doesn't work.” What's something you as a human still provide to your company that AI doesn't? “Given that AI has been trained on past data, a lot of the things that AI spits out are things that somewhere in the past it made some certain sense, like the way we write emails, or maybe the way we structure an idea. But as a startup you're effectively building something that has never existed before.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Robot vacuums that can climb stairs are now officially a thing if IFA 2025 is any indication. At the Berlin tech show, Eufy announced the MarsWalker, a dang stair-climbing mech suit that your robot vacuum can wear. And Eufy plans to release it in the spring of next year, with pricing to be announced later. Robot vacuum owners have been waiting years for a couple of things: a robot that actually does what you want with no compromises (we're not there yet) and the ability for them to actually get up and down your stairs without you (we're close!). A few companies have shown off stair-climbing robots before; consider the Migo Robotics Ascender, an ambitious project that can climb and clean your stairs, but that one hasn't made it to the world yet. Here's how it worked when I saw it at IFA: a compatible Eufy robot vac (in this case, the Eufy Omni S2) and the MarsWalker each leave their respective docks, then have a robotic meet-cute where the Eufy robot slips inside the MarsWalker and they start rolling towards the stairs. I watched the MarsWalker do this over and over again on a small set of wooden stairs that only went up in one direction. But Eufy says it works fine with stairs that reach a landing and turn, either at a right angle or back in the other direction. I asked a member of Eufy's research and development team who was on site, and he tells me the MarsWalker can potentially handle spiral staircases too, but they'd have to have a wide curve. If I get a chance to review it, I'll try it on the spiral stairs in my own home. I asked Eufy's representative about the MarsWalker's future compatibility, and he said the company plans to make other robot vacs that work with it. The MarsWalker has a way to go before it can truly conquer stairs—it doesn't clean the stairs themselves, after all. But if it works as Eufy hopes it will, this little robot can get from one floor to the next all by its onesie, saving you from having to carry your robot vacuum upstairs (which, if you're me, you just don't do) or buy separate vacuums for each floor. And really, it's probably a good thing for Eufy to try to master getting up and down the stairs first before moving onto the next thing. Eufy's robot vacuums, like many on the market today, can save multiple maps of your house so you can move them around, but with this new approach, it creates a full map of all of your floors without you having to initiate separate map-making runs for each floor. Eufy says the Omni S2 is aimed at solving a number of issues that robot vacuums have, not just their inability to climb stairs. Those include the robots' inability to adapt to different floor surfaces, terrible carpet performance, tendency to get their filters clogged with dust and pet hair, and the fact that even the best mop-bots can't actually disinfect your floors. The Omni S2, which Eufy expects to sell for $1,599 in the U.S. in January, will have 30,000Pa suction (that's higher than the Omni E28's 20,000Pa and way higher than the S1 Pro's 8,000Pa), a self-cleaning mop, and can rid floors of “99.999%” of bacteria and pathogens. Eufy says the Omni S2, even without the MarsWalker, uses those to avoid obstacles and messes, adapting to your home as it cleans. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Warner Bros. is suing AI startup Midjourney for copyright infringement, alleging that the company allows users to generate images and videos of characters like Superman, Batman, and Bugs Bunny without permission. As first reported by Reuters, Warner Bros. says that Midjourney knowingly engaged in wrongful conduct, noting that the company previously restricted subscribers from generating content based on infringing images but recently lifted those protections. “Midjourney has made a calculated and profit-driven decision to offer zero protection for copyright owners even though Midjourney knows about the breathtaking scope of its piracy and copyright infringement,” the complaint reads. Warner Bros.' lawsuit follows a similar one filed in June by Walt Disney and Universal against Midjourney for copyright infringement involving characters such as Darth Vader, Bart Simpson, Shrek, and others. In this case, Midjourney has argued that using those works to train generative AI models is legal under the fair use doctrine of U.S. copyright law.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>X, formerly Twitter, has started rolling out its new encrypted messaging feature called “Chat” or “XChat.” The company claims the new communication feature is end-to-end encrypted, meaning messages exchanged on it can only be read by the sender and their receiver, and — in theory — no one else, including X, can access them. Cryptography experts, however, are warning that X's current implementation of encryption in XChat should not be trusted. They're saying it's far worse than Signal, a technology widely considered the state of the art when it comes to end-to-end encrypted chat. In XChat, once a user clicks on “Set up now,” X prompts them to create a four-digit PIN, which will be used to encrypt the user's private key. Matthew Garrett, a security researcher who published a blog post about XChat in June, when X announced the new service and slowly started rolling it out, wrote that if the company doesn't use hardware security modules, or HSMs, to store the keys, then the company could tamper with the keys — brute-forcing them for example since they are only four digits — and potentially decrypt messages. An X engineer said in a post in June that the company does use HSMs, but neither he nor the company has provided any proof so far. “Until that's done, this is ‘trust us, bro' territory,” Garrett told TechCrunch. That makes the whole point of an end-to-end encrypted messaging platform moot. Garrett said that X “gives you the public key whenever you communicate with them, so even if they've implemented this properly, you can't prove they haven't made up a new key” and performed an AITM attack. X says it aims to “open source our implementation and describe the encryption technology in depth through a technical whitepaper later this year.” Finally, X doesn't offer “perfect forward secrecy,” a cryptographic mechanism by which every new message is encrypted with a different key, which means that if an attacker compromises the user's private key, they can only decrypt the last message, and not all the preceding ones. “And even if they were fully trustworthy to start with, they could stop being trustworthy and compromise trust in multiple ways … If they were either untrustworthy or incompetent during initial implementation, it's impossible to demonstrate that there's any security at all.” Matthew Green, a cryptography expert who teaches at Johns Hopkins University, agrees. “For the moment, until it gets a full audit by someone reputable, I would not trust this any more than I trust current unencrypted DMs,” Green told TechCrunch. (XChat is a separate feature that lives, at least for now, with the legacy Direct Messages.)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the world's most sought-after drugs has officially become a vital medication. The World Health Organization has just added semaglutide—the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy—to its list of essential medicines. GLP-1s have completely reshaped how clinicians treat type 2 diabetes and obesity, with more possible uses being explored or on the horizon—but the most effective versions are expensive, scarce, and often aren't covered by insurance. “The new editions of essential medicines lists mark a significant step toward expanding access to new medicines with proven clinical benefits and with high potential for global public health impact,” said Yukiko Nakatani, assistant director-general for health systems, access and data, in a statement. The WHO first released its list of essential medicines in 1977. The list was initially aimed at identifying the drugs most needed in developing countries, but it has since become a global guide, highlighting the medicines most likely to broadly improve public health worldwide. That's why it's so notable that semaglutide and two other GLP-1 drugs (dulaglutide and liraglutide) have been added to the essential medicines list this year. These drugs mimic GLP-1, a hormone that regulates the body's hunger cues and our metabolism, among other things. Tirzepatide—which combines GLP-1 with another hunger-related hormone, GIP-1—has also been added to the WHO's list. The drugs reliably help people with type 2 diabetes control their blood sugar, and they're much more effective at helping people lose weight than through diet and exercise alone. As effective as GLP-1 drugs are, they're also largely out of reach for many of the people most eligible to take them. Even with recent price drops, the latest versions still cost hundreds of dollars a month to buy out of pocket, and in the U.S., public and private insurers will often not cover them. Public health officials could take actions like prioritizing access to the people most likely to benefit from GLP-1s, encouraging the development of generic versions, and making them more easily available through primary care. “Achieving equitable access to essential medicines requires a coherent health system response backed by strong political will, multisectoral cooperation, and people-centered programs that leave no one behind,” said Deusdedit Mubangizi, the WHO's director of policy and standards for medicines and health products, in a statement. Canada is expected to become one of the first countries to approve generic versions of semaglutide as early as next year. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. In new Phase III trial data released Tuesday, people taking orforglipron lost substantially more weight than people taking a placebo. The Danish pharmaceutical company has struggled in recent months to meet its lofty sales expectations. The federal government is expected to start a 5-year-long experiment that will provide some limited coverage of obesity medications. In early animal tests, the experimental TDN triggered weight loss without nausea or vomiting. People who took semaglutide over a slower, more flexible schedule were significantly less likely to experience nausea and to discontinue use. New research published Tuesday concludes that the rising rate of extreme childhood obesity—well above the usual BMI cutoff—has become a "public health emergency."

Outside of manufacturing all around me there is talk of ditching Azure, Google and even AWS in spite of massive lock-in because the feeling that the USA is a trustworthy partner is completely gone. You can't just 'joke about invading Greenland' and expect everybody to move on as if it didn't happen. And I'm pretty sure that this isn't just local sample bias either, NL used to be pretty laid back when it came to silly details such as hosting providers and such.How long until the .COM registry becomes fair game for the nationalists? I'm not sure if that'd fully alleviate the risk for EU companies & governments, but I'd imagine it alleviates some of it. This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone given that it is an American company. Being a multinational corporation like Microsoft or Mercedes Benz means you have to navigate rather complex legal situations, follow not just your home country's laws, but also the laws of the countries that you are operating in. Plus, hiring for AWS / Azure / GCP experience is still much higher than for the smaller EU clouds. Since that facility is still owned by a company that is owned by a US company, the Cloud Act applies.Microsoft tried a similar thing in Germany and it failed.

Odds are they just wanted that person gone and the real reason can't be spoken out loud. Of course, what the law is doesn't really matter anymore. Or maybe the us of a had an oopsie. Right now they only get rewarded if they deport or collar somebody, so that's all they seem to care about, and letting in good people is seen as more of a nuisance they must do while trying to get notches for their promotion. Doesn't seem like much of an incentive to identify good productive people if the incentive scheme is defined as "accept a couple of hundred dollars" vs "don't accept a couple of hundred dollars"... There are already a few sprinkles here and there to reward them for stopping some of the bad people, but nothing if they let in a good person. Or that people responsible for processing visas and checking papers have been restricting numbers despite what their bosses and the wider public ask for. If you want more immigrants than the guidelines and quotas permit, the route to it isn't legalising bribery. I have worked abroad many times and work permits were always under heavy scrutiny by my own company, to the degree that we send one unhappy soul home mid week because some regulations were not met and he came back week smiling because he got a pay rise as comparable rated as local was a requirement. No one was sold on throwing international professionals in jail just for showing up to do a job they took in good faith. And so it shows up the horrifying implications of current policy. Take a drive through the streets of Duluth and you will see more signs in Korean than English. When I moved to the US on a K-1 fiancé visa, I stood in the non-immigrant line at LAX (moving at its usual glacial pace, well over an hour or more in line), only to be "told" that I was in the wrong line, because I was immigrating to the US (It's not: it's a non-immigrant visa with a defined path to immigration: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrat...).So after realizing I was arguing at a brick wall, I schlepped over to the (thankfully shorter, but still notable) immigrant visa line, waited, waited... with the absolutely predictable result that when I got to the counter I got a withering look and a tone that made it clear the agent felt she was speaking to a slow-minded child. "I know, that line sent me here." Thankfully that time I got a different agent. Nearly missed my connecting flight to Seattle, even though I had planned for a 4.5 hour layover for the visa process.

Being accurate is less important than trying to get the lie out in front of as many eyeballs as possible, so the lie can be repeated in front of people who might not realize this sort of information offhand. I am skeptical of even that number. The raid happened yesterday, you're telling me they have conclusive proof 450 people are working illegally less than 24 hours later? 450 koreans working here legally but not carrying papers on them because american is supposed to be a free country. 450 koreans working here legally but not carrying papers on them because american is supposed to be a free country. I am not an immigration judge or a prophet, so I don't know how every case will turn out, but 450 is a lot. It's enough that even if some are here legally, as would be expected since people are detained for reasonable suspicion not proof, it would still be hundreds of illegal immigrants.Most of the immigrants are not from South Korea, they're from central/south america. My understanding of the situation so far is that some South Koreans came here to manage the project, some on questionable visas themselves, and they hired hundreds of laborers (illegally). If you want to build a factory in the US you should follow the laws we have, you can't pick and choose which laws to follow.

Technically work visas are for working temporarily in the US, living permanently in the US requires a green card.Of course they probably wouldn't have deported him for that under Biden, the current administration is just trying to find every excuse to deport to meet quotas.

They have proven time and time again to lie and then double down when wrong. If you don't look American and don't have a US passport or a valid visa on your person, to the jail you go. They routinely arrest latino US citizens. When confronted with this, they then attempted to claim that those citizens actually attacked ICE agents.When confronted with video evidence to the contrary, they attempted to pursue charges, and have failed in almost all cases.ICE and ATF claims aren't worth the air they use up to say.

ICE and ATF claims aren't worth the air they use up to say. ICE, by their own account, has a pretty solid track record now of arresting people en masse, to pump up numbers, and then sorting out who is actually working illegally much later… after dehumanizing and incarcerating people unjustly.So, i don't believe their numbers and i don't believe that they know who they have arrested.

Whistleblowers and local reporting [0] indicate lax safety standards in the construction of the plant, with three dead by May. OSHA has opened at least fifteen investigations into the construction site [1]. The latest story on OSHA investigations is dated today [2], and it mentions that OSHA did not receive reports of several accidents. That might well be because some of the injured were undocumented workers. That recent report mentions Glovis EV Logistics America by name and two unidentified subcontractors as targets of the OSHA investigation.I would not be at all surprised if OSHA didn't have ICE raid this place to shut it down before more people got hurt.

So even if this ends up direly for some of them individually, they all personally are confident that won't be them. i think the reason there is no pushback is that things are happening to fast at an unprecedented scale that we can't even envision the consequences, let alone predict them. we are completely unprepared for this and by the time we can figure out how to deal with it, or even stop it, it will be to late.it is also possible that many believe that this will stop by itself with the next president, and so there is no point in trying to stop things now. in a way i actually agree with that. walking in unity but realizing your error and changing course is a better choice than risking a civil war.civil war sounds alarmist, and maybe it is, but i fear that without consensus on what is the right course of action, worse without consensus that the current trajectory is bad, i don't see any other outcome. before anything can be done, a consensus on what that should be is simply necessary. and unfortunately, it should be obvious that there is no such consensus now. if there were, we wouldn't even have this controversy. it is also possible that many believe that this will stop by itself with the next president, and so there is no point in trying to stop things now. in a way i actually agree with that. walking in unity but realizing your error and changing course is a better choice than risking a civil war.civil war sounds alarmist, and maybe it is, but i fear that without consensus on what is the right course of action, worse without consensus that the current trajectory is bad, i don't see any other outcome. before anything can be done, a consensus on what that should be is simply necessary. and unfortunately, it should be obvious that there is no such consensus now. if there were, we wouldn't even have this controversy. civil war sounds alarmist, and maybe it is, but i fear that without consensus on what is the right course of action, worse without consensus that the current trajectory is bad, i don't see any other outcome. before anything can be done, a consensus on what that should be is simply necessary. and unfortunately, it should be obvious that there is no such consensus now. if there were, we wouldn't even have this controversy. On the other side every democracy looses a bit focus over time and laws to keep government clean get softened, IMHO.But let's say the next election happens and the opposition will be voted in (if not, god knows where this ends) , then there will be a government with a state apparatus in tatas. They have the burden but also the opportunity to rethink how things are supposed to work and can make changes that most previous governments did not even thought possible.Maybe, I don't know. But maybe this slightly painful time is part of a renewal process that in the end will be helpful. And Trump of all people makes it involuntary possible.

So that we do not depend on their virtue, or put confidence in our rulers, but in the people who are to choose them. > To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people, is a chimerical idea.

Similarly, Germany was the de facto enemy of the Ally aligned world in the 40s and only a few short decades later best friends with most.You can identify countless similar atrocities in US history after which relations stabilized within a few years.Most in life are short term oriented and it's rare that these things produce lasting effects on perception.Does anyone care or even remotely think about what Bush did as president 20 years ago? Some politically oriented and historically minded folks yes, 99% no.They really have to be long lasting and persistent transgressions to produce generational distrust e.g. Japan invading China/Korea many times over the last few hundred years.However the new gen seems far less concerned about this too.Given Trump's larger than life character/ego/presence, it's more likely that anything he does will be attributed to him instead of the country as a whole. Which makes his actions perhaps even less impactful than a more neutral presenting president doing the same.

A few years after the bombs, Douglas MacArthur was ruling Japan. They didn't have much of a choice. Japan was occupied for almost 7 years, had their constitution rewritten to make them essentially reliant on the US for security. It's undeniable that by and large Japanese sentiment towards the US bounced back quickly, despite a traumatic and expansive war Those were both significant events in their own right and fundamental causes of the Trump presidencies. Then Trump decided his shitty Nobel Prize mattered more and threw 20 years of hard work in the dump.The consensus in India is that America is perfidious. You claim that countries have goldfish memories, but that doesn't seem to be the case with Indo-American relations. Maybe you have an insight into how Indian people think.

People cheered both Trump elections and were dead terrified of a blue win ruining contracts and business.I don't ask because I am overtly political, I ask because I think it's fascinating that both sides seem to think we're a stone's throw from the apocalypse.. which very much seems to be projected onto the voter base on purpose..

The effects of this insular isolationism can only be explained by simplicity that doesn't hold up in reality: things will be more prosperous for us if we keep what we have to ourselves.

Absolute howler.It's a (pretty white supremacist-coded) fantasy to say that immigrants don't assimilate. They typically assimilate better than native-born citizens! Meanwhile the most economically dominant states are extremely ethnically diverse, and have been for the past century.> People coming here and extracting value from the economy to send home is also a problem.Another example of what would be a knee-slapper if it were a joke, but it is actually white supremacist dog whistle.

Some people would be good for the country, and some people would be bad. I'm speaking of individuals here, not groups. The issue is that the electorate at large feels like it has been given a choice between two extremes: "Effectively allow ANYONE to come here and stay as long as they want" and "Don't let ANYONE come here". If you give a people a choice of two extremes, don't be surprised if they choose the extremism you don't like.Reconceptualize MAGA as voting AGAINST what the Democrats are offering, instead of FOR what Trump is offering, and it might make more sense. Reconceptualize MAGA as voting AGAINST what the Democrats are offering, instead of FOR what Trump is offering, and it might make more sense. Why should voters trust that Kamala Harris will implement immigration policies they want? Why should they expect her not to yield to the most extreme elements in her party, which believe that borders are a fiction and should not exist? Look at Barack Obama's "evolution" on gay marriage over the course of his political career. Now take an issue that is far more important than gay marriage - how is she going to stop unlimited unskilled immigration? How is she going to stop fraudulent claims of refugee status? How is the whole immigration problem itself going to be solved, if you posit that every one of the 10 million "unauthorized immigrants", and every one of the refugee claimants, needs multiple appearances in court to resolve their situation? This is expected behavior, but not to be taken seriously as a moral argument. It's a little more complicated than what you wrote, but basically: yes. [edit] Example study construction: pick some issue where there's been a heavy propaganda push against it from one party, but a law they opposed passed anyway. Ideally, something like a tax increase, that can directly affect voters in a way they might reasonably be expected to understand and know about. Observe that the (say) tax hike affects not more than 2% of the population you're studying. Observe that 35% or 40% of people say the new tax law increased their taxes, and very nearly all of them favor the party that opposed the hike and was claiming or implying it would affect more people than it did.Repeat similar studies over a period of decades, always with familiar outcomes. Draw conclusions.Separately, you can probe basic understanding of how our government & various policies or laws work. You'll find half of everyone not knowing how marginal income tax rates work, that almost all the people who think our foreign aid spending is way too high believe it's 10x, 20x, 30x higher than it actually is, et c. Generally speaking, voters hardly know how anything works, so of course they buy lies about it. That's not me being shitty, it's what the evidence overwhelmingly says is true. And this is far from an exhaustive treatment of alarming traits & behaviors of the electorate.

The 2nd term is making fundamental changes to our economy that carry a promise of bearing fruit. Not only are those promises generally contested by economic experts, the short-term results have been unsurprisingly poor.

The company has blossomed with more than 200 customers in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Australia, and its revenue has more than doubled year-over-year. With the new funding, FarmHQ plans to expand its technology and services for farms that use center pivot irrigation, which is the most common sprinkler system but tricky to automate. The sprinklers create circular crop patterns visible when flying over agricultural areas. While FarmHQ is marking significant growth, it has also been navigating challenges created by new U.S. tariffs on China and Canada. The trade battles are creating “confusion and frustration,” Wallace said. Wallace and his brother Connor founded their company is 2020. RELATED: Irrigation tech startup led by farming experts blossoms with revenue growth and new cash Their technology regulates the water flow and shares irrigation data in real time to a smart phone dashboard. Irrigation innovation could help the agricultural sector, which is getting hammered economically as costs rise and profits decline. In the U.S., that's being driven in large part by a labor shortage that has worsened as the Trump administration has pursued and arrested undocumented workers. “Automation, digital transformation and workforce development are key strategies to address the labor shortage,” states a June 2025 report from FTI Consulting. Additionally, water conservation is becoming increasingly important as the planet continues warming. Wallace said customers are happy with FarmHQ's products and services, which includes perks like free replacements for sensors should they break. Agtech investments worldwide have been in steady decline since 2021, according to PitchBook data.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Isotopes AI came out of stealth on Thursday with a healthy $20 million seed round. With LLMs, business managers can ask questions of their data in natural language. Isotopes' agent, Aidnn, can provide answers and draft complex planning documents, gathering data from wherever it's stored, like finance apps, ERP, CRM, and cloud storage. Their product is so sophisticated, the startup has already applied for 10 patents, co-founder CEO Arun Murthy told TechCrunch. Just over 20 years ago, when Murthy was in his mid-20s, he worked at Yahoo on the team that built an open source project called Hadoop. In 2011, Yahoo spun it out into a company called Hortonworks, with Murthy as co-founder and chief product officer. The merged company was taken private in 2021 after famed activist investor Carl Icahn got involved. Murthy went to Cloudera for a few years during that turmoil, managing about 200 people. He remembers quarterly conference calls with Wall Street analysts grilling execs on operating details. In 2021, he left that job with no real plan on what to do next, and a VC introduced him to Scale AI's Alexandr Wang. It was like “getting a PhD at Scale,” he describes. “Understanding what drives these models and how to improve them.” But when his old buddy from Hortonworks, Prasanth Jayachandran, called him, the two decided to do their own AI startup. They persuaded their third-cofounder, Gopal Vijayaraghavan, also from the Hortonworks days, to join them and in late 2024 founded Isotopes. Their seed round was led by Vab Goel at NTTVC. The founders' backgrounds has allowed them to build an agent that can find data from wherever it is stored (be it Salesforce or Snowflake), but then also clean the data. The agent also maintains plenty of context memory to be useful for complex tasks. For example, if the team is asking Aidnn to draft a report on monthly recurring revenue trends, “the data that you want to chat with actually doesn't exist, at least the form that you need to chat with. Incumbents like Salesforce's Tableau already offer agents (amid Salesforce's major AI agent push), and plenty of other startup founders with impressive pedigrees are in the market, too, such as WisdomAI.

The Legion Go 2 still has an 8.8-inch display and detachable controllers, but adds the new AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor, up to 32GB of RAM, hall effect joysticks, and more. The design is very similar to the prototype shown at CES earlier this year, but now we know much more. This makes enough sense, considering the majority of modern AAA games couldn't run at that high resolution. Lenovo is making up for the lost pixels by using an OLED touchscreen with a variable refresh rate of 30 Hz - 144 Hz. Additionally, Lenovo is offering up to 2TB of storage on board, with a microSD card slot that can support another 2TB. The controllers now have Hall effect joysticks that should prevent drift, and a redesigned D-Pad sits on a pivot disk. They also feature three customizable buttons through Legion Space and still feature the "FPS mode" from the previous generation, letting you use the right controller like a vertical mouse.The right controller still has a touchpad, but there is not a corresponding one on the left side. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The ports haven't changed — Lenovo still offers two USB Type-C ports (one on top and one on the bottom), a microSD card slot on the bottom, and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. Now, the power button has a fingerprint reader for faster login.The Legion Go 2 is set to launch in October, starting at $1,049.00. That's quite a bit more than the original Legion Go, which launched at $749.99 in 2023. Lenovo also announced its new LOQ Tower 26ADR10, a 26-liter system using AMD's Ryzen 7 8745HX mobile processor and Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs, up to an RTX 5070 Ti. The system also features two HDD expansion slots to add even more storage. The LOQ desktop is set to launch this month, starting at $999.99. Andrew E.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Its IFA concepts can rotate or follow you around. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. It consistently pushes the boundaries of what form factors are possible with its products, as seen in the eye-catching ThinkPad Plus G6, which features a rollable screen. As Lucas Rossi, Executive Vice President of Lenovo and President of the Intelligent Devices Group, told us in a roundtable discussion at IFA, "I think we have the credit for the company that takes more risks. Lenovo showed off its first foldable laptop concept in 2017. At the time, the ideas and technology behind that foldable project couldn't immediately be incorporated into a production product. With that in mind, it's possible that we'll see the fruits of Lenovo's labor with the ThinkBook VertiFlex Concept and Smart Motion Concept in future products. However, the ThinkBook VertiFlex, which leaked last week as “Project Pivo,” features a 14-inch display that can rotate without you needing to stow the keyboard (like a 2-in-1 convertible). Instead, the lid contains a pivot point that allows the screen to rotate from its standard landscape orientation to portrait mode. Lenovo says that this capability for an on-demand portrait mode allows the display to become more ergonomic, letting you see more text on the screen when editing documents or displaying code. Then, when you want to watch a movie or play a game, you just pivot the screen back into its default landscape orientation. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The switch (in software) from landscape to portrait is instantaneous, and the ThinkBook VertiFlex is still in ultrabook territory, weighing just 3.06 pounds with a thickness of just 0.7 inches. Typically, they're in a long rectangular or stubby book-shaped form factor and sit on your desk to connect your various peripherals, laptops, and storage devices. The Smart Motion Concept still has that standard dock functionality, with the usual assortment of USB, video, and Ethernet ports, but it also serves as a stand for your laptop. But Lenovo adds a dash of AI to its Smart Motion Concept by using your laptop's built-in webcam and a motorized gimbal system to track your head movements and alter the position of your laptop, in conjunction with the stand, to keep it at the peak of ergonomic efficiency using a motorized gimbal system. The dock can even take input from your laptop's microphones to track where your voice is coming from when you're speaking. It's eerie to see the Smart Motion Concept working in person as it turns and adjusts its height as you move from side to side or up and down. In practice, it works similarly to last year's Lenovo Auto Twist AI PC concept. But building this functionality into a dock makes more sense, since you won't have to toss out all those expensive motors and the motion tracking when it's time to upgrade to a new laptop. There's no guarantee that either the ThinkBook VertiFlex Concept or the Smart Motion Concept will make it to production. Brandon Hill is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware.

In 2016, the Louvre's curators rushed to relocate priceless artworks after the Seine, which flows through Paris, breached its banks in a flood. Hundreds of Parisian buildings rely on this network—but none more than the Louvre. An average-size office building draws about half a megawatt of cooling power, whereas the Louvre soaks up 12 megawatts, Nayral explains. Water is 800 times denser than air, so using it to soak up heat can be extremely efficient. Plus, unlike traditional air conditioners, water-based cooling avoids dumping heat into the air directly outside a building, which heightens the temperature of built-up areas relative to their surroundings, known as the urban heat island effect. While river- and lake-fed cooling networks are growing in Paris, Toronto, and the US, for example, there are headaches on the horizon. As the world warms, buildings are demanding more and more cooling—plus, some bodies of water are getting so hot in the summer that their usefulness for cooling purposes is dwindling. District cooling networks may seem an innovative response to climate change but, all the same, climate change could push some of these systems to their limits. As the water temperature of the Seine rises as a result of climate change, its cooling potential diminishes. “In the old days, it was more like a luxury project,” says Deo de Klerk, team lead for heating and cooling solutions at the Dutch energy firm Eneco. Eneco has 33 heating and cooling projects under construction. In Rotterdam, Netherlands, one of the company's installations helps to cool buildings, including apartment blocks, police offices, a theater and restaurants, using water from the River Meuse. It's not hard to see why cooling technologies are getting more popular. A few years ago, Nayral moved out of Paris. Nayral would sit there well into the evening—reading Les Misérables, no less—waiting for her apartment to cool down. Recently, she has increasingly found herself spending time in shopping malls, where air-conditioning is plentiful, in order to make it through searing hot French summers. This year, unprecedented heat waves hit France and other countries in Europe. A key component of Parisian climate adaptation plans is the river-supplied cooling network, the pipes for which currently cover a distance of 100 kilometers, though this is due to expand to 245 km by 2042. While around 800 buildings are served by the network today, those in charge aim to supply 3,000 buildings by that future date. Systems such as Paris' do not pump river water around properties. Rather, a loop of pipework brings river water into facilities where it soaks up warmth from a separate, closed loop of water that connects to buildings. Essentially, heat from, say, a packed conference room or tourist-filled art gallery is gradually transferred—pipe by pipe—to a river or lake. In the winter, when offices, museums, and hospitals still require some air-conditioning, the COP can be as high as 15, much higher than conventional air-conditioning systems. But those summer temperatures are increasingly a concern. Future, stronger heat waves could evaporate more of that overhead. Can we run the chillers at a higher temperature range, so we can still have a heat exchange with the River Seine—or do we want to develop other facilities?” says Nayral. Those other facilities could include underground reservoirs of cool water. My suggestion of deepening or otherwise altering the Seine to increase the volume of water in it, potentially helping it to maintain lower temperatures, is politely rebuffed, however. I ask the question, however, because there are some district cooling networks that rely on much deeper water—which is consistently cool all year round. One example is the lake-source cooling system used by Cornell University in upstate New York. “People are so proud of this project,” says Fengqi You, professor in energy systems engineering at the university. Cornell's network pumps water from the gigantic Lake Cayuga nearby, accessing it at a depth of 76 meters. So effective is this system that it can provide about 98 percent of the annual cooling load required by 113 buildings on Cornell's campus. This network does use some mechanical refrigeration, but it has an overall COP of around 20, says Cole Tucker, interim associate vice president for energy and sustainability at Cornell: “So, I mean, it's pretty incredible.” However, even Tucker acknowledges that rising temperatures mean the demand for cooling is rising, and this will increase the university's reliance on mechanical chillers. Part of the lake-based cooling system installed in Toronto. Like Cornell's, this network also relies on cold lake water harvested at a considerable depth: 83 meters. “There really aren't many systems like this globally,” says Carson Gemmill, vice president of solutions and innovation at Enwave. The water removed from the lake actually goes on to become drinking water at a treatment plant in this case. After being treated, the water picks up heat from city buildings when it intersects with heat exchangers and the urban cooling loop. “We just warm up that drinking water a little bit,” says Gemmill, noting that only heat is transferred—there's no risk of contaminating the drinking water somehow. Gemmill explains that new pipes carrying cool water were placed within a concrete floor at the base of these specially constructed tunnels, which are around 3 to 4 meters in diameter. Using large bodies of water as giant heat sinks makes sense, given how much heat they can absorb, says Martin Hendel, a researcher at ESIEE Paris, an engineering school within Gustave Eiffel University. However, district cooling networks including Paris' can be expensive to install and maintain—meaning they work best in densely populated areas such as cities where large numbers of people will likely benefit from them. “These things are usually built for areas that have a lot of office space,” adds Hendel. “Office space tends to be cooled all year round.” That's partly in response to the heat generated by servers and computer equipment. Nayral acknowledges that expanding Paris' cooling network is tricky. France's capital is drenched in history—so digging in new infrastructure is often slowed by the requirement to allow archaeologists time to excavate any potentially important artifacts. But Nayral points out that, in some areas, Paris' network makes use of the large old tunnels of the city's sewer system. There's enough room to sling the cooling network's pipes into these, she explains. If the network is to expand as intended and more than double in just 17 years, then the engineers working on it will need to use every avenue, or tunnel, available to them. “In past centuries, access to heat was really a social gap between rich and poor,” says Nayral, noting that, today, it is perhaps access to cool spaces that increasingly divides us. “This is the job of cities,” says Nayral, “to provide shelter.” WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Lenovo isn't shy about trying new things. By default, the ThinkBook VertiFlex Concept looks like a normal 14-inch laptop. Look closely at the screen's edge, however, and you'll see a second layer jutting out; that's the actual screen. The back panel the screen is mounted on has a felt backing to keep everything smooth and scratch-free, and you can even prop a phone up here in this orientation. There's a mechanism inside that manages the motion and keeps it operating smoothly. Despite this, the PC is still fairly slim at 17.9 mm, and it weighs roughly 3 pounds. (The 14-inch MacBook Pro is around 15 mm thick and weighs 3.4 pounds.) Having a vertical screen is a game-changer, as it's perfect for applications that utilize more vertical space. Email is a great example, so are apps like Slack, anything to do with PDFs, and even most word processing software. But I've yet to change my screen orientation in the middle of a workflow. With the VertiFlex, the idea is that I'd use the standard laptop screen when watching a video or browsing the web, and then switch it to portrait orientation when I need to work on a document or am responding to teammates in Slack. Unlike some of Lenovo's more recent concepts, this one isn't adding more screen space, just changing how you use the laptop. The good thing is that there's no real delay going from one orientation to another, so it'll be interesting to see how this impacts day-to-day use and if it will improve the way we work or hamper it. Lenovo has previously turned some of its concepts into purchasable products, like the $3,500 ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable, so don't be too surprised to see the VertiFlex hit store shelves at some point. Since it doesn't require a flexible OLED screen that folds or rolls, the cost could be significantly lower than some of these other devices, which is always a plus. That's what the Lenovo Smart Motion Concept is all about. It's a laptop stand equipped with motors that can raise whatever laptop rests on top, lower it, and swivel it around so that the screen is always facing you. It can do all of this motion by tracking your face via the webcam, or via a ring you wear that supports gesture controls. The stand also doubles as a docking station, with multiple ports at the base to connect various peripherals. The rest of Lenovo's IFA announcements are not as eye-catching, a mix of spec bumps for specific laptops or other minor updates to existing devices, like the new Glacier White color for the ThinkPad X9. There are a handful of new products, though. Lenovo announced two new midrange and budget Android tablets, the Yoga Tab ($550) and the Idea Tab Plus ($270), not to mention Lenovo's first-ever 26-liter gaming tower, the LOQ Tower 26ADR10 ($1,000), and a 4K 31.5-inch OLED monitor with a 240-Hz screen refresh rate—the Legion Pro 32UD-10 ($1,100). Lenovo also shared more concrete availability and pricing details of its hyped-up Legion Go 2 gaming handheld, which it first revealed at CES 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And there's another good reason why so many real-world signals are sparse (as you say) in the FT domain in particular: because so many real-world systems involve periodic motion (rotating motors, fly's wings as you noted, etc). If the world didn't contain so many stable systems, or equivalently if the laws of physics didn't allow so, then likely life would not have existed. All life is complex chemical structures, and they require stability to function.

We have discovered a method (calculus) to mathematcally describe continuous functions of various sorts and within calculus there is a particular toolbox (differential and partial differential equations) we have built to mathematically describe systems that are changing by describing that change.The fact that systems which change are well-described by the thing we have made to describe systems which change shouldn't be at all surprising. We have been working on this since the 18th century and Euler and many other of the smartest humans ever devoted considerable effort to making it this good.When you look at things like the chaotic behaviour of a double pendulum, you see how the real world is extremely difficult to capture precisely and as good as our system is, it still has shortcomings even in very simple cases.

A learning that describes chaos well enough may not want to be associated with "calculus", or even "math" (ask a friendly reverse mathematician about that)https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2021/04/09/period-three-impli...Somewhat tangentially, if Ptolemy I had responded (to Euclid) with anything less specific ---but much more personal--- than "check your postulate", we wouldn't have had to wait one millennium. (Fermat did the best he could given margin & ego, so that took only a century or so (for that country to come up with a workable strategy))Less tangentially, I'd generalize Quigley by mentioning that groups of hominids stymie themselves with a kind of emergent narcissism. After all, heuristics,rules and even values informed by experience & intuition are a sort of arrogance. "Tautology" should be outlawed in favour of "Narcissism" as a prosocial gaslighting term :) https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2021/04/09/period-three-impli...Somewhat tangentially, if Ptolemy I had responded (to Euclid) with anything less specific ---but much more personal--- than "check your postulate", we wouldn't have had to wait one millennium.

Here's a recent experiment: https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/04/m365_copilot_uk_gover...A fairly common pattern seems to be emerging; users _believe_ that it makes them more productive, but attempts to actually measure this don't show that. A fairly common pattern seems to be emerging; users _believe_ that it makes them more productive, but attempts to actually measure this don't show that. If you enabled your market analysts to make twice as many trades per day, you will likely lose money if they actually did that. If the individual is more productive, they can work fewer hours. A very large proportion of the  people I've worked with over my career would absolutely work less hard if they could get away with it. > We've managed to convince the biggest tech companies to invest trillions into tech that doesn't replace SWEs, rather, a new dev tool at our disposal to make some aspects of our job easier: search and tedious coding tasks, saving us time.https://fosstodon.org/@erock/115112206590198248</p>
