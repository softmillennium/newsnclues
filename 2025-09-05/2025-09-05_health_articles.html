                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Together, they highlight the importance of multidisciplinary, personalized approaches to digestive health and nutrition. Researchers found that stress from life circumstances can disrupt the brain-gut-microbiome balance. The paper examined how social factors, such as income, education, health care access, and biological aspects, interact with the brain-gut-microbiome to influence eating habits and obesity. By understanding these interactions, clinicians can better tailor treatment and support to individuals living with obesity, ultimately enhancing outcomes and quality of life. In the first general population study of its kind, researchers found that adults with disorders of gut-brain interaction are significantly more likely to screen positive for symptoms of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. The study highlights the need for routine avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder screening and integrated GI-mental-nutritional health care to better support patients with disorders of gut-brain interaction. Key takeaway: These papers show that gut-brain communication is central to eating behavior disorders and that non-biological stressors - like discrimination or past illness - can shape physiological responses. Clinical tools must address not just what patients eat, but why.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As BioDlink, a leading global CDMO, affirms its commitment to strategic alliances to support biotech innovation worldwide as it marks 15 years of operations. Alliances are gaining momentum across the APAC region, where the first half of 2025 has seen a sharp rise in collaboration—24 new regional partnerships and counting—signaling a shift toward quality, speed, and cost efficiency. Dr. Jun Liu, CEO and Executive Director of BioDlink, notes that biotech companies are increasingly joining trusted ecosystems like BioDlink's to accelerate development and manufacturing to grow the market together in their globalization strategy. These companies demand not only high quality and fast delivery, but also a blend between quality, speed, and cost. Complex therapies such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) demand meticulous fine-tuning to optimize combinations and targets, making reliable, agile partnerships essential. For ADCs, we can complete the entire process from DNA synthesis to toxicology study material release in just 7 months, and the full IND application within 11 months. In the face of global competition, it is more important to build a win-win global ecosystem than go for the lowest price. Dr. Jun Liu, CEO and Executive Director, BioDlink BioDlink's ongoing collaboration with GlycanLink exemplifies this approach, developing the GL-DisacLink® platform, an advanced site-specific conjugation (1-enzyme 1-step) technology that enhances ADC stability and efficacy beyond conventional linker methods. BDKcell®, BioDlink's proprietary cell line construction platform, has a rapid development cycle of 14 weeks. These innovations offer significant process advantages, including high uniformity, simplified workflows, short reaction times, reduced off-target effects, and reduced overall production costs. Building on a strong foundation of 107 pre-clinical studies, 38 clinical studies and 8 pre-BLA studies (as of December 31, 2024), BioDlink's global growth strategy is laser-focused on leveraging key areas such as ADCs, providing differentiated value to alliance partners, and unlocking ecosystem synergy, for instance, Kexing Biopharm covers global licensing, while BioDlink focuses on commercial supply. Partnering with innovative biotechs like MediLink Therapeutics, Escugen, and Smart Nuclide, BioDlink has emerged as the go-to CDMO for ADC and RDC projects. Furthermore, BioDlink's comprehensive CDMO platform for antibody drugs (mAbs/BsAbs), ADCs, fusion proteins, and other bioconjugates delivers: BioDlink's competitive edge stems from its one-base, end-to-end streamlined platform for antibody drugs, ADCs, fusion proteins and other bioconjugates focused on three core customer needs: quality, speed, and cost-efficiency. Dr. Jun Liu also highlights: “Within China, we were among the first CDMOs to focus on antibodies and ADC-based antibodies and retain a first-mover advantage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Students who lean on coffee and energy drinks to power through nonstop studying may be fueling the very stress, anxiety, and depression they are trying to fight, new research warns. Study: Caffeine Intake Mediates the Relationship Between Problematic Overstudying and Psychological Distress. Excessive caffeine intake may be associated with and potentially aggravate psychological distress in students with problematic overstudying behavior, as reported by a new study published in the journal Nutrients. Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive substance worldwide. Primarily obtained from coffee, caffeine improves alertness, attention, cognitive functions, and performance during physically and mentally demanding tasks. These properties make caffeine most popular among university students, who sometimes consume energy drinks to boost their performance while studying. However, existing evidence indicates that excessive caffeine intake can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and panic attacks. Caffeine is known to directly act on the Hypothalamic–Pituitary–Adrenal axis, leading to increased secretion of stress hormones, potentiation of cardiovascular and neuroendocrine stress reactivity, and subsequent induction of overall stress level. Given the higher reliance of students on caffeine intake for performance boosting and the possible negative impact of caffeine on psychological distress, the current study was designed to investigate whether caffeine intake mediates the association between problematic overstudying and psychological distress among university students. Problematic overstudying, also known as compulsive studying behavior or study addiction, is an addictive behavior and an early form of work addiction. Such behavior can potentially reduce functioning in other life domains and trigger negative health consequences. Like the characteristic features of excessive caffeine intake, study addiction is associated with states of high alertness and arousal despite increasing fatigue, which in turn can lead to high and chronic stress and poor quality of life. Given these similarities, the current study aimed to explore the stress-mediating role of caffeine among students with study addiction. All participants were asked to provide information on their daily caffeine intake for the mediation analysis. Higher levels of study addiction symptoms were linked with greater caffeine intake and higher levels of perceived stress, anxiety, and depression in both groups. A similar mediating effect of caffeine intake on the relationship between study addiction and anxiety and depression was observed only among students from the second group. The study suggests that caffeine intake may partially contribute to increased risk of stress, anxiety, and depression among university students with study addiction. Students who are addicted to studying are more likely to consume caffeine, as observed in the study. The mediating effects of caffeine were small and partial, highlighting the presence of other factors, including excessive efforts, perfectionism, and social isolation, which may also contribute to higher levels of perceived stress, anxiety, and depression in addicted individuals. Students consider excessive caffeine intake as a coping strategy, as caffeine triggers arousal, improves attention and alertness, reduces fatigue and pain, enhances mood, and helps distract from problems. However, in students with study addiction, high intake of caffeine may function as a maladaptive and potentially addictive pattern of mood regulation, rather than an effective coping strategy. The study finds a positive association between caffeine intake and depression among students from the second group, which contradicts previous reports stating that higher caffeine intake is associated with a lower risk of depression. However, in line with the current study findings,  prior research has reported that higher caffeine intake is associated with an increased risk of suicidal tendency among shift workers. This study suggests that shift workers consume more caffeine due to long working hours and sleep deprivation, which in turn increases the risk of depression. The study did not find any mediating effect of caffeine intake on the relationship between study addiction and anxiety and depression among students belonging to the first group. This might be due to insufficient statistical power from the small sample size. Overall, the study findings suggest limiting caffeine intake and promoting healthy alternatives, such as rest and recovery, to support the mental health of students with problematic overstudying.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite vaccines and treatments, SARS-CoV-2-the virus that causes COVID-19-continues to pose a global health threat, driven by new variants and its ability to hijack human cells in ways that still aren't fully understood. Now, scientists at Scripps Research have pinpointed dozens of human proteins that SARS-CoV-2 needs to complete its full life cycle, from entering a cell to replicating and releasing new viral particles. Published in PLOS Biology on June 12, 2025, these findings could open the door to new drug strategies that target our own proteins rather than the virus itself, potentially leading to new treatments effective against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, even as the pathogens continue to evolve. To find out which human proteins SARS-CoV-2 relies on, the research team used a technique called genome-wide small interfering RNA (siRNA) screening. By identifying the human proteins that coronaviruses rely on, we can now think about developing the next generation of pan-coronavirus therapies-treatments that could be effective not just against today's SARS-CoV-2, but even a future SARS-CoV-3. Because these strategies target the host, they're also less likely to be undermined by viral mutations and drug resistance." Among the proteins identified, two emerged as especially promising drug targets. The first, perlecan, is a large protein studded with sugar chains found in the extracellular matrix-the supportive meshwork that surrounds and organizes our cells. The research team discovered that SARS-CoV-2's spike protein can latch directly onto perlecan's sugar chains, helping the virus attach to and enter human cells. Blocking that interaction could prevent infection from taking hold. "Perlecan could be acting almost like a co-receptor for the virus," says co-senior author Laura Martin-Sancho, who was formerly a staff research scientist at Scripps Research and is now an assistant professor of molecular virology at Imperial College London. The second protein, Baculoviral IAP Repeat Containing 2 (BIRC2), is part of a cellular inflammation pathway. In cultures of human cells and in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, drug compounds known as second mitochondria-derived activators of caspases (Smac) mimetics-originally developed to trigger cell death in cancer and to "wake up" dormant HIV so it can be targeted by the therapy-successfully inhibited BIRC2, slashing viral levels in an animal model. "To suddenly see them show antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 was a big surprise." Of the 47 proteins tested, 17 were consistently used by all three viruses, including proteins that help viruses fuse with cells, copy themselves, and exit to infect new cells. This suggests that blocking human proteins that the viruses depend on could form the basis of drugs effective against past, current and potentially future pandemic coronaviruses. Next, the researchers plan to explore whether the same host proteins are also used by other respiratory pathogens such as influenza and RSV. They'll also continue testing the safety and efficacy of promising compounds in future studies. Global siRNA screen identifies human host factors critical for SARS-CoV-2 replication and late stages of infection.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is the first study to examine 25 years of national data on hypertensive kidney disease deaths across all U.S. states and major demographic groups. Despite national efforts to reduce health inequalities, Black individuals still had over three times the death rate compared to other groups of people." candidate and internal medicine resident at Wayne State University/Henry Ford Rochester Hospital in Detroit Untreated high blood pressure can lead to serious outcomes, such as heart attack, stroke, heart failure and progression to kidney failure. Globally, the rate of death from chronic kidney disease increased 24% from 1990 to 2021, according to the American Heart Association's 2025 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics. This study, looking at data from 1999 – 2023, found age-adjusted mortality rate (AAMR) for hypertensive kidney disease deaths increased 48%. Men, people living in the South and Black or Hispanic adults had higher than average death rates. "High blood pressure isn't just about strokes or heart attacks - it's also a major cause of kidney disease and death, especially in Black and Hispanic communities," said Nyongbella. In this study, researchers reviewed data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) WONDER database from 1999 to 2023 for all death certificates noted with hypertensive renal disease as the cause of death. "This study provides important observational data indicating a concerning rise (48%) in age-adjusted deaths due to high blood pressure-related kidney disease over the last 25 years, especially among men, and Black and Hispanic individuals," said American Heart Association volunteer expert Sidney C. Smith Jr., M.D., FAHA. "These findings are in line with the recently released 2025 AHA/ACC High Blood Pressure Guideline and AHA's Presidential Advisory on Cardiovascular Kidney Metabolic (CKM) Health. Both papers emphasize the importance of early treatment for high blood pressure, its direct link to kidney disease, as well as the impact of social factors among high-risk populations." Of note, the study relied solely on death certificate data, which may include errors due to missing or mislabeled causes of death.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He began to experience sudden brain vibration and loss of movement on the left side of his body. His son Robert, a professional boxer who is unfortunately all too familiar with head injuries, recognized the symptoms right away and called 911. An emergency medical services (EMS) team from NYU Langone quickly responded. Paramedics Julia Mishiyeva and Keiji Shibata, who have worked for NYU Langone EMS for nearly 25 years combined, have seen countless stroke calls, but this case stands out as one where every step went right. Stroke calls demand rapid and precise action. When the pair arrived at Richard's home, Mishiyeva and Shibata instantly began a targeted assessment. Once Richard was safely moved to the ambulance, they administered supplemental oxygen and activated a stroke code before leaving the scene, alerting NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn's stroke team. This early coordination meant that a CT scanner was ready, along with lifesaving treatments, such as the clot-busting medication tenecteplase (TNK), that could be considered the moment he arrived. Both paramedics credit NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn's system for making the handoff seamless. At NYU Langone, a stroke alert is activated immediately—neurology, radiology, and the full team are ready in advance. "In Richard's case, everything lined up," Mishiyeva added. That's what led to such a great outcome." "The doctors were waiting for me as soon as we arrived and diagnosed the clot," Sabbagh said. Matthew D. Sanger, MD, a vascular neurologist at NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn, who oversaw Richard's care, credits the outcome to preparation and collaboration. "This was a textbook example of how our multidisciplinary approach—spanning neurology, emergency medicine, radiology, nursing, and therapy—sets us apart. We work together seamlessly to achieve the best patient outcome," he said, "and Richard is the perfect example of that." Within hours, Sabbagh's symptoms had dramatically improved, and just two days after his stroke, he was discharged home and required no significant rehabilitation. A stroke survivor once before, having had a transient ischemic attack seven years ago, Richard is now more committed than ever to his health. "If it wasn't for the team at NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn—the paramedics, the ER staff, and Dr. Sanger—I don't know where I'd be today." Robert echoes that sentiment: "My father's care was nothing short of incredible. My advice to other families is simple: pay attention to the warning signs and don't waste time." NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn is a Joint Commission-certified Comprehensive Stroke Center, recognized for providing around-the-clock advanced stroke care and accredited rehabilitation services, and has earned Get With The Guidelines®-Stroke Gold Plus, Target: Stroke Elite Plus, and Target: Stroke Advanced Therapy Honor Roll awards.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A newly published clinical trial in Nutrients highlights pork's role in military nutrition, showing that meals containing lean pork support better recovery, mood and anabolic status in cadets performing intense tactical fitness exercises compared to plant-based meals. Over the course of the double-blind, crossover trial, cadets who consumed lean pork-based MREs showed significantly lower cortisol levels, higher testosterone-to-cortisol ratios and decreased inflammation compared to when they consumed plant-based meals. These physiological markers tell us that the cadets recovered better with pork. Drew Gonzalez, Ph.D., lead study author, postdoctoral researcher at Texas A&M Importantly, both the pork- and plant-based MREs were matched for total calories and macronutrients, highlighting the importance of protein quality - not just quantity - in recovery. Depression scores declined by more than 50% within 48 hours of consuming pork MREs. "Protein quality goes beyond muscle," said Kristen Hicks-Roof, Ph.D., RDN, LDN, FAND, FNAP, director of human nutrition at NPB. "We're seeing early signs that better protein sources like pork may influence mood, motivation and mental stamina - critical components of military performance." While both diets allowed cadets to replicate their performance on the ACFT after 72 hours, those consuming lean pork experienced physiological advantages that could support faster long-term recovery in real-world military settings. The pork diet group showed reduced markers of protein degradation (such as urinary urea nitrogen), lower inflammatory markers (like IL-8) and better mood states post-ACFT. Meanwhile, cadets consuming the plant-based MREs exhibited greater muscle soreness and slower hormonal recovery. "This wasn't just a lab trial - these were real cadets under military protocols, with real meals that looked and tasted like field-ready MREs," said Richard Kreider, Ph.D., senior investigator on the study. "These data suggest pork can be a valuable asset for tactical fueling." "Our findings show that when cadets consume high-quality protein like pork, their bodies respond more favorably to physical stress," said Gonzalez. "This has important implications for performance, recovery and long-term readiness in active-duty personnel."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hydrogels-materials like gelatin that can absorb and hold water-can aid wound healing and enable slow-release drug delivery, but they usually break down in acidic environments like the stomach. Inspired by the properties of gastric mucus, a team of researchers and clinicians led by Zuankai Wang of Hong Kong Polytechnic University have developed an acid-resistant hydrogel called "ultrastable mucus-inspired hydrogel" (UMIH). Publishing September 4 in the Cell Press journal Cell Reports Physical Science, they showed that UMIH improved gastrointestinal wound healing in animals and outperformed a clinically approved mucosal protectant (a material used to protect the stomach lining). UMIH has potential for treating gastroesophageal reflux, gastric ulcers, and post-surgical wound protection and can be combined with endoscopic delivery for minimally invasive therapy. Like other hydrogels, UMIH consists of a meshwork of polymers that absorb water to create a strong but jelly-like consistency. "UMIH represents a major step forward in biomaterials for gastrointestinal repair," says Dr. Wang. "Its strong adhesion, durability, and scalable manufacturing process position it as a promising platform for clinical translation." In lab tests under acidic conditions (pH2), UMIH showed 15× stronger adhesive abilities compared to aluminum phosphate gel (APG), a clinically approved mucosal protectant and antacid that is used to manage gastric ulcers and acid reflux. UMIH was not associated with any toxicity issues in lab-grown gastrointestinal cells. "UMIH achieves an adhesion strength 15 times higher than that of clinically approved materials in acidic conditions," says coauthor Xiao Yang of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. UMIH was associated with less tissue damage, reduced inflammation, and it promoted the growth of new blood vessels, which is essential for healing. Clinical trials will be needed to validate UMIH's safety and efficacy in humans, but the researchers say that it has good potential for commercialization. "This is a material that's ready for both the operating room and the production line," says coauthor Feng Lou of Sichuan University. "UMIH is low-cost, easy –to –mass produce, and built from components with established safety profiles. In [the] future, we plan to integrate UMIH with drug release systems and implantable flexible electronics to create smart gastrointestinal devices that can treat and monitor in real-time."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former male high-level rugby players in New Zealand have a 22 percent increased risk of developing Alzheimer's and other dementias later in life compared to men in the general population, according to new research from the University of Auckland. The project is co-led by senior lecturer Dr. Stephanie D'Souza from the COMPASS Research Centre in the University's Faculty of Arts and Education and Dr. Ken Quarrie from New Zealand Rugby. Researchers examined long-term neurodegenerative disease risk outcomes for almost 13,000 men who played provincial-level or higher rugby between 1950 and 2000 and compared them with 2.4 million New Zealand men, matched on age, ethnicity and birthplace. Out of every 1,000 men in the general population, 52 died from, or were diagnosed with, a neurodegenerative disease over the follow-up period from 1988 to 2023, but among former rugby players, the number was 65 per 100, says the study's lead author, PhD student Francesca Anns. "This is an extra 13 cases per 1,000 people over the study period, or around four extra neurodegenerative disease cases per year, given the size of the player cohort," she says. "Our analysis also showed that players in backline positions had greater risks than forwards, with the risk for backs increasing further the longer they played or the more matches they played, a pattern not observed for forwards." Co-lead investigator Dr. Stephanie D'Souza says these results are consistent with research into other collision sports from the US, Scotland and Italy, but the effect sizes in their study were slightly smaller than most previous reports. That may reflect differences in how the study was designed, including the size and make up of our comparison group, the fact that our study included both provincial and international players, rather than only elite professionals, and how cases were identified, as well as differences in how rugby was played in New Zealand over the decades we studied." The study is part of the Kumanu Tāngata project, which is focused on investigating the long-term health outcomes of first-class rugby players using de-identified linked data, which mean names are removed. In this study, higher risks were seen in players who competed at the international or professional level, as compared to those who only played provincially, and for backs whose risk increased with more years and matches played." She says these patterns showing higher risk with both greater intensity and longer duration of play suggest a possible 'dose-response' relationship. The study's authors recommend that collision sports organizations limit player exposure to head impacts and manage suspected concussions proactively, while continuing to communicate openly about both the benefits and risks of participation in sports like rugby.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team of researchers found there is a possible molecular connection between air pollution and an increased risk of developing Lewy body dementia. The study builds on a decade of research linking exposure to fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) -- from industrial activity, residential burning, wildfires, and vehicle exhaust-to a higher risk of developing these diseases. The findings add to a growing body of evidence indicating how environmental factors may trigger harmful protein changes in the brain that lead to neurodegeneration. Lewy body diseases are a group of neurodegenerative disorders marked by the abnormal buildup of a protein, alpha-synuclein, in the brain. We have identified a novel strain of Lewy bodies formed after exposure to air pollution. By defining this strain, we hope to establish a specific target for future drugs aimed at slowing the progression of neurodegenerative diseases marked by Lewy bodies." The team focused on patients hospitalized for the first time with Lewy body-related conditions and used ZIP-code-level data to estimate their long-term exposure to PM2.5. The scientists found that each interquartile range increase of in PM2.5 concentration in these zip code areas resulted in a 17 percent higher risk of Parkinson's disease dementia and a 12 percent higher risk of dementia with Lewy bodies. "This is among the first human epidemiological study to zero-in on a dementia subtype linked to Lewy bodies," said Xiao Wu, PhD, co-first author of the study and assistant professor of Biostatistics at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. "The statistical association we uncovered is even stronger than what previous studies found when lumping all Alzheimer's and related dementias together-highlighting Lewy body formation as a potentially pivotal pathway that warrants deeper biological investigation, says "We hope to inspire researchers to conduct both epidemiologic and molecular studies that focus on dementia subtypes linked to Lewy bodies." Exploring the biological reason for this association between exposure to PM2.5 and Lew body dementia, the team of researchers exposed both normal mice and genetically modified mice lacking the alpha-synuclein protein to PM2.5 pollution every other day for a period of ten months. "In normal mice, we saw brain atrophy, cell death, and cognitive decline-symptoms similar to those in Lewy body dementia," says study collaborator Ted Dawson, MD, PhD, the Leonard and Madlyn Abramson Professor in Neurodegenerative Diseases and director of the Johns Hopkins Institute for Cell Engineering. "But in mice lacking alpha-synuclein, the brain didn't exhibit any significant changes." The researchers then studied mice with a human gene mutation (hA53T) linked to early-onset Parkinson's disease. Observed through biophysical and biochemical analysis, these protein clumps were structurally distinct from those that form during natural aging. The team also set out to determine whether air pollution effects varied by location. They found that mice exposed to separate samples of PM2.5 from China, Europe and the United States led to similar brain changes and development of alpha-synuclein pockets, suggesting that the harmful effects of PM2.5 may be broadly consistent across different regions. The researchers say changes in gene expression in the brains of PM2.5-exposed mice were strikingly similar to those found in human patients with Lewy body dementia which indicate that pollution may not only trigger the build-up of toxic proteins but also drive disease-related gene expression changes in the human brain. While genetic factors play a significant role in neurodegenerative disease, the scientists say people can potentially control their exposure to pollution. By identifying this novel strain of Lewy bodies formed after exposure to air pollution the authors of the study hope to establish a specific target for future drugs aimed at slowing the progression of neurodegenerative diseases marked by Lewy bodies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Few people with high blood pressure were using salt substitutes, even though they are a simple and effective way to lower sodium intake and manage blood pressure, according to preliminary research presented at the American Heart Association's Hypertension Scientific Sessions 2025. High blood pressure can lead to other serious events such as heart attack and stroke. Overall, less than 6% of all U.S. adults use salt substitutes, even though they are inexpensive and can be an effective strategy to help people control blood pressure, especially people with difficult-to-treat high blood pressure. Health care professionals can raise awareness about the safe use of salt substitutes by having conversations with their patients who have persistent or hard-to-manage high blood pressure." Yinying Wei, M.C.N., R.D.N., L.D., lead study author and Ph.D. candidate in the departments of applied clinical research and hypertension section, cardiology division, at UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas Salt substitutes are products that replace some or all of the sodium with potassium. Many foods contain some sodium in their natural state, however, the largest amount of sodium comes from processed and packaged foods and meals prepared at restaurants. The American Heart Association recommends consuming no more than 2,300 mg of sodium a day, with an ideal limit of less than 1,500 mg per day for most adults, especially for those with high blood pressure. For most people, cutting back by 1,000 mg a day can improve blood pressure and heart health. This study is the first to examine long-term trends in salt substitute use among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2003 to 2020, researchers analyzed the use of products that replace salt with potassium-enriched or other alternative salts. The investigation focused on people with high blood pressure, and an additional analysis was conducted among adults eligible to use salt substitutes, including people with normal kidney function and those not taking medications or supplements that affect blood potassium levels. People with high blood pressure who are thinking about switching from regular salt to a salt substitute should first consult with a health care professional. "Salt substitute use remained uncommon over the last two decades including among people with high blood pressure," Wei said. "Even among individuals with treated and poorly managed or untreated high blood pressure, most continued to use regular salt." "This study highlights an important and easy missed opportunity to improve blood pressure in the U.S.-the use of salt substitutes," said Amit Khera, M.D., M.Sc., FAHA, an American Heart Association volunteer expert. "The fact that use of salt substitutes remains so low and has not improved in two decades is eye-opening and reminds patients and health care professionals to discuss the use of these substitutes, particularly in visits focused on high blood pressure." First, information about salt substitute use was self-reported, so there may have been underreporting or misclassification. "Future research should explore why salt substitute-use remains low by investigating potential barriers, such as taste acceptance, cost and limited awareness among both patients and clinicians," said Wei.
