                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three years into its mission, the James Webb Space Telescope has advanced the search for alien life more than any machine before it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Every day, a faint red star warms this ocean world and the uncountable masses of hungry, plankton-like creatures that inhabit it. They rise to the surface by the billions, joining together in a living, floating continent larger than Australia — spewing out a pungent gas as they knit sunlight into food. The sulfurous gas steams out of the alien bloom, filling the air so fully that a lone telescope floating 700 trillion miles (over a quadrillion kilometers) away can sense it — faintly, for just a few hours every month, when the watery planet glides in front of its small, red star. There's no question that the planet itself is real. One group of researchers who has studied K2-18b with JWST for the last few years claims to have detected signs of dimethyl sulfide (DMS). This compound, which has a cabbage-like odor, is what many Earthlings think of as "the smell of the sea" and is only known to be produced by living, breathing phytoplankton. Outside researchers remain skeptical of this alleged DMS detection, however. They've cautioned that the team's detection relies on questionable data modeling and falls short of the threshold required to signify a new scientific discovery. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. For the first time, JWST is bringing those alien atmospheres into focus. In the hunt for habitable planets — those that orbit in the "Goldilocks zone" of their home star, where liquid water can flow on the surface — JWST is in a class of its own. Unlike Hubble and other optical telescopes, JWST can't directly image the surfaces of faraway planets. Nor can it detect radio waves and other potential "technosignatures" emitted by any advanced alien civilizations that might exist. The signs of life JWST seeks are far more elemental. They're not blurry snapshots of alien trackways or mysterious radio signals, but hints of molecules tumbling invisibly through space, far above a planet's surface. "The first step in finding life is to find an atmosphere," Sebastian Zieba, a postdoctoral researcher at the Harvard and Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, told Live Science. "In order to have liquid water on the surface, you need an atmosphere." For JWST to detect hints of an exoplanet's atmosphere, scientists must wait for a transit — the moment when a planet swoops in front of its home star, forcing that star's light to shine through the planet's atmosphere as seen from our perspective on Earth. In the case of K2-18b, for example, that happens once every 33 days. That "halo" contains important clues about an alien world. As starlight streams through the planet's atmosphere, airborne molecules either absorb or reemit different wavelengths of light, changing what JWST sees when observing at those wavelengths. The unique signature of light compiled from these different wavelengths, called a spectrum, can reveal which molecules are in the atmosphere. This information, in turn, allows scientists to infer the planet's size, surface conditions, geography — and chances of supporting life. For example, Meadows said, if JWST captures the spectrum of a planet that reveals high levels of methane and carbon dioxide absorption in its atmosphere, it could indicate a habitable world akin to Earth in the Archean eon (roughly 4 billion to 2.5 billion years ago), when primitive microbes were breaking down CO2 and spewing vast quantities of methane. Proving those conditions exist on a planet trillions of miles away is the hard part. After making a promising biosignature detection, the challenge then becomes proving that it can't be explained by a geological process, such as volcanism. Then, scientists must demonstrate that their detection meets statistical significance — a rigorous undertaking that requires many repeat observations of the planet and verification from independent researchers using their own data models. "Webb data is very complex," René Doyon, a professor at the University of Montreal and principal investigator of JWST's Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) instrument, told Live Science. "People have been publishing results that are not always consistent. Depending on who reduced the data, you get a different answer." It's here that early studies of K2-18b have fallen under scrutiny. Despite the tentative detection of DMS reported in two studies by a team of University of Cambridge-led researchers, outside experts have so far been unable to verify the result when looking at the same observations with different data models. Nikku Madhusudhan, a professor of astrophysics at Cambridge and lead author of the two DMS studies, said this is no reason to ignore K2-18b as a candidate for a habitable world "teeming with microbial life." "So let's be open to being wrong and get more data. However, he agrees that DMS is a promising signature of life that JWST should continue hunting for on other potentially habitable ocean worlds. If there's complex life out there, including intelligent life, then "a big part of that question is, how common are the biospheres from which those more complex forms of life would originate?" Even if life doesn't ultimately materialize on K2-18b, the distant planet is just one of many being targeted by JWST's keen infrared eye. So far, though, JWST has found no hints of an atmosphere around any of those planets, possibly indicating that the host star showers its satellites with too much ultraviolet radiation to allow atmospheres to survive, Zieba said. Doyon favors studying a world called LHS 1140 b, located 50 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cetus. Doyon and team's observations with JWST reveal that the exoplanet, once thought to be a rocky "super-Earth" six times as massive as our planet, is a much bigger oddball — or, perhaps, an eyeball. Using JWST data from two transits of LHS 1140 b, Doyon and colleagues reestimated the mass and radius of the planet and found "it cannot be explained as a rocky planet — it must have something between 10% and 20% of its mass in water," Doyon said. According to Doyon, LHS 1140 b doesn't resemble Earth so much as it resembles our solar system's icy moons Europa and Enceladus, both of which are suspected to harbor subsurface oceans that could support life. But unlike those moons, this planet is so close to its home star that some of its ice may have sublimated into gas, forming an atmosphere. It's even possible that the sun-facing side of the planet (which, like Earth's moon, is tidally locked) could heat up enough for the ice to melt there, revealing a liquid-water ocean beneath a cloudy sky. As such, this warm, blue "iris" could host life. Doyon thinks this is one the likeliest known exoplanets to harbor an atmosphere. Although Doyon and his colleagues detected "hints" of a nitrogen-rich atmosphere around LHS 1140 b, he said it will take about a dozen more transits to prove whether there are other molecules indicative of an Earth-like atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide. Because LHS 1140 b becomes visible from Earth only four times a year, scientists would have to observe every possible transit for years to come before making any firm conclusions. It's a schedule that "really pushes JWST to its limits," Doyon added. This underscores one of the telescope's biggest limitations: time. In 2024, researchers around the world requested a total of more than 78,000 hours of JWST observation time — about nine times more than is available, according to the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), which manages JWST proposals each year. Of the more than 2,300 submissions, only 274 proposals were ultimately accepted, with exoplanet habitability research accounting for a small percentage. If approved by Congress, the cuts would amount to a roughly 25% to 35% reduction in JWST operations, Neill Reid, multimission project scientist at STScI, said in July at the 246th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Anchorage, Alaska. Future telescopes will build on JWST's revelations, helping to fill in the missing gaps. While the gas makes up about 21% of Earth's atmosphere and is a potent biosignature, "JWST can't do oxygen," Meadows said. Multiple studies — including one co-authored by Meadows, in which researchers modeled what JWST would see if it studied Earth's atmosphere — have found that the telescope is simply not sensitive enough to detect oxygen. That poses a clear challenge to detecting Earth-like atmospheres. For example, the Extremely Large Telescope — a powerful optical/near-infrared telescope being constructed in Chile that could see first light in 2029 — will be more sensitive to oxygen and water in planetary atmospheres than JWST is, Meadows said. Further down the line, NASA's recently announced Habitable Worlds Observatory will take a census of planets around sunlike stars close to our solar neighborhood. Parsing visible, infrared and ultraviolet light signatures, the powerful observatory could potentially confirm atmospheres around dozens of Earth-like worlds. —'Webb has shown us they are clearly wrong': How astrophysicist Sophie Koudmani's research on supermassive black holes is rewriting the history of our universe—After 2 years in space, the James Webb telescope has broken cosmology. Can it be fixed?—James Webb telescope discovers oldest black hole in the universe With JWST expected to remain operational at least into the 2030s, its era of discovery is just beginning. But in its first years, it's already leading scientists closer to that first tantalizing glimpse of evidence than any telescope has before. And once that evidence is found — even if it's on a distant exoplanet that no human or probe will ever lay eyes on — there's no going back. Finding evidence of even one other inhabited planet would imply that there could be countless others out there, raising big questions about the prevalence of life in the universe, and where humans fit into it. "Once we find a credible hint of evidence for life on an exoplanet … I don't think we're ever going to forget about that planet," Schwieterman said. "It's going to be both a scientific and cultural touchstone. Kids are going to learn about it in school."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a gripping episode of Ninjas Are Butterflies, L.A. Marzulli dives deep into the mysteries of ancient giants, biblical prophecy and the cosmic battle between good and evil. Marzulli explains that while some claim modern DNA testing reveals anomalies, contamination remains an issue. “A Neanderthal is 99.5% identical to modern humans. Marzulli emphasizes rigorous testing and peer-reviewed publications as essential to validate such discoveries, sharing how the third round of DNA analysis currently underway. Marzulli recounts personal experiences with purportedly altered mummies that were ultimately revealed to be constructs. Such cases underscore the importance of scientific scrutiny over sensational claims. Stay up-to-date with current issues, Holy Spirit news, Christian teachings, Charisma videos & more! Marzulli then bridges these discoveries with biblical prophecy, particularly the “seed war” introduced in Genesis 3:15. Jesus' warning that the end times would mirror the days of Noah, Marzulli suggests, directly references these ancient giants whose bones were openly displayed in Jerusalem. Marzulli also addresses how these spectacular phenomena connect with alien alleged abduction cases and hybrid experimentation. He draws connections between ancient texts, like the Book of Enoch and current reports of extraterrestrial encounters. According to Marzulli, these modern incidents echo the same patterns of interference seen throughout biblical history. Ultimately, the episode is more than an exploration of giants, mummies or UFOs—it's a journey into the unseen spiritual battles that have shaped human history. Whether investigating ancient civilizations, mysterious artifacts, or the deep currents of Scripture, Marzulli's work invites a closer look at a universe where history, science, and prophecy intersect—and where the eternal battle between good and evil continues to shape humanity's destiny.

In case you hadn't heard, Malamar is the undisputed best Pokemon of all time. In fact, loyal fans and friends of Malamar have been spreading the love for the Gen 6 Dark/Psychic type, for no particular reason at all. OK, but seriously, why is everyone suddenly talking about this big squid? Another dances to a cheering crowd while chanting, "My friend Malamar." It seems pretty likely that these are all teasers for Malamar getting a Mega Evolution in Pokemon Legends: Z-A – we've had similarly interesting reveals for a couple of the other new ones, after all. The Malamar videos seem to be playing on the idea that the 'mon has hypnotic powers that can be used to make people do whatever it wants, and it's seemingly using them to make everyone love it and want to be its friend - There's something deeply sad about that if you think about it too hard. "Felt the urge to draw my Favorite Pokemon Malamar for some reason," says another, sharing some lovely new fan art of the 'mon. Felt the urge to draw my Favorite Pokemon Malamar for some reason pic.twitter.com/O5VhpUrttnSeptember 5, 2025 Others, meanwhile, are creating their own Malamar chain letter messages, which you can bask in the glory of below. Anyway, the good news for any friends of Malamar is that – as Serebii reports – we can expect a "special 'celebration' of Malamar" to appear on the Pokemon social channels at 6am PT / 9am ET / 1pm GMT on Wednesday, September 10. Personally, I'm predicting that we're going to see a Mega Evolution reveal then, but it would be incredibly funny if it ended up being totally unrelated, and simply just a huge effort to make more people like one of Kalos' weirdest 'mons.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cohen will play a new character, Detective Burrow, starting with the Oct. 16 episode. Matt Cohen is on the case in Genoa City. He began taping last week and will first appear in the episode airing Thursday, Oct. 16. It is said that Detective Burrow, who is a new character on Y&R, will be front and center investigating a major case featuring some of the soap's key characters. Further details of the character are unknown at this time, but Genoa City has been in need of a new lead detective ever since the shocking death of Chance Chancellor (Conner Floyd) in July. Cohen is no stranger to the world of soap operas. Additionally, Cohen is a Daytime Emmy Award winner for his work as a correspondent and co-host on Entertainment Tonight from 2019-2023. More recently, in January, Cohen directed and had a starring role in the feature film, Exes, alongside Briana Buckmaster, Mark Sheppard, Felicia Day, and Ricky Whittle. He also produced and co-created the adult animated comedy Public Domain, which stars several fellow Supernatural alums. Last week, EW confirmed Roger Howarth, whose daytime TV credits include years-long stints on General Hospital, One Life to Live, and As the World Turns, is also joining the CBS sudser in a new role. Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more. Howarth was most recently seen on General Hospital as Dr. Austin Gatlin-Holt, the third character he'd played on the ABC soap since 2012, after playing Todd Manning and Franco Baldwin. In addition to Howarth and Cohen, it was also revealed last week that daytime TV veteran Tamara Braun would also be stepping into the world of The Young and the Restless, also as a new character named Sienna Bacall.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Chinese man risks losing all his teeth after trying to make his own dentures with a special resin bought online, to save money on expensive dental procedures. Ms. Liu, who runs a dental clinic in Tianjin, recently posted shocking photos of an elderly client who came in with both his upper and lower teeth caked in a hard, brown substance. He had allegedly been experiencing trouble eating because of his deteriorating teeth, so he decided it was time to get artificial dentures. However, he didn't want to spend too much on them, and knowing that dental work was expensive, he decided to make his own dentures using materials he bought online. Unfortunately, he made a mess of his teeth and was left with no other option than to seek professional help. “He said the hospital didn't dare do anything, and I said there was nothing we could do either.” 5 yuan sounds like too good a deal to pass up, but Liu claims the DIY dentures were a complete disaster and the man now risks losing all his teeth, if he can find someone brave enough to remove the resin. The dentist used this unusual case as a cautionary tale, warning her followers to seek professional help instead of trying to fix their teeth themselves. Although Ms. Liu didn't go into details about the man's attempt at making his own dentures, some speculated that he did not use ultraviolet light to harden the resin, causing it to slowly harden into an uncomfortable mold. People generally agreed that, while very expensive, dental work should be left to the experts.</p>

But election officials say they are not concerned by the number of deaths and don't consider it significantly high. But speculation has been rife on social media due to the rising number of deaths among candidates representing the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. At the beginning of September, four candidates for the AfD were reported dead, and just days later that tally had risen to seven. AfD co-chair Alice Weidel shared the news in a post on the social media platform X saying only, "Four AfD candidates dead." State police looking into the initial four deaths, which were announced on 1 September, told the German Press Agency (dpa) that there was no evidence of any third party involvement. Only in one case was an official investigation launched which didn't uncover any evidence of foul play. On 3 September, the AfD branch in Remscheid told Politico that their candidate for Kremenholl was an 80-year-old who died of natural causes after a long illness. Kay Gottschalk, the AfD state vice-president, said on Politico's "Berlin Playbook" podcast that there was no reason to view the deaths as anything other than a coincidence. Nevertheless, it is planned to examine the cases "without immediately getting into conspiracy theory territory," he said. North Rhine-Westphalia is Germany's third-largest state by area and has a population of more than 18 million. More than 20,000 people are running for seats in the state.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If intelligent beings exist on distant planets, this could be how to find them. In the endless search for technosignatures—signs from some technologically advanced intelligent alien civilization—we've done everything from monitoring radio arrays to hypothesizing about whether space rocks like ‘Oumuamua and 31/ATLAS are actually alien starships stealthily traversing the cosmos in disguise. Earthlings have been ghosted every time we tried phoning E.T. They urge NASA to prepare for possible technosignature detections and highlight how it can carry out research based on evidence, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary work, communication, predictive strategies, and possible methods of detection for the future. NASA already has a strong astrobiology foundation in the form of its Astrobiology Federation, Center For Life Detection, and Biosignatures Standards of Evidence Workshop. Biosignatures are biological signs of life that could give away the existence of any life-form, such as microbes swimming around in an alien ocean, but technosignatures (such as the golden records, industrial emissions, and all the space junk we release into near-Earth orbit) can only be created by an advanced civilization. Some methods will involve AI, but others will merely take the form of improvements to how signals are analyzed, which could allow anomalous things that could not be seen before to be captured. NASA's upcoming, extremely powerful Vera C. Rubin observatory and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will both see further into space with more detail than anything ever has, which makes them ideal for seeking out technosignatures. In anticipation of both of these telescopes seeing first light, the research team suggests that NASA create a sensing strategy that can identify more complex structures than space rocks whizzing by. They use LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory) as an outstanding example. LIGO revolutionized gravitational wave detection, and NASA could potentially develop a sensing system that does the same thing for technosignature identification. We could also work to narrow our search parameters by further analyzing environments like Mars, which could potentially tell us how likely alien planets are to spawn life. Evidence of anything that is alive (or was once alive) on Mars could mean that other organisms are out there in the broader cosmos, though nobody knows whether these hypothetical organisms are intelligent by human standards. However, the researchers propose that deeper research into non-human communication—such as AI, bioacoustics, and quantum computing—could give us some insights into how alien civilizations might communicate. “NASA Astrobiology can establish adaptive operational frameworks for real-time global coordination, ensuring robust communication, governance, and technological resilience in the event of a detection,” the SETI team said.

Conspiracy theories around local German elections took off after 16 politicians who were due to stand in the polls scheduled for September 14, suddenly died. Speculations about the sudden death started circulating on social media after four members of the AfD party died.
