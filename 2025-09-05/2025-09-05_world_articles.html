                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amid reports the Justice Department is weighing banning transgender people from owning firearms in response to last month's mass shooting at a Minneapolis Catholic church, the National Rifle Association said Friday it will oppose any blanket rule that limits Second Amendment rights. Their declaration comes after CNN and other outlets reported that Justice Department leadership is considering whether it can use its rulemaking authority declare that people who are transgender are mentally ill and can lose their rights to possess firearms. “The NRA supports the Second Amendment rights of all law abiding Americans to purchase, possess and use firearms,” the organization said in a social media post.”NRA does not, and will not, support any policy proposals that implement sweeping gun bans that arbitrarily strip law-abiding citizens of their Second Amendment rights without due process.” Trump DOJ is looking at ways to ban transgender Americans from owning guns, sources say Though the internal talks are preliminary and a final rule is far from being implemented, the discussions were faced with an immediate public outcry – including from civil rights groups and gun advocacy groups who claim any such rule would be overly broad and unconstitutionally target a minority group's rights. Data does show, however, that transgender people are far more likely to be the victims of a violent crime. The idea of restricting gun rights has long been a red line for conservatives, with many Republican lawmakers and gun rights groups opposing red flag laws and other policies aimed at keeping guns away from people suffering from mental health issues. Powerful gun rights groups like the NRA have long objected to any sweeping restrictions on the Second Amendment of the Constitution, including during Donald Trump's first administration. After the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 people at a music festival, the NRA initially supported, but ultimately opposed regulations on bump stocks. Those regulations were eventually struck down by the Supreme Court.</p>

Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. remained combative during an extraordinary Senate Finance Committee hearing on September 4 as Democrats grilled him about creating “chaos” at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the committee's ranking Democrat, said Kennedy fired career scientists at the CDC and replaced them with “cranks” and “conspiracy theorists” who promote mistrust in basic public health principles. More than 1,000 current and former staffers at HHS, which includes the CDC, issued a public letter on September 3 demanding that Kennedy resign or be fired by Donald Trump. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. Support for Kennedy, an attorney and a celebrity in the world of anti-vaxxers, appears to be wavering among a handful of key Senate Republicans, although GOP lawmakers were careful not to cross Trump while voicing concerns during the Senate hearing. All eyes were on Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Republican and physician from Louisiana who has pledged to regularly meet with Kennedy and hold him to promises made during confirmation hearings earlier this year. Despite expressing hesitation over his ability to lead the department, Cassidy cast a key confirmation vote in February after receiving assurances that as secretary, Kennedy would not restrict access to vaccines and stoke public mistrust. Now, coupled with drastic cuts to health care approved by Trump and Republicans in the massive budget bill passed earlier this summer, Democrats also appear to view Kennedy as a weakness within Trump's cabinet, and the GOP's gutting of health infrastructure as an opening for political attack. “You are a hazard to the health of the American people,” Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia told Kennedy during a tense exchange before calling on him to resign. Alarmingly, during an extraordinary exchange with Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia), Kennedy said he did not know how many people in the United States are estimated to have died from COVID, or whether the vaccines prevented additional deaths. Kennedy said that he doesn't think “anybody knows” how many people died from COVID and attacked the accuracy of CDC data released regularly under President Joe Biden. At several points during the hearing, Kennedy told lawmakers they were speaking “gibberish” when he was confronted with scientific facts and news reports about the disruption he has brought to HHS. Lisa Gilbert, president of the watchdog group Public Citizen, said Kennedy is “grossly incompetent and unqualified” to lead HHS. The hearing was a rundown of controversies that have erupted at federal health agencies since Kennedy's confirmation in February. Top officials have resigned and hundreds of CDC employees staged a walkout on August 29 after Kennedy fired CDC Director Susan Monarez, who wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on September 4 that Kennedy pressured her to pre-approve policies that would restrict access to COVID shots without providing scientific evidence. In response, Monarez's legal team told Axios that Kennedy's accusations were “false and, at times, patently ridiculous.” As ranking member on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) launched an investigation into Kennedy's decision in late July to fire all 17 members of a key vaccine policy recommendation panel and has called for a bipartisan investigation into the firings. “The attack came amid growing mistrust in public institutions, driven by politicized rhetoric that has turned public health professionals from trusted experts into targets of villainization — and now, violence,” reads an August 20 letter to Kennedy signed by 750 federal employees. Further investigation by law enforcement revealed the suspect was fixated on COVID vaccines and misinformation about them. Julie Rovner, a correspondent for KFF Health News, said Kennedy was unable to answer basic questions from lawmakers about how HHS and CDC function and what his controversial appointees are working on within the agencies. This reportedly includes a study attempting to link childhood autism to vaccines, an obsession of Kennedy's that made him famous in alternative health circles but has been debunked by years of research. “He continued to be really rude, and he continued to not know how the department works,” Rovner said during a webinar after the hearing. “Will this make it easier for Republicans to defend him? It's time for Kennedy to be ousted from his position as secretary of HHS,” Gilbert said.

The U.S. State Department is facing heavy criticism after it announced on Thursday it is imposing sanctions on three major Palestinian human rights groups over their participation in the International Criminal Court's case (ICC) against top Israeli officials. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he's adding Al-Haq, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) to the list of “Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List,” as part of President Donald Trump's executive order sanctioning the ICC. They have been instrumental in monitoring Israel's genocide in Gaza and annexation of the West Bank, serving as a key voice of Palestinians amid Israel's assaults. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. “These entities have directly engaged in efforts by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute Israeli nationals, without Israel's consent,” Rubio said. We will not bend to any State apparatus or system fuelled by violence and oppression.” UN human rights chief Volker Türk said in a statement that the sanctions are “completely unacceptable.” “The work of civil society in documenting violations and engaging with international accountability mechanisms is all the more important when international humanitarian and human rights laws are being violated systematically in Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.” A coalition of Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups, including major organizations like B'Tselem, called the sanctions “violent.” “This is yet another move aimed at erasing fundamental norms of protecting human beings, designed to enable Israel to continue harming Palestinians without restraint,” the coalition said. “The Trump administration's decision to impose sanctions against three prominent Palestinian human rights organizations is a deeply troubling and shameful assault on human rights and the global pursuit of justice,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty International's senior director for Research, Advocacy, Policy and Campaigns. “This appalling move constitutes a brazen attack on the entire Palestinian human rights movement, and a callous attempt to fracture and weaken the whole global human rights community.” Under pressure from an array of McCarthyist anti-speech tactics, independent journalists at Truthout face new and mounting political repression.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“I didn't say when, [but] we're going in.” The statement came in the wake of Chicago's Labor Day weekend, during which nearly 60 people were shot and at least eight killed, which some experts have said could be used by the Trump administration as further justification for sending troops. Both Johnson and Pritzker have routinely rejected the popular rightwing political view of Chicago being overly crime-ridden and in need of federal help. At the end of August, Johnson passed the Protecting Chicago initiative, an executive order with sweeping measures aimed at limiting Trump's influence on local law enforcement. An advance team of at least 30 agents is currently undergoing crowd control and flash grenade training at Naval Station Great Lakes north of Chicago, and 230 agents, most of whom work for Customs and Border Protection, are being sent to Chicago from Los Angeles, sources told the Chicago Sun-Times. During a news conference on Tuesday, Pritzker also expressed concern that Ice agents will target Mexican Independence Day events this month. The El Grito Chicago Mexican Independence Day festival, scheduled for this weekend in downtown Chicago's Grant Park, was also postponed on Thursday due to concerns of Ice operations. Eisendrath, who currently hosts a progressive political radio show from Chicago's Lincoln Square neighborhood on the city's North Side, believes if the goal is to lower crime in Chicago, deploying the national guard won't work. To him, there is a “historic lack of trust in the police” among Chicagoans that will make any actions taken in the name of Trump's purported intent to lower crime ineffective, especially without taking steps to remove guns and other weapons brought over from neighboring red states with looser gun laws, or funding violence-prevention programming. That, coupled with Chicago's history in labor and organizing, may mean different results than from what Trump is expecting. There's also Sjonia Harper, who works in software sales and has lived in Bronzeville, a historically Black neighborhood on Chicago's South Side, since 2006. Despite the overwhelming outside perception of Chicago's predominantly Black and brown neighborhoods such as Bronzeville being plagued by violence, Harper said that crime has largely not been a major concern for her. “Even when I first moved to Bronzeville in 2006, when I would say crime was higher, I still walked my dog every day and wasn't afraid to walk around in my neighborhood and make friends with people in my neighborhood.” Harper also believes it's important not to ignore the racial component to Trump's focus on Chicago and other cities to which he has signaled that troops could also be deployed, many of which are led by Black leaders and have large Black populations. Harper anticipates federal troops employing law enforcement practices with the potential to create violence, not prevent it, including racial profiling, stop-and-frisk and establishing checkpoints in wealthy neighborhoods. For 22 years, John Orleans has lived in North Austin, a predominantly Black neighborhood on Chicago's West Side often evoked because its high crime rates have continued to fall in recent years. He believes increased investment and access to resources such as healthcare, grocery stores and infrastructure in neighborhoods like his could have a bigger impact on crime than deploying federal troops. When I was growing up, Wrigleyville wasn't a great neighborhood, and now, just try to find an apartment there,” Orleans said. The Indivisible Chicago Alliance, a progressive organization of activists and neighborhood chapters, is one of several local groups sharing “Know Your Rights” campaigns, trainings and planned actions from a collection of like-minded partner organizations, including the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, which itself partners with the National Immigrant Justice Center (NIJC), the center's director of communications, Tara Tidwell Cullen, said.. The NIJC has been responding to threats from Ice in Chicago since the start of Trump's second term in January, and has been working with its partners to expand the scope of its work as federal troops head to Chicago, Tidwell Cullen said. Other groups, such as Personal Pac, which typically organizes around reproductive rights, are collaborating with similar organizations and distributing information through the Hands Off Chicago website to “stand up against the unconstitutional and racist regime of Donald Trump”, Personal Pac's CEO, Sarah Garza Resnick, said. And the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) is preparing a team of more than 350 volunteers for legal observation during future protests and civil litigation that could arise from encounters between the public and troops, Matthew Coughlin, director of operations for NLG Chicago, said. Currently, Trump is facing legal challenges that may halt his ability to deploy the national guard and Ice agents as he would like. On Tuesday, a judge ruled that the president violated federal law when he deployed thousands of national guard troops to Los Angeles earlier this summer during protests against Ice, and on Thursday, the District of Columbia sued Trump in federal court over his deployment of troops there. Matt Conroy, a Democratic candidate for Illinois's fifth District, recognizes Chicago does have work to do to address crime, but he's concerned federal troops will primarily “terrorize” predominantly Black and Hispanic communities while costing the local and federal government money. “Rather than addressing the root cause of this, they're just doing what they think looks good for the TV and pretending to be a strongman authoritarian, and that's all that Donald Trump really wants to be,” Conroy said. “Honestly, invoke the Insurrection Act, but to stay together, have a plan, know your rights, and be respectful of law enforcement, to not escalate the situation further, and to provide them with additional resources.” Members of the national guard should also defy unlawful orders that call for violence, Conroy said. Denise Poloyac, a board member for the Indivisible Chicago Alliance, believes that if federal troops and Ice agents begin active law enforcement activities, community will become increasingly important. That means not going to protests alone or uninformed about their organizers, and engaging in de-escalation tactics. I think that is the strength of Chicago, and that's what's going to get us through this, and, you know, I think that's the strength of a lot of places in this country,” Poloyac said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spaceflight makes certain human stem cells age faster, a new study has found, furthering scientists' understanding of the potential effects of space exploration on the human body. Back on Earth, astronauts can say goodbye to blurry eyes, puffy faces, ‘chicken legs' and a little extra height The study, which NASA funded in part, was performed during four International Space Station resupply missions that SpaceX operated from late 2021 to early 2023. “This is the first study that looks at how stem cells behave in space, in low Earth orbit, in real time,” Jamieson added, noting that this kind of research could have a direct impact on health management for astronauts poised to go to space. Called the Stem Cell Regeneration Experiment, it investigated how microgravity affected the ability of mice's embryonic stem cells to make other types of cells. In the new study, researchers examined bone marrow stem cells donated by patients undergoing hip replacement surgery. On board the International Space Station, the cells were constantly monitored by an artificial intelligence system, which could detect their state in real time. “Our stem cells should be asleep (inactive) 80% of the time to retain their full function,” Jamieson said. However, that wasn't the case in space, where microgravity and cosmic radiation had an influence on their well-being. “If our stem cells become exhausted under conditions of stress like microgravity, then they won't function to make a proper immune system.” Their ability to generate new cells was also reduced, and, according to Jamieson, they began activating normally hidden sections of DNA called repetitive elements or the “dark genome.” They send the stem cells into a death spiral. This is similar to the stem cell stress that Jamieson, who is also a medical doctor, observes in the cells of patients with preleukemic disorders. Jamieson tries to stop these cells in their tracks before they turn into full-blown leukemia, a type of blood cancer. Jamieson, a veteran of space stem cell research who has worked on nine missions so far, is planning future studies that will look at practical countermeasures for the aging process. “We can actually use these bioreactors, or avatars for stem cell health, to predict who's likely to do well and who's likely to do extremely badly in space … and develop countermeasures,” she added, noting some upcoming clinical trials for potential medications to counteract the effects of this dark genome activity. The good news is that stem cells can recover from the accelerated aging once an astronaut returns to Earth, according to preliminary results from a separate, upcoming study, although the recovery takes about a year. “I think this is an important tool for us to accelerate the pace of (cancer) research,” Jamieson said. Astronauts face mental and emotional challenges for deep space travel. For astronauts, these findings mean that long missions could weaken the blood and immune systems, potentially raising health risks, said Arun Sharma, a stem cell biologist and an associate professor of biomedical sciences at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in California. “The good news is that knowing the potential negative effects that low Earth orbit has on (stem cell) aging and function gives us directions to address these issues and develop strategies to prevent or counteract these effects, and support future space exploration,” he added. “This often translates into biomedical advances that can be applied to patients on Earth.” Toxic dust on Mars would present serious hazard for astronauts While earlier space research on stem cells suggested vulnerabilities in more indirect or limited ways, this study provides much clearer evidence of aging, said Elena Kozlova, a professor in the department of immunology, genetics and pathology at Sweden's University of Uppsala. Kozlova, who was also not part of the new research, noted that not all studies on stem cells in space point in the same direction. Her own research with early developmental stem cells on microgravity research rockets — operated by the Swedish Space Corporation — showed an increase in growth-associated genes.

Mr. Carney made the announcement Friday morning at an event in Mississauga, Ont. “In the face of uncertainty around the world, we are ensuring that our workers and businesses will prosper by building Canada's strength at home,” he said in a statement. The new measures also include an expansion of employment insurance, a “re-skilling package” for up to 50,000 workers and a new policy to ensure the federal government is buying from Canadian suppliers. U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed 25-per-cent tariffs on foreign vehicles, though Canadian and Mexican manufacturers have a partial exemption. The EV sales mandate, introduced by former Liberal prime minister Justin Trudeau, required the sale of new zero-emission vehicles to hit 20 per cent for the 2026 model year, 60 per cent by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035 as part of a broader pledge on reducing carbon emissions. “We should be aligning with Europe, which is doubling down on renewable energy and electric vehicles, rather than bowing before Trump's attack on people and planet.” Mr. Carney said earlier this week his government continues to work toward new trade deals with the U.S. that could alleviate the tariffs, though there is no guarantee on timing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump is sending 10 F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico to bolster US military operations against drug cartels in the Caribbean region, it was reported on Friday. If follows a deadly US missile strike on Tuesday on a boat in the Caribbean Sea that the Trump administration insisted was carrying 11 Venezuelan drug traffickers, and comments by the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on Wednesday that such attacks “will happen again”. The F-35 is a highly advanced stealth fighter and would be very effective in combat against Venezuela's air force, which includes F-16 aircraft. Trump has already sent at least eight warships and other military assets to the area in recent weeks, and Rubio, speaking in Mexico City on Wednesday, warned of more operations to come. “The US has long, for many, many years, established intelligence that allowed us to interdict and stop drug boats. Interdiction doesn't work,” he told a press conference after meeting with Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, to discuss stronger security ties. Meanwhile, two Venezuelan military planes flew close to a US warship in international waters, the Pentagon said on Thursday in a social media post, an act it called “a highly provocative move … designed to interfere with our counter narco-terror operations”. Maduro has accused the US of “seeking a regime change through military threat” and promised to build up his own armed forces. More than 50 countries, including the US, refuse to recognize Maduro as head of state after accusing him of rigging the Venezuelan presidential election in 2018. “We've got assets in the air, assets in the water, assets on ships, because this is a deadly serious mission for us, and it won't stop with just this strike,” he said. Hegseth was asked by reporters on Thursday what legal justification was used to kill 11 people that the Trump administration has accused, without presenting evidence, of being members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang. And when other people try to do that, they're gonna meet the same fate.” In a statement issued on Thursday, before news of the stealth fighters' deployment broke, Democratic Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar accused the Trump administration of “lawless and reckless” actions in the Caribbean region. “Congress has not declared war on Venezuela, or Tren de Aragua, and the mere designation of a group as a terrorist organization does not give any president carte blanche to ignore Congress's clear constitutional authority on matters of war and peace,” she said. “There is no conceivable legal justification for this use of force. Unless compelling evidence emerges that they were acting in self-defense, that makes the strike a clear violation of international law.” “[I have] no love lost for the people who died that are trying to infiltrate our country with this filth, but at the same time you have to realize it's not as simple as it may sound, ‘let's just kill drug dealers,' because sometimes you have to figure out who people are before you kill them,” he said. “Even the worst people in our country still get a trial.” Analysts have warned that US aggression in the region will have serious unintended consequences, including the possibility of being drawn into an extended guerrilla war in Venezuela. You'll end up having people going to Venezuela to fight the Yankees and I think it'll get messy.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Putin reported that the poverty level in Russia has fallen from 11.3% to 7.2% over the past decade, calling the trend “positive.” He also expressed confidence that inflation – currently estimated at 8.8% – could be lowered to a minimum while maintaining economic growth. He stressed that his goal is to make Russia “an economy of high salaries.” “This is no populism, this makes sense economically,” Putin said, adding that the unemployment has decreased from 7% to 2.4%. However, he said many firms “are eagerly waiting for all these political restrictions to be lifted.” Putin also observed that some foreign companies “continue to operate in Russia despite political disagreements between their governments and Moscow” and “even want to expand cooperation.” He stressed that Russia remains open to cooperation, particularly “with our friends.” “But we are not isolating ourselves from anyone… we have never turned away or pushed anyone out. Those who want [to come] back in are welcome.” Russia is not at risk of a dependence on selling crude oil, gas, and other natural resources abroad, Putin said, adding that such a threat would only become real if Russia remained passive. He added that Russia's partners “will gladly invest in those promising enterprises.” Putin reiterated that he is ready for in-person talks with Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky, but “does not see much sense” in them, explaining that any agreements on the territorial dispute between Moscow and Kiev could be settled only via a referendum in Ukraine. Russian officials earlier also pointed out that Zelensky's presidential term expired last year, making him unfit to sign any binding agreements. At the same time, Putin said he was ready to talk with Zelensky in Moscow, adding that Russia is willing to provide a “100% security guarantee” for the Ukrainian leader. “We are ready for meetings at the highest level. There would be “no sense” in a Western troop deployment to Ukraine once a lasting settlement to the conflict is reached, Putin said. “Nobody should doubt that Russia would implement the agreed terms fully. We will respect security guarantees that both Russia and Ukraine need to be offered,” he added. The Russian leader also warned that if any Western troops arrive in Ukraine while the hostilities are ongoing, Moscow “would consider them legitimate military targets.” “It is not up to us – we are also ready, but if there are political decisions, we will move in that direction,” he said, adding that Russian gas extraction and liquefaction technologies are more efficient than those developed in the US. According to Putin, Moscow and Washington have also discussed potential trilateral cooperation in the Russian Arctic with China. Pivoting to the role of artificial intelligence, Putin remarked that he was certain that AI could be used in the decision-making process.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Canada Globe, unveiled on Friday, follows Mr. Trump's assertions that he would like to annex Canada and turn it into the 51st state of America. It also ignores the President's executive orders renaming geographical features. In an executive order soon after taking office, Mr. Trump renamed the highest peak in North America as Mount McKinley, after former U.S. president William McKinley, who never visited Alaska, where the mountain is located. John Geiger, chief executive of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society, said globes typically represent continents − including North America − in the same colour. It chose imperial pink, used historically to represent Commonwealth countries and those in the British empire. He said the society was concerned by Mr. Trump's utterings about redrawing the map and assertions that “without some sort of imagined massive subsidy that Canada ceases to exist as a viable country.” Trump, tariffs and William McKinley: Two books help explain the U.S. president's latest fixation The globe includes the society's coat of arms and its motto Ducit Amor Patriae – Love of country leads me. The Canada Globe was hand-crafted − including hand-painted − by British globemakers Bellerby & Co. It was commissioned by Canada's Oughtred family as a gift to the society. Bespoke Bellerby globes of this size sell for about $122,250. Ralph Goodale, Canada's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, and Perry Bellegarde, former national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, toured the map with King Charles, pointing out Canada's national parks and other notable sites. The globe also includes recent official updates to country names, including the African kingdom of Eswatini (previously Swaziland), which was renamed in 2018 to mark its 50th year as an independent state. But Turkey, which officially changed its name to Türkiye after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government requested the change in May, 2022, remains Turkey. Hans Island, a tiny barren rock in the Arctic that was the focus of a decades-long territorial dispute between Canada and Denmark, was too small to feature. In 2022, it was amicably divided between Nunavut and Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, at a ceremony in Ottawa at the Royal Canadian Geographical Society's headquarters. The society, which has a large collection of older globes and historic maps, plans to create a map reading room later this year where scholars and interested members of the public can come and view them. The oldest map in its collection dates to 1598 and is one of the earliest extant maps of Newfoundland.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>California's community colleges are grappling with a surge in fraudulent enrollments, with 1.2 million fake applicants last year accounting for nearly 30 percent of new students, blocking real students from classes and costing millions in stolen financial aid, according to college officials. Before the pandemic, most classes were in-person, making fraud more difficult, Martinez said. But with 80 percent of courses moving online, bots and fake students can enroll from anywhere, including other states or countries. “It's happened on a massive scale,” Martinez told Epoch TV's California Insider host Siyamak Khorrami. In one anthropology course, administrators raised the enrollment cap by 30 daily, only for bots to fill slots instantly, leaving just 12 to 15 genuine students. Among faculty, morale has gone down as classes shrink to single digits, making them cost-inefficient yet necessary for student progress. “Faculty teach because they love their discipline, but it's devastating to see classes dwindle,” Kim added. California funds community colleges based on enrollment, but removing fake students can cut revenue by up to 23 percent, Martinez said. “You can't get paid for fake enrollments,” he noted. “It's better to make that cut upfront than face audits later.” Fraud motivations include exploiting Pell Grants, with “Pell runners” collecting up to $7,400 before vanishing, and harvesting personal data such as Social Security numbers for identity theft, Martinez said. To combat the issue, colleges are deploying LightLeap.AI, an artificial intelligence platform from N2N Services, initially developed for course predictions but adapted for fraud detection. Processing nearly 3 million applications and flagging 360,000 suspected fraudsters, LightLeap.AI uses machine learning to analyze shared phone numbers, IP addresses, minimal application data, and suspicious course-taking patterns, achieving a 99 percent accuracy rate at Santiago Canyon. “One art faculty member was ecstatic, saying, ‘I have a clean roster. LightLeap.AI's triangulation method cross-references application data with student information systems and proprietary blacklist/whitelist databases, identifying patterns such as multiple applications from one IP address. Its network effect allows fraud detection at one college to flag bad actors across 83 campuses, with a 92.3 percent effectiveness rate at West Valley-Mission. The system adapts to evolving tactics by incorporating geolocation data and reducing false positives through continuous learning. Since its intersession rollout, it has been applied across spring, summer, and fall terms, with updates to counter fraudsters' use of generative AI. “We need tech-savvy staff, but community colleges can't compete with tech industry salaries,” Martinez said. A proposed $10 application fee, discussed in 2025, aims to deter fraud but risks burdening vulnerable students such as the homeless or undocumented, who struggle with ID verification. Online education is essential for working adults, who now outnumber recent high school graduates enrolled at community colleges. “Adult students—parents with jobs and bills—rely on online classes,” Martinez said. “If it doesn't happen, we're going to keep losing money,” he warned. A 2025 state audit is evaluating fraud trends and mitigation effectiveness to guide future funding. Kim emphasized ethical duty: “We're public servants with a moral obligation to protect taxpayer dollars.” California community colleges serve about 1.8 million students annually, offering low-cost pathways to degrees and jobs.</p>

PARIS (AP) — Five French women boxers will miss the world championships starting on Thursday in England because of complications with new sex tests that are compulsory after a furor at the 2024 Paris Olympics. The French team said it was “with astonishment and indignation” its boxers cannot compete after missing a deadline to get the test results from England. World Boxing announced its mandatory testing policy on May 30 as a response to controversy last year in Paris, where Imane Khelif of Algeria and Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan won gold medals amid a campaign to cast doubt on their eligibility. “It is very disappointing for the boxers that some national federations have not been able to complete this process in time,” World Boxing said on Thursday in a statement. The French boxing federation said it was told to expect the results “within 24 hours and that we could therefore, without fail, present them when registering our boxers.” The five boxers excluded were Romane Moulai, Wassila Lkhadiri, Melissa Bounoua, Sthélyne Grosy and Maëlys Richol. Richol shared on her Instagram page a message by Estelle Mossely, a former candidate to lead the French boxing federation, calling for officials responsible to resign. Khelif also will not compete in Liverpool after failing to get an urgent interim ruling from the Court of Arbitration for Sport in her wider appeal against World Boxing's testing mandate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin appreciates US leader Donald Trump's peace efforts and his constructive approach in general, Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov told TASS at the Eastern Economic Forum (EEF). The Kremlin spokesman told about the upcoming BRICS summit, explained why Vladimir Zelensky was invited to Moscow, and shared his opinion about the domestically-developed messenger Max and its foreign analogues. Efforts to settle the conflict continue, but it is too early to say when it would be resolved: "[Putin] said there is light at the end of the tunnel." Russia, is his words, is ready to use peaceful means to achieve its goals in Ukraine, but if this proves impossible, the special military operation will continue. There are no details yet regarding a new conversation between Putin and Trump: "So far, there have been no preliminary results." Talks between them, Peskov noted, are difficult because each defends the interests of his own country: "But Putin highly values this and is grateful to Trump for such an approach." The Kremlin sees Donald Trump as a US president, without giving him any additional subjective characteristics: "Trump is president of the United States to us." Relations between Russia and the United States were severely damaged under the previous US administration and will take time to restore: "The process of bringing our relations out of complete paralysis will take time. Too much damage has been done to the entire architecture of our bilateral ties." He also noted that Moscow and Washington have not yet returned to cooperation in culture and sports: "We haven't gotten there yet." Russia and the US have not yet reached the point of restoring ties in culture and sports: "Things have not yet gotten to that point." The presence of foreign messengers Telegram and WhatsApp in Russia will incentivize new national platform Max to innovate and get better, so it makes sense not to ban them: "They should stay in Russia. I am convinced that without competition Max will not be able to develop." Russians should want to move over to the Max platform themselves: "In order for Max to truly become a developed service that millions and tens of millions of our fellow citizens want to download themselves, it must constantly evolve and not stand still."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to issue an executive order on Sept. 5 to rename the Department of Defense to the Department of War, various U.S. media outlets reported, citing sources in the White House. Trump, alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, alluded to the reported changes in recent weeks, with Trump telling reporters on Aug. 25 that his administration is "gonna change the name." "I'm sure Congress will go along if we need that. I don't think we even need that," Trump previously said on a potential vote. Amid the transition, Hegseth's title will likely be changed to secretary of war. Dmytro Basmat is a senior news editor for The Kyiv Independent. "I don't see much point in them, (...) because it will be practically impossible to reach an agreement with the Ukrainian side on key issues: even if there is political will, which I doubt, there are legal and technical difficulties," Putin said. At a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Beijing on Sept. 2, Fico pledged to discuss with Zelensky attacks on energy infrastructure, a reference to recent Ukrainian strikes on the Druzhba oil pipeline, which supplies Russian crude to Hungary and Slovakia. "Gasoline (in Russia) is becoming scarce, while gas and oil are quickly running out," Ukraine's top drone warfare commander, Robert "Madyar" Brovdi, wrote. "We are working with the United States and other partners to intensify our pressure through additional sanctions — both direct and secondary sanctions," European Council President Antonio Costa said. "May they have a long and prosperous future together," U.S. President Donald Trump said. Current proposals envision these measures taking effect only after a ceasefire. Ukraine's Air Force said Russian forces launched 157 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones overnight, along with six S-300 guided missiles and an X-59 air-launched missile. "If any troops appear there, especially now, during the fighting, we assume that they will be legitimate targets for destruction," Russian President Vladimir Putin said. "Germany, Italy, and Poland are definitely among Ukraine's security guarantors. We won't go into details yet, but we already have an understanding (of cooperation)," President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron during the Paris summit. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to issue an executive order on Sept. 5 to rename the U.S. Department of Defense to the Department of War, various media outlets, citing sources in the White House, reported. The move is part of a broader push for NATO allies to increase their defense spending.</p>
