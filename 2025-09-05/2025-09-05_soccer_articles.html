                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MORRISTOWN, N.J. — It's been nearly two months since we last saw the United States men's national team in action. On Saturday, the Americans are likely to be the away team on home soil once again, with most of the full house at 26,500-seat Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, New Jersey, expected to be rooting for Korea Republic and superstar forward Son Heung-min. Son Heung-min and Korea Republic will be a tough matchup for the U.S. men's team. With no grueling, marathon World Cup qualifying slate to help prepare them for next summer's 48-team fútbol fest, Mauricio Pochettino's team needs all the adversity it can get. Saturday's contest in the shadow of New York City represents an invaluable opportunity. "South Korea is a very good team, a good challenge for us," Pochettino said at his pre-match press conference. He's back, as is Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah. So are forwards Folarin Balogun and Josh Sargent. And with the planet's biggest sporting event just six more tuneup matches away, they need to get into the habit of winning as soon as possible. The last time a full-strength U.S. team convened, for the Nations League finals last March, they were upset by Panama and Canada in Los Angeles. Yet for Pochettino, winning on Saturday and in another exhibition on Tuesday (against Japan in Columbus, Ohio) is secondary to team-building. The plan is to use these games to gain information that will help them beat whoever they'll face next June and July when it does. That should bode well for the U.S. men's team. It's always good to win, because that gives you more confidence and trust. "You see their quality," Houston Dynamo midfielder Jack McGlynn said of working alongside PSV Eindhoven's Dest, AC Milan's Pulisic and Marseille's Weah. So it's been a great week of training. Obviously, getting to build connections with them, both on and off the field, has been amazing." Pulisic, who got into an unfortunate public spat with Pochettino over the summer after he asked the coach to rest during the Gold Cup, has been particularly impressive this week, according to McGlynn. "He's a leader for us," he said of Pulisic, adding that the USMNT star has been beating defenders and scoring goals at training almost at will. "You can give him the ball," McGlynn said, "And something will happen." On Friday, Pochettino again insisted that he and Pulisic have moved forward. "We all make a mistake sometimes because we read the situation in a different way," the coach said. As Pochettino noted, "we don't have too much time until the World Cup." "The main group is starting to understand what we want, and if we want to arrive at the World Cup in our best condition, they need to know each other and, at some point, we need to start to cut and…increase the players that we believe that we're going to be in the World Cup, but always keeping that mentality. "That, for me, is going to be success in the next two games." Doug McIntyre is a soccer reporter for FOX Sports who has covered United States men's and women's national teams at FIFA World Cups on five continents.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Egypt wins the match in the first half 1 - 0. Ethiopia needs to increase the pace and improve the quality a little in the final third of the field. It's hard to tell whether he was going to shoot or cross. In any case, the ball is cleared. Excellent turn and pass by Mohamed Salah, who sends a teammate to the back line, but the cross comes to nothing. The first chance of the match was wasted by the home team, who started at a fast pace. The match is tied in the begining. Who will win this  qualifying match for the 2026 FIFA World Cup? R. James 6. Ethiopia has failed to score in its last three official away games. Egypt has kept three consecutive clean sheets at home. Only one of the last five head-to-head matches has seen more than 2.5 goals scored. The combined shots on target in recent games are limited, pointing to a trend of few goals. United States New Zealand South Korea Who will  win this FIFA World Cup qualifying match?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This Saturday, the United States Men's national team are back in action, hosting South Korea at the Sports Illustrated Arena. While Concacaf sides may be kicking off the road to World Cup qualification during this window, Mauricio Pochettino will be taking a look at finalizing his World Cup squad since the USMNT have booked their place as a host nation. South Korea will also be coming to America in 2026, already advancing through AFC World Cup Qualification, giving Pochettino an ample test for his experimental squad. Pochettino has almost completed a full year in charge of the USMNT, and results have been mixed, with him winning 10 matches and losing six. Failing to win the Concacaf Nations League and Concacaf Gold Cup while also struggling against top opposition from abroad, this window is a chance for the USMNT to build momentum as the matches will only get harder from here on out. With regulars such as Christian Pulisic, Tim Weah, Folarin Balogun, and Sergino Dest back in the squad, Pochettino will have no shortage of players to choose from, but there is a lack of experience in key areas like goalkeeper, where Matt Freese leads the way with only seven caps. What will be needed for the USMNT to defeat South Korea? Under Pochettino, Antonee Robinson has operated as an aggresive possession fullback, being able to push possession higher up the pitch, interchanging with Christian Pulisic and Malik Tillman. While Robinson isn't in this squad, his role will provide optimism as to how Dest can spark the attack. Someone comfortable playing up the pitch, Dest can create devastating overlaps with Tim Weah to keep a defense on their toes. The PSV man does come with defensive liabilities, but they're ones that are worth managing since he's such a strong creator. Next to Chris Richards and Tim Ream, there's enough defensive cover if Dest gets caught forward, so during this window it will be important to see if he can get back to his best. If so, Pochettino can dream of a much stronger team in October when his defense is mostly solidified. Balogun will have a chance to earn his first start under Pochettino now that he's fully healthy and in the Monaco setup, but that doesn't mean that he won't have competition. Balogun only has one goal this season and has struggled to replicate his form with Reims since moving to Monaco, but one of the hottest strikers in the world will be ready for an opportunity if it comes his way. Josh Sargent has scored in five consecutive games for Norwich City and has six goals in all competitions to start off the season. It has been five years since he has scored a goal for the USMNT, but that doesn't mean that he isn't still confident in his chances to end that drought during this camp. If Sargent is able to get things going, he could be in a position to start a second consecutive World Cup. Someone who plays with plenty of pressure every time he puts on a USMNT shirt, it will only build if results don't turn around sooner than later. There is no gambling offered on this site.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Throughout the 2025 season, Sounders FC's Cristian Roldan has proven himself to be one of the most efficient deep-lying midfielders in MLS. “Sometimes it does take 30 games to stand out, especially when they're not looking for you right away,” said Sounders General Manager & Chief Soccer Officer Craig Waibel. Now, he has the opportunity to showcase his talents on the world stage once again under new head coach Mauricio Pochettino in a pair of friendlies against Korea Republic and Japan. “As an organization, it's always a proud day when you see a guy get called in,” said Waibel. “He is showing a lot of young players the blueprint of how to get there and how to go about it.” In 2025 alone, he's contributed to 10 assists and two goals across all competitions for the Rave Green. TEAM NEWS: @CristianRoldan has been added to the #USMNT roster for September camp. He most recently caught people's attention in the FIFA Club World Cup, where he tallied a goal in the Sounders' first group stage match against Botafogo. “I don't think he elevated his play throughout the season. I actually think this is where he came in, and the difference is he just hasn't ever gone down,” said Waibel. “I think he's played at a high level, far above the league average, in the position all year with, you know, maybe minutes of playing below that level, but not games.” “I always feel like I have a lot to give, whether it's on the field, off the field,” said Roldan. I'm going to make the guys around me better [and] I'm going to compete at a very high level.” Join Sounders FC for an unforgettable year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scotland travel to Denmark in World Cup qualifier action All the goals as they go in | Email Barry He headed the ball on to his own upper arm while contesting a high ball from deep and was the last man back. Having given the Scotland substitute a yellow card, the referee was summoned to his pitchside monitor but stuck by his original decision that a booking would suffice. Denmark 0-0 Scotland: Anders Dreyer lets fly with a shot from distance that fizzes inches wide of Angus Gunn's upright and ripples the side-netting. Moments later, neither Che Adams nor Grant Hanley bother making the run that would have enabled one of them to get on the end of a cross from Andy Robertson that could not have been more inviting if it contained an RSVP card. Greece 5-0 Belarus: Christos Tzolis piles the hurt on Belarus in Piraeus, in a match Steve Clarke and his Danish counterpart Brian Riemer will both be watching with interest in the coming days. If they fail to win tonight their chances of qualifying for next summer's World Cup are going to be in serious mild jeopardy. Denmark 0-0 Scotland: Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg goes close for Denmark only to have a curled effort that was heading inside the foot of the upright deflected out for a corner by Grant Hanley. McTominay has soldiered on despite injuring his knee while overstretching in a bid to relieve Damsgaard of the ball. Denmark 0-0 Scotland: Joakim Maele throws himself in front of a John McGinn shot inside the Denmark penalty area and the ball goes out for a corner. Denmark struggle to clear the inswinger but eventually win a throw-in off Hickey. I'll tell you who the Danes could do with in their attempts to break down this obdurate Scottish defence – Christian Eriksen, who has scored in their past three games but was dropped from the current squad. Denmark 0-0 Scotland: Steve Clarke's side are living on the edge in Copenhagen but look like they might make it to half-time without conceding. They have had one excellent chance, a headed opportunity that Ryan Christie put wide of the far post after connecting with an excellent John McGinn cross. That aside, Denmark have been hammering on the door. Moldova 0-2 Israel: As things stand, Gennaro Gattuso's Italy, who are drawing at home to Estonia, will be third in Group I behind Norway and Israel with a game in hand over the side that's beating Moldova. In other qualifiers I've failed to mention thus far, Croatia are a goal up against Faroe Islands and Czechia lead by the only goal of the game away at Montenegro. Both those games are in Group L, which is being bossed by a Czechia side who have played more games than anyone else. Switzerland 2-0 Kosovo: The Swiss have rattled off a quickfire double against Kosovo, with Manuel Akanji and Breel Embolo scoring two goals in three minutes in their Group B encounter. Greece 3-0 Belarus: As Denmark and Scotland play out a stalemate in Copenhagen, Greece are already laying down a Group C marker. They've just gone 3-0 up against Belarus in what is amounting to a turkey-shoot. Slovenia 0-1 Sweden: With much of the focus in Lujbljana on a player that recently left Newcastle, one who recently joined them has opened the scoring for Sweden. Greece 2-0 Belarus: Greece have doubled their lead in Piraeus, with Vangelops Pavlidis doubling their tally against the team likely to end up as Group C whipping boys. Having said that, with Scotland among the four teams, it would not come as a massive surprise if they have some competition for fourth place. Ukraine 0-1 France: Michael Olise has opened the scoring for the visitors in Wroclaw, where fellow “visitors” Ukraine are hosting France. Denmark 0-0 Scotland: Scotland get an early warning when Morten Hjulmand sticks out a leg to steer a Mikkel Damsgaard free-kick swung in from the left and prod the ball straight into Angus Gunn's breadbasket. It's a terrible miss but he was offside, due in no smart to the commendably high line Scotland were keeping as the free-kick was taken. Denmark 0-0 Scotland: Denmark midfielder Pierre Emile Hojbjerg has picked up an early yellow card for a foul on John McGinn. The 17-year-old midfield talent plies his trade with Genk in Belgium. Brian Riemer decided to leave the 33-year-old out because he hasn't managed to find a club since leaving Manchester United in June. He is believed to have been keeping himself fit by training with the Swedish club Malmo, but Riemer clearly feels he has not done enough to merit inclusion tonight. Scotland: It's no great surprise that Steve Clarke has made seven changes to the experimental side that hammered Liechtenstein in a friendly in June. Rarely one to inspire huge confidence while playing for his country, Angus Gunn is back in goal in place of the injured first choice Craig Gordon, while it's great to see Brentford's Aaron Hickey back in defence after a near two-year absence with various injury issues. John Souttar and Grant Hanley also come into the back four. Ipswich Town's George Hirst has to make do with a place in the bench but is likely to see some action. Easy wins for Spain and Belgium, battling victories for Wales and Northern Ireland, Germany lost their first World Cup qualifier away from home against Slovakia and Poland came from behind courtesy of a Matty Cash thunderbolt to take a point and dent Dutch hopes of qualifying for the World Cup. The new WSL season gets under way tonight, when Chelsea begin their latest title defence by hosting Manchester City at Stamford Bridge. You can listen to the Women's Football Weekly WSL season preview podcast by clicking on the link below, or else subscribe on your usual pod platform. Slovenia v Sweden: Having missed pre-season and spent most of the past six weeks alone kicking footballs into an empty goal in a secluded corner of Newcastle's training ground, it's no great surprise that Alexander Isak is not in Jon Dahl Tomasson's starting line-up to face Slovenia tonight. Liverpool's brand new striker is among the substitutes, with Viktor Gyokeres and Anthony Elanga having got the nod ahead of him. Denmark: Schmeichel, Kristensen, Andersen, Andreas Christensen, Maehle, Dreyer, Hojbjerg, Hjulmand, Damsgaard, Dolberg, Biereth. Subs: Hermansen, Jorgensen, Vestergaard, Hogsberg, O'Riley, Osula, Hojlund, Gronbaek, Skov Olsen, Froholdt, Dorgu, Gaaei. Scotland: Gunn, Hickey, Souttar, Hanley, Robertson, Ferguson, McTominay, Christie, Adams, McGinn, Dykes. Subs: Kelly, Clark, Gilmour, Hendry, Miller, McKenna, Doak, Hirst, Bowie, Johnston, McLean, Doig. Togo, North Korea, Panama, Saudi Arabia and Wales have featured in the World Cup since Scotland last did in 1998 and while Sterve Clarke's side are desperate to end their hiatus, the next six matches will dictate their fate and the legacy of their long-serving head coach. After yesterday's wins for Wales and Northern Ireland, Scotland get their campaign to qualify for next summer's World Cup in the USA, Canada and Mexico under way with a trip to face Denmark at Parken in Copenhagen. In a four-team group with Greece and Belarus, one imagines the Scots, Danes and Greeks will each fancy their chances of winning the group and consider any finish below a playoff spot an unmitigated disaster. It will come as no surprise whatsover if they cause Steve Clarke's side and the two higher ranked nations in Group C problems, even if they are currently obliged to play their home fixtures in neutral venues due to their ongoing involvement of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. As well as monitoring the Scots, we'll keep tabs on the other Uefa qualifiers taking place around the continent, making sure to check in on Sweden's Group B opener against Slovenia in Ljubljana. Unless he's gone on strike and demanded a move to another, more successful nation, Alexander Isak could feature for the Swedes in his first match of the season. Having successfully agitated for a summer move to Liverpool, the former Newcastle striker seems unlikely to start given that he can't conceivably be match fit and hasn't had a proper pre-season but could appear off the bench. Elsewhere, history suggests the qualifier between Switzerland and Kosovo has the potential to be spicy, while Ukraine get their campaign under way with an eyecatching “home” game against France in the Polish city of Wroclaw. Having failed to qualify for either of the past two World Cups, Italy really need a home win against Estonia if they are to avoid further embarrassment. It would be a seismic shock if Croatia were to slip up against the Faroe Islands in Torshavn.</p>

Global superpower France will make a belated start to its 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign as it faces Ukraine in Poland on Friday. Ukraine and France travel to Wroclaw on Friday for a showdown on neutral soil as both teams seek an early leg up in their efforts to qualify for the 2026 World Cup. Les Bleus are major favorites to seal top spot in the qualifying group that also contains Iceland and Azerbaijan, hoping to cement their place in the tournament finals for the eighth consecutive edition. Serhiy Rebrov's side have drawn their last two meetings with Didier Deschamps' men, but it's been almost 12 years since Ukraine last managed a win in this head-to-head. And that's what's required if Zbirna is to have any chance at first place in qualifying Group D, though second will still advance to the play-offs as an alternative route. Liverpool striker Hugo Ekitike was a late call-up to Deschamps' squad as a replacement for injured Manchester City midfielder Rayan Cherki. Meanwhile, Ukraine center-back Ilya Zabarnyi will see some familiar faces on the opposing team after he joined Paris Saint-Germain from Bournemouth in a deal worth $76 million.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. men's national team coach Mauricio Pochettino said he is looking forward to reuniting with his former player, Son Heung-min, when the U.S. faces South Korea on Saturday in New Jersey. He was a very important player, one of the most important players in my tenure in Tottenham. I was always chasing him, because when I was in Southampton, also I wanted to sign him, but he decided to move to a different club. “And I think, now, he's a legend. After 10 years, he's a legend at Tottenham. Pochettino has often pointed to Lionel Messi's influence on Major League Soccer and the reputation of the American domestic league. For Pochettino, Messi's ability to succeed in MLS and stay at a high level when playing with Argentina has reinforced his belief that the league is strong enough to feed American players into his side. LAFC paid a record transfer fee for Son, and the Korean has made an instant impact, setting up goals in his first three games in Los Angeles. “What (Son) is going to add to the MLS, I think, is (that) this type of player is going to help in the evolution of the game, for sure,” Pochettino said. Pochettino pointed out Messi's influence the night before in his final home World Cup qualifier against Venezuela, scoring twice to lead Argentina to a win. Son and South Korea should present a strong challenge for Pochettino's team, which is searching for positive results after advancing to the Gold Cup final this summer. Several key faces are back in the squad this week, including Christian Pulisic, Sergiño Dest, Tim Weah, Josh Sargent and Folarin Balogun. “South Korea is a very good team,” Pochettino said. And I think it's important to see the way that we want to compete with new faces, a little bit (of a) different team than we were playing in the last Gold Cup. But I think it is always important, because the challenge for us is to arrive in the best condition to the World Cup, and I think to give options to different players that maybe didn't play before is important because this is a challenge that we need to (see) between our players.” Find the hidden link between sports terms Paul Tenorio  is a senior writer for The Athletic who covers soccer.</p>

The USMNT star might be the best talent in his federation, but there are plenty of other names waiting to burst onto the scene

We all just assumed that Christian Pulisic is the best player in CONCACAF. That is, of course, the natural order of things - especially if you are of the USMNT persuasion. After all, he is the go-to guy for Milan, a constant threat for the national team, and a top performer in pretty much every notable big game he has featured in of late.

But is that really the case? Pulisic missed two months of football this summer after electing to sit out of the Gold Cup, and watched from home as the rest of CONCACAF staked their claim. In short, there's a sense that others could have caught up. U.S. teammate Tyler Adams has been excellent of late, while Canada's Jonathan David has shown that he is good enough to earn a true step up for Juventus, who have dreams of European glory.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea prepared for their opening fixture of the new Women's Super League (WSL) season by announcing the acquisition of Alyssa Thompson for a new club-record fee. The U.S. Women's national team (USWNT) star is the latest arrival in a summer dominated by big money signings. On the same day Thompson was unveiled, London City Lionesses made Grace Geyoro the most expensive signing in women's football history with a deal thought to be worth £1.43 million ($1.92 million), while Arsenal paid £1 million to whisk Olivia Smith away from Liverpool in July. Thompson is expected to cost just less than that seven-digit sum before add-ons are included. Angel City, the NWSL side which paid £335,000 to have the first draft pick in 2023 which they used to select Thompson straight out of high school, hailed the agreement as “one of the highest transactions in global women's soccer.” Leaving her local club in Los Angeles represents a sizeable upheaval for the 20-year-old. “I love LA,” Thompson told Chelsea's official website. I feel like Chelsea is such an amazing club. I knew it would be so good for me. I felt like I'd be able to grow not just as a player, but also as a person. Thompson has signed a five-year contract stretching until 2030. The jet-heeled winger will watch her new teammates begin the defence of their league title at home to Manchester City on Friday evening at Stamford Bridge.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. women's national team forward Alyssa Thompson has made a major – and somewhat surprising – move, departing Angel City of the NWSL for English giants Chelsea. That said, it may have fallen late Thursday, with French outlet L'Equipe reporting that London City Lionesses had spent roughly $1.92 million to acquire midfielder Grace Geyoro from Paris Saint-Germain. The Women's Super League season begins on Friday, with Chelsea hosting Manchester City in a clash of title contenders. Chelsea is hoping to win a seventh consecutive title, six of which came during current USWNT head coach's Emma Hayes' tenure. Thompson, whose younger sister Gisele remains an Angel City player, has 22 USWNT caps, scoring three goals in those appearances. In 16 NWSL appearances for Angel City this season – where she was widely considered the team's best player – the elder Thompson scored six goals and added two assists. She departs having posted 15 goals and 11 assists in 62 total regular-season appearances for the L.A.-based club. Thompson's departure from Angel City arrived rather abruptly, with buzz around Chelsea's interest only coming to the surface in recent days. ET Thursday to complete transfers; otherwise, a player would not be eligible to play in any competitive game until the secondary transfer window opens on Jan. 1, 2026. Here's what to know about USWNT attacker Alyssa Thompson joining Chelsea: Alyssa Thompson's move to Chelsea is major news on both sides of the Atlantic, and could have huge short- and long-term implications in the NWSL. Her speed in the open field will make her one of the WSL's fastest players, and her new head coach, Sonia Bompastor, will be able to underline this transfer as evidence that the Blues are not resting on their laurels. From Thompson's perspective, there are also major positives at play. Back in January, the forward signed a contract extension running through 2028, but Chelsea, which – thanks to very different league rules, have fewer financial restrictions to cope with than Angel City – is expected to have given her a significant raise. With USWNT teammates Naomi Girma and Catarina Macario already playing for the Blues, Thompson will have friendly faces to guide her as she adjusts to a different environment. Through her play, local roots, and some injury trouble for veteran stars, Thompson had become the face of ACFC. The NWSL transfer window closed last month, and while trades are still possible until the roster freeze date on Oct. 9, the other 13 teams will know that Angel City has just had a financial windfall while also walking into a bind in terms of their roster composition. After winning two straight, ACFC sits in ninth place on 23 points, trailing NJ/NY Gotham FC for the eighth and final postseason berth by a single point with eight games to play. While speculation that the league is doomed to lose all of its stars to free-spending European sides remains unfounded, there's no pretending that losing one of the league's best young players mere months after she had signed a long-term contract isn't a blow. Instead, Thompson is off to London without breaking the global transfer record, which seems like a serious undervaluation. It's one thing for Chelsea, Arsenal, and French giant OL Lyonnes (whose owner, Michelle Kang, also owns the Washington Spirit) to have interest in the league's superstars. That's going to happen, because the NWSL has such a long list of outstanding players. It's another thing entirely to see a player in that class depart with no near-term means of replacing them, and at a price that does make sense stacked up against the other major transfers over the last 12 months.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Germany has returned to embarrass itself in the global stage yet again. Following nearly 10 disappointing years of continuous losses and a steady decline, the country hit a new low, as they granted Slovakia an easy 2-0 win. The lofty aspirations from manager Julian Nagelsmann, who claimed the aim was to win the World Cup 2026, were proven to be mere words as Germany helplessly failed by dint of a solid Slovakian performance. There has not been a single aspect of the game in which Slovakia did not upstage Germany. Slovakia mostly belongs to the latter — the team that managed to execute very basic, simple, yet effectual football. There was much wrong with die Mannschaft. One may argue that both goals were the result of Germany's breakdown, but they deserve due credit for the beautiful passing in their goal build-ups and the picture perfect finishes. He tore through Germany, with explosive pace and a terrific vision for goal. Additionally the Slovak striker David Strelec had a goal and an assist to his name. Other mentions go to Ondrej Duda at midfield and goalkeeper Martin Dúbravka. Slovakia were compact, well-coordinated, and the best of all, even older players pulled their weight. As extreme as it sounds, the truth is that there has been a complete tactical breakdown in Germany. Some may hate to admit it, but Nagelsmann clearly did not instruct the team appropriately enough. Somehow the Germans could not string a single pass together, and were even worse off the ball — look at any tackle made and not one looks clean, let alone effective. Goretzka playing out of position did more for the attack than Serge Gnabry. It begs the question — why move at all without a plan in mind? The backline is severely depleted as wing-backs progress forward but it is also the former's job to make recovery runs and that does not happen when every defender has already lost their man. Antonio Rüdiger somehow had his worst ever Germany performance. His decline at club seems to have bled into his performances for the country and given tonight's performance, it is of doubt as to whether he will start further games in the presence of other personnel. Jonathan Tah continues to exhibit the same questionable performances he has shown at Bayern Munich lately, if not worse, being very mistake prone. Nick Woltemade looked terribly underwhelming and the decision to play him as striker is a head-scratcher. Whom do you blame for Germany's fall from grace? b. Julian Nagelsmann for his nonexistent tactics, poor choice of players and terrible setup, or, c. The players for having played like amateurs? The fact is that Germany desperately need to qualify for this World Cup. Blaming Tah or Rüdiger for being terrible and ball watching in the Slovakian final third helps no one if they do not plan on fixing things. Maximilian Mittelstädt and Oliver Baumann may have saved the country from a worse outcome, but this still is not an acceptable state of affairs for Germany. Perhaps, it might be ok to accept that the former Weltmeister Germany will not be a part of the World Cup — for they have hit a new low. Congratulations to Slovakia on having won their first game in months. Julian Nagelsmann — as he is prone to do — did some experimenting with his lineup and it did not work as the team dropped a 2-0 decision. The players were bad, the coaching was not great, and it was not a banner effort overall.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are no new alerts at this time Rising national soccer star Alyssa Thompson is moving to the United Kingdom to play for Chelsea FC, in a surprise deal that takes her away from her hometown team and her younger sister. Thompson signed to Chelsea in "one of the highest transactions in global women's soccer," Angel City FC announced Friday, although the exact financial terms were not announced. The 20-year-old forward had re-signed a contract with Angel City in Los Angeles earlier this year, which would have kept her at the club through 2028. "I love L.A.," Thompson said in a release from Chelsea on Friday. I feel like Chelsea is such an amazing club." The deal was announced after Chelsea told fans that Colombian forward Mayra Ramírez will be sidelined indefinitely to rehab a hamstring injury that required surgery. Rumors swirled over the last week that Thompson was in talks to move to the Women's Super League, much to the dismay of her Los Angeles fans. But Thompson was not at the game, marked as an excuse absence on the availability report as speculation intensified. The two teams are set to face each other on Sunday, and Angel City will have to do so without one of its top scorers. It's unclear how Angel City will cope with losing Thompson as the NWSL transfer window ended on Aug. 25, and Thompson is currently the second-highest scorer on the team. She's given them six goals so far this season,  just two behind former teammate Riley Tiernan. Thompson was drafted by Angel City at the age of 17 in January 2023, which at the time was a historic move as the NWSL had never drafted a high schooler. Her younger sister was signed to the team later that year, in what the sisters described as dream come true opportunity to play together. They've both been called up to the U.S. women's national team as coach Emma Hayes has been looking to add depth in her roster through developing younger players. She scored her first goal for the senior national team in October last year in an international friendly against Iceland. Since then, Thompson has scored two more goals and totaled three assists for the national team. Thompson will join her USWNT teammates Naomi Girma and Cat Macario at Chelsea. It's an incredible opportunity for Thompson's career development as she grows into a household name for soccer fans. Chelsea is considered one of the best clubs in the women's game, with a stacked roster full of international stars. English players Lucy Bronze and Hannah Hampton are returning to the squad after helping England win the UEFA European Women's Championship this summer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MORRISTOWN — When United States national team defender Max Arfsten jumped into a small-sided soccer match on Sept. 4, Ryder Jacobs knew exactly what to do. "But I didn't really get a chance. Arfsten and teammate Sebastian Berhalter spent a few minutes in each of the youth club matches at the last session of Soccer Forward Play Day, a community engagement event designed to bring together people who love "the beautiful game." The men's national team has been practicing at the Red Bulls' facility in Hanover Township ahead of a Sept. 6 friendly against South Korea at Sports Illustrated Stadium. Jacobs, who plays for Randolph Soccer Club 12U, wore a navy No. 10 USMNT jersey with Christian Pulisic's name on the back. "You guys are the future," former national team defender C.J. The event began with an adult kickaround and networking opportunity, bringing together executives like New Jersey Youth Soccer CEO Evan Dabby, who recalled playing with Gregg Berhalter at Tenafly; Brianna Keys, the NYNJ World Cup host committee director of social impact; and Cosmos CEO Erik Stover, a Morristown resident. Special Olympics New Jersey athletes, mostly from Sparta Unified, also took to Delbarton's Ryan Family Field with their partners. Green Wave soccer players stepped up to play alongside them, offering pointers and encouragement. "When you're playing soccer, it's a human connection," said Delbarton center back Will Antenen, whose 10-year-old sister C.J. played with Chatham United in the later session. "There's something special about being on the field together," Antenen said. ... As someone who plays competitively, sometimes you take it too seriously.</p>

CNET Perspectives is a select group of creators, experts and thought leaders who share first-person commentary from lived experience. And every time a game came on, the entire town shut down for a couple hours as people crowded around whatever TV or radio they could find and enjoyed the broadcast. In Colombia and many other countries, soccer is a source of national pride. So it's fun to see this pride expressed in a country like the United States with its melting pot of cultures and heritages. Even if I'm not keeping up with the game, the family group chat is buzzing with activity whenever Colombia is playing, and when I do get out to live events, I need only spot someone in a matching yellow jersey to make a new friend. John Hoyos, right, with a family friend at the Copa América finals, in which Colombia played Argentina. Hisense is an official sponsor of next year's FIFA World Cup™, and with products like its 116-inch Class UX Series model with RGB-MiniLED technology, the company is showing it understands how to outrun the competition. Here's what to know about the two tournaments and how Hisense is involved. Meet industry creators, contributors and emerging thought leaders that have paired with CNET's award-winning editorial team to provide you with unique content from different perspectives. Although their names are similar, the FIFA World Cup and FIFA Club World Cup are different events and have different dynamics. The FIFA Club World Cup, which concluded this past July, places 32 already-existing teams from around the world into a new tournament format. Each qualifying country enters one team of its best players, a requirement that focuses national pride and creates universal appeal. The FIFA World Cup gives a voice and presence to smaller countries and helps them be seen on the big stage. When Croatia made it to the World Cup final in 2018, for example, they were the second-smallest country by population to ever do so. In 2026, the FIFA World Cup will expand from 32 to 48 teams, which will allow more countries to compete and introduce their cultures at one of the most epic tournaments for any sport. Since first partnering with FIFA in 2018, Hisense has marked four milestone collaborations: initial branding at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, content cooperation via FIFA+ in 2022, technology integration in VAR operations at the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 and now the upcoming FIFA World Cup 26 sponsorship. Each step strengthened Hisense's global presence and commitment to enhancing the fan experience. Enter Hisense's 116-inch Class UX Series model, the world's largest RGB-MiniLED TV. In an RGB-MiniLED TV, the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) themselves are red, green and blue, rather than only white LEDs with a color filter. The result is cleaner contrast, higher peak brightness and better overall color accuracy. As a career-long filmmaker, I probably know and care more about color accuracy than the average soccer fan. Hisense is the origin of RGB-MiniLED and debuted it at CES earlier this year, and with this 116-inch stunner, you'll see the picture difference on a grand scale that's sure to get people talking. With Hisense at the helm, your next watch party will please your guests no matter what country they're cheering for (except when Colombia is playing, in which case you should cheer for them, although I might be biased).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It felt like an important building block under head coach Mauricio Pochettino, who at the time of the Gold Cup had been with the USMNT for less than a year. Veteran center back Tim Ream said the players developed a better understanding of Pochettino's expectations. “Just making sure everybody's being held accountable, pushing each other, making sure we're on the same page —we're on the same team. We're trying to move things forward and make sure we're in a good position moving into the next year and into the World Cup.” Twelve players return from the Gold Cup on Pochettino's latest 24-player roster as the USMNT gets set to face Korea Republic (Sept. 6; Harrison, New Jersey) and Japan (Sept. 9; Columbus, Ohio). “Continuing to try and push the standard of what we're trying to achieve and become a winning team is super important,” Adams said ahead of the friendly against Korea. That standard is built on a culture of players determined to compete for their country. Pochettino has stressed at different times during his year-long tenure the importance of playing with pride for the crest; he sees that hunger serving as a baseline of a winning team. Forward Tim Weah watched the Gold Cup unfold from afar while his then-club Juventus competed in the FIFA Club World Cup. He followed it closely, watching his teammates grind out gritty wins on the way to a final, including a defining penalty shootout in the quarterfinal against Costa Rica. “I think we're just building off of that,” Weah said. Being back after not being with them in the summer is just an amazing feeling, and anytime I'm here, I try to keep that vibe.” While Ream said there's no more pressure than usual, it's still an ultra-importantopportunity together with the 2026 FIFA World Cup in sight. But with the amount of time between now and the World Cup, there's no such thing as friendly games,” Ream said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In recent interviews, the legendary U.S. forward has opened up on motherhood, and inspiring change as she navigates retired life. Even in retirement, the former United States Women's National Team (USWNT) forward is continuing to shatter glass ceilings. “We're joining forces to reaffirm that the future of women's sports is here,” Morgan said. Olympic Membership - Free Live Stream Sports & Original Series - join now! Recently Morgan gave birth to her second child Enzo, five years on from having daughter Charlie. “[After her second pregnancy], I felt like I took care of my body, but I also gave it the grace to not go for a run or get in the gym… my body responded really well this time around, in being able to give birth and get back to feeling good.” If she had given birth while still pursuing her career the second time around, Morgan will be well equipped for far better conditions, largely thanks to her own work behind the scenes. “There were a lot of challenges to work through and a lot of barriers to break down – now in the NWSL, we can proudly be able to stand tall and [know that] you can do it all, have a family and continue playing, which wasn't always the case.” In a move that speaks to her impact in this sport and the club itself, the San Diego Wave will be retiring her shirt. A ceremony will take place on 7 September, cementing yet another chapter in this history-making career of hers. “I feel so fortunate that I got to play five years with my daughter – on the field with her after games, special moments walking out before the game with her, her being in the stands waving to me,” she said. “It's not only seeing them and how my journey is so unique to me, but also all the advocacy that I've worked for.” Morgan has undeniably spearheaded the growth of women's football worldwide – though her boots are hung up, she is showing no signs of slowing down.</p>

Lionel Messi has cast doubt over his participation at the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Messi, who will be 39 by the time the finals roll around next summer, scored twice as he signed off in style during Argentina's 3-0 win over Venezuela on Thursday. The Inter Miami forward has already confirmed he will play no part in La Albiceleste's final CONMEBOL qualifier against Ecuador next week. Signing off in style in his last official match in the country, over 85,000 fans packed into Estadio Monumental to catch one final glimpse of arguably their country's greatest-ever player. Messi spoke to the media following his side's victory in Buenos Aires, admitting he is still unsure whether he will play at the 2026 edition in the United States, Mexico and Canada. "Because of my age, the most logical thing is that I won't make it," began the 38-year-old forward. It's always a joy to play in Argentina with our people.

"But well, we're almost there, so I'm excited and motivated to play it. "I'm trying to feel good and, above all, being honest with myself. I haven't made a decision about the World Cup. Hopefully, I'll have a good pre-season in 2026 and finish this MLS season well, and then I'll decide."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester United forward Bryan Mbeumo produced a top-class performance, helping Cameroon to a comfortable 3-0 victory over lowly Eswatini. He has undoubtedly been one of United's better players during what has been an uncertain start to the new season, with his displays earning him a nomination for the club's August Player of the Month award. Mbeumo scored his first goal for United in the embarrassing EFL Cup defeat to Grimsby Town before opening his Premier League account in the subsequent game against Burnley. The 26-year-old was named in the starting XI for Cameroon's World Cup qualifier against Eswatini on Thursday and led his nation to a dominant win. Mbeumo wasted no time in asserting himself on the game, playing a big role in Cameroon's opener just six minutes into proceedings. Unluckily for Mbeumo, it was judged to be an own goal. Less than 20 minutes later, the United man was at it again, this time delivering a sumptuous pinpoint cross inside the box to Georges-Kevin Nkoudou, who rose highest to head home. Arthur Nvom added a third just moments after, securing the victory for Cameroon and dashing whatever hopes Eswatini may have harboured of a comeback. Also on the pitch for the Indomitable Lions was Andre Onana, although he was largely a bystander in front of goal and didn't have much to do. Mbeumo and Onana are back in action on Tuesday, 9 September, when Cameroon take on table leaders Cape Verde at Estádio Nacional de Cabo Verde.</p>

It was a formal call-up by Mauricio Pochettino to the senior national team for friendlies against South Korea and Japan. “I was very surprised to be honest, and my first reaction was I couldn't believe it and I called my mom instantly,” Banks told Soccer America at the team's camp in Morristown, New Jersey. “She couldn't believe it as well.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A sold out stadium of 85 thousand in Buenos Aires witness two farewell Lionel Messi goals in World Cup qualifier. Lionel Messi made sure he had good memories of playing a home qualifier with Argentina's national team for the last time in his illustrious career. The former Barcelona forward scored twice on Thursday in Argentina's 3-0 victory over Venezuela in front of a raucous sellout crowd that had gathered at Estadio Monumental to bid him farewell. “Being able to finish this way here is what I've always dreamed of,” Messi said. “I've experienced a lot of things on this pitch, both good and not so good, but it's always a joy to play in Argentina, in front of our fans.” Messi now has 36 goals in South American World Cup qualifiers and remains the all-time scoring leader. His Inter Miami teammate, Luis Suarez, has 29 goals in continental qualifying, but he has retired from Uruguay's national team. If I feel good, I enjoy it; if not, I'd rather not be there,” he said, adding that the nine months until the tournament kicks off “is a long time”. Already qualified, the World Cup champions extended their tally to 38 points and will remain atop the South American qualifying standings regardless of what happens in the last round next Tuesday. Venezuela, trying to qualify for its first World Cup, remains on 18 points and in seventh place.</p>
