            Amid reports the Justice Department is weighing banning transgender people from owning firearms in response to last month's mass shooting at a Minneapolis Catholic church, the National Rifle Association said Friday it will oppose any blanket rule that limits Second Amendment rights.
    


            Their declaration comes after CNN and other outlets reported that Justice Department leadership is considering whether it can use its rulemaking authority declare that people who are transgender are mentally ill and can lose their rights to possess firearms.
    


            “The NRA supports the Second Amendment rights of all law abiding Americans to purchase, possess and use firearms,” the organization said in a social media post.”NRA does not, and will not, support any policy proposals that implement sweeping gun bans that arbitrarily strip law-abiding citizens of their Second Amendment rights without due process.”
    


Trump DOJ is looking at ways to ban transgender Americans from owning guns, sources say



            The post was captioned, “The Second Amendment isn't up for debate.”
    


            The NRA confirmed to CNN it was commenting on the Justice Department discussions.
    


            Though the internal talks are preliminary and a final rule is far from being implemented, the discussions were faced with an immediate public outcry – including from civil rights groups and gun advocacy groups who claim any such rule would be overly broad and unconstitutionally target a minority group's rights.
    


            There is no evidence to suggest transgender people are more likely to commit mass attacks. Data does show, however, that transgender people are far more likely to be the victims of a violent crime.
    


            The idea of restricting gun rights has long been a red line for conservatives, with many Republican lawmakers and gun rights groups opposing red flag laws and other policies aimed at keeping guns away from people suffering from mental health issues.
    


            Powerful gun rights groups like the NRA have long objected to any sweeping restrictions on the Second Amendment of the Constitution, including during Donald Trump's first administration. After the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 people at a music festival, the NRA initially supported, but ultimately opposed regulations on bump stocks. Those regulations were eventually struck down by the Supreme Court.

Democrats see RFK Jr. as a weakness in Trump's cabinet — and a clear and present danger to public health.

Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. remained combative during an extraordinary Senate Finance Committee hearing on September 4 as Democrats grilled him about creating “chaos” at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the committee's ranking Democrat, said Kennedy fired career scientists at the CDC and replaced them with “cranks” and “conspiracy theorists” who promote mistrust in basic public health principles. 

“His actions are endangering children, leaving parents confused and scared, and forcing families and taxpayers to pay more for their health care,” Wyden said of Kennedy in his opening statement.

Wyden is one of dozens of Democrats who have joined medical groups, including the American Association of Immunologists and the American Public Health Association, in calling for Kennedy to resign, according to The Washington Post. More than 1,000 current and former staffers at HHS, which includes the CDC, issued a public letter on September 3 demanding that Kennedy resign or be fired by Donald Trump.

Support for Kennedy, an attorney and a celebrity in the world of anti-vaxxers, appears to be wavering among a handful of key Senate Republicans, although GOP lawmakers were careful not to cross Trump while voicing concerns during the Senate hearing. All eyes were on Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Republican and physician from Louisiana who has pledged to regularly meet with Kennedy and hold him to promises made during confirmation hearings earlier this year.

Despite expressing hesitation over his ability to lead the department, Cassidy cast a key confirmation vote in February after receiving assurances that as secretary, Kennedy would not restrict access to vaccines and stoke public mistrust. When Cassidy told Kennedy on Thursday that his policies were effectively denying people COVID shots, Kennedy responded flatly, “You're wrong.”

In fact, Kennedy's policies are creating confusion among doctors and pharmacists and preventing pregnant women, young children, and healthy people under the age of 65 from receiving COVID booster shots at pharmacies in more than a dozen states. Depending on forthcoming recommendations from the CDC's immunization advisory board — a panel that Kennedy recently gutted and stacked with allies and vaccine skeptics — access to COVID vaccines and public trust in disease prevention could further erode under the Trump administration. 

The hearing showed that Democrats see Kennedy and the allies he is installing at powerful positions throughout his department as a direct threat to the wellbeing of their constituents. Now, coupled with drastic cuts to health care approved by Trump and Republicans in the massive budget bill passed earlier this summer, Democrats also appear to view Kennedy as a weakness within Trump's cabinet, and the GOP's gutting of health infrastructure as an opening for political attack.

“You are a hazard to the health of the American people,” Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia told Kennedy during a tense exchange before calling on him to resign.

Alarmingly, during an extraordinary exchange with Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia), Kennedy said he did not know how many people in the United States are estimated to have died from COVID, or whether the vaccines prevented additional deaths. Warner expressed disbelief that a sitting U.S. health secretary could be “that ignorant” about the deadliest disease outbreak in decades. Kennedy said that he doesn't think “anybody knows” how many people died from COVID and attacked the accuracy of CDC data released regularly under President Joe Biden.

At several points during the hearing, Kennedy told lawmakers they were speaking “gibberish” when he was confronted with scientific facts and news reports about the disruption he has brought to HHS. Lisa Gilbert, president of the watchdog group Public Citizen, said Kennedy is “grossly incompetent and unqualified” to lead HHS.

“The gaslighting, the lack of health expertise and the personal pseudoscientific agenda that Kennedy continues to flout are sickening and killing Americans,” Gilbert said in a statement after the hearing. “Kennedy is throwing us into a health crisis.” 

The hearing was a rundown of controversies that have erupted at federal health agencies since Kennedy's confirmation in February. Top officials have resigned and hundreds of CDC employees staged a walkout on August 29 after Kennedy fired CDC Director Susan Monarez, who wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on September 4 that Kennedy pressured her to pre-approve policies that would restrict access to COVID shots without providing scientific evidence. Kennedy told the Senate Finance Committee that Monarez is lying.

In response, Monarez's legal team told Axios that Kennedy's accusations were “false and, at times, patently ridiculous.”

As ranking member on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) launched an investigation into Kennedy's decision in late July to fire all 17 members of a key vaccine policy recommendation panel and has called for a bipartisan investigation into the firings. Kennedy replaced the 17 doctors and scientists with allies and vaccine skeptics — the “cranks” and “conspiracy theorists” that Wyden and other Democrats warn about.

Kennedy has also faced intense internal pushback from hundreds of employees after a shooter opened fire outside of CDC offices in Georgia on August 8.

“The attack came amid growing mistrust in public institutions, driven by politicized rhetoric that has turned public health professionals from trusted experts into targets of villainization — and now, violence,” reads an August 20 letter to Kennedy signed by 750 federal employees.

The suspect shot more than 200 rounds at CDC's offices in Atlanta, and a police officer was killed before the suspect was arrested. Further investigation by law enforcement revealed the suspect was fixated on COVID vaccines and misinformation about them.

“Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., is complicit in dismantling America's public health infrastructure and endangering the nation's health by repeatedly spreading inaccurate health information,” the signatories wrote.

In the past, Kennedy has asserted without evidence that COVID shots are “the deadliest vaccine ever made” and called the CDC a “cesspool of corruption.” Experts say serious adverse effects from COVID vaccines are rare.

Julie Rovner, a correspondent for KFF Health News, said Kennedy was unable to answer basic questions from lawmakers about how HHS and CDC function and what his controversial appointees are working on within the agencies. This reportedly includes a study attempting to link childhood autism to vaccines, an obsession of Kennedy's that made him famous in alternative health circles but has been debunked by years of research.

“He continued to be really rude, and he continued to not know how the department works,” Rovner said during a webinar after the hearing. “Will this make it easier for Republicans to defend him? Probably not.”

“Enough is enough. It's time for Kennedy to be ousted from his position as secretary of HHS,” Gilbert said.

The groups said the US is “dismantling the international legal order” in order to maintain Israel's impunity.

The U.S. State Department is facing heavy criticism after it announced on Thursday it is imposing sanctions on three major Palestinian human rights groups over their participation in the International Criminal Court's case (ICC) against top Israeli officials.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he's adding Al-Haq, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) to the list of “Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List,” as part of President Donald Trump's executive order sanctioning the ICC. 

The three groups are leading human rights organizations in the occupied Palestinian territories, operating out of the West Bank and Gaza. They have been instrumental in monitoring Israel's genocide in Gaza and annexation of the West Bank, serving as a key voice of Palestinians amid Israel's assaults. Sanctions could have a vast chilling effect on their work.

“These entities have directly engaged in efforts by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute Israeli nationals, without Israel's consent,” Rubio said. “We oppose the ICC's politicized agenda, overreach, and disregard for the sovereignty of the United States and that of our allies.”

The groups decried the sanctions in a joint statement calling on states to pressure the U.S. to lift the sanctions. They noted that this is part of a longtime effort by Israel to silence Palestinian voices, by law or by force.

“Threatened by the impact and role of our advocacy, legal research, and documentation in exposing Israel's ongoing international crimes, the United States has resorted to punishing individuals and organisations seeking to uphold the legal system upon which the international community was founded,” the groups said.

“The implications go beyond Palestine: by protecting Israel from accountability, they are dismantling the international legal order and undermining the possibility of justice for victims of grave crimes anywhere,” the groups went on. “But we will not give up nor be silenced. We will not bend to any State apparatus or system fuelled by violence and oppression.”

The sanctions come after the U.S. sanctioned another Palestinian human rights group, Addameer, which focuses on Palestinian prisoners' rights, and UN Special Rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese.

Rubio's announcement was widely condemned. UN human rights chief Volker Türk said in a statement that the sanctions are “completely unacceptable.”

“For decades now, these NGOs have been performing vital human rights work, particularly on accountability for human rights violations,” said Türk. “The work of civil society in documenting violations and engaging with international accountability mechanisms is all the more important when international humanitarian and human rights laws are being violated systematically in Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.”

A coalition of Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups, including major organizations like B'Tselem, called the sanctions “violent.” 

“This is yet another move aimed at erasing fundamental norms of protecting human beings, designed to enable Israel to continue harming Palestinians without restraint,” the coalition said.

Other major international human rights organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International also denounced the Trump administration.

“The Trump administration's decision to impose sanctions against three prominent Palestinian human rights organizations is a deeply troubling and shameful assault on human rights and the global pursuit of justice,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty International's senior director for Research, Advocacy, Policy and Campaigns. “This appalling move constitutes a brazen attack on the entire Palestinian human rights movement, and a callous attempt to fracture and weaken the whole global human rights community.”

City on edge as Trump prepares to move troops in, but organizers and residents are taking steps to push back

Communities are on edge as the long-discussed arrival of federal law enforcement and Ice agents to Chicago is reportedly set to begin in the coming days, marking the potential start of a contentious period of federal policing in the Democratic-led midwestern city.

Donald Trump reaffirmed his commitment to send federal troops to the city as an effort to curb violence and homelessness on Tuesday, calling it a “hellhole” and saying that, though troops would be headed to Chicago regardless, the city's mayor, Brandon Johnson, and the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, should be calling him personally to ask for his help.

If that were to happen, Chicago would be the second US city to receive national guard troops after Trump declared a national crime emergency and deployed about 800 troops to Washington DC in August, having previously sent the national guard to Los Angeles in June.

“We're going in,” Trump said about Chicago. “I didn't say when, [but] we're going in.”

The statement came in the wake of Chicago's Labor Day weekend, during which nearly 60 people were shot and at least eight killed, which some experts have said could be used by the Trump administration as further justification for sending troops. Though the shootings marked the city's deadliest weekend this summer, the overall number of violent crimes has continued to drop in recent years and has remained at its lowest levels in the last four decades. Murders committed from June to August totaled 123, the city's lowest number in 60 years, according to a WBEZ-Chicago analysis.

Both Johnson and Pritzker have routinely rejected the popular rightwing political view of Chicago being overly crime-ridden and in need of federal help. And this week, local leadership began preparing the Chicago populace for federal troops, which are expected to descend upon the city as early as this weekend, according to the New York Times. At the end of August, Johnson passed the Protecting Chicago initiative, an executive order with sweeping measures aimed at limiting Trump's influence on local law enforcement.

Though the president floated the idea of sending troops to states such as Louisiana first, reports suggest Chicago is still primed to be the next city to receive the national guard, whether local leaders agree with the actions or not.

An advance team of at least 30 agents is currently undergoing crowd control and flash grenade training at Naval Station Great Lakes north of Chicago, and 230 agents, most of whom work for Customs and Border Protection, are being sent to Chicago from Los Angeles, sources told the Chicago Sun-Times. During a news conference on Tuesday, Pritzker also expressed concern that Ice agents will target Mexican Independence Day events this month. The El Grito Chicago Mexican Independence Day festival, scheduled for this weekend in downtown Chicago's Grant Park, was also postponed on Thursday due to concerns of Ice operations.

Among residents who are chafing at the prospect of federal troops coming to Chicago is Edwin Eisendrath, a former member of the Chicago city council who served in the Department of Housing and Urban Development under President Bill Clinton and was the CEO of the Chicago Sun-Times from 2017 to 2019. Eisendrath, who currently hosts a progressive political radio show from Chicago's Lincoln Square neighborhood on the city's North Side, believes if the goal is to lower crime in Chicago, deploying the national guard won't work.

To him, there is a “historic lack of trust in the police” among Chicagoans that will make any actions taken in the name of Trump's purported intent to lower crime ineffective, especially without taking steps to remove guns and other weapons brought over from neighboring red states with looser gun laws, or funding violence-prevention programming.

That, coupled with Chicago's history in labor and organizing, may mean different results than from what Trump is expecting.

“If you think of the civic action you've seen over history, whether that's the Pullman strikes a century ago, or Haymarket, or the early union movement, or what we did in the civil rights movement, or the organizing for the Women's March, Chicagoans are organized. So we aren't helpless,” Eisendrath said.

There's also Sjonia Harper, who works in software sales and has lived in Bronzeville, a historically Black neighborhood on Chicago's South Side, since 2006. Despite the overwhelming outside perception of Chicago's predominantly Black and brown neighborhoods such as Bronzeville being plagued by violence, Harper said that crime has largely not been a major concern for her.

“Am I scared to walk my dog? No. I walk my dog every day,” she said. “Even when I first moved to Bronzeville in 2006, when I would say crime was higher, I still walked my dog every day and wasn't afraid to walk around in my neighborhood and make friends with people in my neighborhood.”

Harper also believes it's important not to ignore the racial component to Trump's focus on Chicago and other cities to which he has signaled that troops could also be deployed, many of which are led by Black leaders and have large Black populations.

“It's not going to just end with [Chicago]. It's going to expand. He's already talking about New Orleans, and if you think about all the cities he's talking about – LA, Black mayor; DC, Black mayor; Chicago, Black mayor; Baltimore, Black mayor; New Orleans, Black mayor. We have to be able to call it out for what it is,” she said.

Harper anticipates federal troops employing law enforcement practices with the potential to create violence, not prevent it, including racial profiling, stop-and-frisk and establishing checkpoints in wealthy neighborhoods. She'll primarily be working from home to limit the chances of encountering troops, and plans to routinely check up on her neighbors to share information from the “Know Your Rights” campaigns she's absorbed.

For 22 years, John Orleans has lived in North Austin, a predominantly Black neighborhood on Chicago's West Side often evoked because its high crime rates have continued to fall in recent years. He believes increased investment and access to resources such as healthcare, grocery stores and infrastructure in neighborhoods like his could have a bigger impact on crime than deploying federal troops.

“[When] people have places to go, restaurants to eat at, places to shop, their neighborhood gets better. We've seen this in other neighborhoods in the city. When I was growing up, Wrigleyville wasn't a great neighborhood, and now, just try to find an apartment there,” Orleans said.

The Indivisible Chicago Alliance, a progressive organization of activists and neighborhood chapters, is one of several local groups sharing “Know Your Rights” campaigns, trainings and planned actions from a collection of like-minded partner organizations, including the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, which itself partners with the National Immigrant Justice Center (NIJC), the center's director of communications, Tara Tidwell Cullen, said..

The NIJC has been responding to threats from Ice in Chicago since the start of Trump's second term in January, and has been working with its partners to expand the scope of its work as federal troops head to Chicago, Tidwell Cullen said.

Other groups, such as Personal Pac, which typically organizes around reproductive rights, are collaborating with similar organizations and distributing information through the Hands Off Chicago website to “stand up against the unconstitutional and racist regime of Donald Trump”, Personal Pac's CEO, Sarah Garza Resnick, said. And the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) is preparing a team of more than 350 volunteers for legal observation during future protests and civil litigation that could arise from encounters between the public and troops, Matthew Coughlin, director of operations for NLG Chicago, said.

Currently, Trump is facing legal challenges that may halt his ability to deploy the national guard and Ice agents as he would like. On Tuesday, a judge ruled that the president violated federal law when he deployed thousands of national guard troops to Los Angeles earlier this summer during protests against Ice, and on Thursday, the District of Columbia sued Trump in federal court over his deployment of troops there.

Matt Conroy, a Democratic candidate for Illinois's fifth District, recognizes Chicago does have work to do to address crime, but he's concerned federal troops will primarily “terrorize” predominantly Black and Hispanic communities while costing the local and federal government money.

“Rather than addressing the root cause of this, they're just doing what they think looks good for the TV and pretending to be a strongman authoritarian, and that's all that Donald Trump really wants to be,” Conroy said.

“What they're doing is completely illegal,” Conroy said. “Honestly, invoke the Insurrection Act, but to stay together, have a plan, know your rights, and be respectful of law enforcement, to not escalate the situation further, and to provide them with additional resources.”

Members of the national guard should also defy unlawful orders that call for violence, Conroy said.

Denise Poloyac, a board member for the Indivisible Chicago Alliance, believes that if federal troops and Ice agents begin active law enforcement activities, community will become increasingly important. That means not going to protests alone or uninformed about their organizers, and engaging in de-escalation tactics.

“We can't be effective if we don't act together, and I think we draw our strength from each other. I think that is the strength of Chicago, and that's what's going to get us through this, and, you know, I think that's the strength of a lot of places in this country,” Poloyac said.

“I think that's what Trump's administration doesn't understand, that we are in a community.”

Effective October 6, USCIS special agents will be able to make arrests, carry firearms, and execute warrants.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is planning to recruit and train special agents who will be able to make arrests, carry firearms, and execute warrants against people who have allegedly violated immigration laws. 

A final rule published today in the federal register authorizes the director of USCIS to conduct “law enforcement activities to enforce civil and criminal violations of immigration laws within the jurisdiction of USCIS.” The rule is effective on October 6.

USCIS, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), screens and processes green card and citizenship applications. The agency also administers a number of programs, including those for people who seek to work in the United States, as well as humanitarian programs for victims of certain crimes and people who have been displaced by catastrophes in their home country, among others.

“This historic moment will better address immigration crimes, hold those that perpetrate immigration fraud accountable, and act as a force multiplier for DHS and our federal law enforcement partners, including the Joint Terrorism Task Force,” USCIS Director Joseph B. Edlow said in a press release. (During his Senate confirmation hearing, Edlow, a former visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, the right-wing think tank behind Project 2025, told lawmakers that “USCIS must be an immigration enforcement agency.”) 

The rule states that: “The law enforcement authorities delegated to the Director of USCIS include, but are not limited to, the authority to investigate alleged civil and criminal violations of the immigration laws within the jurisdiction of USCIS, issue and execute both search and arrest warrants, detain and remove aliens, and make recommendations for prosecutions or other appropriate action when deemed advisable.”

Previously, these duties were “only delegated to ICE and CBP regarding the enforcement of immigration laws.” 

As per the new rule, the director of USCIS “will grant individuals or a class of individuals the authority to use non-deadly force, deadly force (in situations where the designated immigration officer or other persons are in danger), and initiate a vehicular pursuit to apprehend fleeing suspects who are attempting to avoid apprehension.”

DHS did not provide public notice or hold a public comment period for the rule, as required by the Administrative Procedure Act, claiming that the “normal notice and comment procedures do not apply” as the changes “do nothing more than organize internal DHS operations.” The rule, however, fundamentally changes USCIS's role in the immigration system. 

“USCIS should be fairly adjudicating people's applications for services,” Doug Rand, a former USCIS senior official during the Biden administration, told NBC News. “It should not be scaring people from applying for services in the first place.”

DHS has made a number of changes to limit people's pathways to live, study, and work in the United States. In August, DHS proposed a rule to limit the amount of time that foreign-born reporters, academics, students, physicians, and others can stay in the United States. Those who wish to stay longer than that time frame would have to apply to USCIS, “therefore requiring regular assessments by DHS,” according to DHS's press release. 

If adopted, the rule, DHS said, “will limit the amount of time that foreign students, professors, physicians, and other visa holders are allowed to remain in the United States without additional screening and vetting.” 

Also last month, USCIS announced that it will consider “any involvement in anti-American or terrorist organizations” and “evidence of antisemitic activity” when reviewing noncitizens' applications to live and work in the United States. The Trump administration has used baseless accusations of antisemitism to attempt to deport foreign-born pro-Palestine student activists, including Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil, who has a green card.

The Trump administration has also been targeting people who show up at courthouses or USCIS offices for immigration appointments. The American Immigration Lawyers Association has reported that ICE has been arresting people when they come to USCIS for biometrics appointments, interviews for I-130 petitions (forms filed by U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents to sponsor their family members), and interviews for green card applications.

“[T]hese arrests are preventing eligible individuals from being approved for lawful status,” the organization wrote in a policy brief published in August. 

“The ICE arrests taking place at USCIS field offices across the country are inefficient, undermine the legal immigration process, and unnecessarily separate families,” the brief continues. “Current ICE actions not only undermine trust in the system but also punish those who are actively trying to comply with the law.”

Acclaimed historian Greg Grandin joins Democracy Now! to discuss the Trump administration's attack on an alleged drug-smuggling boat in international waters, which killed 11 people earlier this week. President Trump and other senior officials have claimed without evidence that the boat was carrying narcotics from Venezuela to the United States and was operated by the gang Tren de Aragua, which the U.S. has designated a terrorist organization. “It was pure murder,” says Grandin. “In many ways, it's bringing the logic of Gaza into the Caribbean, in terms of unaccountability, impunity and an expansive notion of national defense to justify what is, in effect, just extrajudicial killing.”

As President Trump is set to sign an executive order to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War, his administration is threatening to carry out more military attacks in Latin America under the guise of the “war on drugs,” after the U.S. blew up a boat off the coast of Venezuela.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You see it. You see the bags of drugs all over the boat. And they were hit. Obviously, they won't be doing it again. And I think a lot of other people won't be doing it again when they watch that tape.

AMY GOODMAN: The U.S. has deployed several ships, even a nuclear-powered submarine, in the southern Caribbean. On Thursday, U.S. officials said two Venezuelan military aircraft buzzed a U.S. Navy ship in international waters.

This comes as senior Trump administration officials are refusing to provide proof of their claims that blowing up the boat in the Caribbean earlier this week because it was carrying drugs from Venezuela. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he watched a live video feed of the operation, that the vessel targeted by the Pentagon was operated by the Tren de Aragua gang. But Hegseth provided no evidence. Venezuela's communication minister claimed the video was a fake made with artificial intelligence.

In a New York Times report Thursday, an anonymous former senior federal law enforcement official said the attack was a significant change in U.S. anti-narcotics operations and that, quote, “it was more likely that the vessel was carrying migrants on a human smuggling run.” The official noted, quote, “It would be impossible to know for sure, however, given that any evidence of drug smuggling was destroyed in the attack,” unquote. Many experts believe the strike was illegal under both international law and domestic law.

The attack came as Secretary of State Marco Rubio left for a trip to Latin America, where reporters asked if the Trump administration would seek congressional approval in the future for such strikes, but he didn't respond.

Meanwhile, President Nicolás Maduro announced he had mobilized over 8 million people into the National Bolivarian Militia to defend Venezuela against U.S. aggression. The U.S. recently doubled the reward for Maduro's arrest to $50 million and also accused him of being the head of the Cártel de los Soles.

Rubio was in Ecuador Thursday, after going to Mexico. He designated two more Latin American cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.

For more, we're joined by Greg Grandin, history professor at Yale University, Pulitzer Prize-winning author. His new book is America, América: A New History of the New World.

So, you have this boat filled with people, 11 people. Talk about what that indicates and what it means that the U.S. just blew it up in international waters.

GREG GRANDIN: Well, it was pure murder, and it was pure premeditated murder. It was 11 people in a go-fast boat. If you have that kind of boat, you're not — and you're using it for drugs, you're not going to waste space with filling it with 11 people and laying it down with 11 people. You're going to want to use that space to carry the drugs.

And it was premeditated because, I mean, 11 people were summarily executed, you know, and it's unclear where. There's no information, no intelligence, somewhere in the southern Caribbean, somewhere near Venezuela. And it seems like this has been something that's been planned for quite a while. When Trump came into office, he declared — he issued a number of his executive orders that declared cartels to be terrorist organizations and subject to military retaliation. On August 9th, The New York Times reported that he signed a secret order allowing the U.S. to use lethal action against criminal — criminals within Latin America.

And this seemed like, you know, a very staged — a very staged event that was, you know, basically a serial killer looking for a victim. And when this boat left, when they caught this boat, I guess, on satellite, they gave the execution order. And no bodies have been found. I mean, really, in many ways, it's bringing the logic of Gaza into the Caribbean, in terms of unaccountability, impunity and an expansive notion of national defense to justify what is, in effect, just extrajudicial killing.

AMY GOODMAN: And you have Marco Rubio, who is in Mexico, I believe, meeting with Claudia Sheinbaum, saying, “We're going to do it again and again.”

GREG GRANDIN: Yeah, it'll happen again, he said.

AMY GOODMAN: Who are the countries they're threatening? And who are they saying they will not attack?

GREG GRANDIN: Well, it's mostly Venezuelan. What's interesting about this is that it comes at a very interesting moment, because there is a rift within the Trump administration between those who want to do business with Venezuela. Chevron just received a license to pump oil and sell it in the U.S., and that production just started a few weeks ago, and the first shipments of oil from Venezuela, you know, and variants on the sanctions placed on Venezuela have just gone through.

But, of course, Marco Rubio has opposed this for quite a while. Marco Rubio is leading the hard-liners, who basically want to use Latin America and go hard against Cuba, against Venezuela. He's been obsessed about Venezuela. Certainly, during the first term as a senator, he exerted enormous influence on the Trump administration, that led to the fiasco of Trump's foreign policy in Venezuela during his first term. And now he seems to be doing it again. He was in Ecuador. Ecuador is actually a country that does export quite a bit of drugs, more than Venezuela, into the Pacific.

And it's a militarization of the drug war. And what's interesting about this is that most of Latin America's political class, including centrists and conservatives, former presidents, like Ernesto — like Cardoso in Brazil and Zedillo in Mexico, want the drug war wound down. And the United States is escalating it and folding it into the “war on terror.”

AMY GOODMAN: I was just reading the front page of The New York Times, “Without Arrest or Trial, Killing Drug Suspects,” pointing out what happens when you go after alleged drug suspects, going back to 2001, Peru, CIA identifying for Peru a plane, saying it was carrying drug smugglers. In fact, it was carrying American missionaries, killed.

GREG GRANDIN: Yeah, yeah.

AMY GOODMAN: And then you have Duterte, President Trump praising Duterte, the former —

GREG GRANDIN: From the Philippines, yeah.

AMY GOODMAN: — the former president, the father of — the former president of Philippines. Now he is sitting in The Hague, and he is wanted for crimes against humanity.

GREG GRANDIN: Yeah, well, in many ways, Trump — this is exceptional. Without a doubt, this is an escalation, an amplification of the United States's right to kill who it wants, when it wants, where it wants. But it is a long line. There is a long history of this. It started — in the post-Cold War period, the U.S. escalated and claimed greater right for self-defense, expanded what they understood to be the notion of self-defense. When Reagan bombed Libya in 1986, it was in — he invoked Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, saying the United States was acting in self-defense because Libya was involved in a bombing of a Berlin disco in which a U.S. Marine was killed. Then you had, of course, the invasion of Panama, which was in 1991, which in many ways kind of echoes — placing a bounty on Maduro's head is just treating him a lot like they treated Noriega.

AMY GOODMAN: And what about — you're talking about this division within the Trump White House — the role of oil companies like ExxonMobil and Chevron?

GREG GRANDIN: Yeah, well, you know, in many ways, it's a throwback to the 1930s, when Royal Dutch Shell supported Paraguay, and Standard Oil supported Bolivia, and it led to the Chaco War. Today, we have Exxon backing Guyana, British — formerly British Guyana, and Chevron backing backing Venezuela, and there's a border dispute.

Venezuela, of course, has one of the largest deposits of crude oil in the world, something like an estimated 300 billion barrels of oil. And a lot of that spills out into what is Guyana, untapped area in Guyana. Exxon is operating in Guyana, supporting the Guyanese government, and Chevron is operating in Venezuela. So you're seeing the kind of geopolitical tension between these two oil giants playing out, you know, in the Caribbean, in the southern Caribbean, and U.S. foreign policy kind of folding into it and escalating the conflict.

AMY GOODMAN: Let's end with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro speaking during a news conference this week.

PRESIDENT NICOLÁS MADURO: [translated] Eight military ships, with 1,200 missiles, and a nuclear submarine are targeting Venezuela. This is an extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal bloody threat. They have wanted to escalate what they call maximum pressure, which in this case is military. And in response to maximum military pressure, we've declared maximum preparedness for the defense of Venezuela.

AMY GOODMAN: Your final comments, Greg Grandin?

GREG GRANDIN: Well, it really is brinkmanship. I mean, Marco Rubio is really pushing the envelope here. I mean, this morning, we heard that Maduro sent a gaggle of jets to buzz over a U.S. ship. I mean, this is — 

AMY GOODMAN: In international orders.

GREG GRANDIN: Yeah, in international waters. I mean, this really could spill out of control in all sorts of ways. And, of course, Rubio's goal is to basically tank the Chevron deal, ultimately, and topple Maduro, and then — and then Cuba.

AMY GOODMAN: Interesting that President Trump is signing the executive order today renaming the Pentagon the Department of War.

GREG GRANDIN: Yeah, I know.

            Spaceflight makes certain human stem cells age faster, a new study has found, furthering scientists' understanding of the potential effects of space exploration on the human body.
    


            Stem cells are found throughout the body, and they can make more of themselves or turn into other specialized cells — including blood, brain or bone cells — for maintenance and repair.
    


            “In space, stem cells decline in function,” said lead study author Catriona Jamieson, director of the Sanford Stem Cell Institute and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine. “They actually reduce their ability to renew themselves or regenerate, and that's an important thing to be able to know for long-term space missions.”
    


Back on Earth, astronauts can say goodbye to blurry eyes, puffy faces, ‘chicken legs' and a little extra height



            The study, which NASA funded in part, was performed during four International Space Station resupply missions that SpaceX operated from late 2021 to early 2023. The research published Thursday in the journal Cell Stem Cell.
    


            “This is the first study that looks at how stem cells behave in space, in low Earth orbit, in real time,” Jamieson added, noting that this kind of research could have a direct impact on health management for astronauts poised to go to space.
    


            “It's important to study stem cell health and see who's likely to be able to withstand the rigors of space — it's stressful to get up, it's stressful to come down, and it's stressful to be up there.”
    


            NASA conducted one of the first experiments on the effects of spaceflight on stem cells in 2010 using the space shuttle Discovery. Called the Stem Cell Regeneration Experiment, it investigated how microgravity affected the ability of mice's embryonic stem cells to make other types of cells.
    


            In the new study, researchers examined bone marrow stem cells donated by patients undergoing hip replacement surgery. The stem cells, which are directly connected to the health of the immune system and the blood, were placed on a sterile sponge matrix, housed in specially developed bioreactors the size of a cell phone. On board the International Space Station, the cells were constantly monitored by an artificial intelligence system, which could detect their state in real time.
    


            “Our stem cells should be asleep (inactive) 80% of the time to retain their full function,” Jamieson said. However, that wasn't the case in space, where microgravity and cosmic radiation had an influence on their well-being.
    


            “The stem cells woke up, and they didn't go back to sleep, and they became functionally exhausted,” she added. “If our stem cells become exhausted under conditions of stress like microgravity, then they won't function to make a proper immune system.”
    


            Some of the cells in the study sustained up to 45 days of spaceflight, and because they were more active than normal, they burned through their energy reserves and showed signs of accelerated aging. Their ability to generate new cells was also reduced, and, according to Jamieson, they began activating normally hidden sections of DNA called repetitive elements or the “dark genome.”



            “Under conditions of stress, really strong stress, we activate these repetitive elements,” Jamieson said. “These are retroviruses that invaded our genomes thousands and thousands of years ago and represent 55% of our DNA. They send the stem cells into a death spiral. The cells just feel overstressed. They have a crisis. They age too quickly.”
    


            This is similar to the stem cell stress that Jamieson, who is also a medical doctor, observes in the cells of patients with preleukemic disorders. Jamieson tries to stop these cells in their tracks before they turn into full-blown leukemia, a type of blood cancer.
    


Most space travelers face the same debilitating ailment. The experience of 4 civilian astronauts could offer answers



            Jamieson, a veteran of space stem cell research who has worked on nine missions so far, is planning future studies that will look at practical countermeasures for the aging process.
    


            “We can actually use these bioreactors, or avatars for stem cell health, to predict who's likely to do well and who's likely to do extremely badly in space … and develop countermeasures,” she added, noting some upcoming clinical trials for potential medications to counteract the effects of this dark genome activity.
    


            The good news is that stem cells can recover from the accelerated aging once an astronaut returns to Earth, according to preliminary results from a separate, upcoming study, although the recovery takes about a year.
    


            The research can also have a beneficial impact for cancer patients as their stem cells exhibit some of the same stress-related damage that the new study has detected in the stem cells in space. “I think this is an important tool for us to accelerate the pace of (cancer) research,” Jamieson said.
    


Astronauts face mental and emotional challenges for deep space travel. Scientists are working on solutions



            For astronauts, these findings mean that long missions could weaken the blood and immune systems, potentially raising health risks, said Arun Sharma, a stem cell biologist and an associate professor of biomedical sciences at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in California. Sharma, who was not involved with the study, agreed with Jamieson that the findings may help scientists understand the aging process and develop new therapies that slow or reverse it.
    


            The study provides strong evidence of the potential damage that radiation exposure and microgravity can have on stem cells, highlighting the possible health risks associated with long-range space expeditions, said Luis Villa-Diaz, an assistant professor in the biological sciences and bioengineering departments at Oakland University in Michigan. Villa-Diaz was also not involved in the research.
    


            “The good news is that knowing the potential negative effects that low Earth orbit has on (stem cell) aging and function gives us directions to address these issues and develop strategies to prevent or counteract these effects, and support future space exploration,” he added. “This often translates into biomedical advances that can be applied to patients on Earth.”
    


Toxic dust on Mars would present serious hazard for astronauts



            While earlier space research on stem cells suggested vulnerabilities in more indirect or limited ways, this study provides much clearer evidence of aging, said Elena Kozlova, a professor in the department of immunology, genetics and pathology at Sweden's University of Uppsala.
    


            Kozlova, who was also not part of the new research, noted that not all studies on stem cells in space point in the same direction. Her own research with early developmental stem cells on microgravity research rockets — operated by the Swedish Space Corporation — showed an increase in growth-associated genes.
    


            That finding, she added, suggests that under certain conditions spaceflight may even promote a more youthful state in some stem cell populations.

The Liberal government is delaying mandatory sales targets for electric vehicles as one of a series of new measures aimed at supporting sectors badly hit by the ongoing trade disputes with the United States. 

Prime Minister Mark Carney also announced a new “strategic response fund” with $5-billion to assist affected companies, expand existing loan programs for small- and medium-sized businesses, increase cash advances available to the canola sector and a new biofuel production incentive.

Mr. Carney made the announcement Friday morning at an event in Mississauga, Ont. 

“In the face of uncertainty around the world, we are ensuring that our workers and businesses will prosper by building Canada's strength at home,” he said in a statement. 

His announcement followed signs Friday of the toll the unstable global economy is taking in Canada; new numbers from Statistics Canada revealed the unemployment rate is at the highest level since 2016, outside of the pandemic. 

The new measures also include an expansion of employment insurance, a “re-skilling package” for up to 50,000 workers and a new policy to ensure the federal government is buying from Canadian suppliers. 

The Carney government's decision to hit pause on the EV mandate and start a 60-day review of the program's cost follows months of pressure from the auto sector, which warned that with the tariffs imposed by the U.S. and slumping EV sales across the board, the program could dramatically hurt the industry. 

U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed 25-per-cent tariffs on foreign vehicles, though Canadian and Mexican manufacturers have a partial exemption.

“These mandates are so detached from market realities they could destroy the industry before a trade deal is struck with our American partners,” wrote Brian Kingston, the president and chief executive of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, in a recent op-ed for The Globe.

The EV sales mandate, introduced by former Liberal prime minister Justin Trudeau, required the sale of new zero-emission vehicles to hit 20 per cent for the 2026 model year, 60 per cent by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035 as part of a broader pledge on reducing carbon emissions. 

Keith Stewart, a senior energy strategist, slammed the Carney government's decision to pause the mandate.

“What was the point of electing Mark Carney when we get Pierre Poilievre's climate policy?,” he said in a statement, referred to the leader of the Conservative Party who has long called for the abolishment of the mandate. 

“We should be aligning with Europe, which is doubling down on renewable energy and electric vehicles, rather than bowing before Trump's attack on people and planet.” 

The new round of supports is on top of previously-announced measures to bolster the steel and softwood lumber industries, as well as supports for the auto sector. 

Mr. Carney said earlier this week his government continues to work toward new trade deals with the U.S. that could alleviate the tariffs, though there is no guarantee on timing.

Move comes after accusing Venezuela of buzzing US warship and a deadly US missile strike in Caribbean Sea

Donald Trump is sending 10 F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico to bolster US military operations against drug cartels in the Caribbean region, it was reported on Friday.

If follows a deadly US missile strike on Tuesday on a boat in the Caribbean Sea that the Trump administration insisted was carrying 11 Venezuelan drug traffickers, and comments by the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on Wednesday that such attacks “will happen again”.

In another development on Thursday, the US accused Venezuela of the “highly provocative move” of buzzing one of its warships in international waters.

The deployment of strike aircraft to Puerto Rico, first reported by Reuters, citing two sources briefed on the matter, is a sharp escalation of the US president's crackdown on what he sees as a Venezuelan-led drug-trafficking menace in the region.

The planes will arrive in the US territory next week and will be part of a sustained military campaign in the Latin American region that began with Tuesday's airstrike, the news agency said.

The F-35 is a highly advanced stealth fighter and would be very effective in combat against Venezuela's air force, which includes F-16 aircraft.

Trump has already sent at least eight warships and other military assets to the area in recent weeks, and Rubio, speaking in Mexico City on Wednesday, warned of more operations to come.

“The US has long, for many, many years, established intelligence that allowed us to interdict and stop drug boats. And we did that. And it doesn't work. Interdiction doesn't work,” he told a press conference after meeting with Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, to discuss stronger security ties.

“What will stop them is when you blow them up. Instead of interdicting it, on the president's orders, we blew it up. And it'll happen again. Maybe it's happening right now.”

Meanwhile, two Venezuelan military planes flew close to a US warship in international waters, the Pentagon said on Thursday in a social media post, an act it called “a highly provocative move … designed to interfere with our counter narco-terror operations”.

The statement by the Department of Defense “strongly advised” the Venezuelan regime of embattled president Nicolás Maduro not to “obstruct, deter or interfere” with US operations.

Maduro has accused the US of “seeking a regime change through military threat” and promised to build up his own armed forces.

Last month the state department increased to $50m its reward “for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Maduro”, whom the US said has conspired with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia in cocaine production.

More than 50 countries, including the US, refuse to recognize Maduro as head of state after accusing him of rigging the Venezuelan presidential election in 2018.

Pete Hegseth, the US defense secretary, defended the US military buildup in the Caribbean in an appearance on Fox News on Wednesday night.

“We've got assets in the air, assets in the water, assets on ships, because this is a deadly serious mission for us, and it won't stop with just this strike,” he said.

Hegseth was asked by reporters on Thursday what legal justification was used to kill 11 people that the Trump administration has accused, without presenting evidence, of being members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang.

“We have the absolute authority and complete authority to conduct that,” he said, stating that the group was “assaulting” the US with a flow of illegal drugs.

“I'd say we smoked a drug boat, and there's 11 narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean. And when other people try to do that, they're gonna meet the same fate.”

In a statement issued on Thursday, before news of the stealth fighters' deployment broke, Democratic Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar accused the Trump administration of “lawless and reckless” actions in the Caribbean region.

“Congress has not declared war on Venezuela, or Tren de Aragua, and the mere designation of a group as a terrorist organization does not give any president carte blanche to ignore Congress's clear constitutional authority on matters of war and peace,” she said.

“There is no conceivable legal justification for this use of force. Unless compelling evidence emerges that they were acting in self-defense, that makes the strike a clear violation of international law.”

Talking to the rightwing channel Newsmax on Wednesday, Rand Paul, the Republican US senator from Kentucky and chair of the Senate homeland security committee, also questioned the legality and morality of the Trump administration's actions.

“[I have] no love lost for the people who died that are trying to infiltrate our country with this filth, but at the same time you have to realize it's not as simple as it may sound, ‘let's just kill drug dealers,' because sometimes you have to figure out who people are before you kill them,” he said.

“Even the worst people in our country still get a trial.”

Analysts have warned that US aggression in the region will have serious unintended consequences, including the possibility of being drawn into an extended guerrilla war in Venezuela.

“I increasingly fear that the Trump administration may stumble into an intervention scenario in Venezuela, which would be frankly disastrous,” Juan González, the national security council's senior director for the western hemisphere during the Biden administration, told the Guardian this week.

“It'll become the cause célèbre for every kind of criminal or illegal armed group in the Americas. You'll end up having people going to Venezuela to fight the Yankees and I think it'll get messy.”

South Korea concerned after hundreds were arrested at Georgia work site making batteries for Hyundai and Kia cars

Hundreds of workers at a factory being built in Georgia to make car batteries for Hyundai and Kia electric vehicles were detained in a huge raid by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) on Thursday that stopped construction.

The facility is part of what would be the biggest industrial investment in the state's history and had been hailed as a huge boost for the economy by Georgia's Republican governor, Brian Kemp.

At least 450 people were arrested, according to the Atlanta office of the US justice department agency the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

However, the Korea Economic Daily later reported about 560 workers at the Hyundai facility and LG Energy Solution (LGES), had been detained, citing unidentified industry sources. About 300 are South Korean nationals, according to local media reports. Hyundai Motor is a South Korean automotive company but has many international plants.

The raid on Thursday has dealt a setback to the company's substantial project in Georgia and was a dramatic iteration of the Trump administration's harsh crackdown on immigrants in the US.

It also showed the disruptive impact that Donald Trump's mass deportation agenda is having on businesses, even as the White House tries to spur more inflows from foreign investors.

An agent at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said multiple federal agencies, including Ice, the FBI and the DEA “conducted a judicially authorized enforcement operation, as we are actively conducting an investigation into unlawful employment practices”.

“Arrests are being made,” Steven Schrank, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations for Georgia, said in a news briefing.

A government official representing South Korea, the home of Hyundai Motor, said those arrested were being held at an Ice detention facility.

South Korea's foreign ministry said that “many of our nationals” had been detained and expressed concern about the impact of the raid.

“The economic activities of our companies investing in the United States and the interests of our citizens must not be unduly violated during the course of US law enforcement,” a ministry spokesperson, Lee Jae-woong, said in a statement on Friday.

The battery production facility, a joint venture between South Korean battery maker LGES and Hyundai Motor, was due to start operations at the end of this year, according to LGES, to power electric vehicles.

A spokesperson at the Hyundai-GA battery company in Georgia said in a statement that it was cooperating fully and that it had paused construction work.

Hyundai Motor said its production of electric vehicles at the sprawling site was not affected.

In 2023, Hyundai Motor Group and LG Energy Solution (LGES) announced the $4.3bn venture to produce EV battery cells, with each company holding a 50% stake. The plant will supply batteries for Hyundai, Kia and Genesis EV models.

The battery factory is part of Hyundai's $12.6bn investments in Georgia, including the automaker's just-opened car factory, in what would be “the largest economic development project in the state's history” and is part of a bigger investment in US industry by the South Korean company, announced in March as Trump was ramping up tariffs.

Social media video footage showed a man wearing a vest with the letters HIS, an acronym for Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), telling workers in yellow safety vests: “We have a search warrant for the whole site. We need construction to cease immediately. We need all work to end on the site right now.”

Trump has said he wants to deport “the worst of the worst” criminals, but Ice figures have shown a rise in non-criminals being picked up. Rights advocates have denounced such raids.

While HSI led the raid, federal officers were assisted by the Georgia department of public safety and state troopers, according to local media.

Meanwhile in upstate New York, another significant Ice raid took place at the Nutrition Bar Confectioners facilities near Syracuse, where snack bars are made at a family-owned concern, drawing anger from the state governor.

Officers forced entry to the industrial facility and detained dozens of workers.

“I am outraged by this morning's Ice raids in Cato and Fulton, where more than 40 adults were seized, including parents of at least a dozen children at risk of returning from school to an empty house,” Kathy Hochul, New York's Democratic governor, said in a statement released by her office.

“I've made it clear, New York will work with the federal government to secure our borders and deport violent criminals, but we will never stand for masked Ice agents separating families and abandoning children,” Hochul added.

The migrant advocacy group Rural & Migrant Ministry said on Facebook that it estimated that more than 70 workers had been arrested.

South Korea concerned after hundreds of people arrested at Georgia work site making batteries for Hyundai and Kia cars

Hundreds of workers at a factory being built in Georgia to make car batteries for Hyundai and Kia electric vehicles were detained in a huge raid by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) on Thursday that stopped construction.

The facility is part of what would be the biggest industrial investment in the state's history and had been hailed as a huge boost for the economy by Georgia's Republican governor, Brian Kemp.

About 475 workers were arrested, according to US immigration officials on Friday, the largest single-site enforcement operation in the history of the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which was created in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the US in New York and Washington DC.

However, the Korea Economic Daily earlier had reported about 560 workers at the Hyundai facility and LG Energy Solution (LGES), had been detained, citing unidentified industry sources. About 300 are South Korean nationals, according to local media reports. Hyundai Motor is a South Korean automotive company but has many international plants.

The raid on Thursday has dealt a setback to the company's substantial project in Georgia and was a dramatic iteration of the Trump administration's harsh crackdown on immigrants in the US.

It also showed the disruptive impact that Donald Trump's mass deportation agenda is having on businesses, even as the White House tries to spur more inflows from foreign investors.

“The economic activities of our companies investing in the United States and the interests of our citizens must not be unduly violated during the course of US law enforcement,” a ministry spokesperson, Lee Jae-woong, said in a statement on Friday.

The battery production facility, a joint venture between South Korean battery maker LGES and Hyundai Motor, was due to start operations at the end of this year, according to LGES, to power electric vehicles.

The arrests could exacerbate tensions between Washington and Seoul, a key ally and investor in the US. The countries have been at odds over the details of a trade deal that includes $350bn of investments. At a summit last month, South Korea pledged $150bn in US investments – including $26bn from Hyundai Motor.

A spokesperson at the Hyundai-GA battery company in Georgia said in a statement that it was cooperating fully and that it had paused construction work.

DHS officials said the workers who were arrested were barred from working in the US after crossing the border illegally or overstaying visas, following an investigation lasting several months.

A Hyundai Motor spokesperson said none of the people detained were employed directly by the automaker, which complies “with all laws and regulations wherever we operate”.

Hyundai Motor also said its production of electric vehicles at the sprawling site was not affected.

The workers were being held at Ice's Folkston, Georgia detention facility, Schrank said. Most of the 475 people are Korean nationals, he said.

In 2023, Hyundai Motor Group and LG Energy Solution (LGES) announced the $4.3bn venture to produce EV battery cells, with each company holding a 50% stake. The plant will supply batteries for Hyundai, Kia and Genesis EV models.

Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered an address to the Eastern Economic Forum in the far eastern city of Vladivostok on Friday, which mostly focused on the domestic economy but also covered issues including the Ukraine conflict.

Putin highlighted a renewed interest from Western businesses in re-entering the Russian market, commented on the possibility of a meeting with Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky, and dismissed the need for Western troop deployments to support Kiev.

Here are the key takeaways from the Russian leader's speech.

Putin reported that the poverty level in Russia has fallen from 11.3% to 7.2% over the past decade, calling the trend “positive.” He also expressed confidence that inflation – currently estimated at 8.8% – could be lowered to a minimum while maintaining economic growth.

He stressed that his goal is to make Russia “an economy of high salaries.” “This is no populism, this makes sense economically,” Putin said, adding that the unemployment has decreased from 7% to 2.4%.

Putin noted that numerous Western businesses had exited the country after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022 and the imposition of sanctions on Russia, “at a loss to themselves due to ‘political reasons.'” 

However, he said many firms “are eagerly waiting for all these political restrictions to be lifted.” Putin also observed that some foreign companies “continue to operate in Russia despite political disagreements between their governments and Moscow” and “even want to expand cooperation.”

He stressed that Russia remains open to cooperation, particularly “with our friends.” “But we are not isolating ourselves from anyone… we have never turned away or pushed anyone out. Those who want [to come] back in are welcome.”

Russia is not at risk of a dependence on selling crude oil, gas, and other natural resources abroad, Putin said, adding that such a threat would only become real if Russia remained passive.

“We must create conditions for the development of innovative sectors of the economy… so that the people needed for work in these spheres come here,” Putin said, referring to the Far East. He added that Russia's partners “will gladly invest in those promising enterprises.” 

Putin reiterated that he is ready for in-person talks with Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky, but “does not see much sense” in them, explaining that any agreements on the territorial dispute between Moscow and Kiev could be settled only via a referendum in Ukraine. Russian officials earlier also pointed out that Zelensky's presidential term expired last year, making him unfit to sign any binding agreements.

At the same time, Putin said he was ready to talk with Zelensky in Moscow, adding that Russia is willing to provide a “100% security guarantee” for the Ukrainian leader. Zelensky earlier declined the invitation. 

“We are ready for meetings at the highest level. The Ukrainian side wants this meeting... I said: ‘I'm ready, please come. We will fully ensure the working conditions and security.'”

There would be “no sense” in a Western troop deployment to Ukraine once a lasting settlement to the conflict is reached, Putin said. 

“Nobody should doubt that Russia would implement the agreed terms fully. We will respect security guarantees that both Russia and Ukraine need to be offered,” he added.

The Russian leader also warned that if any Western troops arrive in Ukraine while the hostilities are ongoing, Moscow “would consider them legitimate military targets.”

US companies are ready to engage in economic cooperation in the Arctic with Russia, and Moscow is open to this prospect, although political will is required to kickstart projects, Putin said.

“It is not up to us – we are also ready, but if there are political decisions, we will move in that direction,” he said, adding that Russian gas extraction and liquefaction technologies are more efficient than those developed in the US.

According to Putin, Moscow and Washington have also discussed potential trilateral cooperation in the Russian Arctic with China. Cooperation in the oil and gas sector would be mutually beneficial, the Russian president added.

Pivoting to the role of artificial intelligence, Putin remarked that he was certain that AI could be used in the decision-making process. However, decisions ultimately “must be made by a specific person, who must be accountable,” he added.

“You can't hold artificial intelligence accountable – it is just a tool, it is people who must work.”

            Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that any Western troops in Ukraine would be considered “legitimate targets for defeat,” a day after it was announced that dozens of Western countries have pledged to contribute to a potential peacekeeping force there if a ceasefire deal is agreed.
    


            “This is one of the root causes (of the war): trying to involve Ukraine in NATO,” Putin said, speaking at an economic forum in Russia's Far East on Friday. “So if any troops appear there, especially during the ongoing hostilities, we assume they will be legitimate targets for defeat.”
    


            On Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said 26 countries are “backing security guarantees” for his country “in different formats.”
    


            “We have agreed there will be presence,” he said, adding that how this will look will depend on the country involved. “The presence is different. It is in the sky, in the sea and on the ground,” he said.
    


            Putin, however, suggested that if a ceasefire was agreed between his country and Kyiv, then there would be no need for any third parties to get involved.
    


            “If decisions are reached that lead to long-term peace, then I simply see no reason for their presence on Ukrainian territory,” he said. “Because if such agreements are reached, let no one doubt that Russia will fully implement them.”

            Also on Friday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said security guarantees should be provided both to Russia and Ukraine following an end to the war, seemingly contradicting his boss.
    


            “What was one of the root causes of this conflict? It was when the foundations of security guarantees for our country began to be eroded, when Ukraine was being drawn into NATO, and when NATO's military infrastructure began moving toward our borders,” Peskov said, according to Russian state media RIA Novosti.
    


            “Naturally, these guarantees, in the process of settlement, must be provided to both us and the Ukrainians,” he continued.
    


            Last month, Russian envoy Mikhail Ulyanov called on the West to “think about” what it had to offer Russia regarding such guarantees.
    


            Russian officials frequently refer to what they say are “root causes” of the conflict, which have previously included Ukraine's existence as a sovereign state and NATO's eastward expansion since the end of the Cold War.
    


            The threat to target foreign peacekeeping forces in Ukraine is the latest of Russia's inflammatory statements regarding outside involvement in the conflict.
    


            Last September, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow was adjusting its protocols for use of nuclear weapons in light of enhanced Western support for Ukraine.
    


            Putin's comments also come at the end of what many saw as a positive week for the Russian leader.
    


            Standing shoulder to shoulder with his Chinese and North Korean counterparts in Beijing, Putin was able to show the world that, despite Western attempts to isolate his country, he still has powerful allies.
    


            Speaking from Beijing on Wednesday, the Russian leader said US President Donald Trump had asked him to hold talks with Zelensky.
    


            “Donald asked me if it was possible to hold such a meeting. I said yes, it is possible. In the end, if Zelensky is ready, let him come to Moscow. Such a meeting will take place,” Putin said.
    


            He reiterated this call on Friday, promising to provide “security” should Zelensky visit the Russian capital.
    


            “The Ukrainian side wants this meeting and is proposing it,” Putin said. “I said, ‘I am ready, please come. We will definitely provide conditions for work and security. A hundred percent guarantee.'”
    


Trump and Putin both agree: Blame falls on Europe as Ukraine peace effort languishes



            Kyiv dismissed the offer outright, accusing Russia of once again attempting to stall peace efforts rather than working towards them.
    


            “I believe that Russia is doing everything it can to delay the process. Our American partners told me that Putin had invited me to Moscow. In my opinion, if someone wants the meeting to not take place, they should invite me to Moscow,” Zelensky said on Thursday.
    


            Since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukrainian authorities say they have foiled multiple alleged Russian plots to assassinate Zelensky.
    


            Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Wednesday that Zelensky is ready to meet Putin “at any point of time,” but that the Russian leader “continues to mess around with everyone by making knowingly unacceptable proposals.”
    


            “Right now, at least seven countries are ready to host a meeting between (the) leaders of Ukraine and Russia to bring an end to the war. Austria, the Holy See, Switzerland, Türkiye, and three Gulf states,” Sybiha wrote on social media.
    


            “Only increased pressure can force Russia to finally get serious about (a) peace process,” he said.
    


            Meanwhile, as Western countries maintain their attempts to end the war, Russia continues to attack its neighbor.
    


            On Thursday, two humanitarian workers were killed after Russia carried out a missile strike on a demining site in northern Ukraine, according to the Danish Refugee Council, who was leading the mission.

A handcrafted new globe that disregards President Donald Trump's edicts, and overtly differentiates Canada from the U.S. by depicting the country in deep “imperial” pink, is the latest addition to the Royal Canadian Geographical Society's collection. 

The Canada Globe, unveiled on Friday, follows Mr. Trump's assertions that he would like to annex Canada and turn it into the 51st state of America. 

It also ignores the President's executive orders renaming geographical features. 

The globe differentiates Canada from the U.S. by showing the country in deep 'imperial' pink.

In an executive order soon after taking office, Mr. Trump renamed the highest peak in North America as Mount McKinley, after former U.S. president William McKinley, who never visited Alaska, where the mountain is located.

The society's globe refers to the mountain as Denali, or “the high one,” a name bestowed by Indigenous people who have lived in the region of Alaska for centuries. 

Former U.S. president Barack Obama's administration officially changed the name of Mount McKinley to Denali as a symbolic gesture to Indigenous peoples on the eve of a visit to Alaska to highlight climate change.

In addition, the globe does not rename the Gulf of Mexico, despite Mr. Trump's executive order directing U.S. federal agencies to refer to the oceanic basin, which borders the U.S. and Mexico, as the Gulf of America.

John Geiger, chief executive of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society, said globes typically represent continents − including North America − in the same colour. But the society instructed the globe maker to ensure Canada was a different colour than the United States. It chose imperial pink, used historically to represent Commonwealth countries and those in the British empire. 

“It's been designed specifically to emphasize Canada, Canada's place in the world, and to stand out relative to its enormous, enormously powerful neighbour,” Mr. Geiger said. “I could not imagine a scenario in which Canada and the United States were the same colour.”

He said the society was concerned by Mr. Trump's utterings about redrawing the map and assertions that “without some sort of imagined massive subsidy that Canada ceases to exist as a viable country.”

“Those are pretty hair-raising words from the leader of the free world and I think, underscores the importance of an organization like the Royal Canadian Geographical Society.”

The globe includes the society's coat of arms and its motto Ducit Amor Patriae – Love of country leads me.

The Canada Globe was hand-crafted − including hand-painted − by British globemakers Bellerby & Co. It was commissioned by Canada's Oughtred family as a gift to the society. Bespoke Bellerby globes of this size sell for about $122,250. 

The huge globe − which is five feet across − is the largest globe produced since the U.S. Army commissioned globes from a cartographer for Churchill and Roosevelt during the Second World War. 

Gulf of understanding: The way we see the Earth has never been set in stone

The commissioning of the globe follows another symbolic gesture asserting Canada's sovereignty earlier this year. In May, to mark the 100th anniversary of the site of the Canadian High Commission in Trafalgar Square, London, a gigantic map of Canada provided by the Royal Canadian Geographical Society was laid out on the floor.

Ralph Goodale, Canada's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, and Perry Bellegarde, former national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, toured the map with King Charles, pointing out Canada's national parks and other notable sites.

The map had been folded up in a hockey bag and flown over by the society.

Peter Bellerby, founder of Bellerby & Co, said the colouring of Canada on the globe accentuated that it “is an independent country.” He added that the many tiny islands off the coast of Canada were a challenge for his company's colourists. 

The globe also includes recent official updates to country names, including the African kingdom of Eswatini (previously Swaziland), which was renamed in 2018 to mark its 50th year as an independent state. 

But Turkey, which officially changed its name to Türkiye after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government requested the change in May, 2022, remains Turkey.

Hans Island, a tiny barren rock in the Arctic that was the focus of a decades-long territorial dispute between Canada and Denmark, was too small to feature. In 2022, it was amicably divided between Nunavut and Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, at a ceremony in Ottawa at the Royal Canadian Geographical Society's headquarters. 

The society, which has a large collection of older globes and historic maps, plans to create a map reading room later this year where scholars and interested members of the public can come and view them. The oldest map in its collection dates to 1598 and is one of the earliest extant maps of Newfoundland. 

The Dutch copperplate engraving of Terra Nova, which features a sea monster, is among the first to depict the terrain, which is now Newfoundland, as an island.

A driver backed into a staircase, dislodged it and drove off with it on the roof of her car in Mississauga, Ont. in August 2025.Supplied

Last week, as we were having our morning coffee, my wife told me that on August 26 the police had pulled over a driver for driving down a major street with a steel staircase stuck to the roof of her Mazda, like the shell on a snail. 

The 22-year-old driver from Woodbridge, Ont. had backed her car into the staircase (where it affixed to her car) and then drove approximately three kilometres along a major roadway called the Queensway with it sitting atop her Mazda. She was eventually stopped by police and charged with careless driving.

“You think you'll write something about that?” she asked. 

Of course I would. As a columnist, I'm always on the look out for material. Does someone have a live bunny rabbit on the dashboard? I'm on it. Placed an order while nude at a Tim Horton's drive-thru? Ridden a horse through a Taco Bell drive-thru? Been there, done that.

So, the “Curious Incident of the Woodbridge Twenty-something Driver and the Staircase Car” certainly seemed like a story ripe for ridicule. It called back to the “Bluth Stair Car” featured on one of my favorite sitcoms, Arrested Development. Perhaps Staircase Lady was hoping for some hop-ons?

The story posed a few important questions:

The answer? Nobody knows.

“We're not really sure what the heck was going on there,” Peel Regional Police Constable Tyler Bell-Morena posted on social media. The police are investigating.

As I sat down to write this column, while visions of staircase cars danced in my head, it occurred that the funniest thing about driving a car three kilometres with a staircase on the roof is how utterly unremarkable it is. It's strange, sure but the egregiousness of the driving, the sheer badness of it all, was so very, very usual.

Driving around in an automobile with a staircase for a hat is weird but not surprising, not in a world where a man is arrested for driving impaired with four kids in his car or a driver crashes her car into a drive test centre and these events do not make the “front page.” Given how truly awful drivers are, it is not surprising that one backed her car into the staircase and drove off with it sitting atop her vehicle, like the shell on a snail. What's surprising is that there are not fleets of staircase-topped vehicles swarming around our towns and cities.

It must be noted that stairs are a bit of a bête noire when it comes to automobiles. In June, an 80-year-old Italian became notorious when he got stuck driving his Mercedes-Benz down Rome's famous Spanish Steps. He explained that he was on his way to work. He tested negative for alcohol. Last week at Vancouver International Airport, a driver got stuck on a pedestrian staircase. CTV News reported “the driver was the lone occupant of the vehicle and had ‘accidentally exited the parkade via the pedestrian stairs.'” There was no mention whether this was an homage to the Vancouver SUV owner who drove a pedestrian staircase at the Wall Centre in 2019. Likewise, the car in Mississauga which crashed down a staircase after a hit and run collision in 2024.

What is the moral of the Aesop's latest fable - “The Staircase and the Woman From Woodbridge.” When someone suggests you, “Take the stairs,” don't take them literally, especially if you're driving a Mazda 3.

California's community colleges are grappling with a surge in fraudulent enrollments, with 1.2 million fake applicants last year accounting for nearly 30 percent of new students, blocking real students from classes and costing millions in stolen financial aid, according to college officials.

The problem, exacerbated by the shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, affects at least 90 of the state's 116 campuses, said Marvin Martinez, chancellor of the Rancho Santiago Community College District, and Jeannie Kim, president of Santiago Canyon College.

Before the pandemic, most classes were in-person, making fraud more difficult, Martinez said. But with 80 percent of courses moving online, bots and fake students can enroll from anywhere, including other states or countries.

“It's happened on a massive scale,” Martinez told Epoch TV's California Insider host Siyamak Khorrami. “What's made this situation of fraudulent enrollment so different than anything that I've seen before in my 36 years in higher ed is that it's happened in almost 80 percent now of the campuses.”

At Santiago Canyon College, fall 2024 enrollment initially spiked 10 percent to 13 percent, Kim said, but faculty discovered many registrants were fraudulent. In one anthropology course, administrators raised the enrollment cap by 30 daily, only for bots to fill slots instantly, leaving just 12 to 15 genuine students. 

Faculty identified fakes through non-engagement, identical assignments, or invalid contact details, like phone numbers tied to businesses or defunct entities. Removing fraudulent enrollments cut the college's headcount by 10,000 to 12,000 spots, with some bad actors enrolled in up to five classes each.

The fallout is severe. Real students are denied access to required courses, delaying graduations, certificates, and transfers to four-year universities.

“Counselors saw the crestfallen faces of students unable to get classes they needed to graduate,” Kim said.

Among faculty, morale has gone down as classes shrink to single digits, making them cost-inefficient yet necessary for student progress. “Faculty teach because they love their discipline, but it's devastating to see classes dwindle,” Kim added. 

Low-enrollment classes were allowed to run, doubling budgetary strain to prioritize student needs. Financially, colleges face significant losses. California funds community colleges based on enrollment, but removing fake students can cut revenue by up to 23 percent, Martinez said.

 “You can't get paid for fake enrollments,” he noted. “It's better to make that cut upfront than face audits later.” 

In 2024, scammers stole $8.4 million in federal aid and $2.7 million in state aid, with losses since 2021 exceeding $18 million, state reports show. 

The colleges reported 20 to 25 identity theft cases, requiring notifications to victims and reports to the U.S. Department of Education.

Fraud motivations include exploiting Pell Grants, with “Pell runners” collecting up to $7,400 before vanishing, and harvesting personal data such as Social Security numbers for identity theft, Martinez said. 

Perpetrators, often international, use AI tools such as ChatGPT to mimic students, targeting no-prerequisite courses such as accounting or business. 

To combat the issue, colleges are deploying LightLeap.AI, an artificial intelligence platform from N2N Services, initially developed for course predictions but adapted for fraud detection.

Santiago Canyon adopted it for under $100,000 after Kim discovered it at a conference, and it is now scaled to 80 campuses statewide at about $75,000 per institution.

Processing nearly 3 million applications and flagging 360,000 suspected fraudsters, LightLeap.AI uses machine learning to analyze shared phone numbers, IP addresses, minimal application data, and suspicious course-taking patterns, achieving a 99 percent accuracy rate at Santiago Canyon. 

“One art faculty member was ecstatic, saying, ‘I have a clean roster. They're all real,'” Kim recalled.

LightLeap.AI's triangulation method cross-references application data with student information systems and proprietary blacklist/whitelist databases, identifying patterns such as multiple applications from one IP address. 

Operating in three stages—application, registration, and financial aid—it catches twice as many scammers as manual methods, freeing 7,500 seats for real students at Santiago Canyon. Its network effect allows fraud detection at one college to flag bad actors across 83 campuses, with a 92.3 percent effectiveness rate at West Valley-Mission. The system adapts to evolving tactics by incorporating geolocation data and reducing false positives through continuous learning. Since its intersession rollout, it has been applied across spring, summer, and fall terms, with updates to counter fraudsters' use of generative AI.

Implementing LightLeap.AI presents challenges. “We need tech-savvy staff, but community colleges can't compete with tech industry salaries,” Martinez said. Budgets, unchanged in 20 years, hinder hiring, and manual verification tools like ID.me are voluntary and inadequate. 

A proposed $10 application fee, discussed in 2025, aims to deter fraud but risks burdening vulnerable students such as the homeless or undocumented, who struggle with ID verification. 

Online education is essential for working adults, who now outnumber recent high school graduates enrolled at community colleges.

 “Adult students—parents with jobs and bills—rely on online classes,” Martinez said. To support this shift, he urged Sacramento to increase funding for technology and staffing. “If it doesn't happen, we're going to keep losing money,” he warned. A 2025 state audit is evaluating fraud trends and mitigation effectiveness to guide future funding.

“We're easy prey because bureaucracies react slowly,” Martinez said. Kim emphasized ethical duty: “We're public servants with a moral obligation to protect taxpayer dollars.” 

California community colleges serve about 1.8 million students annually, offering low-cost pathways to degrees and jobs.

PARIS (AP) — Five French women boxers will miss the world championships starting on Thursday in England because of complications with new sex tests that are compulsory after a furor at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

The French team said it was “with astonishment and indignation” its boxers cannot compete after missing a deadline to get the test results from England. The tests are prohibited in these sporting circumstances in France by a law protecting women's privacy.

World Boxing announced its mandatory testing policy on May 30 as a response to controversy last year in Paris, where Imane Khelif of Algeria and Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan won gold medals amid a campaign to cast doubt on their eligibility.

Female boxers have to undergo a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test or an equivalent genetic screening test to determine their sex at birth.

The new boxing governing body — which was not involved in the Paris Olympics then was provisionally recognized by the IOC in February — suggested the French federation was responsible for the missed deadline ahead of the worlds in Liverpool.

“It is very disappointing for the boxers that some national federations have not been able to complete this process in time,” World Boxing said on Thursday in a statement.

“(T)he organization has made it clear that testing will be the responsibility of national federations as they have the closest links and most access to their boxers and are best placed to manage the testing process.”

The French boxing federation said it was told to expect the results “within 24 hours and that we could therefore, without fail, present them when registering our boxers.”

The five boxers excluded were Romane Moulai, Wassila Lkhadiri, Melissa Bounoua, Sthélyne Grosy and Maëlys Richol.

Richol shared on her Instagram page a message by Estelle Mossely, a former candidate to lead the French boxing federation, calling for officials responsible to resign.

Khelif also will not compete in Liverpool after failing to get an urgent interim ruling from the Court of Arbitration for Sport in her wider appeal against World Boxing's testing mandate.

VLADIVOSTOK, September 5. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin appreciates US leader Donald Trump's peace efforts and his constructive approach in general, Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov told TASS at the Eastern Economic Forum (EEF).

The Kremlin spokesman told about the upcoming BRICS summit, explained why Vladimir Zelensky was invited to Moscow, and shared his opinion about the domestically-developed messenger Max and its foreign analogues.

TASS has compiled Peskov's main statements.

Putin will take part in a BRICS virtual summit in the coming days: "In just a few days, there will be a BRICS summit via video conference. Putin will participate via video link."

Putin has invited Vladimir Zelensky to Moscow "to talk, not to surrender."

Efforts to settle the conflict continue, but it is too early to say when it would be resolved: "[Putin] said there is light at the end of the tunnel."

Russia, is his words, is ready to use peaceful means to achieve its goals in Ukraine, but if this proves impossible, the special military operation will continue.

There are no details yet regarding a new conversation between Putin and Trump: "So far, there have been no preliminary results."

Talks between them, Peskov noted, are difficult because each defends the interests of his own country: "But Putin highly values this and is grateful to Trump for such an approach."

He added that the Russian leader appreciates Trump's efforts and "the constructive nature of their relationship."

The Kremlin sees Donald Trump as a US president, without giving him any additional subjective characteristics: "Trump is president of the United States to us."

Russia and the United States are currently maintaining communication between the Kremlin and the White House and between the two countries' special services, "but it has not yet revived all our ties across the board."

Relations between Russia and the United States were severely damaged under the previous US administration and will take time to restore: "The process of bringing our relations out of complete paralysis will take time. They are affected by negative inertia. Too much damage has been done to the entire architecture of our bilateral ties."

He also noted that Moscow and Washington have not yet returned to cooperation in culture and sports: "We haven't gotten there yet."

Russia and the US have not yet reached the point of restoring ties in culture and sports: "Things have not yet gotten to that point."

The presence of foreign messengers Telegram and WhatsApp in Russia will incentivize new national platform Max to innovate and get better, so it makes sense not to ban them: "They should stay in Russia. Max must have competition. I am convinced that without competition Max will not be able to develop."

Russians should want to move over to the Max platform themselves: "In order for Max to truly become a developed service that millions and tens of millions of our fellow citizens want to download themselves, it must constantly evolve and not stand still."

U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to issue an executive order on Sept. 5 to rename the Department of Defense to the Department of War, various U.S. media outlets reported, citing sources in the White House. 

Trump, alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, alluded to the reported changes in recent weeks, with Trump telling reporters on Aug. 25 that his administration is "gonna change the name."

While the White House has not officially provided a rationale for the name change, Trump himself has alluded to historical connotations associated with the new name.

"We won the World War 1, World War 2 - it was called the Department of War, and to me, that's really what it is," Trump said in his justification on Aug. 25.

"Everybody likes that we had an unbelievable history of victory when it was Department of War," Trump added. "Then we changed it to Department of Defense."

The U.S. Congress approved the department's current name in 1947, shortly after the end of World War 2, following the country's longstanding use of the Department of War namesake. It was not immediately clear as to whether Congress would need to approve the name change in a vote. 

"I'm sure Congress will go along if we need that. I don't think we even need that," Trump previously said on a potential vote.

Amid the transition, Hegseth's title will likely be changed to secretary of war.

"I don't see much point in them, (...) because it will be practically impossible to reach an agreement with the Ukrainian side on key issues: even if there is political will, which I doubt, there are legal and technical difficulties," Putin said.

Oleksii "Leo," a Ukrainian battalion commander with the legendary Azov Brigade, discusses Russia's rapid advances in the east, Ukraine's manpower shortage, and potential scenarios for the future of the war.

At a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Beijing on Sept. 2, Fico pledged to discuss with Zelensky attacks on energy infrastructure, a reference to recent Ukrainian strikes on the Druzhba oil pipeline, which supplies Russian crude to Hungary and Slovakia.



"Gasoline (in Russia) is becoming scarce, while gas and oil are quickly running out," Ukraine's top drone warfare commander, Robert "Madyar" Brovdi, wrote.

"I'm sure many people sitting in this room will say 'yes, this is outrageous,'" Russian President Vladimir Putin said.

"We are working with the United States and other partners to intensify our pressure through additional sanctions — both direct and secondary sanctions," European Council President Antonio Costa said.

"May they have a long and prosperous future together," U.S. President Donald Trump said.

Current proposals envision these measures taking effect only after a ceasefire.

Ukraine's Air Force said Russian forces launched 157 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones overnight, along with six S-300 guided missiles and an X-59 air-launched missile.

"If any troops appear there, especially now, during the fighting, we assume that they will be legitimate targets for destruction," Russian President Vladimir Putin said.

Russian independent media outlet Mediazona, in collaboration with the BBC Russian service, has confirmed the identities of 125,681 Russian military personnel killed in Ukraine.

"Germany, Italy, and Poland are definitely among Ukraine's security guarantors. We won't go into details yet, but we already have an understanding (of cooperation)," President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron during the Paris summit.

U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to issue an executive order on Sept. 5 to rename the U.S. Department of Defense to the Department of War, various media outlets, citing sources in the White House, reported. 

The Trump administration is preparing to phase out funding for U.S. security assistance programs for European countries bordering Russia, FT reported Sept. 4. The move is part of a broader push for NATO allies to increase their defense spending.

A man reportedly in the U.S. illegally was charged with killing a missing 19-year-old Maryland woman whose body was discovered off a highway earlier this week.

Hugo Hernandez-Mendez, 35, of Bowie, Maryland, was arrested Thursday in the killing of Dacara Thompson, Prince George's County Police Department said.

Hernandez-Mendez is an illegal immigrant and had a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer issued on Thursday, according to WJLA-TV.

Prince George's County Police Department told Fox News Digital that the department was not releasing the immigration status of Hernandez-Mendez. ICE did not immediately respond when Fox News Digital reached out.

The news outlet also reported that U.S. Park Police had arrested Hernandez-Mendez for a DWI in April, but that he was subsequently released pending a court appearance. Fox News Digital reached out to the Park Police but did not immediately hear back.

Thompson's family reported her missing on Aug. 23. On Sunday, her body was discovered dumped in a grassy area near Route 50 in Anne Arundel County.

Investigators combed through security footage that showed Thompson had approached a black sport utility vehicle (SUV) in the early hours of Aug. 23. She was seen speaking to the driver, according to police, before entering the vehicle. The driver then drove to a home in Bowie.

Detectives executed a search warrant on the home Thursday and uncovered evidence that suggested Thompson had been killed in the bedroom of the home, police said.

Hernandez-Mendez lived at the residence and resided in the bedroom where authorities say the killing happened. Police said he also has access to the black SUV that Thompson was seen entering.

Hernandez-Mendez was charged with first- and second-degree murder in Thompson's death.

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore released a statement on the death investigation on Friday, calling Thompson a "bright light" who was "committed to public service."

"Our entire state mourns the horrible loss of Da'Cara Thompson, who was taken from us by an act of senseless violence," the governor said in the statement, vowing to use "every tool at our disposal" to hold those responsible for her death accountable.

The 19-year-old's cause of death has yet to be determined, though police said it may be ruled a homicide based on the evidence collected.

As the investigation remains active, police said detectives are working to determine whether Hernandez-Mendez and Thompson knew each other before the day she went missing.

            • The latest employment snapshot from the Bureau of Labor Statistics paints a bleak picture of the current state of the economy under President Donald Trump.
    


            • Labor market deterioration: Just 22,000 jobs were added in August, dramatically lower than economists' expectations for 76,500 new roles.
    


            • Negative job growth: For the first time in nearly four years, the economy lost jobs, with a decline of 13,000 positions in June.
    


            • Rising unemployment: The jobless rate rose to 4.3%, the highest level since 2021.
    


            • Stagnation: The data underscores the extent to which consumers and businesses are struggling to accommodate the weight of tariffs, stubborn inflation, the decline in America's crucial immigrant workforce and overall economic uncertainty.
    


Our live coverage of the August jobs report has ended. Read more here.



            The US dollar broadly weakened on Friday after a softer-than-expected jobs report stoked concerns about a labor market slowdown.
    


            The dollar index, which measures the dollar's strength against six major foreign currencies, dropped 0.7% and hit its lowest level in over a month.
    


            The dollar weakened on signs of a slowdown and expectations for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Fed rate cuts can lower Treasury yields, making the bonds relatively less appealing for global investors and leading to less demand for dollars.
    


            “Another soft nonfarm payrolls report has put the dollar on the back foot again,” Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.
    


            Although the dollar fell, Goltermann said he expects it to rebound because US economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, is still relatively robust, and expectations for lower rates in other major economies could limit the dollar's decline.
    


            The dollar index is down almost 10% this year. The weaker dollar has also been a boon for gold. The yellow metal is priced in dollars, so a weaker dollar makes it relatively cheaper for global investors, boosting demand. Gold prices on Friday rose roughly 1.4% and hit an all-time high.
    


            Younger Americans seeking work are facing trouble getting hired in today's job market.
    


            The unemployment rate for 16-to-24-year-olds climbed in August to 10.5%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
    


            That's the highest level in nearly four years and a significant increase from 9% as recently as January.
    


            The youth unemployment rate is more than twice as high as the national unemployment rate.
    


            The findings underscore how there are fewer opportunities for younger workers.
    


            The jobless rate is slightly higher, at 10.8%, for high school graduates aged 20 to 24 without college experience. That's up sharply from 8.8% in July.
    


            Even recent college graduates are having serious trouble landing a job these days. Some members of the Class of 2024 say they applied to hundreds of jobs without success – and some economists suspect artificial intelligence may be playing a role.



            The unemployment rate for those aged 20 to 24 years old with a bachelor's degree and higher climbed to 9.3% in August, up from 8.6% in July and 4.2% in April.
    


            “The ‘low hiring, low firing' environment has disproportionately hit the younger cohort of new college grads,” Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told CNN. “We're now likely seeing the impact of AI on this cohort, especially as companies start turning to technology to save on costs.”
    


            E.J. Antoni, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics after he fired the prior BLS commissioner following last month's dismal jobs report, recently floated temporarily suspending monthly job reports.
    


            Instead, Antoni, who does not have any official sway at the BLS while awaiting Senate confirmation, advocated for publishing quarterly job reports until fixes are implemented to ensure the government-produced data is more accurate.
    


            Even though data included in monthly job reports, namely the headline employment number, gets revised several times, it still is an essential window into the state of the labor market. Without a monthly report, Federal Reserve officials, for instance, would likely have a much harder time deciding where interest rates should be.
    


            It could lead to a scenario where they think hiring rates are much higher, leading them to believe it's unnecessary to lower rates. But, in reality, hiring rates could be much lower and could have been somewhat higher, had they cut sooner.
    


            It would also mean a lack of data to support one half of its dual mandate (price stability and full employment), which, in turn, would send shockwaves through financial markets and thoroughly disrupt businesses' abilities to plan.
    


            However, Antoni, if confirmed, and White House officials, said that monthly job reports would continue getting published.

            Friday's job report was a signal the economy is weakening, investors say, spurring a rally in Treasury bonds and gold while stocks and the dollar fell.
    


            Here's what Wall Street is saying:
    


Bank of America revised its expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. The bank now expects a quarter-point cut in September and December, after previously forecasting zero cuts this year.
    


            “The August jobs report is likely to amplify the Fed's concerns about labor market weakness,” Aditya Bhave, senior US economist at Bank of America, said in a note. “The shift in our view is motivated by both the softer labor data and [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell's reaction function, as stated at Jackson Hole.”
    


            Krishna Guha, vice chairman at Evercore ISI, said in a note that a September rate cut is now a lock, and the soft labor data raises the likelihood of an October rate cut “a bit above 50-50 for the first time.”
    


            “The underlying details within the report showed broad-based weakness, with a continued lack of breadth in industries seeing positive payroll gains,” Guha said.
    


            Thomas Simons, chief US economist at Jefferies, said the report confirms his call for quarter-point cuts in September, October and December.
    


            At investment firm BTIG, Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician, said a September rate cut is “locked,” but cautioned against overoptimism from investors who are eager for rate cuts.
    


            “When you are rooting for weaker data to support rate cuts, it's a fine line and sometimes it's a function of ‘careful what you wish for,'” Krinsky said.
    


            The Dow was down 290 points, or 0.64%, as of 12:35 p.m. ET. The S&P 500 fell 0.55% and the Nasdaq was down 0.3%.
    


            Friday's jobs report generates more questions than answers about the US economy; however, one of the biggest blind spots in labor market data is how the immigration landscape is changing.
    


            “The Current Population Survey, which underlies the unemployment rate, is not designed to take up sudden changes in population, including changes to immigration policy,” Daniel Zhao, chief economist at employment website Glassdoor, told CNN in an interview Friday. “We're in the dark a bit there.”
    


            (The Current Population Survey of households is one of two surveys that compose the monthly jobs report. The other, of businesses, is where the headline payroll gains, wage and industry information are from).
    


            Because of how the jobs report is structured, it's impossible to attribute the employment gains to any particular demographic.
    


            However, on Friday, White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett appeared to blame the weak job gains changing immigration dynamics.
    


            “All the job creation in the US has come from native-born workers, whereas in the Biden administration, it would be like maybe about half was foreign born,” Hassett said, repeating a frequent unsubstantiated claim from the Trump administration.
    


            The foreign-born labor force has declined somewhat after peaking earlier this year, BLS data shows. However, the drop-off can be attributed to people refusing to answer surveys or not indicating their nativity status, economists note.
    


            The employment-to-population ratio for foreign-born workers was 63.5% in August, up slightly from July. For native-born workers, that ratio dipped to 58.8% from 59.1.
    


            Economists were already expecting an unimpressive set of data for the August jobs report. The actual numbers came in far worse:
    


            The only potential good news for Trump is that the Fed may finally opt to slash its interest rate — but to support the economy, not to please the president.
    


            A brief rally evaporated Friday morning as investors digested August jobs data that depicted a slowing labor market.
    


            Stocks initially rose after the weaker-than-expected jobs report, as traders ramped up bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this fall.
    


            But the gains were short-lived as Wall Street reckoned with the prospect of a weakening economy. Initial excitement about rate cuts was dampened by the realization that the Fed needing to step in is a sign the economy isn't necessarily doing well.
    


            This reaction to the downside is more logical than the initial cheer, Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, told CNN.
    


            “Do we want the Fed to cut? Yes,” Hogan said. “But do we want the Fed to need to cut? No, that's bad news for the economy and market.”
    


            “Celebrating the Fed coming to the rescue is like celebrating the ambulance coming to your house really fast – until you realize why you needed an ambulance in the first place,” Hogan said.
    


            The Dow was down 400 points, or 0.88%, as of 11:10 a.m. ET. The S&P 500 fell 0.86% and the Nasdaq fell 0.76%.
    


            US stocks moved into the red Friday morning, with the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all erasing earlier gains.
    


            The Dow fell 359 points, or 0.79%. The S&P 500 fell 0.7% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 0.56%.
    


            While stocks had opened higher, confidence wavered as investors digested the prospect of a weakening economy and also grappled with news from the crucial tech sector.
    


            Nvidia (NVDA) fell 4.1%, weighing on markets. Shares of the chipmaker were under pressure after the Financial Times reported that OpenAI is set to partner with Broadcom (AVGO) to produce its own artificial intelligence chips. Broadcom shares were up 10%.
    


            Shares in just under half of the companies in the S&P 500 were lower. More than two thirds of the companies in the Dow were lower.
    


            Elsewhere, Lululemon (LULU) sank 17% after the company lowered its earnings outlook, citing the impact of tariffs.
    


            The sentiment driving markets dipped from “greed” into “neutral,” according to CNN's Fear and Greed index.
    


            In recent months, the unemployment rate has remained low for a not-entirely-ideal reason: The labor force was shrinking.
    


            But in August, the jobless rate moved higher — in part because more people re-entered the labor force looking for work, BLS data showed.
    


            The labor force, which shrank for three months in a row, increased by 436,000 people in August, BLS' latest household survey data shows.
    


            The labor force participation rate moved higher as well, ticking up to 62.3% from 62.2%.
    


            While the majority of those labor force gains were from those classified as employed, the increase in those unemployed was largely attributed to those who re-entered the labor market and are searching for jobs.
    


            “In fact, the median time looking for work slipped to a three-month low, a bright spot in a generally weak jobs report,” Jennifer Timmerman, senior investment strategy analyst at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, wrote in a note to investors Friday.
    


            President Donald Trump is on a mission to make American manufacturing jobs great again by deploying historically high tariffs on imports.
    


            That effort is off to a slow start, at best, and at worst is backfiring by causing job loss.



            US manufacturers shed another 12,000 jobs in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
    


            That marks the fourth consecutive month of job loss for US manufacturers. The industry has slashed 42,000 jobs since April, when Trump shocked investors with massive tariffs that he later paused and dialed back.
    


            While it's far too early to deliver a verdict on Trump's use of tariffs to reshore manufacturing jobs, economists say the chaotic nature of trade policy to date is undermining his efforts.
    


            “What we're seeing is a sector paralyzed by uncertainty,” Matthew Martin, senior US economist at Oxford Economics, told CNN on Friday.
    


            Faced with immense uncertainty on where tariffs will settle, some manufacturers are laying off workers. Others are struggling from higher costs caused by Trump tariffs on key inputs including steel, aluminum and copper.
    


            Surveys of manufacturers reveal frustration over the volatile trade policy.
    


            “Tariff Bingo is tough,” one furniture manufacturer told the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas in a survey released last week. “We are probably going out of business within 90 days.”
    


            A transportation equipment manufacturing executive said the current environment in the industry is much worse” than the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009.
    


            “There is absolutely no activity in the transportation equipment industry. This is 100% attributable to current tariff policy and the uncertainty it has created,” the executive told the Institute for Supply Management.
    


            Appearing to react to Friday's underwhelming jobs report, President Donald Trump took a pointed swipe at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for keeping interest rates high.
    


            “Jerome ‘Too Late' Powell should have lowered rates long ago. As usual, he's ‘Too Late!'” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.
    


            The president's comment comes shortly after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the economy added just 22,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% from 4.2%.
    


            August's job report also included a downward revision to June, which showed the US economy lost 13,000 jobs that month. It's the first negative employment month since December 2020, and brings to an end what was the second-longest period of employment expansion on record.
    


            The US economy is in a hiring slump, but Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Friday signaled an optimistic note on America's job market.
    


            “A year from today, you're going to see employment numbers you'd never imagine,” Lutnick told CNBC Friday just before the jobs report was released.
    


            Lutnick said tariffs will incentivize manufacturing job growth (the industry has lost jobs for four straight months), and the administration will train people to take on new jobs that tariffs will create in the United States.
    


            “What it's going to do is it's going to take the 6.9 million Americans who are capable of working who are sitting on the sidelines now because they just haven't had the jobs they were looking for, they're going to come into the workplace,” Lutnick said. “We're going to train 5 million Americans for these jobs.”
    


            Lutnick said the primary factor for the jobs slump is high interest rates. The Fed has kept rates high because it feared tariffs could boost prices, and job growth had until recently remained robust.
    


            “We're going to see employment numbers that you've never imagined if only, and what would help it, is if finally, [Federal Reserve Chair] Jerome Powell does his job and lowers rates,” Lutnick said. “It is outrageous that the Fed keeps its rates this high. It's absurd, actually.”
    


            National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett conceded Friday the jobs numbers were a “bit of a disappointment” but said he expects that later revisions will show more jobs were added.
    


            “This jobs number was certainly a little bit of a disappointment right now,” Hassett said on CNBC. “There was a Goldman Sachs study that came out yesterday that showed that — because the [Bureau of Labor Statistics] hasn't really done a good job on its seasonal adjustment in August — that they tend to revise this number up by almost 70,000 jobs when they give you a revised number a month later.”
    


            “It's a little bit of a disappointing job number, but I pretty much expect it's going to revise up,” Hassett added.
    


            When the BLS issued a disappointing jobs report for July, including sharp revisions for May and June, Trump fired Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, saying without evidence that the numbers were “RIGGED.”
    


            Hassett said officials are looking at the “capital spending boom” and high industrial production as indicators that “the economy is sound and inflation is low.”
    


            “We're really cruising into, I think, the kind of capital spending boom we had last time, the last time that we had the big corporate reform,” Hassett said. “Against that backdrop, that's exactly what you want to see, in terms of, you got supply side driven growth, so therefore you're not putting inflationary pressure on, as well.”
    


            Job growth and opportunities are cooling for US workers. So are paycheck gains.
    


            The annual growth in average hourly earnings was 3.7% in August, a slowing from 3.9% the month before. While the deceleration can be partly attributed to “base effects” (year-over-year comparisons), they're also a symbol of a broader shift occurring in the labor market, noted economist Lydia Boussour.
    


            “Employers' continued focus on wage containment amid a slowing economy may lead to a further deceleration in wage growth toward 3.5% by the fall,” Boussour, EY-Parthenon senior economist, wrote in a note Friday to investors.
    


            And with inflation heating back up, workers' paychecks are not going as far as they recently did, according to the most recently available data.
    


            Through July, real (inflation-adjusted) average hourly wages were up 1.2%, BLS data shows.
    


            Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer denied that tariffs have anything to do with the weak jobs numbers Friday, laying blame on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for refusing to bend to President Donald Trump's pressure to lower interest rates.
    


            “Jerome Powell should be embarrassed by this report, because he has not done his job,” Chavez-DeRemer said on Fox Business.
    


            Pressed if she's even a little disappointed by the numbers, Chavez-DeRemer conceded slightly, but said the Trump administration is in a net positive with jobs numbers.
    


            “Well, 22,000 jobs underperformed just a bit, but it's still in the positive, almost a half a million jobs have been created since the president took office,” she said.
    


            “It's going to take some time, but again, when everybody is working for the American people and the American worker, and somebody chooses not to, and they're instrumental in those decisions that affect the market, that affect the wage growth, that affect all of those things, do your job,” Chavez-DeRemer added, referring to Powell.
    


            Asked if tariffs have anything to do with the slowing job market, Chavez -DeRemer said, “Tariffs are working.”
    


            “How do I know this? Because companies are reinvesting in the American workforce. We're seeing the consumer confidence up. We're seeing real wages up year over year, almost 4% real wages are up,” she said.
    


            Chavez-DeRemer's statistics are not correct. Over the past year, through July, real (inflation-adjusted) average hourly earnings were up 1.2%. Through August, average hourly wage growth, not adjusted for inflation, was up 3.7%, a slowing from the 3.9% rate in July.
    


            US stocks opened higher on Friday after August jobs data came in softer than expected, boosting expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September to stimulate the economy.
    


            Investors are eager for rate cuts: The Dow rose 119 points, or 0.26%. The S&P 500 rose 0.41% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.63%.
    


            Treasury bonds rallied as investors flocked to safe assets due to signs of an economic slowdown. Investors also recalibrated their expectations for the Fed's rate-cutting cycle and snapped up bonds to lock in current high rates.
    


            Bond prices and yields trade in opposite directions. As bonds rallied, yields fell. The two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to Fed rate cut expectations, dropped sharply to 3.47%, its lowest level since 2022.
    


            Traders ramped up bets on the depth of the Fed's potential rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 12% chance of a jumbo half-point cut in September, compared to a 0% chance yesterday.
    


            The US dollar index sank 0.75% on signs of a slowdown and future rate cuts. Gold prices jumped 0.9% and hit a fresh record high.
    


            There were more industries that lost jobs last month than those that gained, according to the government's latest tally.
    


            US employers overall added just 22,000 jobs in August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday, reflecting one of the weakest three-month streaks of job growth since the Great Recession. But some industries are faring even worse.
    


            In August, the professional and business services sector lost 17,000 jobs, the most of any industry. That wide-ranging industry — encompassing roles such as accountants and engineers — has lost jobs throughout the year.
    


            There were eight other industries that lost jobs last month, such as government, which shrank by 16,000; and manufacturing, which shed 12,000 jobs.
    


            In contrast, there were only five sectors that gained jobs last month.
    


            The biggest job gains were in the private education and health services sector, which added 46,000 jobs in August. As usual, those gains were driven by the health care industry, which added 31,000, “below the average monthly gain of 42,000 over the prior 12 months,” the BLS said in a release.
    


            With signs of America's job market continuing to weaken, investors are expecting the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates at each of its three meetings the rest of the year.
    


            After the Friday jobs report was released, the CME Group's FedWatch Tool showed an 87.8% probability that the Fed will reduce its benchmark rate by a quarter point at its September 16-17 meeting. The central bank has held steady since December.
    


            But now there's also a 12.2% chance of a jumbo half-point cut this month.
    


            The odds of further rate cuts the rest of the year also went up.
    


            Investors now see a 70.5% probability of a quarter-point cut in October, according to the FedWatch Tool, up from 53.6% on Thursday. For the Fed's December meeting, investors see a 67.2% chance of another quarter-point cut, compared with 45.8% yesterday.
    


            Friday's jobs report painted a miserable picture of the labor market in practically every metric.
    


            In addition to the weaker-than-expected monthly total of 22,000 jobs added last month and the revised June figures showing the economy shed jobs for the first time in five years, the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3% from 4.2%.
    


            That's the highest the unemployment rate has been since October 2021.

WASHINGTON (AP) — It's an ideological faction transforming the Republican Party in President Donald Trump's second term. Now firmly in power, its leaders gathered this week beneath a downtown Washington hotel to bask in their triumph — and to chart what comes next.

“Donald Trump's victory was not just a win for his movement but for the ideas of the people in this room,” Missouri Sen. Eric Schmitt told the crowd. “National conservatism is an idea whose time has arrived.”

Members of Congress, Trump administration officials, donors and right-wing pundits gathered this week for the annual National Conservatism Conference — a gathering once seen as fringe, now asserting itself as the GOP's dominant ideological force. Panel titles ranged from “The Threat of Islamism in America” to “The Bible and American Renewal” to “Overturn Obergefell,” the Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage. 

It all underscored the movement's vision of an America rooted in limited immigration, Christian identity and the preservation of what speakers called the nation's traditional culture.

Schmitt, a first-term senator, followed a GOP donor's speech on “The Problem of Our Time: White Guilt” with a talk of his own titled “What is an American?” In it, Schmitt criticized some legal immigration, declared that “America doesn't belong to them — it belongs to us,” and insisted, “We can no longer apologize for who we are.”

“Our people tamed the continent, built a civilization from the wilderness,” Schmitt said. “We Americans are the sons and daughters of the Christian pilgrims who poured out onto the ocean's shores.”

In July 2024, then-Sen. JD Vance used his Republican National Convention speech after accepting the vice presidential nomination to declare: “America is not just an idea. It is a group of people with a shared history and a common future. It is, in short, a nation.”

That idea is central to what national conservatism is. With its first conference in the U.S. in 2019, the national conservatism movement is a project of the Edmund Burke Foundation, a conservative U.S. think tank. Its founder, Israeli political theorist Yoram Hazony, defines national conservatism as a political philosophy centered on the restoration and preservation of national and religious traditions — ideals he says are essential to a nation's long-term strength and cohesion.

Vance has spoken at multiple National Conservatism Conferences and in 2021 credited Hazony as “quite influential to me.” His elevation to vice president — and the policy shifts that followed — signaled that the movement had fully arrived in power.

In 2021, while campaigning for the Senate, Vance delivered the conference keynote, calling on conservatives to “honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country.” Four years later, the Trump administration has done just that, targeting universities by cutting their funding. 

This year's conference was held in the heart of Washington, just blocks from the White House. 

High-profile speakers included Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, White House budget director Russell Vought, Trump border czar Tom Homan, and three U.S. senators. The speaker list also featured more controversial figures, such as John Eastman — an ex-Trump attorney central in efforts to overturn the 2020 election after Trump's loss to Democrat Joe Biden — and Calvin Robinson, a Michigan priest who lost his license after mimicking a straight-arm gesture interpreted by some as a Nazi salute.

Many of the top speakers used their time to defend Trump administration policies and lash out at critics. Vought declared that the Government Accountability Office “shouldn't exist” after it said his latest effort to claw back funds already approved by Congress is illegal. On the broader push for the rollback of appropriated funds, or rescissions, he said, “If Congress has given us authority that is too broad, then we're going to use that authority aggressively to protect the American people.”

On an “Overturn Obergefell” panel, Katy Faust, a right-wing author, argued that legalizing gay marriage had weakened the rights of biological parents: “The moment the state has the power to assign parenthood to strangers, it can unassign it from you. Your legal relationship to the children you've begotten is weaker than it was a decade ago.”

Thomas Klingenstein, a top Republican donor, argued in a speech that the greatest problem facing the nation is “white guilt.”

“Many Americans voted for President Trump in 2016 because he told them what they knew but needed to hear: America could be great again,” said Klingenstein. “Now, Trump must tell them something else they know but need to hear: America is no longer guilty of systemic racism, or most any racism for that matter.”

The 2025 conference served in part as a celebration. The founder, Hazony, opened the event with a speech about “what winning looks like.” Vought urged attendees to further push forward the movement “so that the movement built around President Trump is a durable intellectual river.”

But no one made a louder entrance than Missouri's junior senator, Schmitt.

Opening his 30-minute address with force, Schmitt declared the moment “a revolt within the right.” He offered immigration policy as the prime example. 

“The old conservative establishment may have opposed something like illegal immigration on procedural grounds, simply because it was illegal,” he said. “At this point, it should be clear that the fact that something is sanctioned by our government does not mean it's good for our country.

“That much is obvious with various forms of legal immigration today.”

He closed by outlining his view that America is “a nation and a people, with its own distinct history and heritage and interests.” 

That heritage, he said, is one of pilgrims and settlers who repelled “wave after wave of Indian war band attacks.” He said “every great feat of the modern world bore American fingerprints,” calling those who built skyscrapers, split the atom, invented the airplane and walked on the moon.

“America, in all its glory, is their gift to us, handed down across the generations. It belongs to us. It's our birthright, our heritage, our destiny,” Schmitt said.

Though the ballroom was only half full, Schmitt's remarks quickly reverberated online, as his team pushed out clips across social media.

In just over two years, he has built a close alliance with Trump, helping move key legislation through the Senate. But this speech marked something more: a signal that national conservatism now has a firm foothold in the halls of Congress.

“We're not sorry. Why would we be sorry?” Schmitt said in closing. “America is the proudest and most magnificent heritage ever known to man.”

Jacksonville State University forensics scholar Joseph Scott Morgan discusses police probing a death at the Burning Man festival as a homicide on 'America Reports.'

The father of a Russian man found dead at the Burning Man festival is demanding justice after authorities confirmed his son was the victim of a homicide that rocked the famous art and music gathering.

Vadim Kruglov, a 37-year-old Russian national who had been living in Washington state, was named as the victim found "lying in a pool of blood," according to the Pershing County Sheriff's Office. His death cast a grim shadow over the annual event held in Nevada's Black Rock Desert.

In a video posted to Facebook on Thursday, his father, Igor Kruglov, said "words can't express" his feelings over the loss of his son.

"I'm proud of my son, now known worldwide," Igor Kruglov, speaking in Russian, said in the video. "He felt injustice deeply and fought for fairness always. I believe a similar situation occurred here. This world is often unfair, but as a peaceful man, I seek justice. I want those responsible to face consequences."

Igor Kruglov also expressed gratitude to his son's friends for reaching out to him in the aftermath of the tragedy, noting, "Everyone's helping however they can."

The Pershing County Sheriff's Office told Fox News Digital on Friday it had no new updates to share regarding the investigation.

Burning Man organizers have issued their condolences, saying, "Our hearts go out to Vadim's family and friends, and we grieve the loss of a community member." Organizers also confirmed they were fully cooperating with law enforcement.

"Burning Man Project is doing everything we can to assist the Sheriff's investigation so the perpetrator can be caught and brought to justice," the organization said.

This includes a coordinated donation to the Secret Witness program, which offers rewards for tips aiding the investigation.

The incident occurred on the evening of Aug. 30, between 8 and 9:30 p.m. local time, according to the sheriff's office. The annual event, which attracts tens of thousands of participants, known as "Burners," transforms the desert into a temporary city complete with large-scale art installations, themed camps and the iconic ceremonial burns.

The two final evenings of the festival include a pair of large-scale "burns." The first involves participants loading a 100-foot-tall wooden effigy of a man with fireworks, and the second consists of the burning of the "Temple." 

Authorities were alerted to the scene when an attendee flagged down an officer on Saturday evening, leading to the discovery of the victim, whom police described in a Monday news release as "obviously deceased."

The area was immediately secured, and investigators have since interviewed several individuals who may have been nearby.

Despite the shock surrounding the event, officials have indicated that the death appears to be an isolated incident. The sheriff's office said earlier this week that it is continuing its investigation and seeking public assistance. They believe that witnesses from the community could hold vital clues.

Police are asking anyone with information to call them at 775-273-2641 and reference case # 25-318.

Burning Man organizers stressed the importance of not obstructing the investigation. "The safety and well-being of our community are paramount," they said, according to the Associated Press. Support services are also reportedly available to participants who may be affected.

Fox News correspondent Garrett Tenney has the latest on the University of Kentucky student under arrest after a dead baby was found at her house on ‘America's Newsroom.'

The University of Kentucky student-athlete accused of hiding her dead newborn inside a closet was described as a "serial bully," according to a former classmate.

Laken Snelling, 21, was taken into custody on Sunday after officers with the Lexington Police Department responded to an unresponsive infant, according to officials. The infant was "pronounced deceased at the scene," officials said in a statement. Police said Snelling was the infant's mother.

The Fayette County Coroner's Office in Lexington, Kentucky, said in a statement that an autopsy on the male infant was inconclusive, adding extensive microscopic analysis is needed to determine how the infant died.

Snelling was charged with tampering with physical evidence, concealing the birth of an infant and abuse of a corpse. She pleaded not guilty.

WLEX reported that the newborn was located in a closet "wrapped in a towel inside of a black trash bag," according to a police document.

Sydney Kite, who went to high school with Snelling, accused the athlete of bullying her friends and sister, according to the Daily Mail.

"Laken had many, many people that she took her personal anger out on. My sister was one of them," Kite said. "While in high school, she tried to run over one of my closest friends with her Jeep. The bullying got so bad, my friend had to be pulled out of school and transferred to another because Laken had taken it so far."

Snelling is a senior at the University of Kentucky and a member of the STUNT team, according to a university spokesperson. The university describes STUNT as a "head-to-head competition between two teams that focuses on the technical and athletic aspects of cheer," which is "one of the fastest-growing female sports in the United States."

Snelling also "admitted to giving birth," the police document indicated.

She was released from jail on $100,000 bond and placed on house arrest.

Other similar cases have gained national attention.

In 1996, Amy Grossberg and Brian Peterson had a baby in a $52-a-night Delaware hotel room, then dumped the infant in a dumpster. The two claimed the baby was stillborn, according to NBC Philadelphia.

Grossberg fell sick after returning to her dorm at the University of Delaware and needed to be hospitalized. Once at the hospital, doctors determined she delivered a baby.

Melissa Drexler gave birth to a baby while in a bathroom at her New Jersey high school prom in 1997, according to The New York Times. Officials said Drexler wrapped the infant in plastic bags and put him in a trash bin.

Drexler pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter and was sentenced to 15 years in prison.

Fox News Digital reached out to Snelling's attorney for comment.

Fox News contributor Donna Rotunno explains the legal hurdles victims' families face in trying to permanently block the release of Bryan Kohberger crime scene photos on 'America Reports.'

Quadruple murderer Bryan Kohberger claimed in court documents that he was diagnosed with four mental health disorders in the months leading up to his guilty plea in the killings of four University of Idaho students.

Kohberger, 30, was diagnosed with "autism (level 1)," obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), which he wrote in a mental competency waiver obtained by the New York Post. 

Kohberger had filled out the form before pleading guilty in July.

All four diagnoses were made in February 2025, he wrote in the document. He also noted that, at the time, he was taking a prescription drug called levothyroxine, which is used to treat hypothyroidism.

Kohberger's attorneys argued his autism diagnosis should be a factor in removing the death penalty, but a judge denied that request in April.

His lawyers also didn't want prosecutors to describe him as a "psychopath" or in other specific terms if his case went to trial.

Digital forensics experts who dug into Kohberger's phone and computer told Fox News Digital recently that the criminology Ph.D. student regularly searched the term "psychopath" and related terms like "psychopaths paranoid." They said he also looked up wiretapping and spent Christmas night reading in depth about serial killers.

KOHBERGER'S LAWYERS DIDN'T WANT HIM CALLED ‘PSYCHOPATH,' BUT HE SEARCHED THE TERM REGULARLY

In July, Kohberger pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder in the killings of University of Idaho students Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Xana Kernodle, 20, Madison Mogen, 21, and Ethan Chapin, 20, in November 2022.

Kohberger ultimately accepted a plea deal, avoiding the death penalty and receiving four consecutive life sentences, plus additional years, a move that split the victims' families between those who welcome closure to those who say justice was thwarted.

Some 475 people were detained during an immigration raid at a sprawling Georgia site where South Korean auto company Hyundai manufactures electric vehicles, according to a Homeland Security official.

Steven Schrank, Special Agent in Charge, Homeland Security Investigations, said at a news briefing Friday that the majority of the people detained were from South Korea. “This operation underscores our commitment to jobs for Georgians and Americans,” Schrank said.

South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lee Jaewoong described the number of detained South Koreans as “large,” though he did not provide an exact figure.

Thursday's raid targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, touted by the governor and other officials as the largest economic development project in the state's history.

Other news we're following today:








Republican Gov. Brian Kemp says he's sending the Georgia National Guard later this month.

It's the latest indication that President Donald Trump's law enforcement operation in the nation's capital will drag on.

Kemp said he will mobilize roughly 300 guard members in mid-September to relieve soldiers from other states. Seven other states have sent National Guard troops so far.

Kemp said Georgia's soldiers may be armed and will support law enforcement. Kemp said he already sent 16 soldiers this week to perform non-policing support roles.

It may seem strange to see Wall Street sometimes cheer what appear to be bad numbers for the job market, but what it really wants is for the economy to remain in a precarious balance. It wants the job market to be slow enough to convince the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, but not so weak that it heralds a recession. That's because lower interest rates tend to give prices for investments a boost.

Stocks had been rising because Wall Street has been hopeful that the economy can remain in such a Goldilocks balance. But Friday's weaker-than-expected jobs report may have caused some doubt, and stocks fell in midday trading.

As for inflation, stock prices can rise along with prices for groceries, insurance and everything else in the economy, particularly if profits for companies are heading upward too. If inflation goes up too much, however, that would hurt companies because the Fed could be compelled to raise interest rates, a move that often hurts prices for investments.

“The August jobs report is the latest indication that Donald Trump is crashing our economy in real time and driving us toward a recession,” Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the top House Democrat, said in a statement.

The U.S. added about 22,000 jobs in August, a recent low, while the employment rate rose to its highest since 2021.

President Trump has criticized the jobs data, which are collected by the Bureau for Labor Statistics. Trump last month fired the head of the nonpartisan agency and appointed an economist affiliated with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.

Jeffries continued that “life is becoming increasingly more expensive while unemployment is the highest in years.”

The New York Democrat also criticized the Republicans' signature tax and spending law as “saddling the economy with trillions of dollars in debt” and cutting health and social welfare programs “in order to enact massive tax breaks for their billionaire donors.”

Over a recent two-year period, the Pentagon funded hundreds of projects done in collaboration with universities in China and institutes linked to that nation's defense industry, including many blacklisted by the U.S. government for working with the Chinese military, a congressional investigation has found.

The report, released Friday by House Republicans on the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, argues the projects have allowed China to exploit U.S. research partnerships for military gains while the two countries are locked in a tech and arms rivalry.

“American taxpayer dollars should be used to defend the nation — not strengthen its foremost strategic competitor,” Republicans wrote in the report.

“Failing to safeguard American research from hostile foreign exploitation will continue to erode U.S. technological dominance and place our national defense capabilities at risk,” it said.

The Pentagon and didn't immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is delaying a requirement for automakers to begin hitting minimum sales levels for electric vehicles next year, an official familiar with the matter said Friday.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they weren't authorized to speak publicly ahead of Carney's announcement.

Former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau set the target, requiring that in 2026 20% of passenger vehicles sold should be zero-emission vehicles.

Removing the requirement comes as automakers deal with the impact of President Trump's tariffs.

Carney is set to announce later Friday measures for workers and businesses in those sectors most impacted by the U.S. tariffs and trade disruptions.

Pentagon officials were slated to brief congressional national security staff on Friday but no top-level session for Hill leaders was expected.

Congress has already adjourned for the week and many lawmakers have left town. House Speaker Mike Johnson is in Canada attending the G7 summit of global leaders.

Senate Foreign Relations Chairman James Risch has acknowledged being in touch with the administration about the military strike, but provided no further details.

But House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries had called on the Trump administration to provide a full briefing for Congress.

They were detained during an immigration raid at a sprawling Georgia site where South Korean auto company Hyundai manufactures electric vehicles, according to the Homeland Security official.

Steven Schrank, Special Agent in Charge, Homeland Security Investigations, spoke at a news briefing in Savannah on Friday. No charges were immediately announced.

“This operation underscores our commitment to jobs for Georgians and Americans,” Schrank said.

South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lee Jaewoong described the number of detained South Koreans as “large” though he did not provide an exact figure.

At 10:30 a.m. ET, Trump will receive his intelligence briefing.

At noon, he'll participate in an ambassador credentialing ceremony.

At 2 p.m., he'll sign executive orders, followed by an announcement at 4 p.m., then a 7 p.m. dinner in the Rose Garden, according to the White House.

Congressman Greg Steube of Florida and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah formally introduced the “Department of War Restoration Act of 2025” in the House and Senate respectively.

“It should always be clear to anyone who would harm our people: Americans don't just play defense,” Lee said in a statement earlier this week.

“From 1789 until the end of World War II, the United States military fought under the banner of the Department of War,” Steube, an Army veteran, said in a statement. “It is only fitting that we pay tribute to their eternal example and renowned commitment to lethality by restoring the name of the ‘Department of War' to our Armed Forces.”

President Trump said he wants to change the Pentagon's official title because the War Department title “just sounded better.”

Only Congress has the power to establish, shutter and rename federal departments, meaning the legislation is required to formalize Trump's name change.

The statement from Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, came in response to Friday's jobs report that said U.S. employers added just 22,000 jobs last month amid uncertainty over Trump's economic policies.

“Donald Trump's chaotic tariffs, failed policies, and fake trade deals have slowed job growth and continually raised prices on American families,” Schumer said.

The Senate voted in April to reverse some of Trump's proposed tariffs on Canada, but the House did not act on the legislation.

U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson got a major boost Friday in her bid to succeed Iowa's Republican Sen. Joni Ernst just days after Ernst confirmed she wouldn't run for a third term. Within hours of Ernst's announcement Tuesday, Hinson said she would run for the open seat.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune and National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Tim Scott handed Hinson an endorsement Friday in a joint statement. Thune said Hinson would bring to the Senate her “unrelenting energy” working for President Trump's agenda.

Hinson, who represents Iowa's northeastern corner, joins two other Republicans in a primary for Ernst's seat.

President Trump launched Operation Warp Speed in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, an effort he's credited with saving tens of millions of lives. During a Cabinet meeting last week, he likened it to “one of the greatest achievements ever.”

Sitting at the table as a proud Trump spoke was Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who came under fire at a congressional hearing Thursday for his work to restrict access to vaccines, including the very COVID-19 shots still touted by his boss.

The three-hour hearing exposed an odd dichotomy: One of Trump's most universal successes in his first term remains Operation Warp Speed, yet his handpicked health chief and a growing cadre of Trump's “Make America Great Again” supporters are distrustful of the very mRNA vaccine technology that the president has championed.

Defense officials were scheduled to provide a classified briefing Friday morning to Congressional leaders and key Hill committees about the strike. But it was canceled without explanation, according to a person familiar with the plans who wasn't authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Submit a question on the subject, and an AP reporter may offer a response.






Futures for the S&P 500 rose 0.2% in premarket trading Friday, while Nasdaq futures gained 0.6%, propelled by another strong earnings report from chipmaker Broadcom. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell slightly.

In the bond market, Treasury yields fell after the government said U.S. employers added just 22,000 jobs last month as the labor market continued to cool under uncertainty over President Trump's economic policies, particularly tariffs.

The slowdown in the job market could bolster the case for Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate, which Fed Chair Jerome Powell has already signaled as a possibility. An announcement of a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting Sept. 16-17 could reduce other borrowing costs in the economy, including mortgages, auto loans, and business loans.

South Korea on Friday expressed “concern and regret” over a major U.S. immigration raid at a sprawling Georgia site where South Korean auto company Hyundai manufactures electric vehicles.

South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lee Jaewoong described the number of detained South Koreans as “large” though he didn't provide an exact figure.

His ministry would not confirm or deny South Korean media reports saying that about 300 South Koreans were detained in Georgia on Thursday. The Atlanta office of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which assisted immigration authorities at the site, posed on the social media site X that about 450 people total were apprehended.

Hyundai's South Korean office didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

President Trump's administration has undertaken sweeping ICE operations as part of a mass deportation agenda. Immigration officers have raided farms, construction sites, restaurants and auto repair shops.

The Trump administration is taking its immigration crackdown to the health care safety net, launching Medicaid spending probes in at least six Democratic-led states that provide comprehensive health coverage to poor and disabled immigrants living in the U.S. without permanent legal status.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is scouring payments covering health care for immigrants without legal status to ensure there isn't any waste, fraud or abuse, according to public records obtained by KFF Health News and The Associated Press.

While acknowledging that states can bill the federal government for Medicaid emergency and pregnancy care for immigrants without legal status, federal officials have sent letters notifying state health agencies in California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington that they are reviewing federal and state payments for medical services, such as prescription drugs and specialty care.

The federal agency told the states it's reviewing claims as part of its commitment to maintain Medicaid's fiscal integrity.

That's partly because of the lingering effects of 11 interest rate hikes by the inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve in 2022 and 2023 and partly because Trump's policies, including his trade wars, have created uncertainty that leaves managers reluctant to make hiring decisions.

So far in 2025, the economy has generated 85,000 new jobs a month, down from 168,000 last year and an average 400,000 a month during the hiring boom of 2021-2023 as the United States roared back from COVID-19 lockdowns.

“The labor market is showing signs of cracking,” said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. “It's not a red siren alarm yet, but the signs keep growing that businesses are starting to cut workers.‘'

The Labor Department said Friday that hiring decelerated from 79,000 in July. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3%, the Labor Department reported.

When the department put out a disappointing jobs report a month ago, an enraged President Trump responded by firing the economist in charge of compiling the numbers and nominating a loyalist to replace her.

Talking to reporters Thursday night at a dinner with wealthy tech executives, Trump had seemed to shrug off whatever hiring numbers would come out Friday. “The real numbers that I'm talking about are going to be whatever it is, but will be in a year from now,'' the president said.

The president's daughter-in-law will present an interview with the vice president on Saturday evening for her Fox News show, “My View with Lara Trump.”

Vance has served as a pitchman for the White House, traveling to swing states like Georgia and Wisconsin to promote administration policies like recent tax legislation.

He's also expected to talk about the upcoming midterms and the next presidential election, when he's been floated as a potential successor to Trump.

The interview airs Saturday at 9 p.m. ET.

Angela Tarpinian-Jachym discusses President Donald Trump's efforts to make Washington, DC safer following the killing of her brother Eric on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.' 

Two 17-year-olds were arrested in connection with the murder of Capitol Hill intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym. 

U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro named the two suspects as Jaylin Lucas and Kevin Thomas Jr. She said both of the suspects were charged with murder while armed and will be tried in adult court. 

Pirro noted that both Lucas and Thomas, though juveniles, have prior violent juvenile records in family court.

Tarpinian-Jachym, a rising senior at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, was interning for Rep. Ron Estes, R-Kan. He was fatally shot in Washington, D.C., just one mile from the White House.

"The murder of Eric Tarpinian-Jachym shook our nation's capital, and today justice is moving forward. Thanks to the relentless work of the FBI, MPD, and the Justice Department, two suspects are in custody. This is exactly what President Trump meant when he promised to make Washington, D.C. safe again: law and order, accountability, and justice for victims," FBI Director Kash Patel told Fox News Digital.

BALTIMORE – President Donald Trump is eyeing Baltimore for his next crime crackdown, but while residents agree the city needs change, they remain divided over whether deploying the National Guard is the answer.

Fox News Digital spoke with 17 locals in Baltimore on Wednesday about what a National Guard deployment would mean for their community. While many worried it would raise tensions and inspire riots, others said the troops could serve as a crime deterrent. 

When asked if Trump should step in and send troops to the city, Tasha, a young mother who was pushing her baby in a stroller outside the Department of Social Services, said, "Yes, I do, because right now our city needs it. Baltimore is on fire right now. We need as much help as we can get."

Joseph, a Penn-North resident, said the National Guard's presence would deter drug dealers and users from loitering on the streets around his home. There was a homeless woman sleeping on his front stoop while Fox News Digital spoke to him on Wednesday.

"I think it would make it a lot better," Joseph said. 

Daren Muhammed, a local radio host who called Penn-North "ground zero," said "all options should be placed on the table and made available" to clean up the streets he calls home. 

"My feeling is if the federal government's offering help, one's foolish to turn it down," Anthony, a Baltimore resident for 30 years, said.

Every Penn-North resident who spoke to Fox News Digital on Wednesday recognized the city has a crime issue. 

More than two dozen people were hospitalized in a mass drug overdose event in Penn-North in July. Meanwhile, three out of the seven homicides in Baltimore during August were in the nearby Park Heights, according to local reports. 

Between people selling and using drugs on the corner as one police car was parked just down the street, Tasha said that in Penn-North, "everything is back out here running like it didn't even happen a month ago."

Baltimore Mayor Brandon M. Scott celebrated "historic reductions in violent crime" in a statement released on Monday, touting 91 homicides and 218 nonfatal shootings in 2025, which he said are 29.5% and 21% drops. 

"We're good; we don't need or want the National Guard here in Baltimore," Scott said in response to Trump's potential plans, while promoting a statistic that Baltimore is experiencing its lowest homicide rate in 50 years. 

Gov. Wes Moore, D-Md., has reiterated the same stats and even invited Trump for a public safety walk through Baltimore.

"As President, I would much prefer that he clean up this crime disaster before I go there for a walk," Trump wrote back on Truth Social, as the president continues to signal his willingness to send troops. 

Statistics compiled by the nonprofit research institute Just Facts show that Baltimore's 2024 murder rate is still 6.8 times the average for all metropolitan areas in the nation and that if the murder rate stays the same as it was in 2024, roughly 1 in every 38 people in the city will have their lives cut short by murder at some point during the course of their lives. 

"I don't think they need to bring the troops in," Sarah, who said she is homeless and an addict, told Fox News Digital. "I think that is going to get an uproar. It's going to start a riot."

Sarah said she has witnessed robberies, thefts and shootings but said it would be "absurd" to send the National Guard, adding, "We're not in war zone."

Trayvon, a young man from Baltimore who was hanging around outside the CVS Pharmacy in Penn-North on Wednesday, said the National Guard is "not going to change s--t" in a "rebellious city that ain't been shown love in forever."

"I think anyone who's lived here through Freddie Gray, through a curfew, through almost having martial law in a certain kind of way, having the ramp closed off and locked off to come in after a certain hour, literally being blocked from it if you were on that side of town, with the Guard there and a couple of other different departments, I think psychologically it's not probably best for people who probably still haven't healed," Baltimore local, Ashley, said in neighboring Bolton Hill. 

Freddie Gray was a 25-year-old Black man from Baltimore who died in police custody in 2015. The National Guard was deployed to Baltimore after his death sparked protests that devolved into riots, igniting a national debate about racism and police brutality. 

"The day when the people cannot control themselves and cannot police themselves will be the end of everything," another woman from Baltimore said in Bolton Hill. "That's what we are seeing right now. Nobody will save us – not the National Guard, not the police."

Ronette, a woman who spoke to Fox News Digital while passing by the Department of Social Services in Penn-North, agreed, arguing that Baltimore can take care of itself. 

"We don't need Trump coming in the door," she said. 

Another Baltimore resident, George, said Trump threatening to deploy troops is merely a "stunt," while a woman wearing a face mask outside her home in Bolton Hill said it would "raise tensions much higher than they already are."

Will Hanna, a combat veteran from Baltimore, said the city needs federal help but not from the National Guard.

"I think there are some resources that we haven't exhausted as a city and as a state," Hanna said. "I think that we still can bring the state troopers here."

Trump has floated the idea of sending federal troops to Baltimore, similar to his recent move to send troops to Washington, D.C., to "quickly clean up the crime" if Maryland Gov. Wes Moore says he needs help.

"Chicago is a hellhole right now, Baltimore is a hellhole right now," Trump said earlier this month. "We have a right to do it because I have an obligation to do it to protect this country, and that includes Baltimore."

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., details the latest on the investigation into the Biden White House's handling of the former president's health and use of the autopen. 

FIRST ON FOX: The House Oversight Committee is slamming former Biden spokesman Andrew Bates after he accused Republican lawmakers of having a misguided focus in his opening remarks during the panel's autopen probe.

Bates, the latest former White House official to be interviewed by House investigators, affirmed ex-President Joe Biden's leadership while criticizing his successor in an opening statement obtained by Fox News Digital via a source familiar.

An Oversight Committee spokesperson said in response, "Andrew Bates was part of the Biden cognitive decline cover-up and he's delusional."

"His so-called opening statement — leaked in the middle of his transcribed interview and not even read at the time it was leaked — peddled the same fantasy he's been trying to sell the American people. The public has rejected Bates' spin and witnessed President Biden's decline with their own eyes," the spokesperson said. 

"And just this week, new records revealed that President Biden neither approved — nor may have even been consulted on — thousands of pardons. This is a historic scandal with massive repercussions."

Bates said in the opening statement provided to Fox News Digital, "I was proud to support Joe Biden as President because we believe in the same values. In the White House, it was universally understood that Joe Biden was in charge. That is completely consistent with my personal experience with the President."

"Now someone else with a very different character is in charge," the statement said.

Bates accused Oversight Committee Republicans of "spending taxpayer dollars investigating Joe Biden — an honorable man under whom the economy performed far better than it is today — while turning a blind eye to corruption under Donald Trump."

He went on to rip President Donald Trump's tariffs, accuse him of "illegally trying to take over the Federal Reserve," and criticize the president's personal investments in cryptocurrency and acceptance of a jet from Qatar to be used for official business, among other items.

"To my knowledge, none of the above are being investigated. As a taxpayer and private citizen, I feel that is wrong," Bates said, according to the written comments.

House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., has been investigating whether Biden's senior aides covered up signs of mental decline in the former president, and whether any executive decisions were signed off on via autopen without the then-leader's full awareness.

They're looking in particular at the litany of clemency orders that Biden signed in the latter half of his term, though Biden allies have dismissed the probe as politically motivated.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Thousands of newborn stars sparkle and dazzle in the latest snapshot by NASA's Webb Space Telescope.

Released this week, the picture provides a breathtaking view of a nearby star-birthing center, 5,500 light-years away. A single light-year is 5.8 trillion miles.

Besides baby stars in a variety of sizes and colors, the photo reveals a dramatic cloud of star-forming dust and gas. This cloud — the so-called Lobster Nebula — is so massive that it spills beyond the camera lens. The cluster of infant stars, named Pismis 24, is located deep inside.

Launched in 2021, Webb is the largest and most powerful telescope ever sent into space. It views the universe in the infrared, spending more than five hours to capture this one shot.

In the first half of 2025, she racked up over 55 million views on TikTok and 4 million likes, mostly from tweens glued to their cellphones. Not bad for an AI-generated cartoon ballerina with a cappuccino teacup for a head.

Her name is Ballerina Cappuccina. Her smiling, girlish face is accompanied by a deep, computer-generated male voice singing in Italian — or, at least, some Italian. The rest is gibberish.

She is one of the most prominent characters in the internet phenomenon known as “Italian Brain Rot,” a series of memes that exploded in popularity this year, consisting of unrealistic AI-generated animal-object hybrids with absurdist, pseudo-Italian narration.

The trend has baffled parents, to the delight of young people experiencing the thrill of a new, fleeting cultural signifier that is illegible to older generations.

Experts and fans alike say the trend is worth paying attention to, and tells us something about the youngest generation of tweens.

The first Italian brain-rot character was Tralalero Tralala, a shark with blue Nike sneakers on his elongated fins. Early Tralalero Tralala videos were scored with a curse-laden Italian song that sounds like a crude nursery rhyme.

Other characters soon emerged: Bombardiro Crocodilo, a crocodile-headed military airplane; Lirilì Larilà, an elephant with a cactus body and slippers; and Armadillo Crocodillo, an armadillo inside a coconut, to name a few.

Content creators around the world have created entire storylines told through intentionally ridiculous songs. These videos have proven so popular that they have launched catchphrases that have entered mainstream culture for Generation Alpha, which describes anyone born between 2010 and 2025.

Fabian Mosele, 26, calls themselves an “Italian brain rot connoisseur.” An Italian animator who lives in Germany and works with AI by trade, Mosele created their first Italian brain-rot content in March. Shortly after, Mosele's video of Italian brain-rot characters at an underground rave garnered about a million views overnight, they said. It has since topped 70 million. 

Even as the hysteria over the absurdist subgenre has slowed, Mosele said the characters have transcended the digital realm and become an indelible part of pop culture. 

“It feels so ephemeral,” Mosele said, “but it also feels so real.”

This summer, one of the most popular games on Roblox, the free online platform that has approximately 111 million monthly users, was called “Steal a Brainrot.” The goal of the game, as the title would suggest, is to steal brain rot characters from other players. More popular characters, like Tralalero Tralala, are worth more in-game money.

Sometimes, the games' administrators — who are also players — cheat to steal the characters, a move called “admin abuse” that sent many kids and teens into a frenzy. One video of a young child hysterically crying over a stolen character has 46.8 million views on TikTok. 

In the non-virtual world, some have made physical toy replicas of the characters, while others have created real-life plays featuring them.

The nonsensical songs have at times gestured to real-world issues: One clip of Bombardiro Crocodilo sparked outrage for seemingly mocking the war in Gaza. 

But ultimately, the majority of videos are silly and absurd. 

Mosele said Italian brain-rot consumers largely don't care about how the images relate to what is being said or sung. They often don't even care to translate the nonsensical Italian to English.

“It's funny because it's nonsense,” Mosele said.

“Seeing something so dark, in a way, and out of the ordinary, that breaks all the norms of what we would expect to see on TV — that's just super appealing.”

Italian brain rot didn't go viral in a vacuum. “Brain rot,” the 2024 Oxford University Press word of the year, is defined as the numbing of an intellectual state resulting from the “overconsumption of trivial or unchallenging material.”

It can also be used to describe the brain-rotting content itself. 

Lots of content falls into that category. Consider videos of the game “Subway Surfer” split-screened next to full episodes of television shows, or “Skibidi Toilet,” an animated series featuring toilets with human heads popping out of their bowls. 

Those not chronically online might instinctively recoil at the term brain rot, with its vaguely gory connotations, especially as concern about the potential harms of social media for adolescents mounts. 

When brain rot was crowned word of the year, Oxford Languages President Casper Grathwohl said the term speaks to “one of the perceived dangers of virtual life, and how we are using our free time.” 

Emilie Owens, 33, a children's media researcher, agreed that endless scrolling poses dangers for young people. But she said that the concern about brain rot is misguided.

It's normal to “view the thing the newest generation is doing with fear and suspicion,” she said, pointing to how past generations have had similar concerns about the detrimental effects of comic books, television and even novels at one time.

Concerns about brain rot — that it is unproductive and pointless — actually reveal a great deal about their appeal, Owens said. Brain rot is an acute rejection of the intense pressures on young people to self-optimize. 

“It's very normal for everyone to need to switch their brains off now and again,” she said.

NEW YORK (AP) — George Saunders' path from obscurity to acclaim began some 30 years ago, not long after he finished a novel his wife could hardly stand. 

“I used to think the job of serious fiction was to be completely impossible to understand,” he explained during a telephone interview. “But one day I just started to work on these Seussian poems, just to have fun with them. I showed them to my wife, and she thought they were very funny, and she said to me it was about time that anybody got enjoyment out of my work.”

“I grew up on TV and ‘Jaws' and Dick Cavett,” he said. “I valued entertainment and I once thought maybe it didn't belong in literature. And then I thought, of course it does.”

One of the world's most highly regarded authors, Saunders has now been welcomed into an elevated — and most dignified — pantheon. The National Book Foundation announced Friday that it has named him this year's winner of a National Book Award for Distinguished Contributions to American Letters, a lifetime achievement medal given to Toni Morrison,Robert Caro and Edmund White among others. The $10,000 prize is awarded to “a person who has enriched our literary heritage over a life of service, or a corpus of work.”

Saunders is the author of more than a dozen books and is the rare short story writer who has earned the adjective “bestselling,” notably for the collection “Tenth of December,” a National Book Award finalist in 2013. He has also become a genre unto himself — his name synonymous with twisted humor; poignant, unpredictable narratives and acute social commentary. Ruth Dickey, the foundation's executive director, said in a statement that Saunders had forged an “extraordinary” legacy.

“Through immersive world-building, deeply human characters, and compassionate curiosity towards the most pressing sociopolitical issues of our time, George Saunders' writing exemplifies the power of fiction to unite us despite — and perhaps because of — our fractured and complex world,” Dickey said.

At age 66, he is the youngest recipient since Judy Blume in 2004 and his mindset is more in line with a mid-career author in transition than an eminence looking back. While he established his name as a short story writer, he more recently began forging a career as a novelist. His first published novel, “Lincoln in the Bardo,” is a surreal, polyphonic meditation on the late president that won the Booker Prize in 2017, a rare honor for an American author. Early next year, he will publish “Vigil,” in which an oil company CEO confronts his final moments on Earth. 

“A tank. His wife had once called him that,” Saunders writes in his new novel. “He rolled right over what life had put in front of him. He'd worked his way up. Step by step. To the top. Very top. CEO. About as a high guy could go. If he did say so himself.”

New Yorker fiction editor Deborah Treisman will present Saunders his medal during a Nov. 19 ceremony in Manhattan, when winners in five competitive categories will be announced and author-editor-publisher Roxane Gay will receive the Literarian Award for Outstanding Service to the American Literary Community. Treisman and Saunders have worked together for decades, in what Treisman described in a recent email as “a truly intuitive and ego-less collaboration.”

“I think the uniqueness of George's work comes from his ability to combine humor, sometimes quite pointed and dark humor, with a deep-seated faith in humanity,” she wrote. “His work can be satirical without being mean; hilarious but also heartbreaking. It's hard to say what American letters would be like without him because he's such a one-off. If he didn't exist, we wouldn't have known or imagined what we were missing!”

With influences ranging from Chekhov to Groucho Marx, Saunders describes his background as “off-kilter.” Born in Amarillo, Texas, in 1958 and raised in Oak Forest, Illinois, he doesn't remember himself as a prolific reader in childhood and didn't attend a liberal arts college; he majored in geophysical engineering at the Colorado School of Mines.

But even in high school, thanks in part to a “wonderful” American literature teacher, he was thinking of becoming a writer, whether or not he wanted a degree to go with it. Saunders read for pleasure in college and beyond, supporting himself as a door attendant, a roofer and a slaughterhouse knuckle-puller among other jobs. In 1988, he received an MFA from the creative writing program at Syracuse University, where he met his future wife, Paula Redick, a fellow student at the time. He has been on the Syracuse faculty since 1997.

Once he had tapped into his inner laughter, his work soon caught on. His first story collection, CivilWarLand in Bad Decline,” was a PEN/Hemingway finalist for best debut fiction and four of his stories won National Magazine Awards. In her statement Friday, Dickey also noted Saunders' “genuine enthusiasm” for the process of writing, citing his book on the pleasures of studying Russian literature, “A Swim In a Pond in the Rain,” and his Substack Story Club. 

He is, at least, unofficially, a “genius,” a 2006 recipient of a MacArthur Foundation “genius” grant. Saunders is also, unofficially, a proponent of something not known to align with genius — being a nice person. In 2013, he gave a widely shared convocation address at Syracuse, urging the audience to try and be kinder, to “err in the direction of kindness.” Books may be a solitary pastime, but he also believes they can guide us as social beings.

“I never understood literature as anything but that thing to help us live better, something that allows me to cut to the chase,” he told the AP. “Communication and kindness — this radical idea that other people are as real as we are.”

            The Lebanese government welcomed a plan presented by the army on Friday to disarm Hezbollah, the country's most formidable military force, in an unprecedented move that risks sparking internal conflict.
    


            The army will start implementing the terms of the deal, but may have limited capabilities, according to Lebanon's information minister, Paul Morcos.
    


            The government did not provide a timeline for the plan to take effect, but Prime Minister Nawaf Salam said the army's leadership will submit a monthly report to the cabinet on its progress.
    


            The government, which is under intense American and regional pressure to disarm the powerful Iran-backed militia, had asked the army to present its plan by early August, despite a rejection by Hezbollah and its allies.
    


            At a cabinet meeting on Friday, five ministers from Hezbollah and its allied Amal party withdrew as the government began discussing the plan, according to Lebanon's official National News Agency.
    


            The Lebanese army's plan is an unprecedented effort to disarm Iran's most powerful regional proxy and one of the biggest non-state threats to Israel. Despite being significantly weakened by Israel over the past two years, Hezbollah remains Lebanon's most powerful armed group and has a large support base among the country's large Shiite community. Observers warn that any attempt to disarm it by force risks plunging the country into civil conflict.
    


            While the details of the Lebanese army's plan remain unclear, the government has previously said that all weapons belonging to militias must be under the state's control by the year's end.
    


            “This is a very, very pivotal moment,” a senior Lebanese official told CNN on Friday, before the plan was presented. “The aim is for the handover (of weapons) to be at the end of the year, or started at least by the end of the year.”
    


            Morcos said the government welcomed the military's plan to control weapons but decided to keep the details confidential.
    


            Aside from being a militant group, Hezbollah also functions as a political party that has lawmakers in the legislature and a social services arm that serves many of its constituents, primarily in the south of the country. Some opponents of Hezbollah have insisted that it disband its armed wing and function solely as a political party.
    


            After Lebanon's civil war ended in 1990, Hezbollah expanded its influence across politics and society by remaining armed – unlike other militias, it was exempted from disarmament under the Taif Agreement due to its role in resisting Israeli occupation.
    


            Lebanon was devastated by a year-long conflict between Hezbollah and Israel, triggered by the militia's backing of Hamas after the Palestinian militants attacked Israel on October 7, 2023. Israeli strikes severely weakened Hezbollah – culminating in the assassination of its revered leader, Hassan Nasrallah – and significantly curtailed the group's domestic clout.
    


            A US-mediated ceasefire last year was meant to halt Israel's attacks on Lebanon, but near daily strikes by Israel and its occupation of five positions in southern Lebanon have hardened Hezbollah's refusal to disarm – raising the prospect of a clash with the army if it moves to disband the group.
    


            Lebanon's government, led by Salam, a former head of International Court of Justice, has been accused by Hezbollah supporters of treason for conceding to US demands to disarm the group while Israeli forces remain present in Lebanese territory remain. But opponents of Hezbollah blame the group for dragging the nation into war with Israel and have criticized its leadership for failing to deliver on promises to protect the country.
    


            US envoys Tom Barrack and Morgan Ortagus, appointed by President Donald Trump, have capitalized on Hezbollah's weakened state to launch shuttle diplomacy aimed at negotiating frameworks between Lebanon and Israel, centered around Hezbollah's disarmament and Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon. They appear to be aware of the risks involved.
    


            “LAF (Lebanese Armed Forces) and the government will be coming back with a plan saying ‘our proposal to Hezbollah is how to disarm them,' which is not necessarily militarily – they're not talking about going to war, they're talking about how to convince Hezbollah to give up those arms,” Barrack told journalists during a visit to Beirut last month.
    


            Barrack said at the time that the army's plan is part of an 11-step process pledged to be completed by the Lebanese government.
    


            US and Lebanese officials have offered few details about how they envision convincing Hezbollah to disarm voluntarily.
    


            The senior Lebanese official warned that continued Israeli strikes on Lebanon are hindering government efforts to disarm the group.
    


            “So long as Israel maintains military positions inside Lebanese territory and bombs the entire border area until all homes, fields, crops and any form of life are destroyed, Hezbollah will continue to say that their weapons are to defend themselves and the country,” the official said. “It's important for them (Israel) to get out of here.”
    


            Israeli officials have previously said that troops in Lebanon would remain there “indefinitely,” but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last week that the military would begin a phased withdrawal from Lebanon if the Lebanese army disarms Hezbollah.

Fox News national correspondent Griff Jenkins reports on the Justice Department's first task force meeting on alleged anti-Christian bias on 'Special Report.'

EXCLUSIVE: The Biden administration "weaponized the full weight of the federal government against Christians," according to Trump leadership, laying out in a new report the "numerous instances" of past anti-Christian bias and recommendations to protect faith in America.

Fox News Digital exclusively obtained the report published by the Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias, created by President Donald Trump and chaired by Attorney General Pam Bondi.

TRUMP ANNOUNCES EXECUTIVE ORDER CREATING TASK FORCE TO 'ERADICATE ANTI-CHRISTIAN BIAS'

The task force had a clear mandate to ensure that "any unlawful and improper conduct, policies, or practices that target Christians are identified, terminated, and rectified."

The task force was directed to deliver an initial assessment, which Fox News Digital exclusively obtained Friday. The report provides an overview of "the damage that can be done when religious liberty is not protected and preserved for all Americans."

"The Task Force makes this commitment: the federal government will never again be permitted to turn its power against people of faith," the report states. "Under President Trump and Attorney General Bondi's leadership, in partnership with all members of this Task Force, the rule of law will be enforced with vigor, and every religion will be treated with equality in both policy and action."

The report added: "The days of anti-Christian bias in the federal government are over. Faith is not a liability in America—it is a liberty."

After a preliminary review of federal agencies and departments, the task force uncovered "numerous instances of anti-Christian bias during the Biden administration."

"Joe Biden weaponized the full weight of the federal government against Christians and trampled on their fundamental First Amendment rights," White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Fox News Digital. "Unlike Joe Biden, President Trump is protecting Christians, not punishing them."

The Task Force found that the Department of Defense, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Department of Labor all "deprioritized, mishandled, or denied requests for religious exemptions to the Biden administration's COVID-19 mandate."

The Task Force also found that at the Department of Education the Biden administration "attempted to impose record-breaking fines on some of the nation's largest Christian universities, including Liberty University ($14 million) and Grand Canyon University ($37.7 million)."

At the Department of Homeland Security, the task force found that Customs and Border Protection omitted Christian perspectives from a directive for detainees but deliberately noted accommodations for Islam, Rastafarianism and sects of Judaism.

At the Justice Department, the task force found that the Biden administration lacked an effort to "address and prosecute violations of the law where anti-Christian bias was demonstrated by the persecutors."

"Instead, during that time, the DOJ pursued novel theories of prosecution against those speaking or demonstrating based upon their Christian faith," the report states.

The task force also found that the Department of Justice, under the Biden administration, arrested and convicted approximately two dozen individuals under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act for praying and demonstrating outside abortion facilities.

"Yet, the same DOJ refused to apply the FACE Act to protect places of worship and crisis pregnancy centers," the report states.

At the FBI, the task force pointed to the bureau's memo asserting that "radical-traditionalist" Catholics were "domestic terrorism threats."

At the Treasury Department, the task force pointed to the many "pro-Christian groups" that have been "debanked."

TRUMP SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER ESTABLISHING WHITE HOUSE FAITH OFFICE

The task force found that, under the Biden administration, the Department of State provided "limited humanitarian relief to Christians relative to other populations and offered muted responses to attacks on Christians compared to other groups."

Also at the State Department, the task force said it discovered evidence that "preferential employment practices were afforded" for those of non-Christian religions, while Christian employees "were disfavored."

"It was particularly concerning that employees were less likely to be permitted leave for observation of certain Christian holidays as opposed to non-Christian ones."

Officials also said the State Department imposed "radical LGBTQ gender ideology on foreign governments and State employees, including the forced usage of preferred pronouns and rainbow flags, violating the sincerely held religious beliefs of many Christians and other Americans of faith."

The task force also found that the Department of Labor dismantled its office of faith-based initiatives and replaced it with a diversity, equity and inclusion office.

INSIDE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S WHITE HOUSE FAITH OFFICE

The task force also said that the Department of Housing and Urban Development "discriminated against Christian perspectives in its marketing, treating social media posts celebrating Christian holidays, such as Palm Sunday, Good Friday, and Easter, differently than posts celebrating other religious or interest group holidays, including Pride Month, Ramadan, and Diwali." 

Officials said Housing and Urban Development took down the Christian posts and left up the others.

The task force held its first meeting in April. Prior to the meeting, members of the task force conducted initial reviews of their respective agencies to identify any unlawful anti-Christian policies, practices or agency conduct during the Biden administration.

Officials said that the task force is not finished with its inquiry, but merely just beginning, and will continue its work to investigate the full scope of anti-Christian bias that "pervaded the federal government during the Biden administration."

A final report is expected by February 2026.

Trump also signed an executive order establishing a White House Faith Office in February. 

The office empowers faith-based entities, community organizations and houses of worship "to better serve families and communities," according to the White House.

The office is housed under the Domestic Policy Council and consults with experts in the faith community on policy changes to "better align with American values." A former Biden White House official did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro discusses the Trump administration's crackdown on drug cartels and the success of a major anti-narcotics operation on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.'

Amid President Donald Trump's crime crackdown in the nation's capital, Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia criticized U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro's office, according to The Associated Press.

"It's not fair to say they're losing credibility. We're past that now," Faruqui claimed, according to the outlet, which indicated that he later asserted, "There's no credibility left."

Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, slammed Faruqui on social media.

GRAND JURIES IN WASHINGTON, DC DECLINE TO INDICT TWO ACCUSED OF THREATENING TO KILL TRUMP

"He has repeatedly indicated his allegiance to those who violate the law and carry illegal guns, justifying the possession of these guns and constantly pushing for the release of these dangerous criminals back into our communities," Pirro declared in part of a post on X.

"This judge took an oath to follow the law, yet he has allowed his politics to consistently cloud his judgment and his requirement to follow the law. America voted for safe communities, law and order, and this judge is the antithesis of that," she asserted in another portion of the post.

The AP reported that Faruqui excoriated Pirro's office amid a hearing at which he agreed to dismiss a federal case against Edward Alexander Dana, an individual accused of threatening to kill the president.

An affidavit to support a criminal complaint alleged that Dana was arrested after "damaging a light fixture by pulling it off the exterior wall of the restaurant."

 "I'm not going to tolerate fascism. You see, I was adopted [inaudible] to protect the Constitution by any means necessary. And that means killing you, officer, killing the President, killing anyone who stands in the way of our Constitution… You want to stand in the way of our Constitution, I will f[---]ing kill you," Dana said, according to the document.

Because a grand jury did not indict, multiple misdemeanor charges have instead been lodged against Dana in D.C. Superior Court.

"Instead of the outrage that should be engendered by a threat to kill the President of the United States, the grand jury refused to indict. Our duty as prosecutors is clear: to enforce the law," Pirro said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital.

"When a grand jury does not indict, that does not end our responsibility. We will pursue justice through Superior Court, as we did here—where the defendant now faces four criminal charges," she noted.

Former CIA station chief Dan Hoffman discusses President Donald Trump speaking with Volodomyr Zelenskyy after Vladimir Putin met Xi Jingping and Kim Jong Un in China.

Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Friday that Western military personnel deployed to Ukraine would become "legitimate targets for defeat," raising fresh threats against the idea of international peacekeepers once a ceasefire is reached.

"This is one of the root causes (of the war): trying to involve Ukraine in NATO," Putin said, speaking at an economic forum in Russia's Far East. "So if any troops appear there, especially during the ongoing hostilities, we assume they will be legitimate targets for defeat."

His remarks came a day after European and Allied nations signaled support for a coordinated postwar mission. At a gathering in Paris, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that 26 countries had committed to security guarantees for Kyiv, pledges that could involve military contributions "in the sky, in the sea and on the ground." French President Emmanuel Macron described the commitments as potential deployments "by land, sea or air" once hostilities have ceased.

Putin countered that if Moscow and Kyiv are able to finalize a political settlement, foreign soldiers would only complicate matters. "If decisions are reached that lead to long-term peace, then I simply see no reason for their presence on Ukrainian territory," he said. "Because if such agreements are reached, let no one doubt that Russia will fully implement them."

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov echoed the Russian leader's long-standing grievances with NATO, casting Western guarantees for Ukraine as equivalent to pushing the alliance eastward.

"What was one of the root causes of this conflict? It was when the foundations of security guarantees for our country began to be eroded, when Ukraine was being drawn into NATO, and when NATO's military infrastructure began moving toward our borders," Peskov said, according to Russian state media. He added that any settlement would require guarantees "to both us and the Ukrainians."

The Kremlin's statements followed a week of high-profile diplomacy for Putin, who traveled to Beijing to appear alongside Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. From China, Putin revealed that U.S. President Donald Trump had asked him to engage directly with Zelenskyy about ending the war.

"Donald asked me if it was possible to hold such a meeting. I said yes, it is possible. In the end, if Zelensky is ready, let him come to Moscow. Such a meeting will take place," Putin said. He later promised to ensure security for the Ukrainian leader in the Russian capital.

Zelenskyy publicly dismissed the offer, arguing that Moscow was once again trying to delay serious negotiations. "Our American partners told me that Putin had invited me to Moscow. In my opinion, if someone wants the meeting to not take place, they should invite me to Moscow," Zelenskyy said Thursday.

Ukraine's foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, insisted Kyiv is ready for direct talks but only on neutral ground. "Right now, at least seven countries are ready to host a meeting between the leaders of Ukraine and Russia to bring an end to the war — Austria, the Holy See, Switzerland, Türkiye, and three Gulf states," he wrote on social media.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Over a recent two-year period, the Pentagon funded hundreds of projects done in collaboration with universities in China and institutes linked to that nation's defense industry, including many blacklisted by the U.S. government for working with the Chinese military, a congressional investigation has found. 

The report, released Friday by House Republicans on the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, argues the projects have allowed China to exploit U.S. research partnerships for military gains while the two countries are locked in a tech and arms rivalry.

“American taxpayer dollars should be used to defend the nation — not strengthen its foremost strategic competitor,” Republicans wrote in the report.

“Failing to safeguard American research from hostile foreign exploitation will continue to erode U.S. technological dominance and place our national defense capabilities at risk,” it said.

The Pentagon and didn't immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment.

The congressional report said some officials at the Defense Department argued research should remain open as long as it is “neither controlled nor classified.”

The report makes several recommendations to scale back U.S. research collaboration with China. It also backs new legislation proposed by the committee's chairman, Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Michigan. The bill would prohibit any Defense Department funding from going to projects done in collaboration with researchers affiliated with Chinese entities that the U.S. government identifies as safety risks.

Beijing has in the past said science and technological cooperation between the two countries is mutually beneficial and helps them cope with global challenges. The Chinese Embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. 

The 80-page report builds on the committee's findings last year that partnerships between U.S. and Chinese universities over the past decade allowed hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to help Beijing develop critical technology. Amid pressure from Republicans, several U.S. universities have ended their joint programs with Chinese schools in recent years.

The new report focuses more narrowly on the Defense Department and its billions of dollars in annual research funding.

The committee's investigation identified 1,400 research papers published between June 2023 and June 2025 that acknowledged support from the Pentagon and were done in collaboration with Chinese partners. The publications were funded by some 700 defense grants worth more than $2.5 billion. Of the 1,400 publications, more than half involved organizations affiliated with China's defense research and industrial base.

Dozens of those organizations were flagged for potential security concerns on U.S. government lists, though federal law does not prohibit research collaborations with them. The Defense Department money supported research in fields including hypersonic technology, semiconductors, artificial intelligence, advanced materials and next-generation propulsion.

Many of the projects have clear military applications, according to the report.

In one case, a nuclear scientist at Carnegie Science, a research institution in Washington, worked extensively on Pentagon-backed research while holding appointments at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Hefei Institute of Physical Sciences.

The scientist, who has done research on high-energy materials, nitrogen and high-pressure physics — all of which are relevant to nuclear weapons development — has been honored in China for his work to advance the country's national development goals, the report said. It called the case “a deeply troubling example” of how Beijing can leverage U.S. taxpayer-funded research to further its weapons development. 

In another Pentagon-backed project, Arizona State University and the University of Texas partnered with researchers from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Beihang University to study high-stakes decision-making in uncertain environments, which has direct applications for electronic warfare and cyber defense, the report said. The money came from the Office of Naval Research, the Army Research Office and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

The Shanghai university is under the supervision of a central Chinese agency tasked with developing defense technology, and Beihang University, in the capital city of Beijing, is linked to the People's Liberation Army and known for its aerospace programs.

The report takes issue with Defense Department policies that do not explicitly forbid research partnerships with foreign institutions that appear on U.S. government blacklists. 

It makes more than a dozen recommendations, including a prohibition on any Pentagon research collaboration with entities that are on U.S. blacklists or “known to be part of China's defense research and industrial base.”

Moolenaar's legislation includes a similar provision and proposes a ban on Defense Department funding for U.S. universities that operate joint institutes with Chinese universities.

A senior Education Department official said the report “highlights the vulnerability of federally funded research to foreign infiltration on America's campuses.” Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said the findings reinforce the need for more transparency around U.S. universities' international ties, along with a “whole-of-government approach to safeguard against the malign influence of hostile foreign actors.”

House investigators said they are not seeking to end all academic and research collaborations with China but those with connections to the Chinese military and its research and industrial base.

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Associated Press reporting into an Israeli attack on a Gaza Strip hospital that killed 22 people, including five journalists, raises serious questions about Israel's rationale for the strikes and the way they were carried out. Among those killed was Mariam Dagga, who worked for AP and other news organizations.

Israeli forces struck a position well known as a journalists' gathering point, because — a military official said — they believed a camera on the roof was being used by Hamas to observe troops. The official cited “suspicious behavior” and unspecified intelligence, but the only detail given was that there was a towel on the camera and the person with it — which the army interpreted as an effort to avoid identification.

AP has gathered new evidence indicating the camera in question actually belonged to a Reuters video journalist who routinely covered his equipment with a white cloth to protect it from the scorching sun and dust. The journalist, Hussam al-Masri, was killed in the initial strike.

The evidence calls into question why Israeli forces went through with the strike. Witnesses say Israel frequently observed the position by drone, including about 40 minutes before the attack, giving an opportunity to correctly identify al-Masri.

AP's findings also reveal other troubling decisions from the Aug. 25 attack:

— Soon after the first strike, Israeli forces hit the same position again, after medical and emergency workers had reached the scene to treat the injured, and as journalists including Dagga had rushed to cover the news. The strike has raised accusations of a “double tap” — a type of attack intended to kill those responding to casualties and which experts in international law say is a possible war crime.




— Troops used high-explosive tank shells to strike a hospital, instead of more precise guided weapons that might have resulted in fewer casualties.

— In all, Israel struck the hospital four times, the AP found, each time without warning.

The Israeli military refused to comment when asked if it hit the wrong person and has presented no evidence for their claims. It says it is still investigating but in their initial inquiry described “gaps” in how the attack was carried out. Israel has said none of the journalists killed were intended targets, nor were they linked to Hamas.

Israeli fire has killed 189 Palestinian reporters in Gaza, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Israel has barred foreign journalists from entering Gaza since the war erupted in October 2023, giving Palestinian journalists a critical role in covering the conflict.

The AP's analysis is based on information from current and former Israeli military officials, other officials and weapons analysts — and accounts from nearly 20 people who were in or near the hospital at the time of the strikes.

The attack has galvanized global anger as Israeli forces push ahead with a major offensive in famine-stricken Gaza City, exposing its population to even greater danger from Israeli bombardment and military operations. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it a “tragic mishap″ but stopped short of apologizing.



Before the attack, the Reuters journalist, al-Masri, was positioned with his video camera high up on an external stairwell of Nasser Hospital. A photograph taken by Dagga in mid-August shows al-Masri on the same stairwell next to his camera, with a white cloth draped over it.

In the weeks before the strikes, al-Masri had broadcast live almost daily from the stairwell, according to other journalists who worked there and hospital officials. Five journalists told the AP that he often used the cloth. It is common practice for video journalists around the world, including in Gaza, to use such high positions and to cover their cameras to protect them from the elements.

Nasser Hospital, one of the few functioning hospitals in Gaza, has been a vital location for Palestinian reporters. 

It is a central point for reporting on dead and wounded from Israeli strikes, shootings of Palestinians seeking aid and on malnourished people brought in daily. The Wi-Fi signal offered a rare reliable link to transmit news.

Photographers and videographers used the building's external staircase for months to get a bird's-eye view of the city of Khan Younis — and in the case of global news agencies like Reuters and AP, to supply live video footage to newsrooms around the world. The AP had repeatedly informed the army that its journalists were stationed there. 

An Israeli military official said that several days before the attack, Israeli forces spotted a camera on the roof and were tracking “suspicious behavior,” which he did not specify.

The official said the military believed Hamas was using the camera to monitor its forces and said the camera and the man operating it had what they described as a towel draped over them, suggesting an effort at concealment. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.

A second person was killed in the strike that hit al-Masri. Hospital officials have identified all 22 dead, saying they were a mix of health and rescue workers, journalists, and relatives of patients. But they said they could not be certain which of them was the other person killed in the first strike, since all the bodies were collected at the same time. 

There has been no evidence of a second camera at the site where al-Masri was killed. 

At about the same time as the first stairway was hit, Israel struck another part of the hospital, according to witnesses and video footage showing smoke rising from the location. 

Israel has struck hospitals and journalists on repeated occasions throughout the war. Both are supposed to be protected under international law, but hospitals can lose those protections if they are used for military purposes and journalists can, too, if they are armed or take part in hostilities.

Israel has accused Hamas of operating in or around hospitals but has provided limited evidence. During the war, Hamas security men have often been seen inside hospitals, blocking access to some areas of the facilities. 

Based on analysis of the footage at the time of the attack, and speaking to multiple eyewitnesses, there is no evidence that anyone killed in the strikes was armed. 





The Israeli military has given no explanation why it carried out a second round of strikes.

After the first attack, a crowd of medics, journalists and others made their way up the staircase. Ibrahim Qannan, a correspondent with Cairo-based Al-Ghad TV who was filming from below, said another journalist, Moaz Abu Taha, waved to to him and shouted down to him, “Hussam was martyred.” 

Within 10 minutes, two more loud blasts struck the staircase. Video analysis revealed the flashes of two projectiles and the booms of two explosions. Among those killed was Dagga, who had just snapped her last photos before heading up the stairs, and Abu Taha.

Dagga's brother Sediq had spent the previous night with her and saw her filming from the stairs moments before she was killed. “I rushed upstairs and recovered her body,” he said.

Double-tap strikes, which hit crowds that move into areas to rescue victims from initial strikes, have notoriously been used by al-Qaida and other extremist groups, as well as Russia's military and forces loyal to former Syrian President Bashar Assad. First responders and other civilians are often harmed in such attacks.

Experts in international law say multiple aspects of this attack could point to potential war crimes, including targeting a hospital without warning, and the double-tap strategy that puts civilians in danger.

Israel Ziv, a retired general who once led the Israeli army's operations directorate, said a double-tap strike would violate the army's rules of engagement.

Raed al-Nims, head of the Palestinian Red Crescent's media department in Gaza, said double tap strikes have “happened multiple times” in the war, hitting the group's ambulances and personnel after the arrive at the scene of attacks.

Israel declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation.

AP analyzed videos of the attack and found that Israel fired tank shells in the strikes — which the Israeli military confirmed following their initial inquiry.

Ziv said less deadly and more precise options than tank fire were available.

“There is no good explanation for that,” he said.

An official with knowledge of the attack said the tank wasn't supposed to have been used, but was unable to say what the original plans were. The official spoke to AP on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation.

A munitions expert who analyzed photos of shrapnel from the hospital obtained by AP said it came from high-explosive shells fired by a tank.

The remnants show parts of at least three fin-stabilized tank gun projectiles, consistent with those used by Israel, said N.R. Jenzen-Jones, director of Armament Research Services, an Australian consulting firm.

Satellite imagery from the afternoon of the day of the strike shows Israeli tanks and armored vehicles operating about 4.5 kilometers (3 miles) northeast of the hospital.

The same brigade that carried out these strikes, the Golani Brigade, was involved in the March shooting of an ambulance convoy in southern Gaza that killed 15 Palestinian medics. An initial investigation of that attack by Israeli forces found a chain of “professional failures” and a deputy commander was fired.

A day after the strikes, Israel gave the names of six men who it said were militants killed in the attack. But this statement also raised troubling discrepancies.

It provided no evidence, and one man on its list, Omar Kamel Shahada Abu Teim, does not appear on the hospital's list of casualties obtained by the AP. Doctors and morgue workers said no one by that name was killed, and unlike with the other five, Israel did not provide a picture.

Another person named, Jumaa al-Najjar, was a health care worker employed by Nasser Hospital, according to the morgue list. Another, Imad al-Shaer, was a driver for Gaza's Civil Defense first responders.

The other three names appear on the casualty list, but no other details about them were immediately available.

Israel also did not say if any of the six were killed in its initial strike on the camera. Most were killed in the second round of strikes, and officials have not said whether they were identified among the crowd on the stairwell before troops struck it.

The Health Ministry and the Civil Defense are part of the Hamas-run government. Israel has in the past claimed that some emergency responders were militants. That was the case in the March attack that killed 15 medics.

A joint letter from the AP and Reuters expressed outrage at the strikes and demanded answers.

“Unfortunately, we have found the (Israeli military's) willingness and ability to investigate itself in past incidents to rarely result in clarity and action, raising serious questions including whether Israel is deliberately targeting live feeds in order to suppress information,” they said.

In the past, Israel has acknowledged targeting and killing journalists it accuses of being militants, allegations denied by them and their employers. The military says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas.

Jody Ginsberg, the CEO of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said journalists are civilians and must never be targeted in a war. “To do so is a war crime,” she said.

Scientists searching for fresh water have tapped massive reservoirs hiding in the last place on Earth people look for drinking water – under the sea off Cape Cod. (AP Video shot and produced by Rodrique Ngowi.)

ABOARD LIFTBOAT ROBERT, North Atlantic (AP) — Deep in Earth's past, an icy landscape became a seascape as the ice melted and the oceans rose off what is now the northeastern United States. Nearly 50 years ago, a U.S. government ship searching for minerals and hydrocarbons in the area drilled into the seafloor to see what it could find.

It found, of all things, drops to drink under the briny deeps — fresh water.

This summer, a first-of-its-kind global research expedition followed up on that surprise. Drilling for fresh water under the salt water off Cape Cod, Expedition 501 extracted thousands of samples from what is now thought to be a massive, hidden aquifer stretching from New Jersey as far north as Maine.

It's just one of many depositories of “secret fresh water” known to exist in shallow salt waters around the world that might some day be tapped to slake the planet's intensifying thirst, said Brandon Dugan, the expedition's co-chief scientist.

“We need to look for every possibility we have to find more water for society,” Dugan, a geophysicist and hydrologist at the Colorado School of Mines, told Associated Press journalists who recently spent 12 hours on the drilling platform. The research teams looked in “one of the last places you would probably look for fresh water on Earth.” 

They found it, and will be analyzing nearly 50,000 liters (13,209 gallons) of it back in their labs around the world in the coming months. They're out to solve the mystery of its origins — whether the water is from glaciers, connected groundwater systems on land or some combination.

The potential is enormous. So are the hurdles of getting the water out and puzzling over who owns it, who uses it and how to extract it without undue harm to nature. It's bound to take years to bring that water ashore for public use in a big way, if it's even feasible.

Why try? In just five years, the U.N. says, the global demand for fresh water will exceed supplies by 40%. Rising sea levels from the warming climate are souring coastal freshwater sources while data centers that power AI and cloud computing are consuming water at an insatiable rate.

The fabled Ancient Mariner's lament, “Water, water, every where, nor any drop to drink,” looms as a warning to landlubbers as well as to sailors on salty seas.

In Virginia alone, a quarter of all power produced in the state goes to data centers, a share expected to nearly double in five years. By some estimates, each midsize data center consumes as much water as 1,000 households. Each of the Great Lakes states has experienced groundwater shortages.

Cape Town, South Africa, came perilously close to running out of fresh water for its nearly 5 million people in 2018 during an epic, three-year drought. South Africa is thought to have a coastal undersea freshwater bonanza, too, and there is at least anecdotal evidence that every continent may have the same.

Canada's Prince Edward Island, Hawaii and Jakarta, Indonesia, are among places where stressed freshwater supplies coexist with prospective aquifers under the ocean.

Enter Expedition 501, a $25 million scientific collaboration of more than a dozen countries backed by the U.S. government's National Science Foundation and the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (U.S. money for it was secured before budget cuts sought by the Trump administration).

Scientists went into the project believing the undersea aquifer they were sampling might be sufficient to meet the needs of a metropolis the size of New York City for 800 years. They found fresh or nearly fresh water at both higher and lower depths below the seafloor than they anticipated, suggesting a larger supply even than that.



Their work at sea unfolded over three months from Liftboat Robert, an oceangoing vessel that, once on site, lowers three enormous pillars to the seafloor and squats above the waves. Normally it services offshore petroleum sites and wind farms. This drill-baby-drill mission was different.

“It's known that this phenomena exists both here and elsewhere around the world,” Expedition 501 project manager Jez Everest, a scientist who came from the British Geological Survey in Edinburgh, Scotland, said of undersea water. “But it's a subject that's never been directly investigated by any research project in the past.”

By that, he means no one globally had drilled systematically into the seabed on a mission to find freshwater. Expedition 501 was quite literally groundbreaking — it penetrated Earth below the sea by as many as 1,289 feet or nearly 400 meters.

But it followed a 2015 research project that mapped contours of an aquifer remotely, using electromagnetic technology, and roughly estimated salinity of the water underneath.

That mission, by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, reported evidence of a “massive offshore aquifer system” in this area, possibly rivalling the size of America's largest — the Ogallala aquifer, which supplies water to parts of eight Great Plains states.

Two developments in 1976 had stirred interest in searching for undersea freshwater.




In the middle of Nantucket island, the U.S. Geological Survey drilled a test well to see how far down the groundwater went. It extracted fresh water from such great depths that it made scientists wonder if the water came from the sea, not the sky.

The same year, that federal agency mounted a 60-day expedition aboard the drilling vessel Glomar Conception along a vast stretch of the Continental Shelf from Georgia to Georges Bank off New England. It drilled cores in search of the sub-seabed's resources, like methane. 

It found an eye-opening amount of fresh or freshened water in borehole after borehole.

That set the stage for the water-seekers to do their work a half-century later.



Soon after Robert arrived at the first of three drilling sites May 19, samples drawn from below the seabed registered salinity of just 4 parts per thousand. That's far below the oceans' average salt content of 35 parts per thousand but still too briny to meet the U.S. freshwater standard of under 1 part per thousand. 

“Four parts per thousand was a eureka moment,” Dugan said, because the finding suggested that the water must have been connected to a terrestrial system in the past, or still is.

As the weeks wore on and Robert moved from site to site 20 to 30 miles (30 to 50 kilometers) off the coast, the process of drilling into the waterlogged subsea sediment yielded a collection of samples down to 1 part per thousand salt content. Some were even lower.

Bingo. That's what you find in many bodies of fresh water on land. That's water you can drink, in theory. No one did.



In months of analysis ahead, the scientists will investigate a range of properties of the water, including what microbes were living in the depths, what they used for nutrients and energy sources and what byproducts they might generate; in other words, whether the water is safe to consume or otherwise use.

“This is a new environment that has never been studied before,” said Jocelyne DiRuggiero, a Johns Hopkins University biologist in Baltimore who studies the microbial ecology of extreme environments and is not involved in the expedition.

“The water may contain minerals detrimental to human health since it percolated through layers of sediments,” she said. “However, a similar process forms the terrestrial aquifers that we use for freshwater, and those typically have very high quality.”

By sequencing DNA extracted from their samples, she said, the researchers can determine which microorganisms are there and “learn how they potentially make a living.”





Techniques will also be used to determine whether it came from glacial ice melt thousands of years ago or is still coming via labyrinthian geologic formations from land.

Researchers will date the water back in the lab, and that will be key in determining whether it is a renewable resource that could be used responsibly. Primordial water is trapped and finite; newer water suggests the aquifer is still connected to a terrestrial source and being refreshed, however slowly.

“Younger means it was a raindrop 100 years ago, 200 years ago,” Dugan said. “If young, it's recharging.”

Those questions are for basic science. For society, all sorts of complex questions arise if the basic science affirms the conditions necessary for exploiting the water. Who will manage it? Can it be taken without an unacceptable risk of contaminating the supply from the ocean above? Will it be cheaper or environmentally friendlier than today's energy-hungry desalination plants?

Dugan said if governments decide to get the water, local communities could turn to the aquifers in time of need, such as drought, or when extreme storms flood coastal freshwater reserves and ruin them. The notion of actually using this old buried water is so new that it has not been on the radar of many policymakers or conservationists.

“It's a lesson in how long it can take sometimes to make these things happen and the perseverance that's needed to get there,” said Woods Hole geophysicist Rob Evans, whose 2015 expedition helped point the way for 501. “There's a ton of excitement that finally they've got samples.”

Still, he sees some red flags. One is that tapping undersea aquifers could draw water away from onshore reserves. Another is that undersea groundwater that seeps out to the seafloor may supply nutrients vital to the ecosystem, and that could be upset.

“If we were to go out and start pumping these waters, there would almost certainly be unforeseen consequences,” he said. “There's a lot of balance we would need to consider before we started diving in and drilling and exploiting these kinds of things.”



For most in the project, getting to and from Liftboat Robert meant a voyage of seven hours or more from Fall River, Massachusetts, on a supply boat that made round trips every 10 days or so to replenish stocks and rotate people.

On the platform, around the clock, the racket of metal bore pipes and machinery, the drilling grime and the speckled mud mingled with the quieter, cleaner work of scientists in trailers converted to pristine labs and processing posts.

There, samples were treated according to the varying needs of the expedition's geologists, geochemists, hydrologists, microbiologists, sedimentologists and more.

Passing through clear plastic tubes, muck was sliced into disks like hockey pucks. Machines squeezed water out. Some samples were kept sealed to enable study of ancient gases dissolved in the water. Other samples were frozen, filtered or left as is, depending on the purpose.

After six months of lab analysis, all the science teams of Expedition 501 will meet again — this time in Germany for a month of collaborative research that is expected to produce initial findings that point to the age and origin of the water.

On July 31, Liftboat Robert cranked up its legs from this place of hidden water to end a mission that lent credence to another passage from “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,” Samuel Taylor Coleridge's classic poem about life, death and mysteries at sea. 

In a prelude to the poem, in some editions, Coleridge wrote: “I readily believe that there are more invisible than visible Natures in the universe.”

            Rep. Ronny Jackson announced that the Navy has restored his retired rank of rear admiral, overturning a 2022 demotion that followed a scathing investigation, which found major issues with his behavior while he was the top White House physician.
    


            The Texas Republican on Wednesday posted a June 13 letter from Navy Secretary John Phelan saying he had reinstated Jackson to the retired rank of a one-star admiral following a “review of all applicable reports and references.” The Navy confirmed the move, with a spokesperson for Phelan saying he “greatly appreciates Congressman Jackson's decades of distinguished naval service.”
    


            The decision to restore Jackson's rank comes as the Pentagon has become increasingly transparent in offering benefits and consideration to those it sees as personally loyal supporters of President Donald Trump, while those who are seen as unsupportive of Trump have been pushed out of senior roles across the military. Two weeks ago, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth fired Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, who oversaw the intelligence agency that produced an initial intelligence assessment of US damage to Iranian nuclear sites that angered Trump.
    


            Following his 2019 retirement from the Navy, Jackson was retroactively demoted following a yearslong investigation into his behavior when he was a physician to Trump and former President Barack Obama.
    


            An inspector general's report found that he made “sexual and denigrating” comments about a female subordinate, violated the policy on drinking alcohol on a presidential trip and took prescription-strength sleeping medication that prompted worries from his colleagues about his ability to provide proper medical care.
    


            Jackson gained notoriety for his over-the-top pronouncements about Trump's health during his first term. He was elected to Congress in 2020 following a failed effort in the first Trump administration to appoint him the secretary of Veterans Affairs in 2018.
    


            “I was, and still am, a retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral, and Joe Biden is a retired old FOOL,” Jackson said this week on social media, where he has called himself an admiral despite his demotion.
    


            Last week, military officials revealed that Ashli Babbitt, the rioter who was killed by a police officer during the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, would be offered military funeral honors.
    


            Babbitt was a US Air Force veteran from California who was shot and killed wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders while trying to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker's Lobby inside the Capitol as rioters interrupted the counting of electoral votes certifying Trump's 2020 loss to Biden.

In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. That kind of journalism isn't easy.

﻿The greatest grand slam in the world has become an etiquette nightmare — and it's not alone.

At the US Open's Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong stadiums, there's a hum that never goes away. It sort of sounds like the murmur cicadas make. The closer you listen, though, you realize that instead of insects erupting from the ground to breed and scream in the woods, it's actually thousands of people spending hundreds of dollars to descend upon a tennis tournament to…chat.

It's a problem for tennis fans because tennis, generally, is a beautifully acoustic experience.

The low din muffles the sound of the ball coming off a player's strings. It mutes the line calls. It deadens the squeaks and squeals of sneakers sprinting across the hardcourt. The dull, inescapable mumble turns the sport into a frictionless, pressure-free exercise.

So what's going on with the crowd? Why won't they stop yapping and let tennis tennis?

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

“We're talking about people who are not at all interested in the tennis,” says Caitlin Thompson, the founder of Racquet, a media company that focuses on tennis and culture.

“This is by far the most chaotic, unhinged, oversaturated and non-tennis-inclined audience I've ever experienced at the US Open,” adds Thompson, who has been attending the tourney since the mid-2000s.

On the surface, the US Open hum is the obnoxious chorus of people not respecting the rules that come with watching tennis collectively in some of the biggest stadiums in the world. But if you look a bit deeper, the undulating murmur is a result of both the deliberate effort to woo the kind of attendee who's there just to gab, and a breakdown in the larger social contract when it comes to how we act in public.

Year over year, the real secret to the Open's success is that organizers have figured out how to cater to fans who don't watch tennis. Those fans, it turns out, have other priorities when they're seated courtside.

The gourmet chicken nuggets topped with bumps of green caviar that cost $100, the $40 blue hat that everyone wants, the social media-famous $23 Honey Deuce, served in a cup you can take home; the photo opportunities, giveaways, and interactive games in sponsored activation booths from big brands like Chase, Cadillac, and Emirates; the box seats saved for Anna Wintour, Jeremy Allen White, and Christine Baranski — it's all part of what makes the US Open an event that transcends sports, and the greatest grand slam in the world.

They're also part of what makes it one of the worst places to watch actual tennis.

The US Open has long had a reputation for its electric atmosphere — for being a tournament that embodies the brash, chaotic, rugged attitude of New York City. It's never been a particularly silent experience; its history is punctuated by the crowd reacting (groans, oohs, aahs, etc.) to spectacular plays and players appealing to an audience (causing boos, cheers, heckling, etc.).

That's all to say, one singular conversation in the nosebleeds isn't going to ruin an entire match, but that's not what's happening. This year, Open-goers are treated to a multitude of concurrent conversations about what everyone had for lunch or which player is which, a nonstop cacophony of whispers about how people's days were, and an endless onslaught of how everyone got out to Queens (either the 7 train or the Long Island Railroad) and what time they're going to leave.

The experts I spoke to outlined two reasons why the US Open's racket (no pun intended) feels so inescapable in this and recent years. The first reason is structural: the roofs. David Kane, a producer at Tennis Channel, explained to me that while the roofs on Ashe (completed/renovated in 2016) and Armstrong (completed in 2018) have saved matches from rainouts, they've also created an acoustic problem where the sound is trapped. He also notes that the clamor of people buying concessions and drinks nearby, as well as those milling about to their seats, add to the hum.

“On Ashe and Armstrong, the sound sort of cyclones down to the bottom of the bowl,” Kane tells me. “But it feels like this year it's back, and it's louder than ever.”

The other half of this equation is that the US Open has crossed over from a typical sporting event into a social celebration. Tennis journalists and fans I spoke to compared the crowd to the Kentucky Derby or the Met Gala. Coachella, specifically, kept coming up again and again.

The gist: The US Open has become a place to be seen first, and watch tennis second.

“People are having a night out in New York and chatting away, oblivious to the fact there's a grand slam tennis match happening in front of them that they have ostensibly bought tickets to go see,” says Ben Rothenberg, a tennis journalist and podcast host, tells Vox. Tickets for matches originally start at around $100 for the upper deck, but quickly end up on the resale market for double the price. Courtside seats can go for $5,000 and higher.

Rothenberg cited Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift's appearance last year, as well as Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner's soft launch in 2023, as evidence of the US Open achieving new levels of celebrity attendance and using glitz to court a bigger fan base. Tennis isn't the only sport, and the US Open isn't the only sporting event to use fame and luxury to whip up a fan base (see also: F1), but it might be the most successful.

Rothenberg notes the spike in influencers in the last few years, musing that it might now be more of a place to spot celebs than an event for die-hard tennis fans.

Adding to the Open's mystique is the extremely photogenic Honey Deuce, a $23 fancy lemonade made with Grey Goose vodka. Never mind that the drink tastes neither like honey or honeydew melon, last year the event sold roughly $13 million worth of sweetened alcohol in the form of 550,000 Honey Ds. Somehow, it seems like even more were posted on social media. Also available this year are the $21 Ace Paloma, and the equally Instagrammable Watermelon Slice, a $39 Moët & Chandon champagne cocktail.

“You'd think, with the crazy amount of money that people are actually spending on tickets, that I'd be surrounded by die-hard tennis fans,” says Jon Guerrica, the host of the Fantastic Tennis podcast. “Instead, I really felt like I was surrounded by like, a sea of influencers talking over points and just waiting for changeovers to take selfies with their Honey Deuces.”

Coupled with stunt food like the aforementioned caviar-topped chicken nuggets and exclusive restaurants on site (only available to courtside and suite guests), it's easy to have a US Open experience that doesn't necessarily prioritize tennis. It can't be a surprise that some fans don't necessarily prioritize tennis either.

Even if the stands aren't full of the sport's most devoted observers, however, this chatty, self-interested behavior seems more than a little, well, rude. Why aren't people behaving themselves?

It all comes back to the post-2020 problem of not quite knowing how to act like grown-ups in the real world. One TikToker called the Open an “adult Disney World,” which he ostensibly meant as a compliment.

The US Open's armada of fancy drinks are probably a little bit to blame for that inevitable murmur. Even though Americans are drinking less overall, the US Open might be one of those liminal spaces — the aforementioned adult Disneyworld — where they don't feel tethered to rules of polite society. There are reports that Broadway is experiencing something similar, and some people's chattiness is directly proportional to the number of drinks they're consuming. Journalists and fans I spoke to mentioned fans collecting multiple Honey Deuce souvenir cups and greedily stacking them into towering plastic spires, prompting observers to both do the math on how much money they spent and how much alcohol is in their bloodstream.

But there's another way to look at all those pictures of the Honey Deuce glass, with the three melon balls and Ashe or Armstrong in the background. That is this behavior and content are just symptoms of a bigger cultural shift where everyone sees themselves as the main character.

For many, the allure of the US Open isn't the tennis; it's signaling to everyone else that you're at the US Open. They're not watching tennis, so much as everyone's watching them watch tennis. In this configuration, these spectators become the main attraction, and players like Coco Gauff, Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner, and Naomi Osaka are their supporting co-stars.

Once an attendee sees themselves as the main character and the tennis as secondary, adhering to the best practices for watching and listening to extraordinarily talented people play the sport is completely lost. Nothing on the tennis court will ever become more important than the conversation, the photos, the Honey Deuces that person is having.

I heard the infamous US Open hum at a Taylor Fritz match this past week.

During a second round match a group of girlfriends dressed as if they were going to be called to the court themselves, piled in a row behind me. They talked through points. They talked as players lined up to serve. They talked during rallies and through a tiebreaker. They never stopped talking, even as the usher asked them to keep it down. They talked and talked and talked as if they'd never even gotten to talk to each other before.

“How are you?” 

“These are great seats!” 

“Those guys we were talking to — they were so hilarious!” 

“So hilarious! They should have stayed!” 

“I need to go to the bathroom.” 

“Oh, wow, that's a great shot.” 

“Should I go to the bathroom now?”

“Oh, he won.”

Fritz, the top-ranked American men's player, couldn't compete with the will-she-won't-she restroom saga. Involuntarily, I was plunged into their back and forth rather than the one happening on court.

“I would love it if people were seemingly the slightest bit interested in the actual sport that they're watching,” Thompson, the Racquet founder, tells me. Her disappointment with the hum doesn't lie with the chatterboxes, though; she says it's the organizer who dropped the ball. The goal shouldn't just be bringing in new audiences, it should be getting those potential fans to care about the incredible display in front of them. Thompson says that growing the fan base keeps the US Open running, improving facilities, and tennis going strong, but at the same time, laments the trade-off.

The United States Tennis Association has done a superb job of making the US Open a tremendously cool, luxurious, and highly expensive event that everyone wants to go to. But if you actually like tennis, it's probably better to watch it from home.

            Prince William joked about “getting drunk” with Canadian actor Eugene Levy during a brief appearance in a trailer for the latest season of the actor's Apple TV+ travel series.
    


            The eight-episode third season of “The Reluctant Traveler with Eugene Levy” follows the “Schitt's Creek” star as he roves the globe in search of the ultimate travel bucket list – with a touch of help from the Prince of Wales along the way.
    


            “I've challenged myself to complete my own bucket list, before actually kicking the bucket,” Levy, who is known for his dry wit and deadpan delivery, said in the trailer, which was released on Thursday.
    


            In the trailer, Levy can be seen exploring Windsor Castle, one of King Charles and Queen Camilla's residences, west of London. “Oh my, it doesn't get much better than that,” Levy says in a voiceover as he walks through the castle's grounds.
    


            At the end of the trailer, William and Levy are strolling down a woodland path when the prince asks, “Was getting drunk with Prince William on your bucket list?”
    


            “That's the bucket,” Levy jokes, to which William replies: “That's the bucket, is it?”
    


            Other stars joining Levy on his quest for the world's top travel destinations include Canadian singer Michael Bublé, rising K-pop boy band NOWZ and former Indian top cricketer Rahul Dravid, according to an Apple TV+ press release.
    


            The latest series sees him travel to an impressive list of countries, including Austria, Canada, India, Ireland, Mexico, South Korea, the United States and the United Kingdom.
    


            Levy, who has been able to travel all over the world throughout his acting career, previously admitted that he's “not fond of traveling” at all, describing himself as more of “the great indoors type of guy.”
    


            “I don't hate it. (Hate) is a very strong word,” Levy told CNN in 2023. “But I don't really love it.”

            But two years on, after stepping outside his comfort zone in the first two seasons of the show, Levy is now “inching closer” to becoming an “avid traveler,” the press release said.
    


            “But before he can claim that title, he's challenging himself to experience some of the most iconic adventures the world has to offer,” it continued.
    


            The new series is set to premiere globally on September 19.

﻿Everyone underestimated AI progress. Now what?

Two of the smartest people I follow in the AI world recently sat down to check in on how the field is going.

One was François Chollet, creator of the widely used Keras library and author of the ARC-AGI benchmark, which tests if AI has reached “general” or broadly human-level intelligence. Chollet has a reputation as a bit of an AI bear, eager to deflate the most boosterish and over-optimistic predictions of where the technology is going. But in the discussion, Chollet said his timelines have gotten shorter recently. Researchers had made big progress on what he saw as the major obstacles to achieving artificial general intelligence, like models' weakness at recalling and applying things they learned before.

Chollet's interlocutor — Dwarkesh Patel, whose podcast has become the single most important place for tracking what top AI scientists are thinking — had, in reaction to his own reporting, moved in the opposite direction. While humans are great at learning continuously or “on the job,” Patel has become more pessimistic that AI models can gain this skill any time soon.

“[Humans are] learning from their failures. They're picking up small improvements and efficiencies as they work,” Patel noted. “It doesn't seem like there's an easy way to slot this key capability into these models.”

All of which is to say, two very plugged-in, smart people who know the field as well as anyone else can come to perfectly reasonable yet contradictory conclusions about the pace of AI progress.

In that case, how is someone like me, who's certainly less knowledgeable than Chollet or Patel, supposed to figure out who's right?

One of the most promising approaches I've seen to resolving — or at least adjudicating — these disagreements comes from a small group called the Forecasting Research Institute.

In the summer of 2022, the institute began what it calls the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament (XPT for short). XPT was intended to “produce high-quality forecasts of the risks facing humanity over the next century.” To do this, the researchers (including Penn psychologist and forecasting pioneer Philip Tetlock and FRI head Josh Rosenberg) surveyed subject matter experts who study threats that at least conceivably could jeopardize humanity's survival (like AI) in the summer of 2022.

But they also asked “superforecasters,” a group of people identified by Tetlock and others who have proven unusually accurate at predicting events in the past. The superforecaster group was not made up of experts on existential threats to humanity, but rather, generalists from a variety of occupations with solid predictive track records.

On each risk, including AI, there were big gaps between the area-specific experts and the generalist forecasters. The experts were much more likely than the generalists to say that the risk they study could lead to either human extinction or mass deaths. This gap persisted even after the researchers had the two groups engage in structured discussions meant to identify why they disagreed.

The two just had fundamentally different worldviews. In the case of AI, subject matter experts thought the burden of proof should be on skeptics to show why a hyper-intelligent digital species wouldn't be dangerous. The generalists thought the burden of proof should be on the experts to explain why a technology that doesn't even exist yet could kill us all.

So far, so intractable. Luckily for us observers, each group was asked not only to estimate long-term risks over the next century, which can't be confirmed any time soon, but also events in the nearer future. They were specifically tasked with predicting the pace of AI progress in the short, medium, and long run.

In a new paper, the authors — Tetlock, Rosenberg, Simas Kučinskas, Rebecca Ceppas de Castro, Zach Jacobs, and Ezra Karger — go back and evaluate how well the two groups fared at predicting the three years of AI progress since summer 2022.

In theory, this could tell us which group to believe. If the concerned AI experts proved much better at predicting what would happen between 2022–2025, Perhaps that's an indication that they have a better read on the longer-run future of the technology, and therefore, we should give their warnings greater credence.

Alas, in the words of Ralph Fiennes, “Would that it were so simple!” It turns out the three-year results leave us without much more sense of who to believe.

Both the AI experts and the superforecasters systematically underestimated the pace of AI progress. Across four benchmarks, the actual performance of state-of-the-art models in summer 2025 was better than either superforecasters or AI experts predicted (though the latter was closer). For instance, superforecasters thought an AI would get gold in the International Mathematical Olympiad in 2035. Experts thought 2030. It happened this summer.

“Overall, superforecasters assigned an average probability of just 9.7 percent to the observed outcomes across these four AI benchmarks,” the report concluded, “compared to 24.6 percent from domain experts.”

That makes the domain experts look better. They put slightly higher odds that what actually happened would happen — but when they crunched the numbers across all questions, the authors concluded that there was no statistically significant difference in aggregate accuracy between the domain experts and superforecasters. What's more, there was no correlation between how accurate someone was in projecting the year 2025 and how dangerous they thought AI or other risks were. Prediction remains hard, especially about the future, and especially about the future of AI.

The only trick that reliably worked was aggregating everyone's forecasts — lumping all the predictions together and taking the median produced substantially more accurate forecasts than any one individual or group. We may not know which of these soothsayers are smart, but the crowds remain wise.

Perhaps I should have seen this outcome coming. Ezra Karger, an economist and co-author on both the initial XPT paper and this new one, told me upon the first paper's release in 2023 that, “over the next 10 years, there really wasn't that much disagreement between groups of people who disagreed about those longer run questions.” That is, they already knew that the predictions of people worried about AI and people less worried were pretty similar.

So, it shouldn't surprise us too much that one group wasn't dramatically better than the other at predicting the years 2022–2025. The real disagreement wasn't about the near-term future of AI but about the danger it poses in the medium and long run, which is inherently harder to judge and more speculative.

There is, perhaps, some valuable information in the fact that both groups underestimated the rate of AI progress: perhaps that's a sign that we have all underestimated the technology, and it'll keep improving faster than anticipated. Then again, the predictions in 2022 were all made before the release of ChatGPT in November of that year. Who do you remember before that app's rollout predicting that AI chatbots would become ubiquitous in work and school? Didn't we already know that AI made big leaps in capabilities in the years 2022–2025? Does that tell us anything about whether the technology might not be slowing down, which, in turn, would be key to forecasting its long-term threat?

Reading the latest FRI report, I wound up in a similar place to my former colleague Kelsey Piper last year. Piper noted that failing to extrapolate trends, especially exponential trends, out into the future has led people badly astray in the past. The fact that relatively few Americans had Covid in January 2020 did not mean Covid wasn't a threat; it meant that the country was at the start of an exponential growth curve. A similar kind of failure would lead one to underestimate AI progress and, with it, any potential existential risk.

At the same time, in most contexts, exponential growth can't go on forever; it maxes out at some point. It's remarkable that, say, Moore's law has broadly predicted the growth in microprocessor density accurately for decades — but Moore's law is famous in part because it's unusual for trends about human-created technologies to follow so clean a pattern.

“I've increasingly come to believe that there is no substitute for digging deep into the weeds when you're considering these questions,” Piper concluded. “While there are questions we can answer from first principles, [AI progress] isn't one of them.”

I fear she's right — and that, worse, mere deference to experts doesn't suffice either, not when experts disagree with each other on both specifics and broad trajectories. We don't really have a good alternative to trying to learn as much as we can as individuals and, failing that, waiting and seeing. That's not a satisfying conclusion to a newsletter — or a comforting answer to one of the most important questions facing humanity — but it's the best I can do.

What will come next in the Trump administration's war on “narcoterrorism”?

With this week's unprecedented deadly military strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat in the Caribbean, it's clear that the US plans to use tactics it has long employed against terrorist groups against Latin American criminal organizations — up to and including threats of regime change against governments accused of backing the “terrorists.”

This has been a long time coming. President Donald Trump has talked about firing missiles at drug labs in Mexico as far back as 2020, according to former aides, and discussed the idea of using military force against cartels on the campaign trail. In February, shortly after taking office, the Trump administration designated several criminal groups, including the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, as foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs) and specially designated global terrorists (SDGTs), putting them in the same legal category as al-Qaida and ISIS. Last month, the New York Times reported that the president had signed a secret directive instructing the Pentagon to start using military force against these designated organizations.

Then, on Tuesday, Trump announced that the US had carried out a “kinetic strike” against “Tren de Aragua narcoterrorists,” killing 11 on board. The strikes came soon after the US deployed eight warships to the Caribbean and Pacific around South and Central America, an unusually large surge of military force to the region.

Trump administration officials have suggested that there may be more strikes to come. The administration has also accused President Nicolas Maduro's government in Venezuela of controlling Tren de Aragua, a highly contested claim.

For his part, Maduro, a longtime US adversary, has accused the US of seeking “regime change” in Venezuela. US officials haven't exactly denied this, with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth calling it a “presidential decision” and one Trump official telling Axios, “This is 105% about narco-terrorism, but if Maduro winds up no longer in power, no one will be crying.”

Taken together, the Trump administration's new approach could mark a major shift in the more than 50-year history of America's “war on drugs,” its relationship with Latin America, and the increasing militarization of a wide range of policy.

Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan group that emerged as a prison gang in the 2010s before morphing into a larger criminal organization, has been a major target of Trump's rhetoric since his 2024 campaign, typically in the context of immigration policy and his administration mass deportation campaign.

The group is primarily known for crimes like extortion and human trafficking, and while it has been involved in selling drugs at the local level and in some cases smuggling small amounts across borders, experts are skeptical about US accusations that it is bringing drugs in large quantities into the US.

“Tren de Aragua and MS-13 [a Salvadoran gang also now listed as a terrorist organization] are what you could call poor organized crime groups,” said Adam Isacson, a defense and drug policy analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America. “They make their money extorting people in the neighborhoods they control. If they were actually operating a boat carrying many kilos of cocaine, that would be something new.”

The administration has not yet presented evidence of how it knew who was on the boat, though Trump did say, “We have tapes of them speaking.”

Whoever was at the helm, it's not unusual for the US military — generally the Coast Guard or Navy — to interdict boats suspected of carrying drugs. But using deadly force against these ships is more unusual, particularly when — as it appears in the video shared by the Trump administration — there was no effort to warn the vessel or take it into custody.

According to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, US forces did have the opportunity to stop the boat, but Trump chose to destroy it in order to send a deterrent message to traffickers. “Instead of interdicting it, on the president's orders, we blew it up — and it'll happen again,” Rubio said.

This, to put it mildly, raises some legal issues. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement that the strike was taken in “defense of vital U.S. national interests and in the collective self-defense of other nations,” which the Washington Post interpreted as a reference to the authorization for the use of military force against terrorists passed after the 9/11 attacks.

Even for the remarkably malleable Authorization for Use of Military Force resolution of 2001, this would be a reach. The administration is more likely to rely on the president's powers as commander-in-chief under Article II of the Constitution. Though there's wide agreement that the constitution gives the president the power to use military force without congressional authorization in response to imminent threats, recent administrations have pushed the limits of this authority. The White House is expected to lay out its rationale to Congress soon.

Though Trump and other officials have referred to Tren de Argua as “narcoterrorists” and officially listed it as a terrorist group, this is not actually a death warrant, notes Brian Finucane, a former State Department legal adviser now with the International Crisis Group. The FTO and SDGT listings authorize an array of sanctions and criminalize legal support to these groups, but do not authorize military force against them, though, as Finucane notes, “it is widely misunderstood within the US executive branch to do so, and bureaucratically it can help pave the way for military action.”

Finucane notes that the terrorist designations played a similar role in the first Trump administration when the listing of Iran's Revolutionary Guards preceded the drone strike that killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani.

“It helps further this narrative of theirs where the US is engaged in a war on terror in Latin America,” Finucane said.

The question now is what that war might look like. WOLA's Isacson suggested that the strike, taken in international waters, could be a means of “turning up the dial” toward more provocative actions, such as striking alleged cartel targets on the sovereign territory of other countries, or against governments accused of backing them.

The idea of taking military action against cartels in Mexico is popular among Republican members of Congress, and the boat strike overshadowed a highly anticipated visit by Rubio to Mexico this week. A literal brawl broke out in the Mexican Senate last week during a heated debate on the topic of US military intervention in the country.

For now, that appears to have been forestalled. After a meeting between Rubio and President Claudia Sheinbaum, the two countries agreed to expand cooperation to combat drug cartels while respecting each other's “sovereignty.” There's certainly a possibility the idea could return.

As for Venezuela, the US last month offered a $50 million reward for information leading to the arrest of Maduro. One US official told Axios, “This could be Noriega part 2,” referring to the US military operation that ousted and arrested Panamanian dictator and narcotrafficker Manuel Noriega in 1990.

Venezuela is a much larger country, and given Trump's penchant for avoiding long, drawn-out military deployments, a Panama-style invasion seems pretty unlikely. “Precision” strikes on Venezuelan territory, however, certainly don't seem out of the realm of possibility. Rubio suggested as a senator that he was open to using military force to “restore democracy” in Venezuela.

During the first Trump administration, the US backed opposition leader Juan Guaidó and recognized him as Venezuela's legitimate president after the disputed 2019 presidential election, even after it became clear that despite hopes in Washington, Maduro had the support of his military and Guaidó had little hope of taking power.

Michael Shifter, professor of Latin American studies at Georgetown University, was skeptical of the notion, advanced by some analysts and Venezuelan opposition figures, that the regime could collapse in the face of escalating US pressure.

“We've always underestimated Maduro and his capacity to hold things together,” he said.

What is clear is that the speculation early in the Trump administration that the US and Venezuela could be headed for a rapprochement, particularly after a negotiated hostage release in January, was premature.

While experts, including US intelligence agencies, have cast doubt on the Trump administration's claims that Maduro directly controls Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan regime's links to organized crime are well documented.

That may be one reason why, with the notable exception of Colombia's left-wing president Gustavo Petro, who called the boat strike a “murder,” reaction in the region has been pretty muted, even from governments normally quick to raise alarm about US intervention. (On the other extreme, the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, where the boat may have been headed, praised the strike and called on the US military to kill drug traffickers “violently.”)

Early in the Trump administration, when the president was publicly feuding with Petro and demanding the return of the Panama Canal to US control, it appeared that Latin America was going to be an unusually large focus of American foreign policy, leading to speculation about a “Monroe Doctrine 2.0.” That hasn't quite panned out, as attention has shifted to events in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. But given the focus on crime and immigration, it does appear that the region is taking on a greater role in America's military priorities.

A memo from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to military commanders earlier this month referred to “the President's determination to restore our neglected position in the Western Hemisphere.” It also listed “sealing our borders” and counternarcotics as priorities for the Pentagon above deterring China, which has for several years now been considered the department's overarching “pacing challenge.”

Whatever their feelings about drug gangs or Venezuela's corrupt and dictatorial regime, that's likely to make leaders in the region nervous.

“There's no solidarity with Maduro,” said Shifter. However, he added, “there is nervousness about it and trepidation. They're all wondering, what is this guy doing, and are we next?”

In addition to a greater emphasis on Latin America, the strike suggests a willingness by this administration to expand the scope of what military force can be used for. The strike was announced the same week that Trump is publicly discussing sending the National Guard to more cities, including Chicago and New Orleans, following their deployment to Washington, DC, last month — another dramatic application of the military to what has traditionally been civilian law enforcement.

Though the US has, over several administrations, wound down what was once called the “Global War on Terror,” many of the legal authorities and institutions that emerged as part of that conflict remain. To take one example, the agency known as ICE was created in its current form out of the post-9/11 reorganization that created the Department of Homeland Security. Trump once threatened in his first term to resume sending terrorist suspects to Guantanamo Bay. That never happened, but in his second term, the government has spent millions deporting migrants there.

This week's strike in the Caribbean is just the latest example of how the spirit of the post-9/11 war on terror is very much still alive.

﻿Why did the US blow up a boat in the Caribbean?

The two sides are talking now, but in all likelihood, the fighting will continue.

﻿There's a new “axis” in town. This time, it might be real.

America isn't retreating from the world under Trump. It's doing something stranger.

The global humanitarian system was not set up for a crisis like this one.

There's a long history of using starvation as a weapon of war. But this is different.

Welcome to the Supreme Court's Calvinball era.

Last month, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dropped an inflammatory allegation on most of her colleagues.

On August 21, the Supreme Court handed down a baffling order that required researchers, who claim that the Trump administration illegally cut off their federal grants, to navigate a convoluted procedural maze in two different courts. Jackson labeled this decision “Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist.” Calvinball, an ever-changing game featured in the Calvin and Hobbes comic strip, “has only one rule: There are no fixed rules.”

In this Court, Jackson continued, there are two: The rules always change, and “this Administration always wins.”

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

Under the Versailles-like norms that constrain lawyers and judges, this kind of allegation is simply verboten. While Jackson's Democratic colleagues often criticize the Court's decisions, they frequently go out of their way to say that all of the justices “are operating in good faith.” Law students are trained to never suggest that a judge acted for partisan reasons, largely because judges take great umbrage at this allegation. And there is real danger in Jackson's decision to speak of her Republican colleagues as if they are Republicans.

Last year, after five of the Court's Republicans voted to neutralize a constitutional provision barring insurrectionists from seeking public office during the 2024 election, the Court's Democrats signed a brief opinion accusing them of going “beyond the necessities of this case to limit how [the Constitution] can bar an oathbreaking insurrectionist from becoming President.”

That opinion triggered another from Justice Amy Coney Barrett. While Barrett agreed with her Democratic colleagues about how the case should have been decided, she scolded the three Democrats — declaring that “this is not the time to amplify disagreement with stridency.”

Barrett's call for honeyed words in a case about a violent attack on the Capitol is quaint, but it is also a perilous thing for a justice to ignore. If the Democrats offend Barrett, they risk pushing her deeper into the arms of President Donald Trump and his Republican Party.

Yet, while reasonable minds can disagree about whether Jackson's “Calvinball” accusation was a wise way to navigate the Court's internal politics, it's tough to argue with her conclusion. She is talking, after all, about the same Court which held that Trump is allowed to commit crimes.

The Court's Republican majority now hands Trump several victories every month, only explaining themselves when they feel like it. When they do explain those decisions, they are often incomprehensible. The Republican justices exempt Trump from rules that apply to every other litigant, including the most recent Democratic president. Their decision permitting Trump to commit crimes doesn't even attempt to argue that presidential immunity can be found in the Constitution — instead making a policy argument that Trump should not be chilled from taking “bold and unhesitating action” for fear of prosecution.

Nor is Trump the only litigant who receives this Court's special treatment. The Republican justices favor religious conservatives so much that they will make up fake facts to bolster Christian conservative litigants. Meanwhile, they hate abortion providers so much that they once handed down an anti-abortion decision that, if taken seriously, would permit every state to neutralize any constitutional right.

If any other government official behaved this way, it would be obvious they were placing partisanship ahead of the law. It is no less obvious when these six specific government officials do so. The most reasonable explanation for the Republican justices' behavior is that they are acting in bad faith.

It doesn't take much work to prove that the Republican justices think Trump is above the law. I could post a citation to Trump v. United States (2024), the decision immunizing Trump from prosecution for his official acts in office, and walk away with a mic drop.

But that is not an isolated case. It joins a widespread pattern of decisions treating the GOP leader as if he is special.

Before Trump's first term, the Supreme Court heard cases almost exclusively through a slow process that maximized the justices' ability to consider every implication of their eventual decision. Typically, the Court wouldn't even consider hearing a case until it was decided by at least two other courts — a trial court and an appeals court. Even then, they'd often wait until two appeals courts divided on the answer to the same legal question (what's known as a “circuit split”).

The reason for this caution was straightforward: The Supreme Court has the final word on how to interpret any provision of US law. If they get a question wrong, there's often no way to correct their error outside of a constitutional amendment. Plus, in the overwhelming majority of cases, lower court judges can be trusted to apply the law. So it made sense for the nation's final adjudicators to wait, letting parties on both sides of an issue figure out their best arguments in lower courts, before the justices issued a decree that was likely to stand forever.

Indeed, the Court was historically so hostile to litigants who attempted to jump in line, that — outside of death penalty cases, where someone would die if the justices didn't immediately intervene — most attorneys wouldn't even ask the Supreme Court to hear a case before an appeals court handed down its final decision.

The Department of Justice, for example, brings tens of thousands of cases every year. But, in the 16 years when George W. Bush and Barack Obama were president, the DOJ only asked the justices to intervene prior to a final appellate judgment eight times — once every other year.

Then Trump became president, and everything changed. In the Supreme Court's 2018–'19 term alone, Trump's DOJ filed 10 petitions asking the justices to block a lower court's decision on its “shadow docket,” a forum for emergency motions and other matters that receive the Court's expedited review. Rather than enforce its longstanding norms, the justices abandoned them to accommodate Trump. According to a November 2019 paper by law professor Steve Vladeck, through that point in his first term Trump won a full or partial victory on two-thirds of his requests to stay a lower court decision.

In his second term, the Court has only grown more favorable to Trump — granting, in full or in part, 16 of his last 16 requests for shadow docket relief. Some of these decisions are devastating. Department of Homeland Security v. D.V.D. effectively permits Trump to neutralize the Convention Against Torture. McMahon v. New York allows Trump to fire so many civil servants that entire programs mandated by law cease to exist.

The Court handed Trump even more victories by exempting him from formal rules. As the Court explained in Nken v. Holder (2009), for example, a party asking an appellate court to block a lower court decision while the case is still being litigated normally cannot prevail, even if they show they're likely to win the case. They also must show that they “will be irreparably injured absent a stay,” and that a decision blocking the lower court's order won't do too much harm to the public interest or to third parties.

But, as Jackson pointed out in a pair of dissents this year, the Republican justices appear to have exempted Trump and his administration from this requirement.

In Social Security Administration v. AFSCME (2025), for example, the Republican justices ruled that the “Department of Government Efficiency,” the White House office once led by Elon Musk, may have immediate access to sensitive Social Security information. When a judge asked one of Trump's lawyers what harm the government would experience if DOGE's access to this information were delayed, the lawyer did not answer — saying instead that the Trump administration would “stand on the record in its current form.” Nor did the Trump administration answer this question in its brief to the justices.

This Court has also embraced a divide-and-conquer strategy that weakens lower court judges and prevents litigants from obtaining lasting relief against Trump's illegal actions. The most high-profile example of this strategy is Trump v. CASA (2025), where the Republican justices held that lower courts may only issue so-called nationwide injunctions — orders that toss out a federal policy rather than exempting a particular litigant from having to comply with it — in rare circumstances.

CASA, in fairness, is one of this Court's more defensible Trump-related decisions. President Joe Biden spent his presidency being tormented by right-wing judges who issued nationwide injunctions against him on dubious grounds, and his DOJ fought to halt them until the bitter end. But the Supreme Court did nothing to stop them until a Republican moved into the White House.

And CASA is hardly the only case where the Republican justices placed new — and sometimes, ridiculous — procedural barriers in front of litigants challenging Trump policies. The worst example is National Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Association, the case where Jackson levied her “Calvinball” accusation against her Republican colleagues.

The Court's decision in NIH is so convoluted that it is impossible to parse. But it appears to hold that researchers who lost their grants must first go to a federal district court to obtain an order saying the grants were illegally cut off, then defend that order on appeal, and then go to a different court (the Court of Federal Claims) to get a second court order requiring the administration to give them their money — a process that will likely take years.

Similarly, in Trump v. J.G.G., five Republican justices voted to vacate a lower court order blocking many of Trump's illegal deportations. Trump cut off due process for many immigrants by unlawfully relying on a federal statute that only permits him to do so if a foreign military invades the US. But the Supreme Court held that no judge could block these illegal deportations on a nationwide basis, and instead required the impacted immigrants to bring many lawsuits in many different courts using a process known as “habeas.”

Notably, the majority decision in J.G.G. seems to conflict with the Court's decision in Skinner v. Switzer (2011), which said that there is no case “in which the Court has recognized habeas as the sole remedy, or even an available one, where the relief sought would ‘neither terminat[e] custody, accelerat[e] the future date of release from custody, nor reduc[e] the level of custody.'”

This Court, in other words, has favored Trump by giving him broad exemptions from normal procedures, while simultaneously erecting new barriers in front of anyone who challenges him. That's in addition to its decision permitting Trump to violate criminal law.

Notice how, in many of these decisions, the Court achieved partisan results simply by manipulating procedure. It played a similar game, with opposite results, when Biden was president.

In August 2021, Matthew Kacsmaryk — the Trump judge best known for his failed attempt to ban the abortion medication mifepristone — ordered the Biden administration to reinstate a Trump policy that required many migrants to remain in Mexico while their immigration cases were being processed. His decision had no basis in law, and rested on an egregious misreading of federal immigration statutes.



The Supreme Court eventually reversed Kacsmaryk, warning that he “imposed a significant burden upon the Executive's ability to conduct diplomatic relations with Mexico.” But, in stark contrast to the fast-tracked process the justices applied to Trump's requests to block lower court decisions, the Court sat on the case until late June 2022. Kacsmaryk was the de facto US border czar for nearly an entire year.

A similar drama played out a year later, after a different Trump judge named Drew Tipton struck down a memo from then-Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, which instructed ICE agents to prioritize targeting immigrants who “pose a threat to national security, public safety, and border security and thus threaten America's well-being.” Mayorkas did so under a statute making him responsible for “establishing national immigration enforcement policies and priorities.” DHS issued similar memos in 2005, 2010, 2011, 2014, and 2017.

Once again, the Supreme Court eventually conceded that Tipton's order was lawless, but it sat on the case for 11 months before reaching this obvious conclusion.

And the Republican justices do not limit their partisan shenanigans to procedural orders. To the contrary, they invented a new limit on executive power that they have only ever applied to one president: Joe Biden.

The Supreme Court's “major questions doctrine” empowers the justices to strike down executive actions that they deem to be too ambitious. As the Court said in a 2014 opinion that previewed the doctrine (but that only applied it to a hypothetical regulation), “we expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast ‘economic and political significance.'”

This brand-new legal doctrine has no basis in the Constitution nor in any statute. The Republican justices apply it in dishonest ways, even using it to strike down programs that federal law unambiguously authorizes. Their attempts to justify the doctrine are childish and silly; Barrett, for example, once defended it with a parable involving a babysitter.

Again, the major questions doctrine has only been applied to one president in American history: Joe Biden. The Republican justices used it to block a Covid-related eviction moratorium, to block part of Biden's vaccination strategy, to target an EPA rule intended to fight climate change, and to repeal Biden's plan to cancel many student loans.

The student loans decision, Biden v. Nebraska (2023), was particularly poorly reasoned. The Court struck down a policy that was clearly authorized by federal law; the relevant statute gave the education secretary broad authority to “waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable to the student financial assistance programs” during a national emergency such as the pandemic. The secretary could use this power “notwithstanding any other provision of law, unless enacted with specific reference to” the statute authorizing him to cancel loans.

When the Republican justices applied this fake doctrine to Biden, they showed none of the compunctions about nationwide orders that they repeatedly expressed under Trump. The Republican justices did not require individual landlords to file individual lawsuits seeking to exempt a single tenant from the eviction moratorium. Nor did they require loan servicers to comply with a years-long process in two different courts. They simply abolished the Biden administration policies that they disagreed with.

And there are already signs that at least one of the Republican justices plans to exempt Trump from this major questions doctrine. The doctrine plays a starring role in the lawsuits challenging Trump's tariffs, for good reason. If anything counts as a question of “vast ‘economic and political significance,'” it's Trump's decision to unilaterally impose a massive tax hike that, according to Yale's Budget Lab, will cost the average American household $2,400 in 2025 alone.

And yet, in a concurring opinion in FCC v. Consumers' Research, Justice Brett Kavanaugh signaled that he will exempt Trump's tariffs from the major questions doctrine by declaring that it does not apply in “foreign policy contexts.” Kavanaugh, in other words, has decided to invent a new limit on a brand-new legal doctrine, which was itself invented by himself and his Republican colleagues, and that has no basis in any law. It just so happens that this new limit will rescue a Republican president's signature policy from invalidation.

If Kavanaugh pursues this plan when the tariffs case reaches his Court, how could anyone possibly conclude that he is engaged in a good faith effort to apply the law without favoring either political party?

Though Trump has benefited more from this Court's partisanship than anyone, he's hardly the only beneficiary. The Republican justices have shown similar solicitude for interest groups that are influential within the GOP, and especially for the religious right.

Justices are not appointed to the Supreme Court as representatives of a political party. But it is still a partisan institution, made up of political appointees nominated by a partisan president, and confirmed by partisan senators.

In today's America, both parties have a very sophisticated understanding of how they want judges to act, carefully select judges who can be relied upon to predictably pursue their party's goals, and once confirmed, their Supreme Court appointees consistently act in accordance with their party's vision for the courts.

It hasn't always been this way; indeed, as recently as 2010, Justice John Paul Stevens was a liberal justice appointed by a Republican president. But that was 15 years ago.

Today, the Supreme Court is a partisan institution, and the labels used for justices in this piece reflect that.

A fuller explanation of why I label the justices “Republicans” and “Democrats” can be found here.

One of the Court's first actions after Barrett's confirmation gave Republican justices a supermajority, for example, was to overrule months-old Supreme Court decisions establishing that churches and other houses of worship must comply with the same public health restrictions that apply to similar institutions, such as movie theaters and lecture halls, where people tend to gather in large groups.

The Republican justices have even claimed separating church and state is unconstitutional in many contexts. In Carson v. Makin (2022), for example, the Court held that Maine must include religious schools in a school voucher program.

The Court's Republicans have shown extraordinary impatience in religion cases, even when moving too quickly risks harming important institutions. In Mahmoud v. Taylor (2025), the Court considered a conflict between conservative religious parents and a school district that approved books with queer characters for use in some classrooms. An appeals court, in an opinion by George W. Bush-appointed Judge Steven Agee, had previously ruled that the judiciary needed more information before it could decide how to proceed.

As Agee wrote, the record in the case provided no information “about how any teacher or school employee has actually used any of the Storybooks in the Parents' children's classrooms, how often the Storybooks are actually being used, what any child has been taught in conjunction with their use, or what conversations have ensued about their themes.” So it wasn't yet possible to determine if these parents' constitutional rights were violated.

Rather than wait for lower courts to determine what actually happened, however, the Republican justices rushed out a sweeping decision declaring that parents with a religious objection to any lesson taught in a public school must be given advance notice of that lesson and the ability to opt their child out of it. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned in dissent, this decision is likely to cause “chaos,” because requiring schools to anticipate which parents will object to which lessons “will impose impossible administrative burdens.”

Parents previously sued public schools because they objected, on religious grounds, to lessons touching on topics as diverse as divorce, interfaith couples, “immodest dress,” evolution, pacifism, magic, women achieving things outside of the home, and “false views of death.” Thus, under Mahmoud, a school district can potentially be held liable if it does something as innocuous as assigning a book where one of the characters is a woman who works as a police officer. Or for assigning a biography of President Ronald Reagan, who was divorced.

So in Mahmoud, the Republican justices bypassed the judiciary's ordinary fact-finding process to give religious conservatives what they were seeking as quickly as possible. In another case, Kennedy v. Bremerton School District (2022), they went even further: making up fake facts and then relying on them to rule in favor of a Christian conservative.

Kennedy involved Joseph Kennedy, a public school football coach who incorporated “motivational” prayers into his coaching, led after-game prayer sessions, and who would walk out to the 50-yard line after games to kneel and pray in front of students and spectators. We know that Kennedy conducted these very public prayer sessions because both the school district's brief and Sotomayor's dissenting opinion incorporated pictures of them.

But Justice Neil Gorsuch's majority opinion claims that Kennedy “offered his prayers quietly while his students were otherwise occupied,” and describes them as a “brief, quiet, personal religious observance.”

No one questions that the Constitution permits government employees, including those in positions of authority over young people, to quietly pray. But that's clearly not what Kennedy did. The Republican justices must have seen the pictures in the school district's brief and in Sotomayor's dissent, but they acted like this evidence didn't exist. It appears that they just lied about the facts of the case to benefit a religious conservative.

Meanwhile, the Republican justices twist the law into knots to ensure that no abortion provider benefits from it.

In 2021, back when Roe v. Wade was still good law, Texas enacted a Rube Goldberg-like scheme to shut down abortion clinics without due process. The basic idea was to force the state's abortion providers to choose between being bankrupted by either a court order or by legal fees.

The law allowed nearly “any person” on the globe to sue abortion providers in Texas. Successful plaintiffs collected a bounty of “not less than $10,000”; there was no cap on how much a court could force abortion providers to pay. Moreover, because virtually anyone could file such a lawsuit, abortion providers risked being sued by thousands or even tens of thousands of plaintiffs.

When there is no ambiguity in the law, the Republican justices often make something up so they can rule in favor of Republicans anyway.

And yet, in Whole Women's Health v. Jackson (2021), five Republican justices ruled that the only way abortion providers could defend against these suits is to hire a small army of lawyers to contest each of these thousands of lawsuits. The five Republicans prohibited federal courts from blocking the Texas law.

If taken seriously, Whole Women's Health is the single greatest assault on the Constitution in the Supreme Court's entire history. It would permit any state to neutralize any constitutional right, simply by using a Texas-style bounty hunter system. A segregationist state legislature could sic bounty-hunting plaintiffs on any Black parent who sends their child to an integrated public school. Or it could send bounty hunters after anyone who criticizes the state governor; or who registers to vote as a Democrat.

To be clear, I don't actually think that these justices would allow a state to segregate its public schools — but that's because the most likely explanation for Whole Women's Health is that the five Republicans who decided it were playing Calvinball. They wanted Texas to be able to ban abortion, so they reached for any argument that would support that outcome without caring about the consequences if that argument were applied to any other case.

Consider, as well, the Court's decision in Medina v. Planned Parenthood (2025).

One of the most important questions in US poverty law, possibly the most important question, is whether private litigants can enforce their rights under federal Medicaid law and similar statutes governing federal anti-poverty programs.

Medina involved a federal law that gives Medicaid patients a right to choose their own health providers. An earlier case, Health and Hospital Corporation v. Talevski (2023), involved a list of requirements that Medicaid law imposes on nursing homes, including the right of patients “to be free from physical or mental abuse, corporal punishment, involuntary seclusion, and any physical or chemical restraints imposed for purposes of discipline or convenience and not required to treat the resident's medical symptoms.”

Some of the federal laws governing state Medicaid programs are intended to protect patients, and thus may be enforced through those patients' private lawsuits. Others impose reporting and paperwork requirements on states, or otherwise place obligations on states and Medicaid providers that should not be enforced through private lawsuits. There have been many decades of litigation to distinguish the laws that can be enforced in court from the ones that cannot.

By the time Medina reached the justices, however, the question of how to determine which Medicaid laws may be enforced in private lawsuits, and which ones cannot, was resolved. Talevski held that federal law creates enforceable rights when it is “‘phrased in terms of the persons benefited' and contains ‘rights-creating,' individual-centric language with an ‘unmistakable focus on the benefited class.'”

Thus, a law stating that “no state may prevent a hungry person from eating a hamburger” may be enforced in court, because it is phrased in terms of the people whom the law benefits (hungry people). A different law stating that “states may not impede access to hamburgers” would not be enforceable, because it lacks the “focus on the benefitted class” demanded by Talveski.

Medina was an easy case, because the law at issue in that suit provided that “any individual eligible for medical assistance (including drugs) may obtain such assistance from any institution, agency, community pharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service.” The law focused on the persons benefited: individuals eligible for medical assistance under Medicaid.

Rather than reach this obvious conclusion, however, the Republican justices delivered a garbled opinion that didn't even quote the relevant language from Talevski. Their decision in Medina effectively repeals the law allowing Medicaid patients to choose their doctors.

And why did the Republican justices repeal this law? The answer cannot be found in case law. The most obvious explanation is they did so because Medina was a case about whether Medicaid patients may choose Planned Parenthood as their health provider. Rather than reach the only conclusion that is permissible under the Court's two-year-old decision in Talevski, the Republican justices decided to repeal the law, and spite an abortion provider.

Some of the decisions discussed above are individually defensible. Hell, I've defended some of them. The Court frequently faces legal questions that are unclear, and often the justices simply have to choose between multiple acceptable outcomes.

But the crushing weight of all of these decisions put together should speak for itself. When Trump goes 16-for-16 on the shadow docket, when the Court invents entire legal doctrines to spite Biden, when it applies one set of rules to Democrats and another to Republicans, or when it puts off important legal questions for years, until resolving them will benefit a Republican president, those decisions cannot be explained because judges are sometimes forced to choose among multiple acceptable options. When there is ambiguity in the law, the Republican justices resolve it in favor of Republicans. And when there is no ambiguity in the law, the Republican justices often make something up so they can rule in favor of Republicans anyway.

Nor does the fact that the Republican justices sometimes vote with their Democratic colleagues make them any less partisan. Senate Republicans split 31-15 on whether to approve aid to Ukraine in 2024. Seventeen Senate Republicans joined nearly every Democrat in supporting the CHIPS Act in 2022. The fact that a loyal Republican sometimes agrees with Democrats does not make them any less of a Republican.

And yet public discourse around the Supreme Court too often dances around the possibility that the justices may be partisans acting in bad faith. Most reporters and legal commentators, for example, still euphemistically refer to the Court's two factions as “liberals” and “conservatives,” when it is more accurate to refer to the justices as “Democrats” or “Republicans.”

There are structural reasons why professionals who work closest with the justices are unwilling to openly state what the Supreme Court has become. Lawyers don't want to antagonize judges and justices who may decide their cases. Lower court judges don't want to antagonize the justices because they don't want to be reversed. Journalists don't want to speak of the justices as partisans because they don't want to appear partisan themselves.

Even the justices themselves frequently pull their punches, because they don't want to alienate colleagues they will sit with for decades.

But it is getting harder and harder to take an honest look at the Supreme Court's recent behavior without reaching the same conclusion that Justice Jackson reached. The Republican justices are playing Calvinball. They aren't making a serious effort to apply the law in a fair and consistent way.

Oops.

Trump's decision to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook is a test of the Republican justices' submissiveness.

My brain hurts.

The court finally lifted a two-year ban on drag performances.

Don't expect the courts to keep ICE under control.

The hidden reasons behind America's organ donation crisis.

A Vox reader asks: Why are so few people organ donors? Why would someone choose not to be a donor? Everyone agrees it's a good thing but very few people actually do it.

Grab your ID out of your wallet. Does it have a heart on the front or back? If so, you're one of 170 million Americans who've signed up to donate their organs after death. That's about 60 percent of all eligible adults in the US — hardly “so few people.”

But if most Americans support organ donation and many have registered, why do we still have over 100,000 people waiting for transplants, with 13 people dying every day?

The gap between support and actual donations comes down to the two different ways one can donate their organs and the surprising quirks and issues particular to each.

First is after-death donations, where someone signs up to donate their organs after they die. The biggest bottleneck here isn't registration — it's medical.

The newsletter is part of Vox's Explain It to Me. Each week, we tackle a question from our audience and deliver a digestible explainer from one of our journalists. Have a question you want us to answer? Ask us here.

Only about three in 1,000 people die in circumstances that allow for organ donation, according to the nonprofit Donor Alliance. To remain viable for transplant, organs need continuous blood flow right up until surgical removal, which means dying in a hospital, on a ventilator, typically from brain death, with your heart still beating through mechanical support.

When someone dies at home or in an accident without immediate medical care, crucial organs like kidneys, liver, and heart begin suffering irreversible damage within minutes of blood flow stopping. This incredibly narrow biological window rules out most deaths.

So, that 60 percent registration rate sounds impressive until you realize that only a tiny fraction of those will die in a way for their organs to be viable for a transplant.

And even when someone dies in the right circumstances, families can sometimes still block donations because they're unsure about what their loved one really wanted, they fear bodily disfigurement or feel that the donation process is too lengthy. Legally, a person's registration should be binding, but hospitals often won't proceed if families strongly object. This happens in less than 10 percent of cases involving registered donors, but it still represents lost opportunities.

The other way is living donation, where you donate a kidney or part of your liver while you're alive.

Here the numbers get really interesting. When surveyed, 86.6 percent of Americans say they might consider donating a kidney while alive, according to a 2023 survey. Yet, only about 7,000 living-donor transplants happen annually, and fewer than 350 go to complete strangers. And the number of donors haven't changed much in the past two decades.

This gap between stated preference and actual actions reveals something fundamental about human psychology. When your sister or aunt needs a kidney, she has a face, a relationship, a story you're privy to. You've probably watched them struggle through dialysis, made hospital visits with them, and watched them grow sicker.

But the 100,000 people on transplant waiting lists remain abstract statistics. Turns out, the psychological distance between “helping my sister” and “helping stranger #47,832 on a waiting list” is huge, especially at the potential costs to your body or to your wallet. Even though donating a kidney is safe for most healthy adults, it can be daunting to imagine the physical duress of going through surgery and recovery for the benefit of somebody else.

Even when people overcome these psychological hurdles, there are practical barriers at play. Living donors face average costs of $900 to $19,900 in the first year after surgery. While the recipient's insurance covers medical expenses, donors have to handle lost wages, travel costs, and child care on their own. And they are asked to take up this burden with the goodness of their heart alone.

Also, the evaluation process to see if you're fit to give away a kidney can take months and involve dozens of medical tests, mental health screenings, and meetings with transplant teams. Although, initial data from a pilot study found that once people register, the vast majority stay committed throughout the evaluation process.

Perhaps most tellingly, only about 16 percent of Americans had ever thought about living kidney donation. Unlike deceased donation, which people encounter when renewing driver's licenses, living donation exists outside most people's serious consideration.

But what about the 40 percent who haven't registered for an after-death donation? Some of it is simple inertia; you have to actively opt in, either online or at the DMV, and many people who support the idea in theory never get around to actually signing up.

Others have genuine concerns rooted in medical mistrust, particularly in Black and Hispanic communities that have complicated relationships with the health care system. (Unfortunately, these same communities have much higher rates of kidney disease due to diabetes and hypertension, so they're disproportionately represented among people waiting for transplants.)

Some religious groups also have concerns — certain Indigenous American groups prefer to keep the body intact after death, and some families worry about religious compatibility with donation — though most major faiths actually support organ donation as an act of charity.

There's also the fundamental newness of it all. Safely moving organs from one person to another has only been possible since the 1980s, when we developed drugs to prevent organ rejection. Given this relatively recent innovation, organ transplantation simply has not had enough time to become a deeply familiar practice. It'll take time for something this new to feel completely routine.

All of this creates a cascade effect. Most people support organ donation in theory, but fewer actually register. Of those who do register, only a tiny fraction die in circumstances where their organs can be used. And even then, families sometimes say no. For living donation, the drop-off is even steeper. Lots of people say they'd consider it, but very few actually follow through, especially when it comes to helping strangers. Add in the financial costs and months of medical testing, and you're left with a trickle of actual donors.

But, there's hope on the horizon.

The End Kidney Deaths Act, which was reintroduced in Congress in April, would give kidney donors a $10,000 annual tax credit for five years. The policy has overwhelming public support and could save an estimated 100,000 lives in its first decade. And it's one of the few things that could meaningfully address the deaths of 47,000 people each year waiting for kidneys. My colleague, Dylan Matthews, made a moral case for this act.

If you're interested in reading more about living donation or interested in becoming one, read this another fantastic piece that Dylan wrote about his experience of giving away a kidney to a stranger.

            Hundreds of federal officers descended on a small southeast Georgia community and raided the Hyundai Metaplant – arresting 475 people in one of the largest sweeps yet in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown at workplaces across the US.
    


            The majority are Korean nationals, said Steven Schrank, a Homeland Security Investigations special agent in charge. The raid marks the largest single-site enforcement operation in HSI history, he said, though a host of other federal agencies were also involved.
    


            Previously, federal officials estimated 450 people were apprehended Thursday at the massive site in Ellabell, about 25 miles west of Savannah, Georgia.
    


            All 475 people taken into custody were illegally present in the US, Schrank said. Some crossed into the US illegally, some had visa waivers and were prohibited from working, and some had overstayed their visas, he said.
    


            Schrank said he did not have a breakdown of the arrestees' nationalities.
    


            During the raid, several people tried to flee – including some who “ran into a sewage pond located on the premises,” the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Georgia said.
    


            “Agents used a boat to fish them out of the water. One of the individuals swam under the boat and tried to flip it over to no avail. These people were captured and identified as illegal workers.”
    


            Schrank noted that some of the workers may have been contractors or subcontractors. A Hyundai spokesperson told CNN he does not believe anyone arrested was a direct employee of Hyundai Motor Company.
    


            “We are aware of the recent incident at the HL-GA Battery Company construction site in Bryan County, Georgia. We are closely monitoring the situation and working to understand the specific circumstances,” spokesperson Michael Stewart said Friday.
    


            “As of today, it is our understanding that none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company. We prioritize the safety and well-being of everyone working at the site and comply with all laws and regulations wherever we operate.”
    


            The sprawling, 2,900-acre Hyundai Metaplant has two parts: a Hyundai electric vehicle manufacturing site, and an EV battery plant that's a joint venture between Hyundai and LG.
    


            CNN has reached out to LG for comment.
    


            The raid halted construction of the EV battery plant, the Associated Press reported.
    


            The same day, hundreds of miles away in upstate New York, dozens of workers at a family-owned plant that makes nutrition bars were also apprehended during an ICE raid, officials said, drawing the ire of Gov. Kathy Hochul.
    


            The raids come as Chicago leaders are preparing for a possible National Guard deployment in step with an expected immigration enforcement operation in the city.
    


            At the Georgia site, masked and armed agents gave orders to construction workers wearing hard hats and safety vests as they lined up while officers raided the facility, video footage obtained by CNN showed.
    


            ICE and Homeland Security Investigations were accompanied by the Georgia State Patrol, the FBI, DEA, ATF and other agencies in executing a search warrant as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into “allegations of unlawful employment practices and other serious federal crimes,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. “Together, we are sending a clear and unequivocal message: those who exploit our workforce, undermine our economy, and violate federal laws will be held accountable.”
    


            ATF Atlanta said the operation led “to the apprehension of ~450 unlawful aliens, emphasizing our commitment to community safety.”
    


            Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has touted the Hyundai Metaplant as a boon for the Georgia economy.
    


            In 2022, Hyundai announced an agreement with the state of Georgia to build Hyundai's “first dedicated fully electrified vehicle and battery manufacturing facilities in the United States” in Bryan County, the company said.
    


            The Metaplant was expected to create 8,500 jobs.
    


            “With the first 500 employees trained, and more soon to join them, this is another major milestone as we continue our momentum towards the full opening of the Hyundai Metaplant!” Kemp posted on social media last year.
    


            CNN has asked Kemp's office for comment about Thursday's immigration raid at the Metaplant.
    


            In New York Thursday morning, federal agents arrived at the Nutrition Bar Confectioners plant in Cato and questioned “virtually the entire workforce,” according to Rural & Migrant Ministry, whose staff witnessed the raid.
    


            The group posted a video on its Facebook page showing law enforcement leading people into a van marked “Border Patrol.” During the raid workers were taken into the kitchen area of the plant and “questioned one by one over the course of many hours,” the group said in the post.
    


            The group estimates that “upwards of 70 employees” were questioned and “nearly all” were then arrested and taken to the nearby Oswego Detention Center. A spokesperson for the group told CNN they're still waiting to hear from authorities about exactly how many were detained.
    


            Hochul condemned the ICE operation in her state.
    


            “I am outraged by this morning's ICE raids in Cato and Fulton, where more than 40 adults were seized — including parents of at least a dozen children at risk of returning from school to an empty house,” Hochul said in a statement.
    


            Hochul said such operations “will not make New York safer” and will “shatter hard-working families who are simply trying to build a life here.”
    


            ICE confirmed to CNN affiliate WSTM that it carried out a “court-authorized enforcement action” in Cato. Employees told WSTM that around 60 workers were detained. CNN has reached out to the agency for further details.
    


            Mark Schmidt, the owner of Nutrition Bar Confectioners, told the New York Times that all his workers had legal documentation to work in the US. “We've done everything we can to vet people we hire,” he said.
    


            Schmidt described the ICE raid as “overkill.” His son Lenny Schmidt, the company's vice president, told the Times the scene was “almost theatrical,” describing police dogs and all-terrain vehicles involved in the operation.
    


            “It could have been handled so much more humanely and decently,” he said. “This kind of raid, you feel like it's a drug bust or a human trafficking situation.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the company for further comment.

NEW YORK, NY — Justice Amy Coney Barrett pushed back on partisan portrayals of the Supreme Court during a conversation in Manhattan on Thursday, saying it's a “mistake” to view the justices as aligned with the political Left or Right.

“Judges wear black robes because we are not partisan,” Barrett, one of three high court appointees of President Donald Trump, said. “Thinking in those categories of left and right is just the wrong way to think about the law.”

The remarks came during a live interview with journalist and Free Press founder Bari Weiss at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, part of a speaking tour for Barrett's new book, Listening to the Law, which is slated for release on Sept. 9.

Barrett, a member of the court's 6-3 conservative majority, also said she does not believe the United States is experiencing a constitutional crisis despite critics' concerns about Trump's aggressive use of executive power and growing tension between the administration and the judiciary.

“I think the Constitution is alive and well,” Barrett said during the interview, adding, “I don't think that we are currently in a constitutional crisis.”

She continued, “I think our country remains committed to the rule of law. I think we have functioning courts.”

A constitutional crisis, she said, would be marked by the collapse of the rule of law — “but that is not a place where we are.”

Barrett's comments, one of six members of the 6-3 Republican-appointed majority on the high court, were part of a more than one-hour discussion between her and Weiss that covered a range of issues facing the nine justices, including about her liberal colleague Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.

Barrett addressed her recent high-profile clash with Jackson in the Supreme Court's emergency ruling in a case that arose from a challenge against Trump's curb to birthright citizenship, saying she would not apologize for her words toward the liberal justice appointed by former President Joe Biden.

In Trump v. CASA, the court's conservative majority, led by Barrett, allowed federal judges to narrow the use of universal injunctions while saving the merits of the birthright citizenship executive order for a later date.

In a blistering solo dissent, Jackson warned the decision posed an “existential threat to the rule of law,” accusing the majority of giving the executive branch a green light to “wield the kind of unchecked, arbitrary power the Founders crafted our Constitution to eradicate.”

Barrett, in turn, called Jackson's opinion a “startling line of attack” and said her “extreme” arguments clashed with centuries of legal precedent. “Justice Jackson decries an imperial Executive while embracing an imperial Judiciary,” Barrett wrote. “That goes for judges, too.”

Asked about the exchange on Thursday, Barrett stood by her sharp tone, saying, “I'm not going to be spicy for the sake of being spicy, but I am pointed. There's a time and place for everything.” She added, “I attack ideas, not people,” quoting the late Justice Antonin Scalia.

Barrett also reflected on her 2020 confirmation to the Supreme Court, describing the personal toll and public criticism she faced. “What I do is a great privilege … but anybody who's paid attention to confirmation hearings in the last 25 to 30 years knows they're not a pleasant experience.”

She said her family knew what they were getting into. “We were in our house in South Bend … pacing back and forth,” Barrett recalled. Her husband told her, “If we do it, we have to burn the boats. No second-guessing.”

Barrett said she was not surprised that her Catholic faith became a lightning rod, as it had during her 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals nomination, when then-California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein remarked that “the dogma lives loudly within you.”

“I knew echoes of that would surface again,” she said of her later Supreme Court confirmation. “Someone very experienced in Washington told me when my name appeared on the list: You have to be prepared for attacks on your faith, on your family, even on your adopted children.”

Barrett delved into the court's 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, overturning nearly 50 years of precedent in Roe v. Wade.

She outlined the court's approach to stare decisis, a term representative of high court precedent, noting that precedent can be overturned only when additional factors, like legal disruption or flawed reasoning, are present. “Being wrong isn't enough,” Barrett said.

Barrett cautioned when asked how the court should consider public opinion, saying, “I think prudence plays a part in deciding when to overrule precedent. But it's pretty risky to take popular opinion into account when deciding cases.”

Barrett called the draft Dobbs opinion leak a “huge breach of trust” and said it rattled the court's internal culture.

“We're a small operation,” she said. “We call ourselves the ‘court family' — and that encompasses all the employees. I personally worked hard not to let it make me paranoid or change how I relate to people … but it was shocking.”

Barrett also revisited her views on the death penalty, which she has personally opposed for decades. But she said her moral beliefs did not disqualify her from ruling in a 2022 case involving a Boston Marathon bomber sentenced to death.

“My role is simply to say: Was the law followed?” she said. “Sometimes what the law requires is in conflict with a judge's personal beliefs.”

She cited the Catholic doctrine of “cooperation with evil” to explain why she did not recuse, adding, “Reviewing that sentence for consistency with the law did not trigger a moral obligation on my part.”

Barrett defended her separate opinion in the recent Skrmetti v. United States case, where the court upheld a state law banning gender-transition procedures for minors. She argued that the court was right to sidestep the question of whether transgender individuals should be treated as a “suspect class” under the 14th Amendment.

“Creating new suspect classes makes it very difficult for the political process to draw lines in sensitive areas,” she said, adding that courts have turned down other disadvantaged groups in the past, such as the poor or the mentally disabled.

Barrett also discussed the court's Trump v. United States ruling, where the majority held that former presidents enjoy some immunity from prosecution for official acts taken while in office.

“It's not that the president has special privileges. … It's about separation of powers,” she said, adding if Congress criminalized the president's use of the pardon power, for example, that would clearly violate the Constitution.

But she emphasized that such immunity is “a narrow category” and does not shield presidents from accountability for private conduct.

Barrett explained the difference between the court's regular docket and the emergency docket, sometimes referred to as the “shadow docket.” Cases like Trump v. CASA, she said, arise before lower courts have reached final rulings, forcing the justices to act swiftly on interim relief.

She defended the court's recent skepticism toward nationwide injunctions, saying such remedies are efficient but raise thorny separation-of-powers questions. “The issue is whether a single district judge can block a federal policy nationwide,” Barrett said.

Barrett acknowledged criticism from the political right, particularly from supporters of Trump, who have accused her of being too moderate, and in some cases referred to her as a “DEI judge” due in part to Trump's commitment to appoint a woman to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

“To be in this job, you have to not care what people say about you,” she said. “I don't have social media. … My husband and my assistant screen things. We have a ‘need-to-know' policy,” she said, admitting that the “DEI” comment did not make the cut of material that came to her attention.

Toward the end of the conversation, Barrett reaffirmed her reverence for the Constitution, calling it the “political religion of our nation,” quoting President Abraham Lincoln.

“We don't share a common religion,” she said. “But the Constitution unites us.”

Immigration officers raided a Hyundai megaplant that manufactures electric vehicles in Georgia, shutting down construction on a nearby EV battery factory.

The plant is one of the largest in Georgia, worth billions, and employs about 1,200 people. 

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson told the Associated Press that agents were focused on the electric vehicle battery plant construction site.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that agents executed a search warrant “as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other serious federal crimes.” It did not say whether anyone was detained or arrested.

Georgia State Patrol troopers blocked the road to the Hyundai plant, and the state Department of Public Safety said it was assisting. A social media video showed agents telling workers that they were with DHS and that they had a search warrant.

“We need construction to cease immediately,” the man said. “We need all work to end on the site right now.”

Operations at Hyundai's EV manufacturing plant weren't stopped, a spokesperson said.

The joint venture, HL-GA Battery Company, “is cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities,” the company said. “To assist their work, we have paused construction,” they added.

The administration has targeted other businesses in large raids as well. Two California cannabis farm raids in July yielded more than 300 arrests. One farm worker died after sustaining injuries during the raid.

The Trump administration has made deporting numerous illegal immigrants and migrants a top priority.

To do so, the administration has built additional detention centers across the country, expedited hiring new immigration agents, and directed other agencies to put resources or personnel toward the effort.

So far, the administration has around 60,000 illegal immigrants in ICE detention, according to NBC News.

President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to launch a trade investigation to "nullify" what he said were discriminatory fines being levied by Europe against U.S. tech firms such as Google and Apple.

"We cannot let this happen to brilliant and unprecedented American Ingenuity and, if it does, I will be forced to start a Section 301 proceeding to nullify the unfair penalties being charged to these Taxpaying American Companies," Trump wrote on Truth Social.

He issued the threat hours after Google caught a nearly $3.5 billion penalty from the European Union in a major antitrust case centered on the search giant's advertising technology business.

The post also came the day after Trump hosted a dinner at the White House with a gaggle of top tech executives, who took turns praising the president.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai thanked Trump after a U.S. judge issued a favorable ruling in the landmark antitrust case against Alphabet. Pichai said he appreciated the administration's "constructive dialogue."

The president complained in his social media post that Europe was "effectively taking money that would otherwise go to American Investments and Jobs."

"This is on top of the many other Fines and Taxes that have been issued against Google and other American Tech Companies, in particular," Trump wrote. "Very unfair, and the American Taxpayer will not stand for it!"

In a follow-up post Friday afternoon, Trump claimed that Google has previously paid $13 billion in "false claims and charges."

It was unclear where that figure came from, though the company has recently faced a series of hefty regulatory fines.

He also called out the EU for squeezing billions of dollars from Apple in back taxes and fines for alleged anticompetitive practices.

The post claimed that Apple has been fined $17 billion, but that figure appears to include a 2024 court ruling in Ireland ordering the company to pay over $14 billion in back taxes.

Apple "should get their money back!" Trump wrote.

Shares of Kenvue fell more than 10% on Friday after a report that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will likely link autism to the use of the company's pain medication Tylenol in pregnant women. 

HHS will release the report that could draw that link this month, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.

That report will also suggest a medicine derived from folate – a water-soluble vitamin – can be used to treat symptoms of the developmental disorder in some people, according to the Journal.

In a statement, an HHS spokesperson said "We are using gold-standard science to get to the bottom of America's unprecedented rise in autism rates." 

"Until we release the final report, any claims about its contents are nothing more than speculation," they added. 

Tylenol could be the latest widely used and accepted treatment that Kennedy has undermined at the helm of HHS, which oversees federal health agencies that regulate drugs and other therapies. Kennedy has also taken steps to change vaccine policy in the U.S., and has amplified false claims about safe and effective shots that use mRNA technology.

Kennedy has made the disorder a key focus of HHS, pledging in April that the agency will "know what has caused the autism epidemic" by September and eliminate exposures. He also said that month that the agency has launched a "massive testing and research effort" involving hundreds of scientists worldwide that will determine the cause.

In a statement, Kenvue said it has "continuously evaluated the science and [continues] to believe there is no causal link" between the use of acetaminophen, the generic name for Tylenol, during pregnancy and autism.

The company added that the Food and Drug Administration and leading medical organizations "agree on the safety" of the drug, its use during pregnancy and the information provided on the Tylenol label.

The FDA website says the agency has not found "clear evidence" that appropriate use of acetaminophen during pregnancy causes "adverse pregnancy, birth, neurobehavioral, or developmental outcomes." But the FDA said it advises pregnant women to speak with their health-care providers before using over-the-counter drugs.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists maintains that acetaminophen is safe during pregnancy when taken as directed and after consulting a health-care provider. 

Some previous studies have suggested the drug poses risks to fetal development, and some parents have brought lawsuits claiming that they gave birth to children with autism after using it.

But a federal judge in Manhattan ruled in 2023 that some of those lawsuits lacked scientific evidence and later ended the litigation in 2024. Some research has also found no association between acetaminophen use and autism.

In a note on Friday, BNP Paribas analyst Navann Ty said the firm believes the "hurdle to proving causation [between the drug and autism] is high, particularly given that the litigation previously concluded in Kenvue's favor."

Ahead of its IPO next week, Klarna is rolling out a return-to-office policy and explained that its new requirement is partly due to losing talent to firms that prioritize in-person working.

Employees based in Stockholm, Berlin, Warsaw, and Nykøbing, are expected to come into the office three days a week starting September 29, the company informed workers in an internal Slack post Thursday, which was seen by Business Insider. The rollout will extend to other offices shortly thereafter, per the post.

Klarna's announcement comes as more Big Tech companies and startups are unveiling their return-to-office plans for workers. Last September, CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a memo that Amazon would end remote work starting at the beginning of this year. Dell also said in January that it was "retiring" hybrid work and told employees to be in the office five days a week from March.Klarna also said in the Slack post, written by the company's director of people and HR, Mikaela Mijatovic, that it tested out an office week in Stockholm during the spring. Many employees shared how much they enjoy reconnecting with colleagues, sharing ideas naturally, and working side by side, Mijatovic wrote in the message. "At the same time, we have seen some of our top talents leave for companies where in-person collaboration is a fundamental part of daily work," Mijatovic wrote. "This is a signal we cannot ignore, as our success depends on being a company where people thrive and grow together."Klarna declined to comment.

Once Europe's most valuable startup, Klarna offers short-term financing to customers online and in stores at checkout. In 2021, it was valued at $45.6 billion, but its valuation fell to $6.7 billion in 2022 during a wider market downturn for startups. It is now seeking to raise up to $1.72 billion during its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange next week.

During the pandemic, Klarna implemented a hybrid work policy that allowed employees to work from home up to three days per week. In 2022, Klarna transitioned to a fully flexible work arrangement, giving employees complete flexibility to work from home or the office, with no mandatory in-office days.

Klarna previously considered rolling out a three-day-a-week return-to-office policy in 2023, according to a document discovered by an employee at the Swedish fintech company, according to internal Slack posts seen by Business Insider.

The company put together a draft mandate that was shared in a post in an internal Slack channel in 2023 after one staffer discovered it on Klarna's intranet. Klarna's chief operating officer, Camilla Giesecke, responded to the Slack post and said it was "just a draft" and that somebody "stumbled upon it and decided to post it."The proposed RTO policy was met with backlash from some staff at the time, according to five Klarna employees BI spoke to and internal Slack comments.

Two people said in Slack comments at the time that implementing the policy would be "disastrous" and "problematic" if they policy was implemented because some workers had been hired with the option to work remotely, and others had moved away from the office during the pandemic.

Roblox on Friday announced new short-video and AI features that come amid increasing lawmaker scrutiny into how the company protects children on its platform.

With Roblox Moments, users 13 and older will be able to create and share video clips of their gameplay with others on a feed within the platform. The artificial intelligence additions, meanwhile, will allow users to generate advanced 3D objects for the games they create on the platform.

Tune in at 4:15 p.m. ET: Roblox CEO Dave Baszucki joins CNBC TV to discuss the company's latest announcements coming out of its developer conference. Watch in real time on CNBC+ or the CNBC Pro stream.

Although users can share video clips from mature games on Moments, users who do not meet the age requirements of those experiences will be unable to view them, the company said. Roblox will moderate each video shared on Moments and will allow users to "flag content that they find is inappropriate," said Matt Kaufman, Roblox safety chief. Moments is launching in a limited release on Friday.

The AI features will roll out to users before the end of the year. Roblox users will be able to use the artificial intelligence tools to create objects, like futuristic monster trucks, that match the aesthetics of the games users build on the platform, said Anupam Singh, Roblox's senior vice president of engineering. Those creations will also be moderated, Kaufman said.

Roblox faces a number of lawsuits alleging that its design enables online predators to exploit underage victims.

Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill sued Roblox in August, alleging the company fails to implement robust safety protocols to "protect child users from predators." At the time, Roblox said, "any assertion that Roblox would intentionally put our users at risk of exploitation is simply untrue."

The company on Wednesday announced it would expand an age estimation program that Roblox debuted in July.

Google was on Friday hit with a 2.95-billion-euro ($3.45 billion) antitrust fine from European Union regulators for anti-competitive practices in its lucrative advertising technology business.

The European Commission, which is the executive body of the EU, accused Google of distorting competition in the so-called adtech market by unfairly favoring its own display advertising technology services to the detriment of rival adtech providers, advertisers and online publishers.

It also ordered Google to "bring these self-preferencing practices to an end" and "implement measures to cease its inherent conflicts of interest along the adtech supply chain." The company has 60 days to respond.

"Today's decision shows that Google abused its dominant position in adtech harming publishers, advertisers, and consumers. This behaviour is illegal under EU antitrust rules," EU competition chief Teresa Ribera said in a statement Friday.

"Google must now come forward with a serious remedy to address its conflicts of interest, and if it fails to do so, we will not hesitate to impose strong remedies."

Google's global head of regulatory affairs, Lee-Anne Mulholland, said the EU decision is "wrong" and the firm will appeal.

"It imposes an unjustified fine and requires changes that will hurt thousands of European businesses by making it harder for them to make money," Mulholland said. "There's nothing anticompetitive in providing services for ad buyers and sellers, and there are more alternatives to our services than ever before."

The case dates back to 2021 when the EU first opened a probe into Google to assess whether the tech giant favors its own online display ad technology services.

The news comes after Reuters reported earlier this week that the Commission had delayed the fine as regulators were waiting for the U.S. to cut tariffs on European cars as part of a trade deal.

The outlook seems to be getting worse for job seekers.

The U.S. economy added just 22,000 jobs in August, below expectations, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.

Meanwhile, a data revision showed the economy lost 13,000 jobs in June — the first month of job losses since December 2020. That loss ends the consecutive-job-growth streak that had lasted 53 months, from January 2021 through May 2025, according to Daniel Zhao, chief economist at Glassdoor, a career site.

Outside of the pandemic, the U.S. economy hasn't added this few jobs in the first eight months of a year since 2010, around the Great Recession, wrote Laura Ullrich, director of economic research for North America at Indeed.

"August's Employment Report confirmed that the labour market has headed off a cliff-edge," Bradley Saunders, a North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note Friday.

The report piles on top of other data issued this week showing a frozen labor market for job seekers, economists said.

In July, the number of unemployed people eclipsed the number of job openings for the first time since April 2021, according to BLS data issued Wednesday.

Employers have been hiring at the slowest pre-pandemic pace since about 2013. Meanwhile, layoffs have been low by historical standards, suggesting employers are in a holding pattern amid economic uncertainty and policy changes like tariffs, economists said.

Of course, the unemployment rate — which is at its highest in almost four years — is still at a "perfectly healthy level" relative to historical standards, Saunders wrote.

Hiring in certain sectors like healthcare and hospitality also remains "decent," Ullrich wrote. But there's risk ahead that healthcare hiring slows further amid reduced federal Medicaid and social assistance funding in coming months and years, she wrote.

All told, it's a "really challenging" environment for jobseekers, said Mandi Woodruff-Santos, a career coach.

"Think of the worst game of musical chairs you ever played, where there are 12 chairs and they've let 100 people go after those 12 chairs," she said. "That's kind of how it feels these days."

While it's harder for workers to find new jobs right now, there are ways to enhance the odds of success, Woodruff-Santos said.

Investing time and energy into building professional relationships and networks is key, she said. Those relationships may help get your foot in the door when a job opportunity becomes available, she said.

Find ways to show up at events with people in your industry, whether individuals you're meeting for the first time or with colleagues, she said.

Even sending emails to former college professors and teachers could be productive, Indeed's Ullrich told CNBC.

It's also important to keep your skills "sharp," by staying current on new software your industry may be using, for example, Woodruff-Santos said.

Show off the skills and knowledge you already have to your professional network, leveraging online platforms like LinkedIn to talk about what you do or are passionate about, she added. It's a good way to get attention from people who may not remember you.

"You can create your own platform," Woodruff-Santos said. "Use your voice."

The main thing is to keep "moving forward and doing something," perhaps by getting a part-time job in the meantime or broadening your job search to sectors in which your skills are transferrable, Ullrich said. Even volunteer opportunities can look like work experience on a resume, which may show hiring managers you are adaptive, she added.

Additionally, don't overlook "pivoting in place," Woodruff-Santos said. Seek out opportunities to advance internally at your current company, whether taking on more responsibility, seeking a promotion or shadowing someone to pick up new skill sets, she said. There are ways to be entrepreneurial in your current job to set you up for future success, she said.

"What people really need right now is patience," Woodruff-Santos said.

"You'll start to feel like there's no hope, but you can't let that cloud weigh you down," she said — lean on colleagues, friends, peers and coaching communities to help keep you going.

There is more than enough focus on Wall Street about what the Fed will do next, and Friday's weak nonfarm payrolls report will add to expectations for a rate cut. But maybe there is not enough planning among investors about what they should do to preserve the hefty gains embedded in market portfolios since the April low gave way to a new S&P 500 record. A rate cut is typically seen as a good thing for stocks, but a weakening labor market is also a sign that broader trouble for the economy could be ahead.

Global equities are at all-time highs, 401(k) and IRA millionaire account numbers have surged to their own record, flows into equity ETFs are picking up, and investor sentiment data is getting "a little hotter," according to Strategas Securities' technical strategist Todd Sohn, all signs that there could be a tipping point ahead for the market where bullishness becomes its own sign of overconfidence. But in Sohn's view, we're not there yet. September has had some rocky trading days already, and its long-term track record as a market month going back decades is not good, but "the real lull," if it comes, will happen further into Q4, he said.

"That's when people can get hit with a speed bump like April, maybe not as quick or as big of a drawdown," Sohn shared on this week's "ETF Edge." But he stressed that there are "no signs of massive risk yet."

The market initially headed higher on Friday to yet another new record as traders bet a rate cut is coming, but then gave up those gains.

Fed chair Jerome Powell has himself signaled that a rate cut may be ahead, but that isn't really signaling anything the market didn't already know, and according to Bryant VanCronkhite, Allspring Global Investments' senior portfolio manager and co-head of its special global equity team — who joined Sohn on "ETF Edge" — the market may be overpricing the odds of a Fed rate cut even with the weakening labor market. Inflation, with core CPI at 3.1% in July, remains "safely above target," he said — a reference to the Fed's longstanding policy approach of aiming for 2% inflation — and the uncertainty related to tariff impact on prices throughout the economy gives the Fed more reason to wait for more data before committing to a big change in policy.

That's a long way of saying that given the wiggle room still possible within the Fed's timing for a cut, and the uncertain economic outlook tied to the trade war, VanCronkhite and Sohn both say it is a good time for investors to take a look at defensive options with the stock market that may be underrepresented in their portfolios. It doesn't mean a major change in how an overall portfolio is constructed, but some tweaks on the edges to insulate overall returns from any damage that could be in the cards for the recent equity winners. They broke down that analysis into a few key points for investors to consider.

1. Nothing new here, but your portfolio still likely has too much techFor years, investors have been warned that mega-cap tech stocks have become too dominant in the cap-weighted S&P 500, and that problem has not gone away, with Sohn noting that the weighting of the top eight mega-cap stocks is now close to 40% of the index (in an index of 500 stocks). The tech sector, as a whole, is currently 31% of the index as measured by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF.

Nvidia, the biggest of them all, was lower on Friday, its sixth losing day out of the last seven, and on track for its worst week since April, and fourth-consecutive losing week, according to CNBC data.

Sohn says the first step in dealing with tech concentration risk is for investors to make sure they don't have a core stock market index fund in addition to large-cap growth and tech stock growth funds, which in the end, are all more or less replicating the same exposure and risk profile. If there is any tilt in the future to value stocks, that composition of a portfolio will exacerbate the pain for investors.

It should be said, this concentration warning has been issued for years and the mega-cap, tech-led stock market has mostly continued up and to the right. Nevertheless, it makes sense to evaluate a portfolio's overall concentration risk with the prospect of major changes in rate policy and overall economic conditions ahead. So, where to look?

2. Value and defensive stocks have been left behind, and that leaves opportunity ahead

Sohn and VanCronkhite both say that heading into 2026 it makes sense for investors to reposition ahead of any tilt in the market cycle towards value. "Maybe not the bulk of a portfolio," Sohn said, but from his technical lens on the market, looking at the stocks and sectors that have not participated in the recent gains, corners of the stock market that have, in effect, been in their own bear market or stuck in a narrow trading range over the past few years. Sohn says that "leaves us with lots of opportunities away from tech."

"Now is the time to begin shifting and broadening exposure," said VanCronkhite. "Take some capital out of the past winners, like tech and financials," he said.

3. Where exactly to move market money, starting with health care

Sohn said there has been "absolutely no demand for defensives" like health care, and VanCronkhite pointed to industrials and materials.

"Buy something different" from among the "desolate" sectors of the market, Sohn said, adding that transports and small-caps are, on a relative basis at least, at attractive valuations.

Health care, in particular, is a focus for both ETF strategists. It has also been a recent focus for Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.

While there are significant political and cyclical issues for the health care sector, VanCronkhite described it as "being ignored" right now by the market.

"There has been a mass exodus from health care," said Sohn, referring to flows out of the health care sector as its performance relative to the S&P 500 has hit "bottom-decile" on a historical basis. As a result, it would be "hard to get much worse for health care," he said.

Sohn conceded that for health care to do better, the current market leaders will need to do worse. There won't be any "sustained" move in health care without a cost for "everything else." He is not betting that there is any wholesale move into health care anytime soon because that would require a breakdown in the broader market. But he says it still makes sense "as a differentiation hedge going forward, especially because no one is there."

In this article

Broadcom shares soared 11% on Friday after the chipmaker said on its earnings call that it had secured a new $10 billion customer. Analysts quickly pointed to OpenAI.

Following a better-than-expected earnings report late Thursday, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan told analysts that a fourth large customer had put in orders for $10 billion in custom artificial intelligence chips, which the company calls XPUs.

"One of these prospects released production orders to Broadcom, and we have accordingly characterized them as a qualified customer for XPUs," Tan said. He added that the order increased Broadcom's forecast for AI revenue next year, when shipments will begin.

Analysts at Mizuho, Cantor Fitzgerald and KeyBanc all said they think AI startup OpenAI is the customer. The Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the partnership, that the two companies co-designed a chip that will hit the market next year.

OpenAI declined to comment on the report.

While Broadcom doesn't name its large web-scale customers, analysts have said dating back to last year that its first three clients were Google, Meta and TikTok parent ByteDance.

"During the call, the company surprised us by noting that it had secured a $10B order from a fourth XPU customer (we believe this is OpenAI), adding significant upside to the company's three current XPU customers (Google, Meta, and ByteDance)," analysts at Cantor wrote in a note late Thursday. "Shipments are expected to commence in 2026."

Broadcom's stock has been on a tear of late as the company has joined Nvidia at the front of the race to build the kinds of processors and infrastructures needed for massive AI workloads. The stock is up about 130% in the past year, lifting Broadcom's market cap past $1.6 trillion.

For the fiscal third quarter, Broadcom reported earnings and revenue that topped estimates. The company said it expects $17.4 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, higher than the $17.02 billion projected by Wall Street analysts, with AI revenue reaching $6.2 billion.

But news of an incoming $10 billion customer is what got Wall Street excited.

Tan said on the call that "immediate and fairly substantial demand" boosts the outlook for next year, "and really changes our thinking of what 2026 would be starting to look like."

The company didn't provide specific guidance for next year, but Tan suggested that growth in its AI could be above the 50% to 60% range he'd offered on the prior call.

Analysts at Mizuho raised their AI revenue growth estimate for next year to 76% up from about 60%, which would bring the total to $35 billion. Total revenue for the year ending in October 2026 is expected to increase about 30% to $81.8 billion from $63.1 billion this fiscal year, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG.

In addition to hardware, Broadcom has a large software business, keyed by its $61 billion acquisition of server virtualization software vendor VMware in 2023. Revenue in the infrastructure software business, which includes VMWare, rose 43% to $6.79 billion.

Broadcom shares soared 11% on Friday after the chipmaker said on its earnings call that it had secured a new $10 billion customer. Analysts quickly pointed to OpenAI.

Following a better-than-expected earnings report late Thursday, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan told analysts that a fourth large customer had put in orders for $10 billion in custom artificial intelligence chips, which the company calls XPUs.

"One of these prospects released production orders to Broadcom, and we have accordingly characterized them as a qualified customer for XPUs," Tan said. He added that the order increased Broadcom's forecast for AI revenue next year, when shipments will begin.

Analysts at Mizuho, Cantor Fitzgerald and KeyBanc all said they think AI startup OpenAI is the customer. The Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the partnership, that the two companies co-designed a chip that will hit the market next year.

OpenAI declined to comment on the report.

While Broadcom doesn't name its large web-scale customers, analysts have said dating back to last year that its first three clients were Google, Meta and TikTok parent ByteDance.

"During the call, the company surprised us by noting that it had secured a $10B order from a fourth XPU customer (we believe this is OpenAI), adding significant upside to the company's three current XPU customers (Google, Meta, and ByteDance)," analysts at Cantor wrote in a note late Thursday. "Shipments are expected to commence in 2026."

Broadcom's stock has been on a tear of late as the company has joined Nvidia at the front of the race to build the kinds of processors and infrastructures needed for massive AI workloads. The stock is up about 130% in the past year, lifting Broadcom's market cap past $1.6 trillion.

For the fiscal third quarter, Broadcom reported earnings and revenue that topped estimates. The company said it expects $17.4 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, higher than the $17.02 billion projected by Wall Street analysts, with AI revenue reaching $6.2 billion.

But news of an incoming $10 billion customer is what got Wall Street excited.

Tan said on the call that "immediate and fairly substantial demand" boosts the outlook for next year, "and really changes our thinking of what 2026 would be starting to look like."

The company didn't provide specific guidance for next year, but Tan suggested that growth in its AI could be above the 50% to 60% range he'd offered on the prior call.

Analysts at Mizuho raised their AI revenue growth estimate for next year to 76% up from about 60%, which would bring the total to $35 billion. Total revenue for the year ending in October 2026 is expected to increase about 30% to $81.8 billion from $63.1 billion this fiscal year, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG.

In addition to hardware, Broadcom has a large software business, keyed by its $61 billion acquisition of server virtualization software vendor VMware in 2023. Revenue in the infrastructure software business, which includes VMWare, rose 43% to $6.79 billion.

White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett called Friday's new jobs report number "a little bit disappointing," but added, "I expect it's going to revise up."

Hassett's comments on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" came shortly after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that nonfarm payrolls rose by only 22,000 in August.

That is less than one-third of the 75,000 new jobs expected by economists who were surveyed by Dow Jones ahead of the report.

When Hassett was asked if he was concerned about a sluggish hiring rate, he responded with a personal anecdote.

"Members of my family have been hired," he said.

"Both of them started their new jobs about a week ago. And so you are seeing that people are being hired." 

Hassett later Friday told Fox News that the BLS has been "struggling with bad response rates" to surveys about jobs.

He also pointed to a Goldman Sachs study on Thursday, which he said shows that August seasonal jobs reports for a decade or more have had to be revised upward by 70,000 or so jobs.

President Donald Trump on Aug. 1 fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, accusing her of manipulating jobs report data for political purposes.

McEntarfer was terminated hours after the BLS reported that just 73,000 nonfarm jobs were added in July, which was below market expectations.

The BLS on the same day sharply revised downward the previously reported job numbers for June and May.

Earlier Friday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC's "Squawk Box" that BLS jobs reports will be more accurate with McEntarfer gone, because "you'll take out the people who are just trying to create noise against the president."

Anthropic's Dario Amodei is doubling down on his warning to entry-level workers.

In an interview on BBC Radical with Amol Rajan published on Thursday, the CEO said repetitive-but-variable tasks in law firms, consulting, administration, and finance could be eliminated in the next one to five years.

"Specifically, if we look at jobs like entry-level white, you know, I think of people who work at law firms, like first-year associates, there's a lot of document review. It's very repetitive, but every example is different. That's something that AI is quite good at," he said.

He also said many CEOs privately view AI as a way to cut costs — not just "augment" workers.

"I think, to be honest, a large fraction of them would like to be able to use it to cut costs to employ less people," he said.

Amodei stressed that his one-to-five-year timeline isn't about distant possibilities but about what's already emerging.

The technology, he said, is "already very good at" entry-level work and "quickly getting better now."

He added that his conviction stems in part from conversations with CEOs already rolling out AI tools, many of whom have said they want to use AI to reduce head count.

Amodei has been sounding the alarm bell for months.

In May, he told Axios he believes AI could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level office jobs within five years, potentially pushing unemployment to 10-20%, and that industry and governments are "sugarcoating" what's coming.

He's also argued that the automative wave won't be limited to back-office work.

In March, Amodei said at a Council of Foreign Relations event that AI could write 90% of software code within three to six months and "essentially all" of it within a year, with human engineers increasingly focused on design constraints rather than line-by-line programming.

The warnings have sparked a backlash and fueled a debate across the tech industry.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed Amodei's bleak outlook at VivaTech in Paris in June, saying he disagreed with "almost everything" the Anthropic chief had said and predicting AI would change jobs rather than erase them.

OpenAI's Sam Altman struck a similar note, saying society won't allow half of jobs to vanish and that new, better roles will emerge.

Others remain divided. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said he sees no evidence of a near-term jobs apocalypse, while Ford CEO Jim Farley forecast that AI would replace "literally half" of US white-collar workers.

Tesla is asking investors to approve yet another outsized pay plan for CEO Elon Musk, according to a financial filing out Friday.

The total package is worth about $975 billion based on the maximum payout, assuming share count remains.

The proposed plan for Musk, already the world's wealthiest individual, consists of 12 tranches of shares to be granted if Tesla hits certain milestones over the next decade. It would also give Musk increased voting power over the EV maker and aspiring robotics titan, which he has publicly demanded since early 2024.

Tesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin the plan was designed to keep the CEO "motivated and focused on delivering for the company."

"If he performs, if he hits the super ambitious milestones that are in the plan then he gets equity — it's 1% for each half a trillion dollars of market cap, plus operational milestones he has to hit in order to do that," Denholm said on CNBC's "Squawk Box."

The full award would give Musk more than 423 million additional shares. He currently holds about a 13% stake in the company.

Denholm confirmed that the Tesla CEO pay plan, if approved by shareholders, would not put any limit on where and how Musk spends his time or require him to spend any minimum number of hours per week on Tesla business.

To obtain the first award in the plan, Musk and Tesla would need to almost double their current market cap to reach $2 trillion. The final benchmark is reaching an $8.5 trillion market cap.

The operational milestones in the 2025 CEO Performance Award include: 20 million Tesla vehicles delivered, ​10 million active FSD Subscriptions, ​1 million robots delivered, ​1 million Robotaxis in commercial operation and a series of adjusted EBITDA benchmarks.

Musk said at Tesla's 2024 annual meeting that Optimus robots could make Tesla a $25 trillion company. This week, he said roughly 80% of Tesla's value could eventually come from Optimus but offered no specifics.

The board's pitch for a ten-year Musk pay plan comes as his attention remains divided across his other ventures, and the legal battle over his 2018 pay drags on.

Musk's collection of companies includes aerospace and defense contractor SpaceX, drilling venture The Boring Company, health tech company Neuralink and the artificial intelligence venture xAI, which has merged with his social network, X.

Tesla is in the midst of a multi-quarter sales slump due to its aging lineup, competition from Chinese automakers, and a consumer backlash to Musk's incendiary political rhetoric and involvement with the Trump administration.

Tesla also said in the filing Friday that it will ask shareholders at the Nov. 6 meeting to vote on whether the company should invest in Musk's newest venture, xAI.

Musk first floated the idea publicly with an informal poll on X last July, asking whether Tesla should invest $5 billion into xAI.

Founded in early 2023 in Nevada, xAI merged with Musk's social network X earlier this year. The company now operates a massive data center in Memphis, and plans to build out another facility there to help train and run its large language models and a chatbot called Grok.

The new pay proposal for Musk comes after the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled last year that his 2018 pay plan was excessive, had been improperly granted by the Tesla board and must be rescinded.

In that case, Tornetta v. Musk, a judge found that the Tesla CEO had controlled pay negotiations at the automaker, and his board of directors failed to give shareholders information that they were legally entitled to before telling them they should vote to approve Musk's performance-based pay plan.

The 2018 pay plan was worth about $56 billion when it vested, and was the largest public executive compensation plan in U.S. history. 

Like the new proposed pay plan, Tesla had to hit a series of benchmarks, both market cap related and operational, for Musk to get his options.

The amount of compensation that Tesla had paid its directors, including Denholm, was a point of consideration for the judge in the Tornetta matter. Denholm said in the trial that during her time on the Tesla board, she had received compensation worth $280 million, calling it "life-changing wealth."

Musk, Denholm and other allies of the Tesla CEO have criticized the Delaware court's decision, and Tesla even moved its site of incorporation from Delaware to Texas in response to the verdict.

Tesla attempted to "ratify" the 2018 CEO pay plan after Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick voided it, asking shareholders to vote to restore it in retrospect of her ruling. McCormick said such a vote did not remedy the earlier problems and upheld her decision in December 2024.

The case is now on appeal in Delaware.

Renewables giant Orsted on Friday received approval from shareholders for its emergency 60 billion Danish kroner ($9.4 billion) rights issue, shortly after issuing a fresh profit warning.

Orsted's pitch to raise the capital comes at a time of profound industry turmoil, amid sustained attacks by U.S. President Donald Trump on offshore wind projects.

The White House abruptly ordered the company to halt work on Revolution Wind off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut last month. The fully permitted project is 80% complete and would provide enough power for more than 350,000 homes across both states.

Orsted has since sued the Trump administration in a bid to restart construction on the windfarm.

In a statement following Friday's extraordinary general meeting, the company said its closely watched rights issue had been approved by shareholders.

Investors appeared to welcome the reprieve. Orsted shares, which have fallen nearly 90% from a 2021 peak, were last seen up around 2.9%.

Earlier in the day, Orsted cut its full-year operating profit outlook following lower-than-normal offshore wind speeds during July and August.

Analysts at Citi said the lowering of Orsted's full-year guidance was "relatively minor" against the backdrop of other company developments, referring to both the U.S. lawsuit and the rights issue. The bank's analysts nevertheless described the update as "unhelpful."

German auto giant BMW is doubling down on its brand value, as it prepares to roll out a fleet of software-controlled electric vehicles to take the fight to Chinese rivals and Elon Musk's Tesla.

Speaking to CNBC ahead of next week's Munich car show, where struggling European automakers are expected to face off with Chinese newcomers, BMW CEO Oliver Zipse introduced the world premiere of the iX3 sports utility vehicle.

The SUV is the first production model to be developed as part of BMW's long-awaited Neue Klasse platform of EVs.

The Munich-headquartered company wants to release more than 40 new and updated vehicles onto the market by 2027, as it seeks to keep pace with competitors.

Zipse told CNBC's Annette Weisbach on Friday that the iX3 debut is the result of a five-year journey.

"It is the most important and the biggest single investment we've done ever, and it shows the path into the future. And what you see here is only the first car of a series of models, which employs the same technologies," Zipse said.

BMW has sought to revolutionize the digital offering of its new models by focusing on a so-called "superbrain architecture," which replaces hardware with a centralized computer system.

The company says an "all-new digital nervous system" for the Neue Klasse platform has more than 20 times the computing power of its current vehicle generation.

These digital platforms provide the computing capacity for automated driving and infotainment functions, as well as basic car functions, such as climate control and comfort features.

The push to highlight the firm's technological development comes as legacy European car manufacturers scramble to close the gap with leading players of software-defined vehicles. U.S. EV-maker Tesla, alongside Chinese manufacturers including Xpeng and BYD, currently dominate this space.

"There is fierce competition, especially price competition in China. There are a lot of new players in the market [and] there is a tough fight about market share," Zipse said.

On the other hand, Zipse said the company has just over 3% market share worldwide and doesn't have to compete in every market segment. What will help in the areas that it does compete, Zipse said, is the firm's brand value.

"BMW is a promise. The brand is a promise to have the highest possible quality, to have the latest technology, and to be very customer orientated. I think that is very important," Zipse said.

Shares of BMW are up around 13% year-to-date.

OpenAI has announced it is developing an AI-centered jobs platform as part of broader efforts to expand AI literacy, and as the company grows its consumer and business-facing AI applications.

The ChatGPT maker's "OpenAI Jobs Platform" will utilize AI to help connect qualified job candidates to companies, which could put it in competition with Microsoft's LinkedIn. 

OpenAI and Microsoft have an uneasy partnership, with Microsoft formally labeling the AI startup as a competitor in search and news advertising in its annual filing last year. Microsoft is OpenAI's biggest investor, having reportedly poured $13 billion in the company.

The news was announced by Fidji Simo, chief executive officer of applications and the former head of Instacart, in a blog post on Thursday. 

"Importantly, the jobs platform won't just be a way for big companies to attract more talent. It will have a track dedicated to helping local businesses compete, and local governments find the AI talent they need to better serve their constituents," Simo said.

She didn't elaborate further on details regarding the platform, but a company spokesperson told TechCrunch that it expects to launch the service by mid-2026. 

Additionally, OpenAI will introduce a new certification program in connection with its "OpenAI Academy," an online learning platform that teaches workers how to use AI on the job better. This could also put it in competition with LinkedIn's learning platform, which also offers video courses across business, technology and creative fields, with certifications.

"[W]e're going to expand the Academy by offering certifications for different levels of AI fluency, from the basics of using AI at work all the way up to AI-custom jobs and prompt engineering," Simo said, adding that the program will utilize ChatGPT's Study mode. The study feature turns the chatbot into a teacher that questions, hints and provides feedback, instead of giving direct answers.

Organizations will be able to make the certificate part of their own learning and development programs, with OpenAI already working with Walmart, the largest private employer in the U.S. OpenAI said it plans to certify 10 million Americans by 2030.

The plans come amid fears about how AI is impacting the labor market. Business leaders like Salesforce's Marc Benioff have recently announced layoffs due to AI, while new studies have linked the technology to mass job loss for certain workers.  

Simo acknowledged the "disruptive" force of AI in her post, saying jobs and companies will look different and need to adapt. 

"[W]hat we can do is help more people become fluent in AI and connect them with companies that need their skills, to give people more economic opportunities. 

Recent research from labor market data company Lightcast found that roles that require AI skills pay higher salaries on average than those that don't. 

The new initiatives were also said to come as part of OpenAI's "commitment to the White House's efforts toward expanding AI literacy." 

The company has been strengthening ties with Washington, launching a new offering called OpenAI for Government on June 16, the same day it was awarded a contract of up to $200 million by the U.S. Department of Defense. OpenAI is also part of the $500 billion Stargate project, which aims to invest in AI infrastructure in the U.S. over the next four years. 

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was part of a group of tech leaders that met with U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday to discuss topics including the development of artificial intelligence. 

Before the dinner, first lady Melania Trump made a speech highlighting the importance of AI in education and American progress, but that "we must manage AI's growth responsibly."

At a White House dinner with tech executives, President Donald Trump congratulated Google CEO Sundar Pichai and co-founder Sergey Brin following Alphabet's favorable antitrust ruling on Tuesday.

"Well you had a very good day yesterday," Trump said, calling on Pichai at the Thursday evening dinner. "Google had a very good day yesterday. Do you want to talk about that big day you had yesterday?"

Alphabet this week added $230 billion to its market cap after avoiding a breakup in a landmark antitrust case brought by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2020. Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search last year. Deciding on the penalties this week, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled against the most severe consequences proposed by the DOJ, causing shares of the search company to jump.

"I'm glad it's over," Pichai responded to Trump, causing an eruption of laughter from the other table guests.

"It's a long process," Pichai said. "Appreciate that your administration had a constructive dialogue, and we were able to get it to some resolution." 

"Right," Trump replied.

"The AI moment is one of the most transformative moments any of us have ever seen or will see in our lifetimes, so making sure the U.S. is at the forefront — and I think your administration is investing a lot," Pichai said. "Already the AI action plan under your leadership I think is a great start, and we look forward to working together. And thanks for your leadership."

The plan Pichai referred to is the administration's "Winning the AI Race: America's AI Action Plan," launched in July, which claims to identify 90 federal policy actions across three pillars: the acceleration of innovation, building of artificial intelligence infrastructure, and leadership in international diplomacy and security. Part of that plan includes a July executive order that says AI models should not incorporate "Woke AI" or "ideological dogmas such as DEI," meaning diversity, equity and inclusion.  

Google is also in discussions with Trump's lawyers for an ongoing lawsuit that the president filed more than four years ago, accusing the online video platform YouTube of unlawful censorship. The lawsuit stemmed from the suspension of Trump's accounts on social media sites after the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot.

Earlier Thursday, Pichai attended the White House "AI Education Taskforce" event hosted by first lady Melania Trump.

Trump interrupted Pichai's Thursday evening response to say "Biden was the one who prosecuted that lawsuit, you know that right?" Trump said, referring to the search monopoly case.

The search case was brought by the DOJ while Trump was in office during his first term. Pichai did not correct him.

WATCH: Alphabet antitrust ruling the 'dream scenario' for Google, says Wedbush's Dan Ives

Argentina's President Javier Milei is scrambling to unlock the South American country's copper potential, seeking to capitalize on surging global demand amid a push toward electrification and renewable energy.

Milei, a self-described anarcho capitalist who won a shock election in 2023, has unveiled a series of tough reformist measures in an effort to stabilize the traditionally volatile economy and "Make Argentina Great Again."

As part of this push, Milei's administration hopes the mining sector can play a key role, particularly in regard to copper and lithium.

One of the libertarian president's flagship policies has been to introduce the Large Investment Incentive Regime, or RIGI, a scheme designed to provide generous tax, trade and foreign exchange benefits to large-scale investors over a 30-year period.

To date, 20 projects worth just over $30 billion have sought entry into Argentina's RIGI, according to global risk intelligence firm Verisk Maplecroft, three-quarters of which are in mining. Copper alone is estimated to represent $16 billion, more than all non-mining sectors combined.

Major players including BHP, Glencore and Rio Tinto are among those making bold bets on Argentina's copper and lithium potential, with top executives from Glencore and Rio Tinto recently traveling to meet with Milei on a trip to Buenos Aires.

Ro Dhawan, CEO of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), a trade body representing roughly one-third of the global industry, described Argentina as "arguably the most exciting new copper story today."

There are other countries and jurisdictions which may be more geologically rich, Dhawan said, but not one that sits at the intersection of a stable domestic political environment, and the provision of basic infrastructure and facilities and sufficient other investments complementary to the mining industry.

Among the most notable copper projects in Argentina is BHP and Lundin's Vicuna joint venture.

Situated along the Chile-Argentina border, the Vicuna District is regarded as a geologically prospective region. Indeed, the deposits at Vicuna's Josemaria and Filo del Sol mines are estimated to contain 13 million metric tons of measured copper and 25 million tons of inferred copper.

For ICMM's Dhawan, the potential significance of BHP and Lundin's Vicuna copper project is extraordinary.

"It's of the same importance to copper as Western Australia was to iron ore — and I don't say that lightly. It is a bold comparison to make but it is one that I do genuinely believe in," Dhawan said.

A spokesperson for BHP and Lundin's Vicuna copper project said last month that the two companies intend to apply to receive benefits under RIGI, Reuters reported.

Argentina's renewed mining focus comes as global copper demand is expected to skyrocket over the coming years, dramatically outstripping supply amid an artificial intelligence boom and a shift away from fossil fuels.

Analysts at consultancy CRU Group have estimated that the pipeline of Argentina's potential copper projects could represent a roughly $47 billion opportunity for the economy through to 2040.

This cumulative impact is comparable to the record $44-billion bailout loan Argentina received from the International Monetary Fund.

A government spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment when contacted by CNBC.

Asked whether Argentina's long history of boom-and-bust economic cycles means Argentina's copper dreams could crumble once again, ICMM's Dhawan said: "Where doesn't have that risk is the question I would ask?"

He added: "I just think that people have adjusted to a new normal expectation of quite significant volatility and that has almost worked in Argentina's favor. I think two things have happened, I think Argentina's stability has gone up and the world's stability has gone down."

Dhawan said it's not possible to predict which way Argentina will go, but investors appear to be prepared for different political and economic scenarios and that sovereign risk has been priced in.

Mariano Machado, principal analyst for the Americas at Verisk Maplecroft, said that while Argentina does possess the minerals needed to reshape its export base, "policy consistency and social licence will determine whether this is Argentina's mining moment or another mirage."

"The country's policy swings have kept investment below potential levels, and the government's failure to persuade lawmakers from the opposition Union for the Homeland (UP) to vote for the RIGI means there is a risk that less private sector-friendly sectors will dispute its provisions if they make a comeback," Machado told CNBC by email.

"A new mining boom could also stoke anti-mining activism," he added. "Issues around water, protection of glaciers and broader human rights underscore persistent challenges for companies to secure durable social licence to operate."

President Donald Trump hosted a who's who dinner for some of the biggest names in tech — and the CEOs had glowing remarks for the president.

The dinner guest list includes Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, alongside more than a dozen other executives from leading AI and tech firms.

According to a pool report, with more than 30 chairs around the table, guests were encouraged to speak and went around the table praising the president.

Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO and once the face of Trump's White House DOGE office, did not attend, though the White House said a representative for Musk would be there. Musk had a public falling out with the president earlier this year. Trump has said he thinks Musk will return to the GOP fold.

The administration's new Artificial Intelligence Education task force, chaired by first lady Melania Trump, held an event earlier in the day that was attended by top executives of Google and OpenAI.

Here is a list of tech leaders spotted at the White House.

Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, is collaborating with the White House on a $500 billion project to build more AI infrastructure. The endeavor, dubbed Project Stargate, is jointly developed by SoftBank and Oracle.

"Thank you for being such a pro-business, pro-innovation president. It's a very refreshing change," Altman said to Trump over dinner. "I think it's going to set us up for a long period of leading the world, and that wouldn't be happening without your leadership."

OpenAI also launched a special initiative for government adoption of AI. The US Department of Defense awarded OpenAI a $200 million contract to develop AI tools for military and national security applications.

Trump once threatened to jail Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. They have since formed an alliance. At the dinner, he was seated next to the president.

Zuckerberg ended a collaboration with third-party fact-checking organizations earlier this year, shortly after Trump signed an executive order banning federal officials from engaging in censorship.

During the dinner event, Zuckerberg thanked Trump for hosting and said that "all the companies here are building huge investments in the country in order to build their data centers and infrastructure to power the next wave of innovation."

Earlier this year, Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, pledged to invest $600 billion in US manufacturing during Trump's push for tariffs. In August, Cook presented Trump with a glass plaque mounted on a 24-karat gold base as a gift.

"I want to thank you for setting the tone such that we could make a major investment in the United States and have some key manufacturing, advanced manufacturing here," Cook said during Thursday night's dinner event. "I think that says a lot about your focus and your leadership and your focus on innovation."

"I also want to thank you for helping companies around the world," he added. "This is a very key, key thing, and I really enjoy working the administration on those topics as well, because I think they're so important to the country. I want to thank the First Lady focusing on education."

Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently announced that the company will commit $1 billion to education and job training in the US. During the task force meeting, Pichai also announced that $150 million of the billion-dollar fund will be dedicated toward AI-focused grants.

Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates was seated next to the first lady at the dinner.

Gates previously tried to convince the Trump administration to preserve critical global health programs and to reconsider cuts to USAID. The last time he publicly sat down for dinner with Trump was shortly after the 2024 election at Mar-a-Lago.

Gates again pushed for both advancements and access to healthcare and advocated for AI's role in curing diseases like sickle cell or HIV.

"But I think the thing that ties my first career that I still spend some time on, because AI is so phenomenal, and my second career is innovation, and innovating in health, in areas like vaccines or gene editing, and the president and I are talking about taking American innovation to the next level to cure and even eradicate some of these diseases," Gates said.

"AI, for our foundation, is that we want a doctor for everyone in Africa through AI, we want farmers to have incredible advice, and kids to have a chance to learn," Gates added. "So the work being done by the people at this table is changing the world."

Despite disagreeing over funding cuts, Gates thanked Trump for his "incredible leadership" over the White House dinner and said that people at that table are "changing the world."

Alexandr Wang, the 28-year-old former CEO of Scale AI, was in attendance. Meta invested $14.3 billion in the AI startup for a 49% non-voting stake to bring Wang into the fold.

Wang joined Meta as its chief AI officer as part of the company's AI spending spree and heads Meta Superintelligence Labs.

In January, Wang also wrote a letter to Trump outlining the need for the US to invest in AI.

Lisa Su, the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, has publicly endorsed the Trump administration's AI Action Plan. The Trump administration also recently announced negotiations with AMD and Nvidia, which involve a proposed 15% levy on GPU exports to China.

Chamath Palihapitiya, the founder of Social Capital and part of the "All-In" podcast, was spotted outside of the White House ahead of the AI education event. Palihapitiya last toured key areas of the White House, such as the West Wing, in March.

David Sacks, a South African-American entrepreneur and investor in internet technology firms, was named the chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology in December 2024. He is otherwise known as the White House AI and crypto czar.

Cameron Wilson is the president of Code.org, a prominent nonprofit dedicated to expanding access to K-12 computer science education in the US. As part of Google's AI education funding commitment, Code.org will receive $3 million from the company.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella thanked the president for bringing the group together and for "the policies that you have put in place for the United States to lead."

"I think that everything that you're doing in terms of setting in place the platform where the rest of the world can not only use our technology, but trust our technology more than any other alternative is perhaps the most important issue, and you, and you and your policies are really helping a lot," Nadella added. "So thank you very much."

Oops, something went wrong

Crypto venture capital firm Sora Ventures aims to raise $1 billion to help bolster Bitcoin treasuries in Asia, the firm announced on Friday. 

Starting with $200 million from partners and investors, the firm seeks to accumulate a further $800 million for BTC over the next six months. 

“This is the first time that Asia has seen a commitment of this magnitude toward building a network of Bitcoin treasury firms, with capital commitment towards Asia's first $1 billion treasury fund,” said Sora partner Luke Liu in a statement. 

The firm said its fund will act differently from other Bitcoin investment vehicles in the region, like the publicly traded firm Metaplanet, which holds 20,000 BTC worth more than $2.2 billion on its balance sheet. 

Instead, Sora's fund will act as a “central pool of institutional capital designed to both support these existing firms and fuel the creation of similar treasuries globally,” the firm said. 

Sora Ventures did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for details on exactly how its fund will operate. 

The Taiwan-based firm aims to put Asia on par with western markets as it comes to institutional adoption of Bitcoin. 

“Asia has been one of the most important markets for the development of blockchain technology and Bitcoin. We have seen a rise in interest from institutions investing in Bitcoin treasuries in the U.S. and EU, while in Asia efforts have been relatively fragmented,” said Sora founder Jason Fang in a statement. 

“This is the first time in history that institutional money has come together, from local to regional, and now to a global stage.”

Ethereum ICO Whale Awakens, Stakes $645 Million ETH

Last year, Sora invested in Metaplanet, the largest Bitcoin treasury firm in Asia. In July, the firm participated in an acquisition of Thailand's DV8, a publicly traded firm now undertaking a Bitcoin treasury model. 

The Bitcoin treasury phenomenon first started with Michael Saylor and his business software firm Strategy in 2020. Now more than 300 entities hold the top crypto asset on its balance sheet, with more than 3.7 million BTC accounted for, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net. 

Bitcoin is up 1.2% in the last 24 hours and trading at $110,842.

A virtual commentator on technology and investing, created by AI, known for combining macro trends with startup stories.

- Aleo and Request Finance launch a private crypto payroll service using zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to address enterprise privacy and compliance challenges.

- The service encrypts transaction details (sender, receiver, amount) while enabling verifiable compliance via cryptographic view keys, reducing cross-border costs by 70–90%.

- This partnership targets the $1.2T global payroll market, aligning with growing institutional adoption of ZK technology for scalable, privacy-preserving enterprise solutions.

 

The enterprise blockchain space is undergoing a quiet revolution. As companies grapple with the dual demands of global compliance and data privacy, zero-knowledge (ZK) technology is emerging as a critical enabler. Aleo and Request Finance's collaboration to launch a private crypto payroll service exemplifies this shift, leveraging ZK proofs to address real-world pain points in enterprise payments. This partnership isn't just about innovation—it's a strategic response to the growing need for confidentiality, efficiency, and regulatory alignment in a digital-first economy.  

Traditional payroll systems, even when digitized, often expose sensitive data to intermediaries, auditors, and public ledgers. For global enterprises, this creates a paradox: transparency is necessary for compliance, but it risks exposing employee salaries, vendor contracts, and proprietary financial information. According to a report by Bitwave, 68% of enterprises cite data privacy as a top barrier to adopting blockchain for B2B payments [1]. Meanwhile, cross-border transactions incur high fees and delays, particularly for companies with distributed teams.  

Aleo's zero-knowledge infrastructure, combined with Request Finance's crypto payroll expertise, offers a novel solution. By using succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (SNARKs), the service encrypts transaction details—such as sender, receiver, and amount—while enabling verifiable proof of execution on-chain [1]. This means businesses can automate payroll and vendor payments without revealing sensitive data. For example, a multinational firm could pay employees in 30 countries while ensuring no individual's salary is visible to others, yet auditors can confirm compliance with local labor laws via cryptographic view keys [3].  

Aleo's “programmable privacy” model further enhances this. Unlike traditional blockchains, where privacy is an afterthought, Aleo's Record model encrypts balances and transaction histories by default [2]. This is achieved through a modified UTXO (unspent transaction output) framework, where only authorized parties can decrypt data using cryptographic keys. For enterprises, this translates to a system where privacy isn't compromised, but regulatory requirements are met through selective disclosure.  

The benefits are tangible. Request Finance, which has already processed over $1 billion in crypto transactions, brings operational expertise to the table [2]. Aleo's ZK infrastructure reduces transaction costs by 70–90% compared to traditional cross-border transfers, while eliminating the need for intermediaries [1]. For Web2 companies transitioning to Web3, this service bridges the gap between legacy banking standards and blockchain efficiency.  

Moreover, the partnership aligns with broader industry trends. Aleo's co-founder, Howard Wu, emphasized at Blockchain NEXUS 2025 that ZK technology is no longer a niche concept—it's a scalability and privacy enabler for mainstream adoption [2]. By addressing enterprise pain points, Aleo and Request Finance are positioning themselves to capture a significant share of the $1.2 trillion global payroll market, which is increasingly digitizing [3].  

The strategic adoption of ZK in enterprise payments isn't just theoretical. Aleo's recent collaboration with Google Cloud—where the tech giant runs an Aleo validator and hosts blockchain data on its Web3 portal—signals institutional confidence [1]. Meanwhile, Request Finance's existing client base, including Fortune 500 companies, provides immediate traction for the private payroll service.  

From an investment perspective, the partnership taps into two high-growth areas: enterprise blockchain adoption and ZK-based privacy solutions. Aleo's native token (ALEO) has seen a 300% increase in institutional wallet activity since January 2025, according to CoinMarketCap [4]. If the private payroll service gains traction, it could drive further demand for Aleo's infrastructure, creating a flywheel effect.  

While the potential is significant, challenges remain. Regulatory frameworks for ZK-based systems are still evolving, and enterprises may require time to trust encrypted ledgers for compliance. Additionally, the technical complexity of SNARKs could slow adoption among non-technical teams. However, Aleo's focus on developer education—such as its Privacy Virtual Hackathon—suggests a long-term strategy to build ecosystem support [1].  

Aleo and Request Finance's private crypto payroll service is more than a product—it's a blueprint for how ZK technology can solve real-world enterprise problems. By prioritizing privacy without sacrificing compliance or efficiency, they're addressing a critical gap in the digital economy. For investors, this collaboration highlights the growing importance of ZK in enterprise blockchain, offering a compelling case for strategic adoption. As global payroll systems continue to digitize, the winners will be those who can balance transparency with confidentiality—and Aleo and Request Finance are leading the charge.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, is a blockchain-powered platform for creating decentralized applications (dapps).

Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency. It's a global, decentralized network that enables smart contracts—self-executing programs on the blockchain—and decentralized applications, or dapps, that run without banks, governments, or big tech.

When programmer Vitalik Buterin published a “whitepaper” in late 2013 proposing a new kind of blockchain—not just for money but for programmable code—a revolution in digital finance began. Today, the Ethereum blockchain hosts decentralized applications like smart contracts, games, digital art, and assets worth billions.

Ultimately, many believe that Ethereum could underpin a re-imagining of how the internet works, dubbed Web3, in which control of the internet is disintermediated away from big companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and X.

This guide will help you understand the history of Ethereum, Buterin's big idea, and the role Ether plays in that vision.

The feature that set Ethereum apart from Bitcoin early on was the smart contract. A smart contract is a code stored and executed on the blockchain that runs automatically once its conditions are met.

Smart contracts are transparent, tamper-proof, and execute without relying on third parties. This makes them the backbone of everything built on Ethereum, from DeFi protocols to NFT marketplaces.

Russian/Canadian computer programmer Vitalik Buterin wrote the whitepaper that Ethereum is based on. However, the building of the network and community was helped along by a number of co-founders: Anthony Di Loria, Charles Hoskinson, Miha Alisie, Amir Chetrit, Joseph Lubin and Gavin Wood.

Development of the Ethereum network began in early 2014 under the Ethereum Foundation, with Gavin Wood publishing the technical “yellow paper” that defined the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

A crowdfunded token sale followed in mid-2014, raising funds through an initial coin offering, or ICO, that exchanged Bitcoin for Ether. The ICO raised over $18 million.

The network officially went live on July 30, 2015, launching as “Frontier”—a platform for developers to test and deploy decentralized applications.

When it first launched, Ethereum used the same Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism as Bitcoin, with cryptocurrency miners securing the network by solving complex cryptographic puzzles.

In September 2022, Ethereum switchted to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. Instead of mining, Ether is created through staking: validators lock up at least 32 ETH as collateral and are chosen to propose and verify new blocks. Honest participation earns them ETH rewards.

What is Proof of Stake? How it Differs From Proof of Work

This shift, known as “The Merge,” ended Proof-of-Work mining, making Ethereum more energy-efficient while allowing anyone with the required stake to help secure the network and earn rewards.

Blocks are still added about every 12 seconds, but ETH is now distributed as staking rewards, not mining rewards.

Ether (ETH), Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, pays for transactions, powers apps, and secures the network. Ether's sub-units, Gwei and Wei, are named after Wei Dai, an early pioneer of cryptocurrencies.

One of Ethereum's most radical innovations was the decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO. A DAO is a blockchain-based organization governed by smart contracts and community votes. Members typically hold tokens that grant them voting power on how the DAO operates and spends its funds.

The first major experiment was The DAO in 2016, which sought to operate as a decentralized venture capital fund. Investors pooled Ether, then voted collectively on how to allocate it. The project ended in disaster due to an infamous hack, but it demonstrated the potential of blockchains as platforms for decentralized governance.

What Is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)?

Since then, DAOs have grown into a vibrant sector. They range from DAO frameworks like Moloch and Aragon, to investment collectives like Syndicate, and governance DAOs such as MakerDAO, which manages a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, to social DAOs that organize communities online.

Supporters argue that DAOs could redefine corporate governance by replacing traditional hierarchies with code and community control. Critics warn that legal frameworks remain murky, and smart contract vulnerabilities pose risks. Still, DAOs remain one of the clearest examples of Ethereum enabling something that could not exist without it.

If Bitcoin is the gold of the cryptocurrency world, Ethereum is the oil that machines are powered on—but it has not been all smooth sailing.

Ethereum's first major crisis arrived in 2016 with the DAO hack, when attackers exploited a vulnerability to steal $50 million worth of Ether.

The community was split: some argued the blockchain's ledger should remain immutable, while others pushed to undo the damage. The decision to hard fork created two parallel blockchains—Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).

Ethereum also fueled the explosion of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, unique digital assets that prove ownership of items like art, music, or collectibles.

The breakthrough came in 2017 with the ERC-721 token standard, which let developers create unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.  NFTs began to clog the Ethereum network as users spent millions trading CryptoKitties, CryptoPunks, and more, showing both the appeal and the limits of the technology.

Beginner's Guide to NFTs: What Are Non-Fungible Tokens?

By 2021, NFTs had gone mainstream. Digital artist Beeple sold an NFT artwork for $69 million, and the Bored Ape Yacht Club launched. One of the most prominent NFT collections, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, is a collection of 10,000 primate-themed NFTs that became a cultural phenomenon, drawing celebrities and selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars each. At its height, in May 2022, all 10,000 BAYC NFTs collectively were valued over $1 billion.

Ethereum's smart contracts made this possible by encoding ownership and authenticity directly into the blockchain. The NFT boom exposed Ethereum's energy inefficiency, accelerating its shift away from the more energy-intensive Proof-of-Work algorithm.

Ethereum's biggest weakness? Scalability. At about 15 transactions per second, it cannot match Visa's tens of thousands. That bottleneck has often caused sky-high “gas fees,” or transaction costs.

To address this, developers began a years-long upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0. The launch of the Beacon Chain in 2020, the Berlin and London upgrades in 2021, and the Merge in 2022 marked steps toward a more efficient, Proof-of-Stake network. Later upgrades, including Shanghai in 2023 and Dencun in 2024, tackled staking flexibility and lower transaction costs.

Vitalik Wants To Speed Up Ethereum By 100x, Make it as 'Simple as Bitcoin'

Supporters see Ethereum as the foundation for “Web3”—an internet where users, not corporations, control data, money, and digital identities. Ethereum powers decentralized finance DeFi, non-fungible tokens, and decentralized autonomous organizations, each of which experiments with alternatives to traditional financial and governance systems.

But competition looms. Rival networks such as Solana, Cardano, and Polkadot have positioned themselves as faster, cheaper alternatives. Meanwhile, Ethereum scaling solutions like Polygon and Arbitrum aim to process transactions off-chain before anchoring them to Ethereum's main blockchain, reducing lag time and cost.

As Ethereum enters its second decade, it continues to test the boundaries of what a blockchain can do. Whether it will deliver on its vision of a decentralized internet—or cede ground to faster competitors—remains an open question.

What's certain is that Ethereum has already changed how we think about the internet, money, community, and governance.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, is a blockchain-powered platform for creating decentralized applications (dapps).

Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency. It's a global, decentralized network that enables smart contracts—self-executing programs on the blockchain—and decentralized applications, or dapps, that run without banks, governments, or big tech.

When programmer Vitalik Buterin published a “whitepaper” in late 2013 proposing a new kind of blockchain—not just for money but for programmable code—a revolution in digital finance began. Today, the Ethereum blockchain hosts decentralized applications like smart contracts, games, digital art, and assets worth billions.

Ultimately, many believe that Ethereum could underpin a re-imagining of how the internet works, dubbed Web3, in which control of the internet is disintermediated away from big companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and X.

This guide will help you understand the history of Ethereum, Buterin's big idea, and the role Ether plays in that vision.

The feature that set Ethereum apart from Bitcoin early on was the smart contract. A smart contract is a code stored and executed on the blockchain that runs automatically once its conditions are met.

Smart contracts are transparent, tamper-proof, and execute without relying on third parties. This makes them the backbone of everything built on Ethereum, from DeFi protocols to NFT marketplaces.

Russian/Canadian computer programmer Vitalik Buterin wrote the whitepaper that Ethereum is based on. However, the building of the network and community was helped along by a number of co-founders: Anthony Di Loria, Charles Hoskinson, Miha Alisie, Amir Chetrit, Joseph Lubin and Gavin Wood.

Development of the Ethereum network began in early 2014 under the Ethereum Foundation, with Gavin Wood publishing the technical “yellow paper” that defined the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

A crowdfunded token sale followed in mid-2014, raising funds through an initial coin offering, or ICO, that exchanged Bitcoin for Ether. The ICO raised over $18 million.

The network officially went live on July 30, 2015, launching as “Frontier”—a platform for developers to test and deploy decentralized applications.

When it first launched, Ethereum used the same Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism as Bitcoin, with cryptocurrency miners securing the network by solving complex cryptographic puzzles.

In September 2022, Ethereum switchted to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. Instead of mining, Ether is created through staking: validators lock up at least 32 ETH as collateral and are chosen to propose and verify new blocks. Honest participation earns them ETH rewards.

What is Proof of Stake? How it Differs From Proof of Work

This shift, known as “The Merge,” ended Proof-of-Work mining, making Ethereum more energy-efficient while allowing anyone with the required stake to help secure the network and earn rewards.

Blocks are still added about every 12 seconds, but ETH is now distributed as staking rewards, not mining rewards.

Ether (ETH), Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, pays for transactions, powers apps, and secures the network. Ether's sub-units, Gwei and Wei, are named after Wei Dai, an early pioneer of cryptocurrencies.

              Highlights            



                        After the collapse of FTX and Alameda Research in 2022 along with other sector-wide scandals and failures, “zombie blockchains” (like Solano, Algorand, Cardano, and BNB Chain) seemed doomed but survived thanks to active developer communities.                      


                        The crypto narrative has shifted from “coins as money” to blockchains as middleware — secure, transparent rails for applications.                      


                        The revival of these blockchains highlights that survival through downturns can strengthen credibility; their existing infrastructure and developer ecosystems now make them competitive in securing partnerships and large-scale pilots.                      

In late 2022, the mood around the crypto industry was funereal. The scandalously criminal collapse of FTX and the implosion of associated hedge fund Alameda Research left deep scars across the digital asset world, turning once popular blockchains and their respective cryptocurrencies into “ghost” chains as confidence in the industry cratered.

Among the hardest hit was Solana, the once celebrated “Ethereum killer,” which had prided itself on speed and low transaction costs. By December of 2022, Solana's price had fallen 95% from its peak.

To critics, this was not just a market correction but confirmation of deeper weaknesses: multiple network outages, dependence on a few venture backers and proximity to the disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried empire.

And yet, the Solana blockchain never really died, despite its coin's nosediving value. Developers kept building through the rubble, quietly shipping code. Three years later, Solana isn't just alive but is being included by the Trump administration in conversations about a national U.S. crypto reserve.

This Lazarus-like return isn't unique.

Algorand, Cardano, BNB Chain and other so-called “zombie blockchains” that once looked destined for the graveyard are suddenly reappearing with renewed relevance. They are no longer framed merely as speculative “coins” but as infrastructure: rails for tokenization, settlement and application development.

And in an industry notorious for boom-and-bust cycles, the reanimation of these networks says less about crypto market price charts and more about how the role of blockchain networks themselves are evolving in the broader economy.

When blockchain first captured mainstream attention in the late 2010s, the narrative was dominated by “coins as money.”

Bitcoin was digital gold. Ethereum was programmable money. Alternative networks promised faster, cheaper transactions that might make crypto viable as daily currency. But that framing ran into limits: regulatory scrutiny, volatile pricing, and the simple fact that most people already had payment systems that worked well enough.

Today, the conversation has shifted. Blockchains are being reinterpreted not as currency replacements but as middleware: infrastructure for applications that need secure, transparent and tamper-resistant data.

This reframing opens the door for networks once dismissed as “ghost chains” to play roles beyond speculative mania. Their value is no longer tied purely to how high their token prices go, but to the robustness of their ecosystems and their ability to host real-world use cases.

If the first wave of blockchain adoption was about speculation and the second about DeFi and NFTs, the next may be about tokenization: the process of turning traditional assets into blockchain-based digital tokens. Tokenized bonds, real estate, and commodities could reshape capital markets.

In this context, zombie chains aren't necessarily disadvantaged. Their survival has given them credibility; their existing infrastructure and developer bases allow them to compete for pilots and partnerships. The blockchain race is no longer just about speed or decentralization; it's about who can provide reliable rails for trillion-dollar markets.

Solana's arc exemplifies this transformation. After its brutal fall, many assumed developer migration would hollow it out. Instead, the network retained one of the most active GitHub communities in the blockchain sector. By 2024, Solana was hosting stablecoin experiments, new consumer-facing apps, and decentralized exchanges boasting speed that rivaled centralized players.

Algorand was another network tagged as a zombie. Founded by MIT cryptography pioneer Silvio Micali, it was pitched as a high-performance, mathematically elegant blockchain. But by 2022, its market relevance seemed limited; its token price languished, and its community appeared overshadowed by trendier platforms.

But today, Algorand is being positioned not as a mass-retail chain for speculative investors but as an institutional-grade solution for tokenization and compliance-heavy applications. Its “dead chain” years may have simply been incubation for the role it is now playing.

Perhaps the strangest comeback belongs to BNB Chain, originally launched as Binance's in-house network for faster and cheaper trading. When U.S. regulators cracked down on Binance in 2023, many assumed the chain would collapse alongside its parent exchange.

Instead, BNB Chain has remained one of the most used blockchains globally by transaction volume, powering gaming economies, decentralized apps, and low-fee token transfers. Its fate is still intertwined with Binance's legal and regulatory trajectory, but its technical ecosystem has developed enough momentum to stand on its own.

Perhaps the clearest sign that “zombie blockchains” are being resurrected lies in who is using them. The U.S. government, traditionally skeptical of crypto, has increasingly turned to blockchain networks for pilots in asset tokenization and financial market modernization, citing tokens such as bitcoin, ethereum, the XRP token from Ripple Labs, the SOL token from the Solana blockchain and the ADA token from the Cardano blockchain.

This institutionalization is reshaping the perception of old networks. What once seemed like failures of consumer adoption may prove to be stepping stones toward enterprise-grade applications. Only the future will tell.

Asia is stepping up its institutional adoption of digital assets, as two major announcements this week highlighted the region's ambitions to catch up with the West, especially the US, in crypto adoption.

At Taipei Blockchain Week, Hong Kong-based Sora Ventures launched Asia's first Bitcoin treasury fund, backed by $200 million in commitments and aiming to purchase $1 billion in BTC within six months. Also, Tokyo-listed Robot Consulting Co., Ltd. unveiled plans to invest up to ¥1 billion (around $6.7 million) in Ethereum, part of a wider strategy to blend blockchain with legal technology services.

Sora's new fund marks a milestone for Asia, where crypto treasury strategies have until now been fragmented. Unlike corporate players such as Metaplanet in Japan or DV8 in Thailand, which hold Bitcoin directly on their balance sheets, the Sora fund pools institutional capital into a centralized vehicle.

The model is designed both to support existing Asian treasuries and to seed new ones globally, creating synergies across jurisdictions.

Jason Fang, founder and managing partner at Sora Ventures, said the launch represents the first time that institutional money has come together, from local to regional, and now to a global stage for Bitcoin.

The fund builds on Sora's recent acquisitions of treasury-focused firms across the region, including Moon Inc. in Hong Kong, DV8 in Thailand, and BitPlanet in South Korea. It also invested in Metaplanet's ¥1 billion Bitcoin allocation in 2024.

Analysts say the move could catalyze a wave of corporate adoption across Asia, particularly if Sora succeeds in funneling $1 billion into Bitcoin in such a short timeframe. The fund has already attracted interest from regional institutions seeking to hedge against currency volatility.

While Sora doubles down on Bitcoin as a treasury asset, Robot Consulting is betting on Ethereum as both an investment and a technological platform. The company, which listed on Nasdaq in July, said it would allocate up to ¥1 billion in ETH between Q4 2025 and spring 2026, using available cash and IPO proceeds.

The company said the initiative would enhance the company's “presence in the emerging field of accessible legal services through technology” by integrating Ethereum's smart contracts into its legal tech products. The firm is working to combine blockchain with AI data in addition to digital services such as automated compliance checks and dispute resolution.

Robot Consulting will mark the valuation of its ETH holdings to market on a quarterly basis, with gains or losses disclosed in annual statements.

“This investment in Ethereum marks a significant step in aligning our blockchain strategy with our legal technology vision,” Robot's Chief Executive Officer Amit Thakur said in a statement. “Looking ahead, we expect to continue to invest in technologies that strengthen our business model and deliver long-term value.”

While the US has dominated the narrative on corporate Bitcoin and Ethereum adoption, Asia's institutional interest is growing.

Sora's initiative could bring cohesion to fragmented treasury efforts across the region, giving Asia a collective presence in Bitcoin markets. Meanwhile, Robot Consulting's ETH allocation illustrates how blockchain is being woven into specific industries, in this case, legal technology, rather than being treated purely as a speculative bet.

The price of Bitcoin fell below $110,500 on Friday morning as August jobs data came in weaker than expected, which fueled concerns about a looming recession. Altcoins also saw gains erased as market volatility intensified.

The US economy added 22,000 jobs in August, far below expectations and down from 79,000 in July, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. The unemployment rate increased to 4.3% from 4.2%, while July's job gains were revised lower from 73,000.

The sharp deceleration suggests businesses are pulling back on hiring, often an early warning sign of weaker demand and slowing activity.

The three-month average has dropped sharply, showing a consistent cooling trend in the labor market that can spill into consumer spending and overall growth, raising the risk of recession.

Gold hit a record $3,580 on the weak jobs data, while Bitcoin dipped to $112,500 before rebounding above $113,300, TradingView showed.

The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq also touched fresh highs, but crypto and equities quickly pulled back even as markets fully priced in a September Fed rate cut.

Traders now see a 98% chance the Fed delivers a quarter-point cut at its Sept. 16–17 meeting, with 2% odds on a half-point move, according to FedWatch Tool data.

In his most recent statements at the Fed's Jackson Hole event, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that the central bank kept the door open for a September rate cut.

However, he also indicated it would not signal the start of an aggressive easing cycle.

Powell noted that inflation risks remain tilted to the upside while employment risks are leaning lower. With policy rates now closer to neutral but still restrictive, he said the Fed can proceed carefully, while leaving room for adjustments if risks shift further.

Markets are now looking ahead to the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, set for release on September 11, to gauge whether Fed rate cuts are on the horizon.

September has historically been a volatile month for crypto and stocks.

Last year, Bitcoin fell below $55,000 before surging after a 50-basis-point Fed cut. The rate move came amid rising unemployment, weak job growth, and recession fears.

As Ethereum claws its way upward this week, a looming challenge threatens digital asset treasury (DAT) companies as their mNAVs have come close to 1 or slipped below it, with experts signaling potential trouble for future capital inflows.

mNAV, or market-to-net asset value, compares a company's stock value to that of its assets. And for digital asset treasury companies, the value of their crypto treasuries can experience dramatic fluctuations.

Data from Strategic ETH Reserve shows a steep drop in mNAV for key players. BitMine and SharpLink Gaming have seen their mNAV fall below 1, to 0.99 and 0.89, respectively. BitDigital and GameSquare Holdings Inc have seen there's slip, but hold above 1 so far. BTBT is at 1.51 and GAME has fallen to 1.13.

The downtick in mNAV tracks the broader crypto market's dip, with Bitcoin falling from its mid-August peak, when it set a new all-time high of $124,545.6, to $112,154, per CoinGecko.

For DATs holding hefty Ethereum reserves—BitMine has $8.3 billion and Sharplink holds $3.7 billion worth of ETH—this erosion of premium could choke off their ability to raise cash without punishing existing investors.

“I think that's why we've seen capital raises stall after a busy stretch earlier this year: Investors just don't want to pay the premiums for the same ETH exposure,” Arthur Azizov, founder and investor at B2 Ventures, told Decrypt.

For DATs, mNAV is the lifeblood of capital raises, particularly through at-the-market (ATM) equity programs, where a premium over net asset value allows companies to issue stock without harming investors.

But as mNAVs shrink, “companies must issue far more shares to raise the same capital, leading to painful dilution,” CryptoQuant analyst Maarten Regterschot told Decrypt.

While Ethereum's price volatility erodes mNAV cushions, relentless ATM share sales flood the market, driving down valuations, Azizov highlighted. Adding pressure, spot Ethereum ETFs offer investors direct exposure without the premium DATs once commanded, he said.

“Investors aren't willing to pay extra for the same Ethereum,” Azizov explained, noting why capital raises have ground to a halt lately.

According to Regterschot, a stagnant ETH/BTC price is another source that has pressured mNAVs' recent plunge, creating a feedback loop where fading premiums and rising share supply choke demand.

The outlook for Q4 is make-or-break, both experts highlighted.

A bullish Ethereum run could revive mNAVs, allowing DATs to issue stock on favorable terms and bolster ETH holdings, thereby restarting growth. But if ETH stalls or the crypto market turns bearish due to macroeconomic concerns, mNAVs could dip below 1, effectively putting a stop on new issuance.

“A strong quarter is critical,” Azizov said. Without it, DATs may be forced to lean on staking yields, with netflows stalling as they navigate a constrained funding landscape.

 Bitcoin price strength disappears despite nonfarm payrolls data cementing Fed rate cut bets, and bulls are nowhere to be seen. 

Key points:

Bitcoin disappoints with volatility around US jobs data, resulting in a dive under $111,000.

BTC price action gives up all its gains while gold goes on to hit yet another all-time high.

Traders maintain expectations of a $100,000 support retest.

Bitcoin (BTC) flipped volatile at Friday's Wall Street open as US jobs data fell far short of expectations.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD reaching new September highs of $113,400 before dropping almost $3,000 in an hour.

The August print of US nonfarm payrolls (NFP) confirmed that the economy added 22,000 jobs — far fewer than the anticipated 75,000.

The US dollar's strength plummeted as a result, while gold hit new all-time highs.

Reacting, market participants agreed that the course was now set for a key risk-asset tailwind event: the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates at its Sept. 17 meeting.

Data from CME Group's FedWatch Tool underscored the likelihood of such an outcome.

“This marks the 2nd lowest jobs report number since July 2021,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter wrote in part of a thread on X. 

Kobeissi noted that the job numbers for previous months had also been revised down.

“The labor market is far worse than you think: Not only was June's jobs number negative, but the US economy lost -357,000 full time jobs in August,” founder Adam Kobeissi added.

Despite the positive implications of the NFP print for Bitcoin, BTC price action offered a noticeably lackluster reaction.

This was not lost on some market participants, who included popular commentator WhalePanda.

Traders instead looked to key resistance levels still in need of being flipped back to support. Popular trader Daan Crypto Trades flagged the 200-period simple (SMA) and exponential (EMA) moving averages on four-hour time frames.

“The 4H 200MA & EMA are generally seen as a good momentum indicator for the short to mid timeframe trend. These have both acted as resistance for the past few weeks and are now being tested again,” part of an X post explained.

“This is a very crucial level to reclaim for more upside,” fellow trader ZYN agreed about the pre-NFP price zone, adding that “bulls will be fully back” should $113,000 support return.

Bearish perspectives remained, with crypto investor and entrepreneur Ted Pillows reiterating expectations of a drop toward $100,000.

“Also, if this level doesn't hold, BTC could go around $92K-$94K CME gap level,” he warned on the day.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) plan to hold a joint roundtable as a next step in their efforts to make the U.S. markets friendlier to financial firms, including crypto businesses.

The heads of the agencies — SEC Chair Paul Atkins and Acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham — announced a joint roundtable for later this month to discuss prediction markets, decentralized finance and 24/7 trading in traditional financial markets, among other issues. The agencies also published a joint statement outlining their push for "greater harmonization" between the two agencies.

"It's time to leave turf aside and really collaborate," Atkins said during a press call on Friday morning.

During the previous administration, the two agencies were sometimes at odds over the policing of crypto, even though their leaders were both Democrats appointed by former President Joe Biden. Gary Gensler, the ex-chief of the SEC, set himself up as a crypto antagonist, taking companies to court and refusing to move forward on comprehensive crypto regulations, while then-CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam was marginally more open to conversations with the industry.

For instance, the two agencies adopted distinct positions on which crypto assets were securities and which were commodities, including Ethereum's ETH, which both seemed to claim under their jurisdictions at different times.

In the Friday call, Atkins and Pham presented a new united front, as the two said they're trying to bring innovators back from overseas jurisdictions and get set to oversee modern, round-the-clock markets.

Asked by CoinDesk whether the regulator had the resources to police 24/7 trading, as the agencies suggested in their joint statement, Atkins pointed to self-regulatory organizations as the entities that would take on the bulk of the work.

"It's the markets themselves, the SROs that are charged with looking at the trading on their own platforms," he said. "And so obviously, then we have other ways that we track what's going on and [we] depend on their alerting us."

Atkins threw a follow-up question about a possible SRO for the crypto industry to Congress, saying the agency was involved in the market structure legislation currently advancing through the legislature.

Pham, who's overseen the CFTC while the Senate mulls President Donald Trump's nominee Brian Quintenz, said the agency did not need additional staffing to continue its mandate of overseeing non-securities markets.

"By consolidating many of the activities at the agency, we're actually better able to have the maximum productivity and capacity available," she said. "We are doing great with all of our initiatives, and we look forward to continuing to work on this together with the SEC."

Ethereum (ETH), the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, is flashing powerful bullish signals as a rare inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and tightening supply dynamics fuel speculation of a $10,000 rally.

This setup comes at a time when Ethereum is consolidating near $4,300–$4,400, holding firm above key support despite recent volatility. With institutional inflows, network upgrades, and long-term accumulation trends strengthening, analysts argue Ethereum could be primed for its next major breakout.

According to Ethereum price analysis, ETH has rebounded strongly from its August 2025 range of $3,392 to $4,953 and is now consolidating above $5,500. While the ETH price today shows minor fluctuations, market analysts believe Ethereum's underlying fundamentals and technical signals support a major breakout.

Ethereum recently reached an all-time high price near $4,950 in late August before undergoing a pullback and sideways trading. Despite this, the cryptocurrency has gained around 20.54% over the past month and an impressive 80.82% over the last year, according to CryptoPotato. This resilience has been attributed to rising institutional demand, increased staking, and inflows into Ethereum ETFs.

Crypto analyst Chami (@ChamiCrypto78) posted an analysis highlighting a massive inverse head-and-shoulders pattern forming on Ethereum's weekly chart. This classic Ethereum technical analysis signal is widely seen as a bullish reversal formation, with a projected target of $10,000 or higher if confirmed.

Supporting this outlook, the Stochastic RSI indicator shows a reading of 82.09 against a signal line of 90.87. While this indicates slightly overbought conditions, Chami noted that short-term cooling could see ETH retest support around $4,100 before stronger buying pressure resumes.

“Ethereum may briefly revisit $4,100 support before demand takes over, opening the door for a potential rally toward $10,000,” Chami explained.

Adding to the bullish narrative, analyst @cas_abbe revealed on September 5 that Ethereum's Exchange Flux Balance has indeed turned negative for the first time, suggesting a significant shift towards long-term holding and reduced sell-side pressure, based on data from Alphractal. This means more ETH is being withdrawn from exchanges than deposited—a trend often seen as a precursor to a supply shock.

With billions of dollars' worth of ETH moving into long-term storage and Ethereum staking, sell-side pressure is decreasing. This reduction in liquid supply aligns with historic precedents where exchange outflows preceded significant rallies. Cointelegraph has also reported that ether reserves on exchanges are at a nine-year low since 2016, reinforcing the possibility of a major price surge.

Institutional activity remains a cornerstone of Ethereum's bullish outlook. Reports from AInvest show that major institutional investor BMNR holds 1.71 million ETH worth approximately $7.9 billion—around 4.9% of circulating supply. BMNR aims to raise this share to 5%, creating what some describe as a “sovereign put,” where institutions prefer to buy ETH directly from BMNR to stabilize markets.

At the same time, BlackRock's Ethereum ETF and other US spot ETFs have attracted significant inflows, boosting confidence in ETH as a long-term store of value beyond speculative trading. This institutional adoption enhances Ethereum's position compared to Bitcoin, thanks to its utility in smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and tokenization of real-world assets.

Traders are closely watching critical Ethereum price levels to determine ETH's next move:

Despite the bullish backdrop, some Ethereum news points to caution. Recent data shows several US spot ETH ETFs experiencing net outflows, signaling short-term cooling of institutional demand. Retail traders have also been taking profits, creating temporary headwinds.

Moreover, Ethereum's Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio remains elevated, raising concerns of possible overvaluation. Regulatory uncertainty in major markets adds another layer of risk, leaving some analysts cautious about short-term price action.

While short-term volatility is expected, the long-term outlook for Ethereum remains bullish:

With ETH trading above $4,400, the cryptocurrency finds itself at a pivotal moment. The inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and negative exchange balances signal strong bullish potential, while institutional accumulation through Ethereum ETFs provides additional support.

However, short-term risks—such as ETF outflows, profit-taking, and regulatory challenges—remain in play. Traders and investors alike will be watching key levels near $4,300 support and $5,000 resistance to gauge Ethereum's next move.

For now, Ethereum stands at the crossroads of consolidation and breakout. Whether it can overcome short-term hurdles to ignite a rally toward $10,000 will define the next chapter in its evolution.

 Crypto exchange Bybit has become the first crypto exchange to debut stablecoin payments for regulatory fees in Kazakhstan's AIFC. 

Kazakhstan's financial regulators have allowed license and supervision fees to be paid in USD-pegged stablecoins.

Kazakhstan's Astana Financial Services Authority (AFSA), a designated financial authority for the Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC), has launched a project enabling AIFC members to pay regulatory fees in USD-pegged stablecoins.

The regulator announced on Thursday that the project was officially launched at the local event Astana Finance Days 2025, signing a related multilateral memorandum of understanding (MMoU) with the centralized crypto exchange (CEX) Bybit.

“This initiative represents a first-of-its-kind regulatory framework for payments in stablecoins in the region, signaling Kazakhstan's ambition to position the AIFC as a hub for digital finance [...],” AFSA CEO Evgeniya Bogdanova said.

Currently, companies pay regulatory fees primarily through traditional methods such as bank transfers and wire payments in fiat currencies such as the US dollar and the Kazakhstani tenge, a spokesperson for Bybit told Cointelegraph.

“These methods are functional but often involve delays, high transaction costs and limited flexibility, especially for firms whose primary treasury is held in digital assets,” the representative said.

With stablecoins like Tether USDt (USDT) or Circle's USDC (USDC), the parties are provided with a fast, cost-efficient, and transparent payment option, the Bybit spokesperson noted.

According to the official statement from the AFSA, the project's participation requires signing an MMoU, subject to meeting the authority's eligibility criteria.

Bybit became the inaugural signatory of the MMoU, which was signed during Astana Finance Days 2025 by AFSA's Bogdanova and Bybit CEO Mazurka Zeng.

The names of the providers participating in the new project will be published on the official AFSA website after signing an MMoU, the regulator said.

Cointelegraph approached the AFSA for comment regarding the project details, including eligibility criteria, but had not received a response at the time of publication.

Jesse Knutson, head of operations at Bitfinex Securities — which has been operating in Kazakhstan since 2021 — told Cointelegraph that the AFSA's project “demonstrates how central stablecoins like USDt are to the development of tokenised financial markets.”

“FSA led the way by becoming one of the first to develop a regulatory regime for the issuance and listing of tokenised securities, and they are again a first-mover in accepting USDt and others as a fungible currency for their own regulatory fees,” Knutson said.

The news came amid crypto gaining momentum in Kazakhstan, with the US-regulated crypto custodian BitGo assisting the launch of Central Asia's first spot Bitcoin ETF by the local company Fonte Capital in August.

Kazakhstan has emerged as a major player in the crypto industry, including cryptocurrency mining. In June, local authorities also reported studying the concept of a state-run crypto reserve, likely funded by digital assets mined or seized by the government.

- U.S. lawmakers may block a digital dollar due to privacy concerns, with the House passing the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act in July 2025.

- A CBDC differs from private digital assets but faces adoption barriers as privacy-focused alternatives like encrypted stablecoins gain traction.

- Global CBDC progress accelerates, with China's 180M digital yuan wallets and India's expanding digital rupee pilot highlighting cross-border innovation challenges.

- Design choices (privacy tiers, offline payments) and interoperability hurdles like BIS's mBridge project complicate U.S. CBDC development amid geopolitical tensions.

Lawmakers in the United States could potentially block the development of a U.S. digital dollar due to concerns over privacy, according to experts in the field. The proposed digital currency, if implemented, would be a central bank digital currency (CBDC), issued directly by the Federal Reserve. However, political resistance has already emerged. In July 2025, the House of Representatives passed the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which seeks to prevent the federal government from issuing a digital version of the U.S. dollar. The bill, still pending in the Senate, reflects growing unease among lawmakers about the potential for government surveillance and erosion of financial privacy associated with digital currencies.

A CBDC differs from private digital assets such as stablecoins or cryptocurrencies in that it is backed directly by a central bank and represents a digital form of sovereign money. There are two primary types of CBDCs: retail, which is intended for use by the general public for everyday transactions, and wholesale, which is designed for interbank and cross-border transactions. The U.S. has yet to decide on a retail CBDC, but the Federal Reserve remains actively engaged in studying its potential impacts on monetary policy, financial stability, and privacy.

Privacy concerns represent one of the most significant barriers to CBDC adoption in the U.S. Critics argue that the traceability of transactions in a CBDC system could lead to widespread surveillance, eroding the privacy of financial interactions. In contrast, privacy-focused digital alternatives, such as stablecoins with enhanced encryption or decentralized systems, may offer a more privacy-preserving route for digital payments. These options could reduce the perceived need for a government-issued digital currency by providing secure, transparent, and efficient transactional mechanisms outside the central bank's direct control.

Globally, central banks are advancing in their CBDC research and pilot programs. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) reports that over 90% of central banks are now actively exploring CBDCs, with wholesale CBDCs progressing faster than retail versions. The European Central Bank, for example, is working on a digital euro to reduce reliance on non-European payment providers and increase strategic autonomy. In China, the digital yuan has already reached a significant scale, with over 180 million personal wallets by 2024. Meanwhile, India is expanding its digital rupee pilot and exploring cross-border applications.

Design choices in CBDC development are critical to their success and adoption. Key considerations include privacy levels, offline payment capabilities, limits on digital holdings, and the potential for programmable money. The BIS has highlighted the importance of tiered privacy features that protect small-value transactions while meeting anti-money laundering (AML) requirements for larger ones. Offline functionality is also crucial, particularly in low-connectivity areas or during system outages.

Interoperability remains another major challenge. Multi-CBDC platforms, such as the BIS's mBridge project, aim to enable direct cross-border settlements between central banks, reducing friction in international trade and remittances. These platforms are still in early stages but have shown potential for streamlining transactions. However, achieving widespread adoption will require global consensus on technical standards, governance models, and regulatory frameworks—areas where geopolitical tensions may complicate progress.

The future of CBDCs in the U.S. remains uncertain. The Federal Reserve has not yet reached a final decision on the implementation of a digital dollar, and legislative resistance could further delay or prevent its development. If the U.S. chooses to move forward, it will need to address privacy concerns, ensure financial stability, and navigate complex geopolitical dynamics in a rapidly evolving digital finance landscape.

As the crypto market awaits the U.S. nonfarm payrolls release for insights on the how the Federal Reserve might act on interest rates, implied volatility indexes point to moderate price volatility in major cryptocurrencies. 

At press time, Volmex's annualized bitcoin BTC$110,661.21 one-day implied volatility index was 43.80. That means a 24-hour expected price swing of 2.29%. The indexes for ether (ETH), XRP XRP$2.8124 and SOL (SOL) suggested price swings of 3.7%, 4%, and 4.86%, respectively. 

Analysts said that a hotter-than-expected jobs report could weaken the case for rapid Fed rate cuts, sending risk assets lower.

 Sun said his WLFI pre-sale allocation was “unreasonably frozen” in a move that could damage the reputation of the Trump-family-linked decentralized finance platform. 

Update Sept. 5, 11:20 a.m. UTC: This article has been updated to include insights from Coinbase's Conor Grogan.

Tron founder Justin Sun is urging World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto project linked to the Trump family, to unfreeze his token allocation. His wallets were blacklisted after suspicious transactions flagged by blockchain trackers sparked accusations of selling.

Sun's World Liberty Financial (WLFI) token address was blacklisted on Thursday, after blockchain data from Nansen and Arkham flagged the address for a $9 million transfer, Cointelegraph reported.

In a Friday response to the blacklisting, Sun said his pre-sale tokens were “unreasonably frozen,” urging the team behind World Liberty Financial to unlock his investment, in respect to the principles of decentralized blockchain technology. 

World Liberty's decision to block his tokens is a violation of investor rights and risks “damaging broader confidence in World Liberty Financial,” wrote Sun in a X post, adding:

“Tokens are sacred and inviolable—this should be the most basic value of any blockchain. It's also what makes us stronger and more fair than traditional finance,” added Sun.

Sun was among the first investors to join the Trump family-linked WLFI pre-sale, and said that he was looking to hold the tokens long-term.

Sun “stated he will not be selling soon (his words) and is creating yield on HTX for WLFI deposits — plus minting $200M USD1 on Tron to power the ecosystem,” wrote the WLFI platform in a Tuesday X post, referencing Sun's earlier statement.

“Justin and the WLFI team are in active communication about this matter,” a spokesperson for Justin Sun previously told Cointelegraph.

The blacklisting occurred shortly after Sun had started moving WLFI tokens to the HTX cryptocurrency exchange.

“Justin Sun moved $9M of his still-unlocked $WLFI to HTX. In total, he sent $10M to CEXs over the past 3 days,” wrote Bubblemaps in a Friday X post.

Other crypto analysts have also suggested that Sun was selling his allocation, despite earlier promises.

“If Justin Sun really lured in WLFI tokens from HTX users with a 20% APY to lock them, and then sell them to get out of ‘his' own position while they're still unvested, then he deserves to get his account frozen,” wrote Quinten François, cryptocurrency analyst and the co-founder of social decentralized application weRate, in a Friday X post.

Others, including Nansen crypto intelligence platform founder Alex Svanevik, contend that Sun has not been selling his allocation.

“At first, it (an AI agent) thought @justinsuntron caused the dump. Then I asked it to scrutinize the timestamps. Conclusion seems to be: he did not,” wrote Svanevik in a Friday X post, referencing his conversation with the Nansen AI agent.

Still other industry analysts allege that Sun circumvented HTX to end up selling via the Binance exchange instead.

“A Binance deposit wallet connected to Justin Sun received over 60 million WLFI tokens worth  $12M yesterday from HTX,” according to Conor Grogan, head of product at Coinbase exchange.

“The 60M WLFI deposit represents about 52.6% of HTX's total WLFI holdings at present from what I can find onchain based on HTX's public wallets,” Grogan said in a Thursday X post.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Taiwan-based crypto venture capital firm Sora Ventures announced plans to build a $1 billion fund to invest in bitcoin treasury companies in Asia.

Sora Ventures said on Friday in a press release that it aims to accumulate $1 billion in the next six months. It has secured $200 million in initial commitments from regional partners and investors. 

The fund is set to invest in Asia-based companies that hold bitcoin on their balance sheets, a strategy that has recently gained traction among listed firms in Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand, and South Korea.

"We have seen a rise in interest from institutions investing in Bitcoin treasuries in the U.S. and EU, while in Asia efforts have been relatively fragmented," said Jason Fang, founder and managing partner of Sora Ventures. "This is the first time in history that institutional money has come together, from local to regional, and now to a global stage."

Sora Ventures' latest plan builds on a series of acquisitions and investments in publicly traded companies that have adopted bitcoin as a treasury asset. In April 2024, Sora invested in Japan's Metaplanet and supported Metaplanet's 1 billion yen ($6.6 million) bitcoin purchase, according to the statement. 

Earlier this year, Sora Ventures acquired Hong Kong's Moon Inc., which has pivoted toward bitcoin and Web3-related investments following its rebrand from HK Asia Holdings. 

In July, Sora led a consortium that acquired Thai electronics retailer DV8 through a tender offer, aiming to replicate the Metaplanet model in Southeast Asia. Also in July, Sora and its partners took a controlling stake in South Korea's BitPlanet to back the company's expansion into digital assets.

The Trump family has a bitcoin mining company that started trading on the Nasdaq Wednesday.

Why it matters: Running mining rigs is one of the most policy-sensitive corners of the crypto industry, with its number one cost input being the price of power.

Catch up quick: American Bitcoin, backed by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., began publicly trading on Wednesday following a merger with a small-cap bitcoin miner, which allowed it to skip a traditional IPO process.

How it works: According to an investor presentation, American Bitcoin has a three-pronged strategy to provide leadership in the U.S. bitcoin industry:

Zoom in: Later in the presentation the company talks about building platforms and monetizing its surface area in the industry.

The big picture: The Trumps are entering the industry as competition has gotten fierce.

Between the lines: The cost of energy is crucial to a mining operation.

What we're watching: Nukes. We'll be curious to see if American Bitcoin comes out ahead of other miners in cutting deals with new nuclear plants, if they start getting permits.

💭 Our thought bubble: This could be yet another play to profit off of the presidency, but bitcoin mining takes a lot more elbow grease than running a meme coin or a second-tier stablecoin.

Bitcoin BTC$110,661.21 steadied near $111,600 on Friday morning, showing relative resilience even as macro jitters pulled global risk assets lower. Ether (ETH) slipped 0.7% to $4,330 while Solana's SOL (SOL) added 1.3% to trade above $204. XRP XRP$2.8124 hovered near $2.81, flat on the day but up 3.5% over the week.

The week's backdrop has been dominated by U.S. labor data and shifting expectations around the Federal Reserve. Friday's jobs report is widely expected to show unemployment climbing, firming bets on a September rate cut. But traders are no longer expecting an extended easing cycle.

“While high unemployment numbers indicated the Fed is likely to cut rates in mid-September, traders now believe that reductions throughout the rest of the year will be limited in scope,” said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE. “The Fed is wary of introducing too much new money into the economy for fear of inflation. This is why gold has rallied while cryptocurrencies and stocks fell.”

Gold touched a fresh high above $3,500 an ounce earlier this week, indicative of a broad appetite for hard stores of value. That parallel has only heightened comparisons between the metal and bitcoin.

“Bitcoin has matured beyond being just a speculative asset and is widely recognized as a store of value and a hedge against currency debasement, fiscal instability, and geopolitical risk,” said Vikrant Sharma, CEO of Cake Wallet, in a Telegram message.

“Volatility has reduced but not disappeared, which is understandable for an asset just over a decade old. The narrative has shifted: it's now a strategic allocation rather than just a speculative asset," he added.

Sharma added that periods of low volatility often precede major price moves. “A $100,000 plus floor makes Bitcoin feel less like a high-beta trade and more like a global reserve asset in the making,” he said.

Despite headwinds, Bitcoin's dominance has remained firm. It still commands approximately 60% of the total crypto market capitalization, helping to stabilize sentiment even as altcoins have swung sharply.

“Despite recent market volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable resilience, dropping only 3% while maintaining its 60% dominance,” said Nassar Achkar, Chief Strategy Officer at CoinW, in an email. 

“The Fed's potential rate cuts later this year, combined with ongoing institutional adoption via ETFs and digital asset tokens, continue to provide strong fundamental support. That said, traders should remain cautious of shifting policies which may drive near-term fluctuations,” Achkar added.

The mixed outlooks come amid market fragility heading into September, historically crypto's weakest month.

Carter Woetzel '21 went from balancing cross country, a double major, and a minor to launching a business, publishing a book, and speaking at global conferences—all while keeping his drive and faith at the center.

By Macey Heath, social media content specialist

September 04, 2025 | 8:35 a.m.


Carter Woetzel '21

When Carter Woetzel '21 first stepped onto Bethel University's campus, the place already felt familiar. Three of his siblings had attended Bethel, and he had spent years hearing their stories about professors who cared deeply, a campus community that felt like family, and opportunities that inspired bold thinking. But familiarity wasn't the only draw. For Woetzel, his decision to come to Bethel was the intersection of academics and faith.

“I had the chance to run track and cross country, which I loved,” he says. “And when I realized I could pursue both computer science and business here, that sealed it. Bethel was the one place that offered all of that in an environment that felt like home.”

By the time Woetzel arrived as a first-year student, he was already ahead of the curve. At Blaine High School, he had been part of the STEM program, taking rigorous college courses and graduating with 57 college credits already earned. He was also active in Business Professionals of America, a national organization that fosters leadership and career skills. That combination of technical training and business exposure created a unique dilemma for his future studies: Should he major in computer science or business? “When I sat down with a Bethel enrollment counselor, I learned I could do both,” Woetzel says. “That conversation changed everything.”

He chose to pursue a B.S. in computer science, a B.A. in business with an emphasis in finance, and a minor in mathematics. It was an ambitious academic load, but Woetzel thrived on the challenge. “I think I would have been bored if I wasn't pushing myself,” he says. “Bethel gave me space to take on a lot, and I loved it.”

Throughout his time at Bethel, Woetzel found professors who not only taught him the material but also shaped his perspective on leadership, problem-solving, and integrity. In the Department of Business, Professor Brian Holland left a lasting impression. “Brian did an incredible job teaching us to love how businesses work,” Woetzel says. “He helped me see the science behind business operations and the systems that make companies thrive.” On the computer science side, Professors Nathan Gossett and Deborah Thomas challenged Woetzel with some of the department's most difficult courses. “Nathan built the technical foundation I rely on today to lead teams of computer scientists,” Woetzel says. “Deborah was such an encouragement—she pushed me to see what I was capable of.”

He also worked as a computer science tutor under Patrice Conrath. “Patrice is a trooper,” he says. “Her faith, her work ethic, her genuine care for students—those are the kinds of qualities that stick with you.”

During the summer after his sophomore year, Woetzel was working at Bethel's IT help desk when his cousin, a fellow Bethel alum, introduced him to blockchain technology—an innovative way of securely recording and sharing digital information across a decentralized network, without relying on a single authority like a bank or government. Intrigued, Woetzel began exploring the concept, reading everything he could find and taking detailed notes. “By the end of the summer, I had 40 pages of notes,' he says. ‘At some point I realized, maybe this is a book.”

“[Bethel's humanities courses] taught me how to explain complex ideas in a way people can understand. That skill has been invaluable working in the tech industry.”

— Carter Woetzel '21

That realization led to two and a half years of writing Building Confidence in Blockchain, which was published in the spring of 2020. Woetzel's goal was to create a resource that bridged the gap between highly technical blockchain literature and investment-focused material. “I wanted the average person to be able to read, understand, and enjoy it,” he says. The writing process was rigorous. “My publisher had multiple editors and revisionists. It was humbling to have entire chapters sent back for rewrites,” Woetzel says. “It taught me to accept feedback and see writing as a team effort.” He credits Bethel's humanities courses for honing his communication skills. “They taught me how to explain complex ideas in a way people can understand. That skill has been invaluable working in the tech industry.”

Woetzel secured an internship the summer of his junior year, but one day before it was set to start, the opportunity was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “It was a gut punch,” he says. “I needed that internship to complete my business credits. Suddenly I was scrambling.” He found a short-term role in solar sales to meet the credit requirement, but the experience was far from ideal. “I was cold-calling people in the middle of a pandemic,” he says. “It wasn't where I wanted to be.”

With his hours completed by June, Woetzel faced two open months. “I was doing delivery jobs just to pay the bills,” he says. “It was a low point. But I remember calling my mom and deciding I wasn't going to waste the rest of the summer. I was going to build something.” That decision set the stage for his next chapter. “I had nothing to lose,” he says. “God was faithful in that season. Losing the internship felt like a setback, but it was actually the opening I needed.”

That summer, Woetzel began laying the groundwork for a blockchain infrastructure company. By late 2021—just months after graduating—he had raised $5 million in venture funding. The company operated “nodes,” computers that help maintain blockchain networks, and later expanded to building applications for lending, borrowing, and cryptocurrency trading. At its peak, the team included eight Bethel alumni. “It was amazing to bring in people I knew from Bethel—people of faith, people I trusted,” Woetzel says. “That shared foundation made a huge difference in how we worked together.”

Woetzel speaking at conference

“Business doesn't just happen in your backyard—it happens everywhere. Bethel prepared me to think globally and serve people from all cultures.”

— Carter Woetzel '21

Today, Woetzel's work takes him across the globe. He has traveled to New York, Dubai, Thailand, and Morocco for conferences and client meetings. His customer base spans continents, with more clients in Europe than in the United States. “Travel has expanded my perspective,” he says. “Business doesn't just happen in your backyard—it happens everywhere. Bethel prepared me to think globally and serve people from all cultures.”

Woetzel sees blockchain as a technology that will shape the future of finance by making transactions faster, more transparent, and less expensive. “Imagine sending a million dollars from the U.S. to Asia in six seconds for a penny,” he says. “That's the power of blockchain.”

He is candid about the challenges of leading a startup in a volatile industry. “There have been a lot of highs and a lot of lows,” he says. “But through it all, God has been faithful.” He points to his Bethel experience as a key source of resilience. “At Bethel, I was surrounded by people who encouraged me to live out my faith in every part of life,” he says. “That doesn't just go away after graduation—it's something I carry into every decision.”

When asked what he would say to current Bethel students, Woetzel's answer is immediate: “Go create value for free. Find something you care about and start solving problems. The world rewards people who take initiative.” He emphasizes that opportunities often come from unexpected places. “I didn't plan to write a book. I didn't plan to start a company during a pandemic. But when you stay curious and take action, amazing things can happen.”

Looking back, Woetzel sees Bethel as the place that integrated all the elements of his journey—academic rigor, faith formation, mentorship, and a supportive community. “Who you are and who you're becoming matters,” he says. “Bethel prepared me for both the professional challenges and the personal mission I live out today.”

Woetzel's journey—from driven student to published author, startup founder, and global traveler—reflects the transformation Bethel seeks to inspire in graduates: leaders who step into a changing world with intelligence, integrity, and faith. And his story isn't finished. “This industry is evolving every day,” Woetzel says. “I'll be here, learning, building, and serving—because that's what Bethel prepared me to do.”

Retailers everywhere are asking the same question: “Is it safe to accept crypto for gift cards?”

As digital assets shift from speculative investments to everyday payment methods, businesses are weighing the opportunities against the risks. From fraud prevention to regulatory compliance, understanding how to let customers buy gift cards with Bitcoin safely is no longer optional - it's essential.

This article breaks down the key risks, the red flags to avoid, and the best practices retailers can adopt to integrate crypto securely and confidently.

For retailers, the lack of chargebacks in crypto can be both a strength and a weakness.

While it eliminates costly disputes common with credit cards, it also means that if a fraudulent order slips through, the funds are gone for good. Retailers must be certain that the wallet address receiving payments is accurate and secure.

Because crypto regulations differ by country, retailers expanding internationally face compliance challenges.

Failing to align with local rules around money transmission, taxation, or consumer protection could expose businesses to fines or reputational damage.

Fraudsters often target retailers as much as consumers.

Fake vendor sites or phishing schemes can damage brand trust if customers believe your marketplace is linked to fraudulent actors. Retailers must vet their partners carefully and protect their own digital infrastructure.

If gift cards come with unexpected fees or strict expiration dates, customers may direct their frustration toward the retailer rather than the marketplace.

Clear communication and transparent terms are essential to preserve trust and repeat business.

When selecting a crypto-gift-card provider, retailers should evaluate the platform's security infrastructure.

HTTPS encryption, two-factor authentication, and clear refund or replacement policies are non-negotiables. A lack of transparency in these areas could signal a potential liability for your business.

Due diligence goes beyond consumer ratings. Retailers should look for platforms with verified operational history, industry recognition, and long-standing partnerships.

A provider with consistent positive feedback and demonstrated resilience against breaches is more likely to protect your brand reputation.

If a potential partner pushes for quick sign-ups, promises unrealistic returns, or uses urgency to bypass proper vetting, consider it a red flag.

Retailers benefit from measured, well-documented partnerships, not rushed agreements that may expose them to fraud.

Retailers should only integrate payment wallets or gateways that have a proven track record of security.

Features such as biometric authentication, hardware storage, and multi-signature approvals not only protect transactions but also reassure customers that payments are being processed safely.

Private keys and recovery phrases must never be shared or stored insecurely within a retail organisation.

Internal protocols, such as role-based access, hardware wallets, and mandatory two-factor authentication, help ensure that even internal threats or errors don't compromise business funds.

Expanding beyond Bitcoin to include Ethereum, stablecoins, and other widely used cryptocurrencies provides customers with flexibility.

For retailers, this diversification also spreads risk across multiple payment channels, minimising dependence on a single coin's volatility.

For retailers considering partnerships with crypto-gift-card providers, trust and reputation should be essential. A reliable marketplace is one that:

●      Has years of operation without major breaches or security lapses;

●      Guarantees fast, verifiable delivery of digital codes to customers;

●      Provides transparent terms around refunds, spending limits, and fees;

●      Demonstrates compliance with evolving financial and data protection regulations.

Reliability isn't just about getting a working code - it's about safeguarding transactions, building customer confidence, and ensuring crypto payments remain a safe and convenient option.

Retailers should communicate openly about risks, security tips, and how customers can verify transactions. Transparency builds confidence and loyalty.

Automated monitoring can flag unusual purchasing patterns, such as bulk high value gift card buys, which are often linked to fraud attempts.

Setting daily or transaction limits reduces exposure to large scale fraud and ensures compliance with anti-money-laundering regulations.

Retailers should document transaction details, including crypto value at the time of purchase. This helps with customer support, tax obligations, and regulatory reporting.

For retailers, allowing customers to buy gift cards with Bitcoin represents more than just a trendy payment option—it's a chance to reach a growing base of digital-first shoppers who value flexibility, speed, and privacy.

But safety has to come first. By focusing on trusted platforms, strong payment policies, and proactive customer education, retailers can turn potential risks into opportunities.

By applying clear safeguards, businesses can confidently embrace crypto as part of their gift card strategy. Done right, this approach not only protects their operations but also positions their brand as forward-thinking, innovative, and ready to meet customers where they already are.

Authorities in Hunan province have suggested China's digital currency could be employed to clear opaque ‘chain debts' more easily

China is mulling the application of its digital yuan – the central bank-backed currency also known as the e-CNY – to tackle persistent payment defaults, a move that would broaden the asset's scope beyond the set of use cases explored by Beijing since the currency's launch in 2019.

Authorities in the central province of Hunan touched upon the subject when detailing plans to expand the digital currency's application scenarios and scale, according to a document published last month.

Hunan will “explore using the digital yuan to clear chain debts” through a model where funds can reach the end of the payment chain directly, the document said.

While details at the moment are sparse, analysts suggested the digital currency could be used to ensure the often opaque relationships between payers and payees are more traceable and transparent.

“This could potentially help enhance real-time visibility and control over transactions within the economy,” said Tan Junyu, an economist at global trade credit insurer Coface.

How can data be processed at lightning speed, or electricity conducted without loss? To achieve this, scientists and industry alike are turning to quantum materials, governed by the laws of the infinitesimal. Designing such materials requires a detailed understanding of atomic phenomena, much of which remains unexplored. A team from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), in collaboration with the University of Salerno and the CNR-SPIN Institute (Italy), has taken a major step forward by uncovering a hidden geometry -- until now purely theoretical -- that distorts the trajectories of electrons in much the same way gravity bends the path of light. This work, published in Science, opens new avenues for quantum electronics.

Future technologies depend on high-performance materials with unprecedented properties, rooted in quantum physics. At the heart of this revolution lies the study of matter at the microscopic scale -- the very essence of quantum physics. In the past century, exploring atoms, electrons and photons within materials gave rise to transistors and, ultimately, to modern computing.

New quantum phenomena that defy established models are still being discovered today. Recent studies suggest the possible emergence of a geometry within certain materials when vast numbers of particles are observed. This geometry appears to distort the trajectories of electrons in these materials -- much like Einstein's gravity bends the path of light.

From theory to observation

Known as quantum metric, this geometry reflects the curvature of the quantum space in which electrons move. It plays a crucial role in many phenomena at the microscopic scale of matter. Yet detecting its presence and effects remains a major challenge.

''The concept of quantum metric dates back about 20 years, but for a long time it was regarded purely as a theoretical construct. Only in recent years have scientists begun to explore its tangible effects on the properties of matter,'' explains Andrea Caviglia, full professor and director of the Department of Quantum Matter Physics at the UNIGE Faculty of Science.

Thanks to recent work, the team led by the UNIGE researcher, in collaboration with Carmine Ortix, associate professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Salerno, has detected quantum metric at the interface between two oxides -- strontium titanate and lanthanum aluminate -- a well-known quantum material. ''Its presence can be revealed by observing how electron trajectories are distorted under the combined influence of quantum metric and intense magnetic fields applied to solids,'' explains Giacomo Sala, research associate in the Department of Quantum Matter Physics at the UNIGE Faculty of Science and lead author of the study.

Unlocking Future Technologies

Observing this phenomenon makes it possible to characterise a material's optical, electronic and transport properties with greater precision. The research team also demonstrates that quantum metric is an intrinsic property of many materials -- contrary to previous assumptions.

''These discoveries open up new avenues for exploring and harnessing quantum geometry in a wide range of materials, with major implications for future electronics operating at terahertz frequencies (a trillion hertz), as well as for superconductivity and light-matter interactions,'' concludes Andrea Caviglia.

Scientists have bred the world's first horses with CRISPR-mediated genomic edits to enhance their muscle power and speed.Credit: Agustin Marcarian/Reuters

These horses might look like ordinary horses, but there is something highly unusual about their genomes. They are the first of their species to have their DNA edited using CRISPR–Cas9, a technique that cuts the genome at a specific location to change gene expression and achieve a desired trait.

The horses are clones of the prize-winning steed Polo Pureza, but they have a tweak to myostatin — a gene involved in regulating muscle development — that is designed to quicken their pace. CRISPR was used in fetal fibroblasts (connective tissue cells) to generate embryos through cloning, and then the embryos were implanted into mares.

The development of these five CRISPR-edited horses ten months ago, by the non-profit research organization Kheiron Biotech in Buenos Aires, Argentina, is proving controversial among horse breeders in Argentina, where polo is extremely popular, Reuters reported on 30 August.

Critics are concerned that the technology threatens people's livelihoods and that it will compromise the tradition of using selective breeding to generate elite horses. The Argentine Polo Association has now banned the use of gene-edited horses in the sport, following the lead of similar organizations such as the International Federation for Equestrian Sports1, which banned the practice in 2019.

Some scientists, however, welcome the CRISPR horses. “It's cool to show that CRISPR works and you can create CRISPR-altered horses,” says Molly McCue, a veterinary clinician scientist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. “Horse[riders] often feel very strongly about breeding as an art and not a science, but really it is both together,” she adds.

The CRISPR horses join a menagerie of gene-edited animals that have  wide-ranging applications — mostly with the goal of improving agriculture. Such efforts have now transformed from a research promise to a commercial reality, says Tad Sonstegard, chief scientific officer at Acceligen, a company in Eagan, Minnesota that specializes in the precision breeding of livestock. Biological engineering ethicist Jeantine Lunshof, at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, puts the rise of the technology in animals down to improvements in CRISPR techniques and “a broader acceptance of gene editing”.

Acceligen is one of a handful of companies that are using CRISPR to alter the genomes of livestock, with the goal of making animal products such as meat and milk in a more efficient manner. Its ‘PRLR-SLICK' cattle have an edit in the prolactin receptor gene that gives them shorter, slicker hair, providing tolerance to heat stress. Sonstegard says that the short-haired PRLR-SLICK cows should be able to adapt to hotter climates and to tolerate the rising temperatures associated with climate change, increasing the accessibility of meat and dairy products to people around the world. In 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the PRLR-SLICK cattle for meat production and human consumption, deeming them a low risk to safety, but it's unclear when the meat will hit the US market.

With a similar goal, researchers in India announced the first CRISPR-edited sheep earlier this year. As with the Argentine horses, the scientists edited the myostatin gene of the sheep to increase muscle mass — but in this case, the goal was to increase meat production rather than to speed the sheep up.

Disease resistance is another reason that scientists are producing CRISPR animals. Genus, a company based in Basingstoke, UK, has used CRISPR to generate pigs that contain a mutation in the CD163 gene. This makes them resistant to a virus that causes porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), which can be deadly for suckling pigs. In 2020, the FDA approved the gene-edited pigs for sale in the United States, and they are expected to go on the market there in 2026.

Researchers are also using CRISPR to make animal products that are safer for human consumption. GalSafe pigs, made by Revivicor in Blacksburg, Virginia, are designed to be a source of hypoallergenic meat. Researchers use CRISPR to inactivate the GGTA1 gene, which produces alpha-gal, a sugar molecule found in most mammals that can cause allergic reactions in humans who eat red meat. Revivicor is also investigating whether organs from the pigs could be transplanted into people: the company says that the same gene edits might reduce the risk of pig organs being rejected from human bodies. The FDA approved GalSafe pigs for use in biomedical therapeutics and for human consumption in 2020.

A new study explains that time travel itself eventually leads to a reality without it.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Is time travel truly possible? The prospect presents its fair share of paradoxes.

Of course, there are famous logical examples, such as the Grandfather paradox, which explores what would happen if a time traveler killed their grandparent before their parent was conceived (an idea not so far removed from the plot of the sci-fi great Back to the Future). Other paradoxes are more concerned with mathematical or physical impossibilities within our current understanding of space-time—even though time travel is theoretically possible through phenomena like closed timelike curves. 

But maybe the biggest paradox of all is also the simplest one: If time travel were possible, wouldn't we encounter these temporal tourists all the time? Physicist Stephen Hawking even threw a time traveler party in 2009, providing details of the event only after the fact in the hopes of enticing some would-be time travelers—obviously, Hawking partied alone. Because the world isn't awash with Marty McFlys, maybe that means time travel isn't possible after all.

Unfortunately, when it comes to the ins and outs of something immensely complicated like time travel, things are rarely so simple. 

In a new study, Andrew Jackson—a research associate from the School of Informatics—explores reasons beyond the scientific or technological as to why time travel appears to be impossible (at least, in this reality). Published in the preprint journal arXiv and titled “Where Are All the Tourists From 3025?,” the study posits that maybe time travel itself is a self-suppressing phenomenon. 

“I conclude that, assuming my model, time travel is self-suppressing: the timeline is continually rewritten until it inevitably reaches a timeline with no time machines ever being constructed, “ Jackson wrote. “At this point, no further changes to the timeline are possible.”

Jackson illustrates this idea with what's known as a Markov chain, named after Russian mathematician Andrey Markov, which describes a sequence of possible events wherein the probability of those events depends only on the current state. In the paper, Jackson shows that introducing time travel into any timeline would create dynamic instability that would eventually (at least, statistically) create a timeline where time travel was never invented, which is the most stable state for any timeline. The process of this continuous timeline change would, however, feel instantaneous to non-time travelers such as you and I.

Why would this happen this way? Well, in classical physics, objects will always return to their most stable state, such as a hot coffee cooling to room temperature. If time machines introduce temporal instability, then timelines will similarly default to the most stable state, which would be a timeline with no time machines at all. 

“[The paper] shows that time travel—by enabling timeline alterations—induces a dynamic instability that—with very high probability—leads to its own erasure,” Jackson wrote. “This self-suppressing mechanism results in the asymptotic convergence of all timelines toward states in which no time machines ever exist.”

Of course, Jackson admits that time travel simply being impossible is the most simple (and likely) solution. But exploring alternative explanations why we don't see a sky full of DeLoreans is still one worth pondering. 

“It may simply not be possible to travel through time,” Jackson wrote. “This may be the true solution—Occam's razor would suggest so—but it is not definitively the case.”

How the Math of Shuffling Cards Almost Brought Down an Online Poker Empire

Card dealers create a unique deck with each shuffle, something computers cannot replicate

By Manon Bischoff edited by Daisy Yuhas

If you've ever shuffled a deck of playing cards, you've most likely created a unique deck. That is, you're probably the only person who has ever arranged the cards in precisely that order. Although this claim sounds incredible, it's a great illustration of how quickly large numbers can creep into everyday situations—with occasionally challenging consequences, as the developers of an online poker game painfully discovered in the late 1990s.

The mathematics of card shuffling is quite easy to explain. To calculate how many arrangements 52 playing cards can have, you must go through all the possible shuffles. So logically, one of the 52 cards is placed on top, and once that's determined, there are only 51 possibilities for the card below it. The next card has only 50 possible options, and so on. A 52-card deck can therefore be arranged in 52 × 51 × 50 × ... × 2 × 1 = 52! different ways.

If you do the multiplication and round the answer, you will get a number with 67 zeros. That's more than a quadrillion times as many ways to arrange these cards as there are atoms on Earth.

So clearly there are many, many different ways to arrange 52 playing cards. And yet to find out how likely it is that another person in the world will randomly create the same sequence of cards by shuffling, it's not enough to simply calculate 1 / 52! That number simply indicates how likely it is to get one very specific shuffle of cards.

There's a more subtle question to consider: How likely would it be for any two or more people in the world to randomly shuffle a deck of cards in the same way?

This question is reminiscent of the birthday paradox. It works according to the same principle: It is rather unlikely that a student in a class has a birthday on a given date—in a group of 30 people, the probability of this is 1 − (364 / 365)30≈ 7.9 percent. The probability that two students are born on the same day is more than 70 percent, however. The reason for this apparent discrepancy is that people usually underestimate how many possible pairs of students there are. From 30 students, 435 pairs can be formed. The probability that each pair of students was born on a different day then doesn't seem so high.

If you want to find out how likely it is to randomly shuffle a deck of cards in the same way as any other person in the world, there are several ways to do it. One is to first calculate the probability of the opposite event and then subtract this result from 1. This means that you first examine how likely it is that all people in the world create a completely new arrangement when mixing: the first person has a probability of 1, the second a probability of (52! – 1) / 52!, the third of (52! – 2) / 52!, and so on. Then subtract this result from 1.

If there are eight billion people in the world, the probability that several people create the same shuffle of cards can be calculated as follows:

The trouble is that my calculator (or rather, the online program Wolfram|Alpha) fails when I try to evaluate this formula. Therefore, I have to rely on a very rough estimate of this probability:

This means that the probability that two or more people in the world will create the same deck of cards is less than 0.0000...08 percent—a number that only deviates from 0 in the 47th decimal place.

With that illustration, I hope I have convinced everyone that it is extremely unlikely that several people in the world would randomly create the same deck of cards by shuffling. But you have probably shuffled cards many times in your life, not just once. So how does the result change if we assume that each person shuffles approximately 100 decks of cards in their lifetime? By replacing the eight billion in the previous estimate with 800 billion, we find that the probability in this case is less than 8 × 10−43 percent.

In other words, the odds don't change by much. Even if each person in the world shuffles a deck of cards 100 times, it is very unlikely that the same deck will appear twice.

For that matter, if we consider every person who lives or has ever lived on earth—by some estimates, about 117 billion people—each of whom has shuffled a deck of cards about 100 times (which is unlikely, given that our species has not had playing cards for very long), then the probability that the same arrangement was created multiple times is less than 1.7 × 10−40 percent.

This makes it clear: it is truly extremely unlikely that two people in the entire history of humanity have ever shuffled a deck of cards the same way—at least assuming they shuffled the cards with great care. This illustrates how big 52! is and how enormously many possibilities there are for arranging 52 cards.

The vastness of 52! is not only inspiring to contemplate—it has also posed some significant practical problems for online game developers. Online poker can involve large sums of money, so it's critical that these games are as secure and fair as possible. Any flaws or loopholes could be exploited by cheaters or used by the house against players.

Digital cards should be well shuffled and dealt randomly, just like real ones. In an ideal world, an algorithm would randomly select an arrangement from the 52! possible decks. But no computer has enough memory to evaluate all of these possibilities, and a perfect random number generator doesn't yet exist. Therefore, developers generally rely on algorithms that simulate card shuffling.

In the late 1990s the development platform ASF Software supplied several online poker providers, such as Planet Poker, with card-shuffling algorithms. The platform even posted the algorithm on its website as proof that the game was reliably programmed. And this post caught the attention of some employees at Reliable Software Technologies, an IT company. “As soon as we saw the shuffling algorithm, we began to suspect there might be a problem. A little investigation proved that this intuition was correct,” a few employees wrote in a poston a software development website.

The algorithm started with an ordered deck of cards and then swapped two cards at a time in several steps. To do this, the program used a random number generator linked to the computer's system time. But there are several constraints on this method. For one, the swapping mechanism was implemented such that certain card arrangements were favored and more likely to appear than others. For another, the system ties its number generation to the number of seconds that have passed since midnight, resetting once each day, which further limits the possible random values. Only about 86 million arrangements could be generated this way, the Reliable Software Technologies team discovered.

The programmers then realized that because the system is tied to a clock to randomize its shuffles, the arrangement of cards could be further constrained by taking that timekeeper into account. Simply syncing up their own program to the system clock reduced the possibilities to a mere 200,000 potential decks that the algorithm could generate. “After that move, the system is ours, since searching through this tiny set of shuffles is trivial and can be done on a PC in real time,” they wrote. Recall that this was back in the 1990s, when computers were significantly less powerful than they are today.

The employees of Reliable Software Technologies reported these weaknesses to the algorithm's developers, who immediately revised it. Today many online poker sites use the Fisher–Yates algorithm, also called the Knuth shuffle (which sounds delightfully like a dance). It's easy to implement and delivers satisfactory results.

Of course, these algorithms are constrained in other ways—random generators simply aren't good enough to do what people can do with an actual deck. But even the most skillful human dealer cannot provide a perfect hand every time.

A region in Finland displays many of the traits shared by “Blue Zones,” where residents live longer, live healthier lifestyles, and embrace living in a community more than other parts of the world.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Ostrobothnia in Finland may not yet be a certified Blue Zone just yet, but researchers from Abo Akademi University believe it's well on its way. 

A Blue Zone is loosely defined as a geographical area in which an unusually large proportion of people live significantly longer and healthier lives than people in other parts of the world. The phenomenon is hotly debated, and some even claim it to be a myth entirely, but it continues to fascinate people worldwide. The qualifications have evolved over the years—coming to include lifestyle traits and community attitudes—but what all Blue Zones have in common is populations that consistently live notably longer lives. Ostrobothnia may well fit the bill. 

The team of researchers recently published a study in the Journal of Aging Research highlighting the search for potential Blue Zones in the Nordics, and they feel confident that they've found one. “Swedish-speaking Ostrobothnia,” they wrote, “showed preliminary tendencies to be a longevous Blue Zone in terms of high levels of longevity, health, and adherence to the Blue Zone lifestyle principles.”

The team researched various areas in Finland and found that Swedish-speaking Ostrobothnia showed good health and adherence to the Blue Zone lifestyle.  The island of Åland had the best health, but otherwise deviated from several Blue Zone lifestyle principles, and Finnish-speaking South Ostrobothnia showed the poorest health of the regions studied, even though it adhered to Blue Zone lifestyle principles as closely as its Swedish-speaking counterpart. The part of Ostrobothnia where people spoke predominantly Finnish deviated the most drastically from the Blue Zone lifestyle. 

“The findings imply that Nordic longevous regions do not necessarily adhere to the Blue Zone lifestyle,” the team wrote. “Future research incorporating individual community, and societal factors could further elucidate whether and how longevity, lifestyle, and health are interconnected in different ethnolinguistic contexts to further advance the understanding of health ageing and improve the implementation of effective health-promoting initiatives.”

Common Blue Zone populations share lifestyle traits like eating healthy, maintaining strong community bonds, engaging in moderate physical activity, and living with a sense of purpose. Examples of recognized Blue Zones include Ogliastra in Italy, Ikaria in Greece, Okinawa in Japan, and Martinique. 

But could the Blue Zone definitions be overly simplistic? “The potential link between longevity, health, and lifestyle may vary across cultural, political, social, and economic contexts in different regions,” Sarah Akerman, postdoctoral researcher in social policy and principal investigator of the Blue Zones in the Nordics project the university, said in a statement. “Here, we require additional demographic studies to verify the extraordinary life expectancy in Ostrobothnia, especially among the Swedish-speaking community.” 

The initial research—the team plans to keep harvesting data well into 2026 as part of the study—showed that Åland had the highest life expectancy and best health, but didn't match the lifestyle principles typically linked with long-lived populations. This suggest that life expectancy and health may be impacted by other factors on the islands. 

Swedish-speaking Ostrobothnia and South Ostrobothnia displayed the most consistent health-promoting lifestyles, but South Ostrobothnia had a lower life expectancy and the poorest health of the regions studied, even though they followed the Blue Zone lifestyle to the same extent as other areas.  

Even though it didn't adhere the most strictly to Blue Zone lifestyle choices, with life expectancy in Ostrobothnia averaging 83.1 years—higher than the Finnish average of 81.6 years and well outpacing the global 73.1-year average—the world may still have another Blue Zone on its hands.

Experts Warn of Growing Threats amid CDC Resignations

With the CDC in disarray and its future uncertain, this episode explores what's driving the exodus of agency staff and what this means for national health security.

[CLIP: Chris Hayes appearing on MSNBC's All In with Chris Hayes:“We're following breaking news out of the CDC, where top officials are resigning en masse.”]

Feltman: As you've probably noticed, things at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are pretty chaotic right now. Last week the Department of Health and Human Services announced that CDC head Susan Monarez would no longer be leading the agency, an announcement that Monarez and her legal team had plenty to say about. On September 1 a group of nine former CDC directors and acting directors penned a guest essay in the New York Times denouncing HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership. The group of CDC veterans, who have served presidents of both major parties and collectively carry more than a century of experience at the agency, called Kennedy's recent moves “unacceptable” and said his actions should “alarm every American, regardless of political leanings.” Additionally, a group of more than 1,000 past and present HHS employees put out a letter this week calling for Kennedy to resign.

Here to update us on the situation is Lauren Young, associate editor for health and medicine at Scientific American.

Lauren, thanks so much for coming on to talk to us.

Lauren Young: Thanks for having me.

Feltman: So big picture, what's going on at the CDC right now?

Young: Yeah, so it's a bit chaotic, and a lot of it is confusing in the sense that we've been getting information rolled out, you know, minute by minute. We've even had new developments that happened [in the] latter half of the week, after the major announcement that Susan Monarez is no longer the CDC director. We've had several other top officials submit resignations, and at the end of last week RFK Jr. announced an acting director for the CDC.

So it's a lot of things up in the air. With these several resignations of top officials a lot of branches of the CDC are currently leaderless, so it's gonna take some time to figure out who's filling in where, and there's a lot of concern among experts on, like, how this is going to roll out with regular just functioning at the CDC, just day-to-day operations.

It's a good reminder that the CDC, yes, is the primary public health agency that we have in the U.S. that's on top of things like pandemic preparedness, the COVID vaccines, other vaccine schedules, childhood vaccination schedules, but other things just, like, general outbreak surveillance—so we're just hot off the tails of a major measles outbreak. So we're kind of sitting in a hot seat right now trying to see how this is all gonna shake out in just daily operations.

Feltman: Yeah, so let's start with the head of the CDC, or perhaps former head of the CDC. Last week there was a lot of confusion about what the status of her employment was. Could you tell us about her background, who appointed her, how long she served and what's been happening in the last week or so?

Young: Yeah, so Susan Monarez has actually been a public health figure for quite some time. She's actually served [in] multiple presidential administrations prior to this. She's not a physician, but she's been in the public health space for quite some time.

So President Trump originally appointed and nominated Monarez for the position, and she was sworn [on] July 31. So she's really only been the director officially for the CDC for, you know, a few weeks. Prior to that she was serving as the acting director, but for some time the CDC had actually been leaderless—for several months.

Feltman: And so within the last few weeks we've, you know, gotten news that she was supposedly stepping down, but that's been quite legally contentious. Can you tell us more about that?

Young: Right, so last Wednesday, during the day, the Department of Health and Human Services posted on X that Monarez was no longer CDC director. There wasn't a lot of context to it; it was just this kind of blanket post. Shortly after that Monarez's lawyers, her legal team, posted a statement saying she had not received any notice that she had been fired and she was not planning on resigning or stepping down. And shortly after that [laughs] the White House spokesperson basically confirmed that she had been dismissed and had been terminated.

This was confusing because then her legal team came back again and posted, “Well, actually, since the president was the one who appointed her and she is Senate-approved, only the president can be the one to dismiss her formally.” So technically speaking, and from my reporting as of Tuesday, I haven't seen anything that has indicated that the president has changed his mind or made any decisions [about] whether to reappoint her or to support the decision. But theoretically, because she is a presidential appointee and was approved by the Senate, President Trump can come in and overturn this decision.

Feltman: So things have been kind of chaotic at the CDC for a while, to say the least. You know, they've been changing their recommendations about various vaccination schedules and requirements and having public health experts and organizations actively conflict with them in a way that's really unprecedented. But this firing—dot, dot, dot, question mark—has led to sort of a cascade of people who seem just done with their work at the CDC and a lot of big resignations. Could you tell us about that?

Young: Yeah, so far there's been four big-name resignations of several different branches, and I'll also mention, too, there was a huge walkout on the, the subsequent day that all of this has happened. So a lot upset amongst all staff, even among these top officials. But to name a few of—some of the branches, for example, the director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases stepped down, and this was a person who had been with the CDC for more than 30 years and is one of the top influenza experts ...

Feltman: Mm.

Young: Actually, at the CDC. And that's huge because this year we saw one of the highest years of pediatric deaths from influenza, so it's really, you know, terrifying that we have one of the top leaders who's resigned from that position. We've also seen the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases also resign. And we've also seen the CDC chief medical officer resign. So those are just a few of [the] folks who've decided to step down from their positions.

Feltman: And what kind of reasons have they been giving in their statements as they've resigned?

Young: There's been several. A big theme has been just the sheer amount of misinformation and disinformation that's come out ...

Feltman: Hmm.

Young: Of these public health agencies since Kennedy has taken the helm of the HHS. That's been, to me, one of the biggest themes. A lot of the, you know, just sudden, confusing explanations around vaccination schedules. There was a lot of citations, too, of the measles outbreak and, again, some confusing information about how you should be treated for it, about vaccinations.

So there were several reasons. A few of 'em also mentioned the tragic event, the shooting that happened earlier in August at the CDC's campus—at least one of the letters had mentioned or referenced that as a potential reason for this.

Feltman: You know, I think some listeners might hear that these experts are resigning and think, you know, “How could they leave an organization that they feel like is in so much trouble?” And I think the point that [the experts] seem to be making is: the CDC has drifted so far from its mission statement and become such a chaotic, you know, misinforming, disinforming organization that they don't believe they can help public health by staying there. Would you say that that's accurate?

Young: Yeah, actually, I was listening to several of these officials who resigned, one of which [was] Debra Houry, who was the CDC chief medical officer. She was telling PBS NewsHour ...

[CLIP: Debra Houry appearing on PBS NewsHour: “I thought my voice and the voice of my colleagues that also resigned with me would be more powerful on the outside.”]

Young: And that it really just was a tipping point. She felt like she no longer could work in a credible way. Another thing she mentioned—and I've seen this, too, from several reports—[with] some of the violence that's been taking place against public health and directly against CDC's staff, you know, they are fearful of speaking out, and they feel that they have targets on their backs.

Those were a few things that she had mentioned that, I think, kind of speak to that question, yeah.

Feltman: Well, and I know you talked to a couple of folks who are experts in the public health space. What did they have to say about why this is happening and what the implications are?

Young: Yeah, so I've spoken to a couple public health experts. Georges Benjamin, who's the executive director of the American Public Health Association, he was telling me that he's concerned, you know, who would even want the CDC director position, let alone any position at the CDC or these public health agencies, when you have somebody in charge who doesn't believe in the science and believe in the evidence. I think that's a question that a lot of people are sitting on.

And he also mentioned, he was like, you're seeing these people leaving because they've essentially just had enough, you know? They've had enough of trying to push for the evidence, following where the data's leading them but then not being listened to. I've been hearing a lot of that in the conversation.

Another person I talked to, Jennifer Nuzzo, who's an epidemiologist and the director at the Pandemic Center at Brown University, she's really concerned about how the lack of cohesion in these leadership spaces, in these public health agencies, what they are saying to other nations. She's particularly worried about potential biological threats.

The emergence of that threat is potentially growing, and what she told me, which I think really sits [at the heart of the issue], is: “No one is home to watch out for health threats to the nation, and no one will be there to respond.” And, you know, these are what our public health agencies do; they're looking out for us 24/7, whether that's a foodborne-illness outbreak, whether that's measles, whether that is a biological threat. So I think that's something that I know all these experts on the outside and on the inside are thinking about right now.

Feltman: Well, and, you know, as you mentioned there are a lot of question marks about who will lead the CDC, who would want to, who HHS and the president want leading the organization [laughs], given the people that they've pushed out. But what do we know about who's running the CDC in the interim?

Young: Right, so the HHS did announce an acting director for the CDC, who is Jim O'Neill. He's been serving as the deputy secretary of the HHS, so he worked very closely with Kennedy. So he's going to be, right now, the acting director of the CDC, and like Monarez [O'Neill is] also not a physician. He was a Silicon Valley investor and entrepreneur; worked in, like, aging, longevity spaces; and during the pandemic he was pretty critical of the CDC's response. So far from what we know of O'Neill's stance on vaccination is he's publicly stated that he's pro-vaccine and that he has been an adviser to a vaccine company. So we're just gonna have to wait and see what happens.

Feltman: Thanks so much for coming on to talk us through this, Lauren.

Young: Thanks so much for having me.

Feltman: On Thursday, which is when I'm recording this, Kennedy testified before the Senate. While the hearing's stated focus was the administration's health care agenda for 2026, he was, of course, questioned on recent changes to the CDC. Kennedy maintained that those changes were necessary. For more up-to-date news on this story, go to ScientificAmerican.com.

Within most tissues, the extracellular microenvironment provides mechanical cues that guide cell fate and function. Changes in the extracellular matrix such as aberrant deposition, densification and increased crosslinking are hallmarks of late-stage fibrotic diseases that often lead to organ dysfunction. Biomaterials have been widely used to mimic the mechanical properties of the fibrotic matrix and study pathophysiologic cell function. However, the initiation of fibrosis has largely been overlooked, due to challenges in recapitulating early stages of disease progression within the native extracellular microenvironment. Here, using visible-light-mediated photochemistry, we induced local crosslinking and stiffening of extracellular matrix proteins within ex vivo mouse and human lung tissue. In ex vivo lung tissue of epithelial cell lineage-traced mice, local matrix crosslinking mimicked early fibrotic lesions that increased alveolar epithelial cell mechanosensing, differentiation, and nascent protein deposition and remodelling. However, the inhibition of cytoskeletal tension, mechanosensitive signalling pathways or integrin engagement reduced epithelial cell spreading and differentiation. Our findings emphasize the role of local extracellular matrix crosslinking and nascent protein deposition in early stage tissue fibrosis and have implications for ex vivo disease modelling and applications to other tissues.

Since Hans Driesch's pioneering work in 1891, it has been known that animal embryos can develop into complete individuals even when divided. However, the developmental processes and molecular mechanisms enabling this self-organization remain poorly understood. In this study, we revisit Driesch's experiments by examining the development of isolated 2-cell stage blastomeres in the sea urchin, Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus. Contrary to intact embryos, these isolated blastomeres initially form a flat, single layer of dividing cells that eventually round up to be a blastula. Live imaging and knockdown experiments reveal that actomyosin activity at the basal side of the cells and septate junctions drives this process. Intriguingly, we observed temporal disorganization of the anterior-posterior (A-P) and dorsal-ventral (D-V) axes, where the original A-P poles come into contact after sphere shape formation. The disrupted A-P axis is subsequently corrected as the embryos employ the Wnt/β-catenin signaling mechanisms assumed to be used in intact embryos to re-establish a normal axis. These findings suggest that axis re-organization through pre-existing developmental mechanisms is essential for the successful regulative development of divided embryos.

In 1891, Hans Driesch demonstrated that isolated 2-cell and 4-cell stage sea urchin blastomeres can each develop into a complete individual, highlighting the remarkable self-organizing capacity of early embryos1. Following this seminal discovery, researchers observed similar self-organization abilities in early embryos across various taxa2,3,4,5,6. Even in humans, this phenomenon underpins the formation of identical twins when early embryos split accidentally. In contrast, animals relying on mosaic development, where maternal factors predetermine cell fate during early stages, lack this self-organization capacity (e.g., comb jellyfish, solitary ascidians, tusk shells)7.

Despite Driesch's experiments being referenced in textbooks for over a century, the molecular mechanisms governing this self-organizing ability remain poorly understood. Moreover, detailed morphological and developmental analyses of separated early embryos are scarce (Fig. 1a). Echinoderms, especially sea urchins, offer an ideal model system to study self-organization due to their external fertilization, ease of manipulation, and transparency—making them suitable for high-resolution live imaging. Additionally, the extensive genomic and gene regulatory data available for sea urchins further supports their utility in unraveling these mechanisms8,9,10,11,12. Remarkably, sea urchins were the original model system used by Driesch to demonstrate self-organization. While there is one report on isolated blastomere development in sea stars13, detailed studies on sea urchins remain elusive, and this gap must be addressed.

Here, we revisit Driesch's classic experiments using modern molecular biology techniques to define the self-organization phenomenon in sea urchins. Focusing on the Japanese species Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus, we describe the developmental trajectory of isolated 2-cell stage blastomeres, with particular attention to the molecular forces driving morphological changes. Additionally, we report the re-organization of the anterior-posterior (A-P) and dorsal-ventral (D-V) axes during the development.

Initially, we examined the morphology of H. pulcherrimus embryos bisected at the 2-cell stage (Fig. 1). During early cleavage, each isolated blastomere followed a cleavage pattern similar to that of intact embryos (Fig. 1b–i). For example, at the 16-cell stage, when intact embryos formed 8 mesomeres, 4 macromeres and 4 micromeres, halved embryos generated 4 mesomeres, 2 macromeres and 2 micromeres. However, after the 16-cell stage, while intact embryos continued cleaving to form a blastula (Fig. 1p–s), the halved embryos unexpectedly developed a flat, plate-like structure instead (Fig. 1j). The edges of this flattened structure then lifted, forming a cup-like shape (Fig. 1k), which gradually closed at the opening (Fig. 1l, m), eventually creating a sphere (Fig. 1n). At this stage, the blastocoel was difficult to discern in the spherical embryos. Ultimately, the halved embryos developed a clear blastocoel (Fig. 1o), becoming miniature versions of an intact blastula (Fig. 1t).

Given the essential role of the extracellular matrix (ECM), hyaline layer, which we removed during blastomere isolation, in normal sea urchin development14,15, we considered whether its absence caused the irregular morphology. However, this possibility was ruled out, as isolated blastomeres with an intact hyaline layer exhibited the same morphological changes (Supplementary Fig. 1). This indicates that the observed developmental process is an intrinsic feature of bisected embryos. We named these distinct stages of halved embryo morphology as flat, cup and sphere (Fig. 1j–n). Although the development of halved embryos progressed more slowly than intact embryos, once the blastula was formed, the subsequent developmental processes—such as mesenchyme cell ingression, gastrulation, and pluteus formation—proceeded in a manner similar to that of intact embryos (Supplementary Fig. 2).

During our observations, we identified two key biological questions regarding the developmental re-organization of halved embryos. First, how does the flat morphology transition into a sphere? Second, how is a normal body axis established in the resulting sphere, given that the original axis could be disrupted during this shape transformation?

To investigate the mechanism driving the flat-to-sphere transition, we examined whether this morphological change was accompanied by additional cell proliferation. Our analysis showed no significant difference in cell number between intact embryos and double-counted halved embryos, indicating that the shape change is not due to increased cell proliferation but rather a result of cell shape changes (Fig. 2a, b). To further understand these cell shape dynamics, we closely observed the transition from cup to sphere using the membrane probe FM1-43 (Fig. 2c–f). Similar to intact blastulae, both the cup-shaped and sphere-shaped halved embryos were composed of a single layer of cells. However, the cells in halved embryos were notably more elongated along the apical-basal axis compared to those in intact embryos, forming a distinct cone-like shape (indicated by magenta double-headed arrows in Fig. 2c–f, k). The cell length in cup-shaped halved embryos was significantly greater than that in control embryos at 8 hours post fertilization (hpf) (corresponding to the flat stage of halved embryos), 10 hpf (cup stage equivalent), and 14 hpf (blastula stage equivalent) (Supplementary Fig. 3). Therefore, cell elongation along the apicobasal axis appears to be a specific feature of halved embryos. As development progressed, the apices of these cone-shaped cells converged at the center of the spherical embryo, while the edges of the cup gradually sealed laterally, leading to complete closure. During the subsequent transition from sphere to blastula, the elongated cells shortened to adopt a columnar shape, similar to those found in intact blastulae (Fig. 2k). This series of coordinated cell shape changes underlies the morphological re-organization from a flat structure to a spherical blastula-like form in halved embryos.

To identify the factor(s) regulating the drastically morphological transition from flat to spherical shape, we first perturbed several signaling pathways known to play key roles in embryonic development. However, none of the treatments affected the shape transition (Supplementary Fig. 4). This suggested that the morphological change in halved embryos might be driven by cell-autonomous mechanisms. We therefore focused on the cytoskeleton and performed live imaging of actin dynamics in halved embryos by injecting lifeact-mCherry mRNA (Fig. 2g–j, Supplementary Movie 1). To visualize the nuclei and determine the apicobasal axis, we co-injected histone2B-Venus mRNA, as nuclei localize to the apical side of cells in normal sea urchin blastulae16. In control blastula, actin accumulation was observed both apical and basal side and the accumulation at apical side is stronger than that at the basal side (Fig. 2g). Unexpectedly, in halved embryos, we observed strong actin polymerization on the basal side of the cells, opposite the nuclei, during the cup-to-sphere transition (Fig. 2h, i, white arrowheads). To determine if this basal actin polymerization is essential for the morphological change, we treated halved embryos with cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, and (-)-blebbistatin, an inhibitor of myosin-II ATPase, from the flat stage (Fig. 2l–o). While over 90% of control halves successfully formed a spherical shape, 100% of cytochalasin D-treated halves were arrested at the cup stage and never formed spheres. Additionally, 94% of blebbistatin-treated embryos exhibited significant delays in sphere formation, resulting in incomplete spherical blastulae (Supplementary Fig. 5). In both treatments, cell elongation along the apicobasal axis was not observed. These results suggest that actomyosin-generated forces on the basal side of cells are crucial for cell elongation along the apicobasal axis, and this cell shape change is essential for the proper formation of the blastula.

To identify additional factors involved in the shape transition of halved embryos, we examined the role of septate junctions, which are septa-like structures between cells that function as occluding junctions in invertebrates17. In Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, septate junctions are formed at the 8th cleavage stage18. Notably, the timing of the flat-to-cup shape transition in halved embryos coincided with the initiation of septate junction formation, prompting us to investigate the role of septate junction-related genes, particularly Tetraspanin19. in situ hybridization revealed that tetraspanin was ubiquitously expressed across the entire embryo in the flat stage, and this expression persisted through the sphere stage (Fig. 2p–s, Supplementary Fig. 6a, b). This expression pattern was identical to that in control embryos. To assess whether septate junctions are required for the shape transition in halved embryos, we attenuated tetraspanin function using a morpholino anti-sense oligo (MO) and analyzed the resulting phenotypes (Fig. 2t, u, Supplementary Fig. 6c, d). While 82% of control halved embryos successfully transitioned to the sphere stage, only 8% of tetraspanin-deficient halved embryos achieved this transition. Most tetraspanin-deficient halved embryos exhibited a “bumpy” flat shape, where cells were misaligned and failed to form a single cell layer. By 24 hpf, a small percentage of tetraspanin-deficient embryos eventually adopted a spherical shape. A similar phenotype was observed in halved embryos where ZO-1, another component of septate junctions19, was knocked down using a specific morpholino (Supplementary Fig. 6d). These results strongly suggest that the mechanical forces provided by septate junctions contribute significantly to the shape transition from flat to spherical in halved embryos.

Based on these observations, we identified two molecular mechanisms regulating the shape transition in halved embryos: actomyosin constriction and the adhesive force of septate junctions. Surprisingly, neither mechanism relies on the signaling pathways typically associated with body axes formation. Instead, shape transition depends on an intrinsic system. The cells themselves actively adhere to each other via septate junctions, and this strong cellular adhesion facilitates the morphological change from a flat to a spherical structure as the cells reorganize to form a cohesive, unified shape.

Next, to characterize the gene expression feature of halved embryos, we performed bulk RNA-seq and compared the gene expression profile between intact embryos and halved embryos by principal component analysis (PCA) (Fig. 3a). Halved embryos were sampled at 4 stages: cup, sphere, 6-8 hours after sphere formation and early gastrula. Intact embryos were sampled at 2-cell stage and corresponding timing with each stage of halved embryos. At cup shape stage, the gene expression profile of control and halved embryos were similar. At the sphere stage, a large difference was detected between control and the halves. Surprisingly, the difference between control and halves was rapidly compensated 6-8 hours after the sphere shape formed. This result implies that some critical event for accomplishing self-organization occurred after sphere formation. We especially focused on genes which is involved in body axes formation and compared gene expression amount of 5 anterior specification genes (foxQ2, homeobrain, six3, sFRP1/5, dkk-1), 4 posterior specification genes (wnt8, wnt1, frizzled5/8, blimp1) and 4 lateral ectoderm specification gene (nodal, lefty, chordin, bmp2/4) between control and halves, and the only detectable difference was foxQ2 expression amount (at cup stage: cup/control = 4.63). Therefore, we focused on foxQ2 and traced the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis formation in halved embryos. We analyzed gene expression patterns in halved embryos using in situ hybridization chain reactions with foxQ2 (an anterior marker) and alx1 or foxA (posterior markers) (Fig. 3b–f). In intact embryos, foxQ2 and foxA were expressed at opposite poles, and halved embryos initially exhibited similar patterns with control (Fig. 3b–d). However, immediately after the halved embryos formed a spherical shape, foxQ2 and foxA were expressed in close proximity, almost adjacent to each other (Fig. 3e), indicating a complete disruption of the A-P axis. Remarkably, six hours later, the expression sites of foxQ2 and foxA had returned to opposite poles, resembling normal A-P axis (Fig. 3f). These observations show that the A-P axis temporarily collapses when the spherical shape was formed but is subsequently reorganized to restore normal axis patterning.

Since no aberrant cell proliferation was observed during the formation of the spherical shape (Fig. 2a, b), we hypothesized that A-P axis re-organization occurs through one of three possible mechanisms: (1) shifting the anterior end specification site from its original to its final position, (2) shifting the posterior end specification site from its original to its final position, or (3) shifting both the anterior and posterior end specification sites to their final positions. To determine the most likely scenario, we labeled the animal-pole cells of halved flat-stage embryos with DiI (Fig. 3g) and tracked the labeled cells at the gastrula stage to determine their location in the body. In intact sea urchin embryos, animal-pole cells typically contribute to the anterior end region12. However, in 78.8% of halved embryos, the labeled cells were found in the lateral ectoderm, suggesting that the anterior end was specified in a different position from the original. Remarkably, in 30% of the halved embryos, the labeled cells were located in the posterior lateral ectoderm (Fig. 3h, Supplementary Fig. 7). We also performed the same labeling experiment on posterior cells of halved embryos (Veg2 lineage, which give rise to secondary mesenchyme cells and archenteron cells12). In 75% of halved embryos, the labeled cells contributed to the archenteron or became secondary mesenchyme cells at the gastrula stage (Supplementary Fig. 7), indicating that the posterior region was specified at its original site. These results suggest that A-P axis re-organization is primarily accomplished through the shift of the anterior end specification site from its original to its final position, while the posterior end maintains its original position.

To investigate whether the Wnt/β-catenin, which is the first and the most responsible signaling for A-P patterning20,21, plays a role in the shifting of the anterior end specification site in halved embryos, we blocked the pathway by injecting mRNA encoding a truncated form of cadherin's cytoplasmic domain (Δcad). This truncated cadherin prevents β-catenin from entering the nucleus and functioning as a transcription factor22,23. We labeled the animal pole cells of the halved Δcad embryos with DiI to trace the cell fate shift. As a result, the labeled cells remained at the most anterior end, indicating that the animal-pole cells retained their original fate (Fig. 3i [cf. Fig. 3g, h]). This result strongly suggests that endogenous Wnt/β-catenin signaling is necessary for the anterior end shift in halved embryos. Intriguingly, at the timing of the anterior-fate shifting in halved embryos, Wnt/β-catenin originally does not play a role in restricting the anterior end region in intact embryos. Thus, we hypothesized that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is reactivates irregularly in halved embryos at this stage. To test this, we performed live imaging of halved embryos injected with β-catenin-Venus mRNA, which allowed us to trace where Wnt/β-catenin signaling was active22,24. In these embryos, we observed a temporal nuclear β-catenin signals in a region adjacent to the original posterior site after the halved embryos formed a sphere (white asterisks in Fig. 3j–l, Supplementary Movie 2). To confirm whether canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling is truly reactivated after the embryo has reached the sphere stage—at a time point when it would normally be too late to suppress foxQ2, we treated embryos with the Wnt inhibitor C59 from cup shape stage and analyzed the expression patterns of foxQ2 and foxA at blastula stage. While C59 does not achieve the same level of canonical Wnt inhibition as ∆cadherin injection in H. pulcherrimus, it has a relatively strong inhibitory effect and was thus used in this experiment. In control halved embryos, 100% (16/16) showed polar expression of foxQ2 and foxA at opposite ends (Fig. 3m, m'), consistent with successful A–P re-formation. In contrast, 44% (7/16) of C59-treated halved embryos exhibited foxQ2 and foxA expression in adjacent regions, indicating a failure of foxQ2 to shift to the opposite pole after initial proximity to foxA after being formed sphere (Fig. 3n, n'). Overall, these results indicate that a transient Wnt/β-catenin signal plays a crucial role in shifting the anterior end region from its original to the final position, facilitating the re-organization of the A-P axis in halved embryos following sphere formation. In addition, non-canonical Wnt signaling has been reported to restrict anterior neuroectodermal fate downstream of canonical Wnt in normal sea urchin embryos20,25, we next investigated whether this pathway is involved in anterior fate shifting in halved embryos. We inhibited c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a key component of non-canonical Wnt signaling, using the JNK inhibitor SP600125, and observed the positional relationship between foxQ2-positive anterior regions and foxA-positive posterior regions in halved embryos (Supplementary Fig. 8). In 97% of control halves, the anterior and posterior regions were located at opposite poles, similar to intact embryos. However, in 27% of JNK-inhibited embryos, the anterior and posterior regions were adjacent to each other, suggesting that non-canonical Wnt signaling is partially required for anterior end shifting. These findings suggest that signaling pathways, which normally restrict the anterior-most region in intact embryos, are also utilized during A-P axis re-formation in halved embryos.

Considering the organization of body axes, we next focused on the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis. During sea urchin embryogenesis, D-V axis formation is regulated by members of the TGF-β superfamily, including Nodal, Lefty, Chordin, and BMP2/426,27,28. To determine whether the D-V axis forms normally in halved embryos, we performed in situ hybridization with nodal and lefty (Fig. 3o-x). In intact embryos, nodal is expressed exclusively in the future ventral ectoderm. In halved embryos, although the precise expression position was challenging to completely identify in the flat stage, we detected biased nodal expression. Intriguingly, from the cup stage onward, nodal was ubiquitously expressed across the entire embryo, except at the anterior and posterior ends, this pattern that persisted until the spherical stage. Four hours after the halved embryos formed a sphere, nodal expression became re-biased toward the future ventral side, resembling that of intact embryos. We also observed nuclear phosphorylated-Smad2/3 (pSmad2/3), a downstream transcription factor of the Nodal signaling pathway29, throughout the embryo at the cup stage, except at the anterior and posterior ends (Supplementary Fig. 9), supporting the notion that ectopically expressed Nodal functions as a signaling ligand. The expression pattern of lefty closely mirrored that of nodal during the cup stage, though it was less prominent immediately after the embryos reached the sphere stage; however, the precise mechanism responsible for this transient reduction remains undetermined in the current study (Fig. 3w). To investigate BMP signaling, we performed immunohistochemistry to detect phosphorylated-Smad1/5/8 (pSmad1/5/8), a transcription factor downstream of BMP29, which marks the region where BMP2/4 functions (Supplementary Fig. 10). In halved embryos, pSmad1/5/8 signals were first observed at 16 hpf, coinciding with the timing in intact embryos, and were localized on one side, as in normal embryos. Notably, no pSmad1/5/8 signals were detected before the embryos reached the sphere stage (Supplementary Fig. 10g). These findings suggest that the D-V axis is initially present in halved embryos and is later reorganized after the spherical shape is established.

Our data revealed that H. pulcherrimus 2-cell halved embryos undergo a unique developmental process, progressing through flat, cup and sphere stages (Figs. 1, 4a). This specific sequence had never been reported in any sea urchin species, making it an intriguing discovery for us. We also observed this developmental pattern in other sea urchins, such as S. purpuratus and Strongylocentrotus intermedius, when embryos were halved at the 2-cell stage (Supplementary Fig. 11). In contrast, 2-cell blastomeres of Temnopleurus reevesii developed directly into a blastula without passing through the flat or cup stages. A key difference in T. reevesii development is the lack of compaction until the 60-cell stage, while other echinoderms exhibit strong cell-cell adhesion from early cleavage stages30. Further studies with additional echinoderm species will help elucidate whether this developmental process is completely common across the phylum. Interestingly, previous research demonstrated that 2-cell stage sea urchin embryos, in which one blastomere was killed while maintaining the membrane structure, could still form a blastula31 (Supplementary Fig. 12a-f). This led to the hypothesis that sea urchin embryos “actively” recognize their individual boundaries through cell-cell signal communication31. At first glance, the pronounced morphological changes from the flat or cup to the sphere in our study might suggest an ‘active' reorganization of individual cell boundaries, contributing to the formation of the spherical blastula body through cell-cell signaling. However, no major signaling pathways were involved in this shape transition and there is no difference between control and halves in gene expression profile at cup shape stage (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 4). Therefore, we propose that the establishment of embryonic boundaries during development is governed primarily by cell-autonomous mechanisms in halved embryos, rather than by active cell–cell signaling. The observed morphological outcome—the formation of a spherical blastula—appears to emerge as a cumulative result of individual cells autonomously regulating their own shape and behavior. In this view, the overall halved embryo shape is not sculpted by coordinated, long-range intercellular signaling, but rather by the local, self-organized activities of individual cells acting independently, yet coherently.

a Schematic summary of halved H. pulcherrimus development. Grey bars indicate the time frame that each event which we argued in this article occurs. b Two crucial events in sea urchin self-organization which we discussed. (Upper row) Making sphere shape: At the timing for shape transition from flat to cup, actomyosin activity at the basal side of the cells (red) contribute to cells elongate along apicobasal axis direction and make cells cone chape. Apex of each cell is bundled and becomes the center of the embryo. Simultaneously, septate junction (blue) gives each cell the ability to adhere each other on the lateral side. As a result, the free edge of the cup can bind each other and form sphere. (Lower row) A-P axis re-organization: At the cup shape stage, presumptive anterior pole (magenta) and posterior pole (green) are in their original positions. When sphere shape is formed, presumptive anterior and posterior region are temporarily placed very close together and anterior-posterior (A-P) axis is temporarily disturbed. Triggered by anterior and posterior pole contact, Wnt/ß-catenin signal is newly activated at adjacent region of original posterior pole, and the signal makes the anterior-most region shift to the opposite side. Finally proper A-P axis is formed.

In sea urchin and sea star eggs, the first cleavage establishes apical-basal polarity, where the apical side adheres to the ECM and the basal side to other cells. This polarity is maintained even when 2-cell stage blastomeres are separated32,33,34,35, indicating that apical-basal polarity maintenance is a cell-autonomous event. Therefore, the characteristic flat shape of halved embryos likely results from the apical nature of the cell, as the apical side continues to adhere to the ECM even in isolated blastomeres. Our data suggest that septate junctions play a crucial role in the transition from flat to sphere shape in halved sea urchin embryos (Fig. 2p–u). Septate junctions are rapidly formed following cell reaggregation, as seen in hydra regeneration from dissociated cells36, and dissociated cells from sea urchin blastulae can also regenerate a whole organism from cell aggregates37,38. Although the precise mechanisms of septate junction assembly in sea urchin embryos remain unclear, it is plausible that this process is cell-autonomously initiated in early development. In addition, halved embryos never fuse to other halves after they make sphere. Thus, we propose that septate junctions are part of a cell-autonomous mechanism determining the individual boundary in halved embryos. The lateral regions of cells are predisposed to form septate junctions with neighboring cells, enabling the flat/cup structure to close the opening and form a single-layered sphere as septate junctions develop between the cells at the edge of the halved embryos (Fig. 4b). We also suggest that actomyosin activity at the basal side of cells contributes to the dynamic morphological changes in halved embryos by facilitating cell shape alterations, although we cannot completely rule out a potential contribution from apical actin. Since extreme cell elongation along the apical-basal axis was not observed in halved sea star embryos6,13, nor in other sea urchin species (Supplementary Fig. 11), we hypothesize that the cell elongation observed in H. pulcherrimus halved embryos may be a species-specific feature. In addition, it is implied that actin accumulation on basal side of the cell is halved embryos specific response because actin accumulation at the apical side was stronger than the basal side in normal blastula (Fig. 2g). We cannot definitively determine whether the accumulation of actin at the basal side is cell-autonomous. However, it is implied that halved embryos utilize some intrinsic mechanisms to regulate the actin accumulation and cell shape change because halved embryos could make sphere with any signaling perturbation (Supplementary Fig. 4).

This research revealed that the temporarily disrupted A-P axis during the flat-to-sphere transition is gradually restored afterward. The re-organization of the A-P axis is triggered by the proximity of the anterior and posterior regions, with the anterior end shifting from its original position, driven by vegetal signals temporarily activated by Wnt/β-catenin (Fig. 4b). This study provides the first experimental evidence of the molecular mechanism underlying axis re-formation during self-organization. As shown in Fig. 3o–x, nodal and lefty is broadly expressed in the lateral ectoderm, even after halved embryos form a sphere. Given that FoxQ2 selectively represses the autoregulatory loop of nodal but does not block its initial expression21, we hypothesize that the Nodal/FoxQ2-free region is formed by the positional shift of the foxQ2-expressing anterior end in response to posterior signals. This shift re-establishes the morphogen gradient along the D-V axis, starting from the Nodal/FoxQ2-free region. Support for this model comes from the observation that BMP2/4 becomes active after sphere formation (Supplementary Fig. 10). Based on these observations, our findings suggest that the re-establishment of the anterior–posterior (A–P) axis acts as an indirect trigger for the formation of the dorsal–ventral (D–V) axis. While the A–P axis does not directly instruct D–V specification, its proper reconstruction appears to create a necessary permissive condition for the initiation of D–V polarity. One possible mechanistic explanation for this is based on previous studies showing that the D–V axis can only be established once the Nodal repressor, FoxQ2, is cleared from the ectoderm21. During the ambiguous period of A–P axis re-formation, FoxQ2 expression is transiently detected and then disappears. Although FoxQ2 does not prevent the initial activation of nodal, its presence is thought to interfere with the autoregulatory loop required for sustained Nodal expression21. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the autoregulatory loop of Nodal—required for robust D–V axis formation26—can only be stably activated after the anterior shift and clearance of FoxQ2 have been completed. In this way, A–P axis re-formation indirectly triggers D–V axis establishment by ensuring a cellular environment conducive to stable Nodal expression. A similar phenomenon has been observed in Xenopus laevis, where dorsal and ventral ends are juxtaposed during wound healing, and both ends shift from their original positions when blastulae are bisected39. Since β-catenin is stabilized at the dorsal end by cortical rotation in Xenopus, inducing a morphogen gradient along the D-V axis40, it is possible that a similar mechanism triggers self-organization in sea urchins. In sea urchins, β-catenin is stabilized at the vegetal pole, and the adjacency of the anterior and posterior ends initiates self-organization. Indeed, stable A-P axis formation is important for D-V axis formation, since A-P axis deficient halved embryos, in which ∆cadherin was injected into, are covered with long and immotile cilia (Supplementary Fig. 13) as in reported ∆cad embryos, indicating that they are composed only of anterior neuroectoderm20. The reason for the broad nodal and lefty expression during the cup and sphere stages is unclear and should be addressed in future studies. One report suggest that redox state regulate the D-V axis formation41. Live imaging of mitochondria distribution in halved embryos may provide further insights into this process.

Based on the molecular mechanisms of self-organization revealed in this study, we define self-organization as the process in which axes and molecular gradient information is reorganized within a newly defined individual boundary, without de-differentiation, in response to signals from the organizer. This study not only demonstrates the first experimental proof of axes re-formation during self-organization but also highlights the robustness and flexibility of embryonic developmental programs. The fact that sea urchin embryos, and potentially other species, can autonomously re-establish their developmental axes and molecular gradients in response to disruptions suggests that these systems are hardwired for resilience. This intrinsic ability to re-form body axes without external cues points to the evolutionary significance of self-organization, likely as a safeguard against environmental or developmental perturbations. Understanding these molecular mechanisms provides new insights into how early embryonic systems maintain developmental fidelity. Moreover, the parallels between sea urchin and Xenopus embryos hint at conserved evolutionary pathways regulating self-organization, possibly extending to other deuterostomes. In a broader context, our findings may have implications for regenerative biology and artificial tissue engineering, where inducing or harnessing similar self-organizing principles could be critical for tissue repair and organ regeneration. The discovery of species-specific features, such as the cell elongation observed in H. pulcherrimus, further suggests that there may be as-yet-undiscovered diversity in self-organization mechanisms across species. Investigating these variation and/or similarity in depth could open new avenues for understanding developmental plasticity and robustness, providing valuable insights into both evolutionary biology and biomedical applications.

Adults of Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus and Temnopleurus reevesii were collected around Shimoda Marine Research Center (University of Tsukuba) and Marine and Coastal Research Center (Ochanomizu University) under the special harvest permission of prefectures and the Japan Fishery cooperative. Strongylocentrotus intermedius were gifted for experimental purposes from Chirippu Fishery Cooperative, and the experiment using Strongylocentrotus purpuratus was supervised by Prof. Gary Wessel (Brown University, Providence, RI, USA). Gametes were collected by injecting 0.5 M KCl into the body cavity. The embryos were cultured in plastic dishes or glass beakers filled with filtered natural seawater (FSW) containing 50 µg/ml of kanamycin sulfate (Nacalai Tesque Inc., Kyoto, Japan) and kept at 15 °C until an appropriate stage. FM1-43 FX (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was treated with a final 4 µM in FSW from 1 h before observation. Cytochalasin D (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Co., Osaka, Japan), (-)-blebbistatin (FUJIFILM), cyclopamine (FUJIFILM), and 4-aminopyridine (FUJIFILM) were treated with 2 µM, 30 µM, 6.25 µm, and 2 mM, respectively, from the flat or cup shape stage. Actinomycin D (FUJIFILM) and cycloheximide (FUJIFILM) were treated with 25 µg/µl and 2 mM from 20 min after fertilization. U0126 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and Y27632 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) were added with 10 µM and 1 mM from 2-cell stage. C59 (Funakoshi Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was treated from the cup stage at 0.8 mM. SP600126 (FUJIFILM) was treated from the sphere shape stage at 2 µM. All reagents were diluted with FSW, and the same volume of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as a negative control.

For cell counting in embryos, the embryos were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in FSW for 10 minutes and washed several times with PBS-T ([PBS] Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan 0.1% Tween-20). Nuclei were then stained with DAPI. The embryos were observed under a confocal microscope, and the number of cells was determined. To avoid miscounting, nuclear signals were marked digitally during analysis.

All gene information is available at HpBase (Genome & Transcriptome database for H. pulcherrimus8). Tetraspanin (tspn: HPU_14020) and ZO-1 (HPU_12399) of H. pulcherrimus were cloned with primers written in below.

Forwerd primers have EcoRI sequence, and Reverse primer have XhoI sequence for inserting PCR products to pCS2+ vector with in-fusion cloning kit (TAKARA BIO INC., Shiga, Japan).

Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed as previously described42. Embryos were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in FSW for overnight at 4 °C. Fixed embryos were washed with MOPS buffer (0.1 M MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) for 7 min x 7 times, then pre-hybridized with hybridization buffer (70% formamide, 0.1 M MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 1% BSA) at 50 °C for 1 h. Samples were hybridized with 0.4 ng/µl Digoxygenin (Dig)-labeled RNA probes in hybridization buffer at 50 °C for 5–7 days. Subsequently, samples were washed with MOPS buffer 7 min x 7 times and blocked with 2.5% skim milk (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) in MOPS buffer at room temperature (R.T) for 1 h. Specimens were incubated for overnight at 4 °C with 1/1500 anti-Dig antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (AP) (Roche Holding AG, Basel, Switzerland) in MaxBlot Solution 2 (MBL, Tokyo, Japan). Samples were washed with MOPS buffer, and MOPS buffer were substituted with AP buffer (0.1 M Tris, pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 1 mM Levamisole) by 2 times for 7 min each. Dig was detected by the reaction of AP with Staining solution (10% dimethylformamide, 3.15 µl/ml NBT and 2.45 µl/ml BCIP [Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA] diluted in AP buffer) in the dark until the signal was visualized under the microscope. Whole-mount in situ hybridization chain reaction was performed as described in previous study43 with small modification.

Immunohistochemistry was also performed as previously described42. For immunohistochemistry, embryos were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in FSW for 10 min at R.T. For detecting phosphorylated-Smad2/3 (pSmad2/3), embryos were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in FSW for 10 min. Fixed embryos were washed with PBS-T 7 min x5 times and blocked with 5% lamb serum (ThermoFisher Scientific) in PBS-T for 1 h. Specimens were incubated for overnight at 4 °C with each antibody in MaxBlot Solution 1 (MBL). Anti-FoxQ2 (in-house made44), anti-pSmad2/3 (Abcam) and anti-pSmad1/5/8 (Cell Signaling Technology) antibody was diluted to 1/100, 1/100 and 1/1000 in MaxBlot solution 1, respectively. Samples were washed with PBS-T buffer and reacted with 1/2000 diluted secondary antibody (ThermoFisher Scientific) in MaxBlot Solution 2 for 2 h at R.T in dark.

Micro-injection into fertilized eggs and blastomeres was performed as previously described45. Each morpholino anti-sense oligo nucleotides (MO) and mRNA for micro-injection were dissolved in the injection buffer (24% glycerol, 20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, and 120 mM KCl). The concentration in needle and the sequence of morpholino and mRNA were as follows:

BMP2/4-MO (400 µM): 5'- GACCCCAATGTGAGGTGGTAACCAT -3' (Specificity was previously confirmed44);

FoxQ2-MO (200 µM): 5'- TCATGATGAAATGTTGGAACGAGAG -3' (Specificity was previously confirmed42);

Nodal-MO (200 µM): 5'- AGATCCGATGAACGATGCATGGTTA -3' (Specificity was previously confirmed46);

Tetraspanin-MO1 (3.8 mM): 5'- GATCCATACCCATCTTGAATTATAT -3'

Tetraspanin-MO2 (200 µM): 5'- CTTGACTACACGCTTCGTAAACAAA -3'

ZO-1-MO1 (3.8 mM): 5'- CATATCCGACATCCATCATGG -3'

ZO-1-MO2 (1.0 mM): 5'- TCTCTGTCCACCTCTTTATAA -3'

Zebrafish UROD-MO (200 µM): 5'- GAATGAAACTGTCCTTATCCATCA -3',

∆cadherine mRNA (400 ng/µl), Lifeact mcherry mRNA (500 ng/µl), ß-catenin-Venus mRNA (500 ng/µl) and membrane TagRFP (100 ng/µl).

Embryos were fertilized in the FSW containing 1 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (ATA) to prevent the fertilization envelope from hardened47. Fertilized eggs were cultured at 15 °C until 2-cell stage and removed fertilization envelope by pipetting. Ease for manipulation, the embryos were treated with Ca2+-free seawater (CFSW; 435 mM NaCl, 9.3 mM KCl, 24.5 mM MgCl2, 25.5 mM MgSO4, 2.15 mM NaHCO3, Woods Hole, MBL). Fire-burned and pulled thin-wall glass capillary (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA, USA) was used for cutting embryos. The protocol for making a manipulation needle was previously described45. All plastic dishes and glass capillaries for cutting embryos were coated with 3% BSA or lamb serum. The cut embryos were maintained in the small holes on the 1% agarose gel in FSW, which were made by the heated tweezers.

Total RNA was collected from 100 control embryos and 200 halved embryos with RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) at each developmental stage. For total RNA sequencing, we utilized the Macrogen Total RNA sequencing service.

Data retrieval and pre-processing: The reference genome file (HpulGenome_v1_scaffold.fa) and the annotation files (HpulGenome_v1.gff3 and HpulGenome_v1_annot.xlsx) of H. pulcherrimus were retrieved from HpBase. We performed Trimmomatic (v0.39) against 54 of FASTQ files and trimmed Illumina adapter sequences with our original list (https://bioinformatics.riken.jp/ramdaq/ramdaq_annotation/mouse/all_sequencing_WTA_adopters.fa).

Mapping to the reference genome and quantification of gene expression: The index file of the STAR aligner (v2.7.10a) was generated with the --runmode genomeGenerate and then the trimmed FASTQ files were mapped to the reference genome using STAR with the default parameters. FeatureCounts (v2.0.1) was used to quantify the gene expression levels of each sample. The gene expression matrix was generated by counting the number of reads mapped to each gene.

Data quality control (QC): FastQC (v0.11.9) was used to check the quality of raw and trimmed reads. MultiQC (v1.12) was used to summarize the results of FastQC. Using R (v4.4.2), we generated a heatmap of the correlation between samples using the R package ggplot2 (v3.5.1). prcomp is used to perform PCA and the mapping rate and the number of detected genes were evaluated on the score plot.:Differentially expressed gene (DEG) detection:

edgeR (v4.4.1) and DESeq2 (v1.46.0) were used to detect DEGs. The DEGs were visualized using the R package ggplot2 (v3.5.1).

Reproducibility: All the data analyses were performed on a workflow using Snakemake (v6.5.3) (https://github.com/kokitsuyuzaki/urchin-workflow). All the tools are pre-installed in the following three Docker containers, and executed via Singularity (v3.5.3), so that data analyses are reproducible in any computational environment.

CellTrackTM CM-DiI (DiI) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was dissolved into 100% EtOH to final 1 µg/µl concentration. Diluted DiI was loaded into the glass capillary, which is used for micro-injection. DiI that flows into the seawater becomes a small crystal at the tip of the capillary, since DiI is not dissolved in water/seawater. DiI crystal was pressed to the target portion of halved embryos on poly-L-lysin (Sigma-Aldrich) coated plastic dish for 2 min. After the stained signal is confirmed by a fluorescent microscope (IX70 [Olympus, Tokyo, Japan]), the labeled embryos were kept at 15 °C until the appropriate stages.

No statistical methods were used to predetermine the sample size. All n numbers are described in figure. To compare the two groups in Fig. 2a (median of control = 98.5, median of half x2 = 97, W statistic = 532.5, p-value = 0.8877), Fig. 2b (median of control = 397, median of half x2 = 378, W statistic = 820.5, p-value = 0.08695), we used Wilcoxon rank-sum test with a significance level of 0.05. To compare the four groups in Fig. 2k, we used one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test with a significant level of 0.01 or 0.05, and following F value (F) and degrees of freedom [d.f.]. For Fig. 2k: F = 72.406, d.f. = 3.

The unique properties of stereogenic sulfur centres make sulfoxides highly valuable in medicinal chemistry, organic synthesis and other fields. Axially chiral sulfoxides are a class of complex organosulfur compounds with promising applications, but their synthesis remains challenging. Here we report a streamlined synthetic strategy for axially chiral sulfoxides. By leveraging the combination of rationally designed reagents and tailored catalytic systems, the method simultaneously establishes chiral sulfoxide and axial chirality in a single reaction step. This method was applied to a wide variety of substrates and resulted in products with broad functionality. The sulfinylation reaction was studied through a series of mechanistic experiments. This study provides a route to chiral sulfoxides with underexplored functionalities for potential future applications.

Huntington's disease (HD) is a rare, neurodegenerative disorder for which only symptomatic treatments are available. The PROOF-HD study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of pridopidine, a selective Sigma-1 receptor agonist, in HD. The primary and key secondary endpoints, change in total functional capacity (TFC) and composite Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (cUHDRS) score at week 65, were not met in the overall population. The TFC least-squares mean difference between pridopidine and placebo was −0.18 (95% confidence interval −0.49 to 0.14; P = 0.26). The cUHDRS least-squares mean difference between pridopidine and placebo was −0.11 (95% confidence interval −0.40 to 0.18; P = 0.45). Sensitivity analysis in a subgroup of participants not treated with antidopaminergic medications at any time demonstrated a consistent pattern favoring pridopidine across multiple measures, including TFC and cUHDRS. Notably, pridopidine 45 mg twice daily demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Taken together, pridopidine has the potential to address a critical unmet need in HD. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04556656.

Huntington's disease (HD) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by a genetic mutation in the huntingtin gene. HD progresses over 10–20 years, causing motor abnormalities, cognitive decline, psychiatric symptoms and progressive loss of independence that ultimately result in death1,2,3. Symptomatic treatments exist, but therapies to modify disease progression are urgently needed2,4,5. Standard treatments for HD include antidopaminergic medications (ADMs) such as vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitors (VMAT2 inhibitors) for chorea and off-label antipsychotics (neuroleptics), which may help reduce involuntary movements and behavioral symptoms4,5,6,7. However, mounting evidence suggests ADM-related side effects may interfere with accurate measures of disease progression, especially in outcomes like cognition and function widely used in HD clinical trials5,8,9,10.

Pridopidine is a potent and selective Sigma-1 receptor (S1R) agonist and potential new HD therapy. By targeting S1R, pridopidine modulates multiple pathways in HD and other neurodegenerative diseases11. Preclinical evidence demonstrates that pridopidine exerts neuroprotective effects through a multimodal action—reducing endoplasmic reticulum stress, promoting calcium homeostasis and stimulating neurotrophic-dependent restoration of synaptic plasticity12,13,14,15,16,17,18. A positron emission tomography study in humans confirms pridopidine's engagement with S1R in key HD-affected brain regions, including the striatum19. Clinical trials show oral pridopidine is well-tolerated with a benign safety profile20,21,22 and may have the potential to preserve functional capacity, cognition and motor function in HD20,21,22,23,24,25,26.

In early clinical studies, including the HART and MermaiHD trials21,22,26,27, motor-related endpoints were primary outcomes but were not met. However, exploratory analyses indicated pridopidine 45 mg twice daily (bid) showed motor benefits with significant improvements in total motor score (TMS). In PRIDE-HD23,24, pridopidine 45 mg bid was associated with a slower rate of decline in total functional capacity (TFC), a key measure of functional abilities in HD, over 52 weeks compared with placebo, with potential benefits lasting up to five years in the Open-HART extension study20,21. In the phase 2 HEALEY ALS Platform Trial, pridopidine 45 mg bid showed numerical trends suggesting slowed decline in ALSFRS-R, respiratory, bulbar and speech functions in a post hoc analysis of a subgroup of participants meeting El-Escorial Criteria for definite or probable amyotrophic lateral sclerosis within 18 months of symptom onset28.

These findings supported further evaluation of pridopidine in PROOF-HD (Pridopidine-Outcome-on-Function), a global phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in early adult-onset HD. This study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04556656; EudraCT number 2020-002822-10; date of registration 16 October 2020) assessed the efficacy and safety of pridopidine 45 mg bid on clinical measures of HD progression. The primary endpoint was the change in TFC from baseline to week 65 (ref. 3). A key secondary endpoint was the change in composite Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (cUHDRS), a sensitive global measure of function, cognition and motor assessments29.

To reflect clinical practice and given the duration of the study (18 months), the trial permitted the concomitant use of ADMs, which are standard treatments for psychiatric symptoms and chorea in HD. However, given their known side effects, such as parkinsonism, sedation and cognitive impairment, which may confound trial outcomes5,8,9,30, a sensitivity analysis was conducted in a subgroup of participants who remained off ADMs (no VMAT2 inhibitors or antipsychotics at any time during the study)31. This allowed examination of pridopidine's potential treatment effect in the absence of possible ADM-related confounding30,31.

In the overall population, pridopidine did not significantly outperform placebo in the primary or key secondary endpoints. However, in a sensitivity analysis of the off-ADMs subgroup, pridopidine was associated with favorable trends across measures of function, cognition, motor performance and cUHDRS scores. These findings underscore the importance of minimizing potential ADM-related confounding in HD trials and support further investigation of pridopidine in defined patient subgroups.

Between October 2020 and March 2023, 594 participants were screened across 59 international sites. Of these, 499 were randomized 1:1 to receive either pridopidine 45 mg bid or placebo (intent-to-treat (ITT): placebo, n = 249; pridopidine, n = 250) (Fig. 1). The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population excluded ten participants because of missing post-baseline efficacy data (mITT: placebo, n = 247; pridopidine, n = 242). Completion rates at week 65 were 90.0% (pridopidine) and 93.6% (placebo), and at week 78 were 72.4% and 68.3%, respectively, under the common closing study design (Methods). The per protocol (PP) population included 217 participants in the placebo group and 197 in the pridopidine group at week 65, and 160 in the placebo group and 158 in the pridopidine group at week 78. Twenty-eight participants in the pridopidine group and 22 in the placebo group discontinued for various reasons (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Table 1).

The flowchart illustrates participant disposition across study populations. ‘Off ADMs' refers to participants who were not treated with ADMs at any point during the study. The ITT population includes all randomized participants. The mITT population consists of ITT participants who received at least one dose of the study drug and had valid TFC scores at baseline and at least one post-baseline visit. The SP population includes randomized participants who received at least one dose of the study drug. The PP population represents the combined analysis set of the W65PP and W78PP subsets. The W65PP and W78PP subsets include mITT participants with valid TFC scores at weeks 65 and 78, at least 80% compliance with the study drug and no major protocol deviations. W65PP, per protocol week 65 population; W78PP, per protocol week 78 population. aPatients who did not receive ADM treatment at any point during the study; bthe analysis set consisting of patients from both W65PP and W78PP.

Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were comparable across populations. In the ITT population, the mean (s.d.) age was 52.5 (11.7) years, CAG repeat length was 43.9 (3.54) and 51.9% of participants were female. The disease stage distribution showed 41.3% of participants were at stage HD1 (TFC 11–13) and 58.7% were at stage HD2 (TFC 7–10). The mITT group showed similar distributions (Table 1). Randomization was stratified by baseline HD stage and antipsychotic use. VMAT2 inhibitor use, which was not a stratification factor, was by chance slightly higher in the pridopidine group (22.3%) versus placebo (15.4%).

ADM use was permitted post-baseline, if deemed necessary by the treating physician. At baseline, 44.5% (110 of 247) of participants in the placebo population and 50.0% (121 of 242) of participants in the pridopidine mITT population used ADMs. Antipsychotics (a stratification factor) were used by 33.2% (placebo) and 31.8% (pridopidine) of participants; VMAT2 inhibitors were used by 15.4% (placebo) and 22.7% (pridopidine) of participants. During the study, 45.3% (placebo) and 39.7% (pridopidine) of participants remained off ADMs. Baseline HD stage among mITT and PP off-ADM participants was balanced: ~50% in HD1 and HD2 (Table 1).

The primary outcome was the change in TFC from baseline to week 65. In the ITT population (placebo, n = 249; pridopidine, n = 250), pridopidine did not outperform placebo (Fig. 2a). The least-squares mean (LSMean) change was −0.95 (95% confidence interval (CI) −1.18 to −0.72) for placebo and −1.12 (95% CI −1.36 to −0.89) for pridopidine; difference −0.18 (95% CI −0.49 to 0.14; P = 0.27) (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Table 2).

a,b, TFC (primary endpoint) (a) and cUHDRS (key secondary endpoint) (b) are presented as LSMean changes from baseline to week 65 for the ITT and mITT populations. LSMean differences between the placebo and pridopidine treatment arms are shown at each time point. Sample sizes at week 65 were: placebo, n = 249 and pridopidine, n = 250 (ITT); and placebo, n = 247 and pridopidine, n = 242 (mITT). All replicates represent biologically independent participants. Statistical analyses were performed using a maximum likelihood-based mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM). Data are presented as LSMean ± 95% CI.

The multiplicity-adjusted key secondary endpoint in the overall population was the change in cUHDRS from baseline at week 65. No significant difference in cUHDRS was observed at week 65 (mITT: LSMean difference −0.11 (95% CI −0.40 to 0.18); P = 0.454). The change in cUHDRS was −0.88 (95% CI −1.09 to −0.66) for placebo and −0.99 (95% CI −1.20 to −0.77) for pridopidine (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Table 3).

Pridopidine 45 mg bid was well-tolerated, with a safety profile broadly comparable with placebo22,23,26, and consistent with previous clinical trial experience (Table 2 and Extended Data Table 4). Compliance in the safety population (SP) was 94.5%, with an average treatment duration of 70.7 weeks. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 85.9% of participants in the placebo population and 82.8% of participants the pridopidine population, with >70% of TEAEs classified as mild or moderate. Common TEAEs included COVID-19, falls, diarrhea and headache. Depression was more frequent in the pridopidine group (10.4% versus 5.2%) but was below historical HD norms32,33,34. Suicidality rates were comparable between groups (0.4% in each).

Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 11% of participants (8.4% placebo, 13.6% pridopidine), with none assessed as related to study treatment. No safety signal indicating increased mortality risk with pridopidine treatment was identified. Of the four deaths reported during the trial, none was considered related to the study drug (one in the placebo arm and three in the pridopidine arm) (Extended Data Table 1). The single death in the placebo group followed a motor vehicle accident. In the pridopidine group, the deaths were attributed to clinical complications consistent with the natural progression of HD35. The only treatment-related SAE (acute myocardial infarction) was in the placebo group. Psychiatric SAEs were infrequent and generally balanced across groups, including suicidal ideation (two in each group) and isolated cases of anxiety, delusion and depression. Suicide attempts occurred in three participants in the pridopidine group, all of whom had pre-existing psychiatric comorbidities. These events are consistent with the elevated background risk of suicidality in HD36.

Treatment-related TEAEs led to discontinuation in 0.8% of participants in the placebo group and 0.4% in the pridopidine group (Extended Data Table 1). Severe treatment-related TEAEs were rare (0.4% placebo, 1.2% pridopidine), with no treatment-related serious events in the pridopidine group and no evidence of a broader safety signal, as reported previously35. Pridopidine caused no clinically meaningful changes in renal function or Q-T interval duration. Q-T interval corrected using Fridericia's formula (Q-TcF) changes >30 ms but ≤60 ms occurred in 9.2% of participants in the pridopidine group and 3.6% of in the placebo group, with no post-baseline Q-TcF values >480 ms or change >60 ms, indicating no cardiac safety concerns.

A subgroup analysis evaluated pridopidine's effects in participants not treated with ADMs, which may confound measures of clinical outcome30,31. Because the primary endpoint was not met, all analyses for the off-ADM subgroup report P values as nominal and unadjusted for multiplicity. Figure 3 and Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2 present outcomes from the off-ADM subgroup analyses in the mITT and PP populations, respectively, with summaries below.

a, In the off-ADM mITT population, pridopidine treatment was associated with a slower rate of decline in cUHDRS scores compared with placebo. Maximal differences were observed between weeks 26 and 52, with nominal statistical significance at weeks 26 (P = 0.004), 39 (P = 0.014) and 52 (P = 0.035). b–f, Forest plots display treatment effects for cUHDRS and its four components—TFC, SWR, SDMT and TMS—in both the off-ADM mITT and PP populations. For the mITT group, sample sizes were as follows: week 26, n = 112 (placebo) and n = 95 (pridopidine) (b); week 39, n = 107 (placebo) and n = 90 (pridopidine) (c); week 52, n = 104 (placebo) and n = 91 (pridopidine) (d); week 65, n = 106 (placebo) and n = 91 (pridopidine) (e); and week 78, n = 71 (placebo) and n = 70 (pridopidine) (f). For the PP population, group sizes were: week 26, n = 99 (placebo) and n = 78 (pridopidine) (b); week 39, n = 99 (placebo) and n = 76 (pridopidine) (c); week 52, n = 97 (placebo) and n = 78 (pridopidine) (d); week 65, n = 97 (placebo) and n = 78 (pridopidine) (e); and week 78, n = 60 (placebo) and n = 60 (pridopidine) (f). g, Cognitive performance based on SWR showed numerical improvements with pridopidine at week 26 (P = 0.018; n = 112 (placebo) and n = 95 (pridopidine)), week 39 (P = 0.058; n = 107 (placebo) and n = 91 (pridopidine)) and week 52 (P = 0.042; n = 104 (placebo) and n = 92 (pridopidine)). h, Motor skills assessed by FT IOI Mean showed significant improvements at week 26 (P = 0.025; n = 112 (placebo) and n = 95 (pridopidine)), week 65 (P = 0.016; n = 104 (placebo) and n = 91 (pridopidine)) and week 78 (P = 0.028; n = 71 (placebo) and n = 69 (pridopidine)). All replicates represent independent participants. Statistical analyses were performed using a MMRM with two-sided nominal P values. The unit of analysis was the individual participant. Data are presented as LSMean, with error bars indicating 95% CI. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.

In the mITT population off ADMs, pridopidine demonstrated a trend favoring slower TFC decline compared with placebo to week 78, with the strongest effect at week 52 (maximal difference: 0.25 versus placebo) (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Confidence intervals overlapped at all time points. Whereas pridopidine showed a trend for slower decline, participants in the placebo group showed the expected pattern of progressive TFC decline. In the PP population, pridopidine showed a showed a numerically favorable trend (a 0.37-point difference versus placebo at week 78), but this was not significant (Extended Data Fig. 2a).

In the mITT population off ADMs, pridopidine showed nominally significant benefits in maintaining cUHDRS scores compared with placebo, with the largest differences (Δ) at week 26 (Δ = 0.46, P = 0.004; placebo n = 112, pridopidine n = 95), week 39 (Δ = 0.45, P = 0.014; placebo n = 107, pridopidine n = 90) and week 52 (Δ = 0.41, P = 0.035; placebo n = 104, pridopidine n = 91) (Fig. 3a). Improvements from baseline were most pronounced to week 39. Differences at week 65 (Δ = 0.27, P = 0.168; placebo n = 106, pridopidine n = 91) and week 78 (Δ = 0.14, P = 0.532; placebo n = 71, pridopidine n = 70) were not significant. In the PP population off-ADMs, similar treatment effects were also observed at week 26 (Δ = 0.46, P = 0.006; placebo n = 99, pridopidine n = 78), week 39 (Δ = 0.60, P = 0.003; placebo n = 99, pridopidine n = 76) and week 52 (Δ = 0.43, P = 0.035; placebo n = 97, pridopidine n = 78), with nonsignificant trends at weeks 65 and 78 (Extended Data Fig. 2b).

A key assumption in using the multicomponent cUHDRS is that therapies targeting disease progression should lead to improvements across multiple components of the cUHDRS29,37. To evaluate this, a forest plot analysis assessed the contributions of TFC, Stroop Word Reading test (SWR), Symbol Digital Modality Test (SDMT) and TMS among participants off-ADMs (Fig. 3b–f). The analysis showed that differences favoring pridopidine were evident across all four cUHDRS components, rather than being driven by any single one. TFC and SWR showed trends favoring pridopidine at all time points. Although TFC did not reach significance, point estimates favored pridopidine up to week 78 in both the mITT and PP populations. For SWR, differences were observed at week 26 (mITT P = 0.018; PP P = 0.034), week 39 (mITT P = 0.0576; PP P = 0.023) and week 52 (mITT P = 0.042; PP P = 0.019), indicating potential cognitive benefit with pridopidine (Fig. 3b–d). SDMT and TMS did not show differences, but TMS trended in favor of pridopidine at weeks 26, 39 and 52. These findings suggest that the observed cUHDRS treatment effect differences in the off-ADM subgroup were supported by contributions from multiple outcomes, across function, cognition and motor measures.

In the mITT population off ADMs, pridopidine was associated with a consistent pattern of slowing cognitive decline compared with placebo to week 52. For SWR, between-group differences favored pridopidine across multiple time points (Fig. 3b–g), with LSMean differences of 3.16 at week 26 (P = 0.018; placebo n = 112, pridopidine n = 95), 2.89 at week 39 (P = 0.058; placebo n = 107, pridopidine n = 91) and 3.05 at week 52 (P = 0.042; placebo n = 104, pridopidine n = 92) (Fig. 3g). For SDMT, trends also favored pridopidine to week 39, with score trajectories remaining stable to week 78 (Fig. 3b–g). In the PP population off ADMs, a similar trend was observed, with significant SWR differences at week 26 (P = 0.034; placebo n = 99, pridopidine n = 78), 4.14 at week 39 (P = 0.023; placebo n = 99, pridopidine n = 77) and 4.22 at week 52 (P = 0.019; placebo n = 97, pridopidine n = 79) (Extended Data Fig. 2c).

Motor outcomes in participants in the off-ADM subgroup showed a pattern of numerical improvements with pridopidine treatment, based on Q-Motor measures including the finger tapping inter-onset-interval (FT IOI) (Fig. 3h). In these measures, pridopidine treatment resulted in improved FT IOI motor performance. At week 26, the LSMean difference in FT IOI was −21.15 ms (P = 0.025; placebo n = 112, pridopidine n = 95), with additional numerical differences favoring pridopidine at week 52 (−14.31 ms, P = 0.15; placebo n = 104, pridopidine n = 91), week 65 (−24.71 ms, P = 0.016; placebo n = 104, pridopidine n = 91) and week 78 (−22.90 ms, P = 0.028; placebo n = 71, pridopidine n = 69).

For Q-Motor task pronation–supination tapping inter-tap-interval (Pro-Sup ITI), pridopidine improved function at weeks 26 and 65 compared with placebo (Extended Data Fig. 1b). At week 26, the LSMean difference was −38.06 ms (P = 0.007; placebo n = 112, pridopidine n = 95) and at week 65, the LSMean difference was −23.92 ms (P = 0.04; placebo n = 104, pridopidine n = 91). Although improvements at week 52 (−20.21 ms, P = 0.109) and week 78 (−22.23 ms, P = 0.104) did not reach statistical significance, the overall trend favored pridopidine.

In the PP population, these effects in FT IOI and Pro-Sup ITI were more pronounced, with larger LSMean differences observed throughout the study. Results consistently favored pridopidine over placebo at time points between weeks 26 and 78, supporting a potential treatment effect on motor performance (Extended Data Fig. 2d,f).

Additional variability data from finger tapping (FT IOI s.d.) (Extended Data Fig. 1c) also showed a beneficial effect of pridopidine at week 26, with a nominally significant improvement over placebo. At later time points, weeks 52, 65 and 78, the treatment effect persisted as a numerical trend in favor of pridopidine. In the PP population, results were more robust, with larger treatment effects observed consistently across all time points (Extended Data Fig. 2e).

Results for Pro-Sup IOI show similar trends favoring pridopidine, particularly at weeks 26 and 65 (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Effects were more pronounced in the PP population (Extended Data Fig. 2g). Together, although these motor findings suggest pridopidine's potential to improve motor function and mitigate motor decline in HD, these outcomes were secondary, and should therefore be interpreted cautiously.

To further characterize the treatment effect in the off-ADM subgroup, two post hoc analyses of cUHDRS scores were conducted to explore clinically meaningful response patterns. These analyses provided a complementary view to mean change estimates, highlighting potential differences in individual participant trajectories in a population that typically experiences progressive decline in HD2,29,38 (Methods).

The first approach used cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) in the mITT population and showed consistently greater response rates for pridopidine than placebo across all time points (Fig. 4a). The CDF provides a comprehensive view of the distribution of treatment responses without relying on a predefined cutoff, thereby reducing potential bias and allowing for objective comparison of clinical benefit across groups. At week 26, the treatment difference was notable (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.60, P = 0.013; Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test P = 0.0093), with similar trends at weeks 39 (AUC = 0.61), 65 (AUC = 0.55) and 78 (AUC = 0.59). In the PP population, effects were more pronounced at week 78 (P = 0.035) (Extended Data Fig. 3).

a, Post hoc responder analyses in the mITT population show that pridopidine led to higher CDF response rates than placebo at all time points, with significant differences at weeks 26 (AUC = 0.60, P = 0.013; KS test P = 0.0093) and 39 (AUC = 0.61, P = 0.0054; KS test P = 0.024). b, A threshold-based analysis revealed that a ≥5% improvement in cUHDRS was achieved in approximately twice as many participants receiving pridopidine compared with placebo at weeks 26 (P = 0.004) and 39 (P = 0.003). All statistical tests were two-sided and unadjusted for multiple comparisons. Error bars represent 95% CI. **P < 0.01.

In the second approach, a post hoc threshold-based analysis using a ≥5% improvement cutoff in cUHDRS score consistently showed higher response rates for pridopidine compared with placebo across all time points (Fig. 4b and Methods). At weeks 26 and 39, response rates nearly doubled for pridopidine (week 26: 40% versus 21%, P = 0.004; week 39: 40% versus 20%, P = 0.003). This corresponds to a relative increase in responders of 95% at week 26 and 104% at week 39. This pattern persisted to week 78, suggesting potential durability. The PP population showed similar findings, with significant differences observed at weeks 26, 39 and 78. Together, these responder analyses provide additional insight into a potential treatment effect of pridopidine in participants off ADMs, particularly with favorable trends sustained to week 78.

The PROOF-HD study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of pridopidine over 65 weeks, with a variable 13-week extension for a total of 78 weeks. The trial evaluated pridopidine's impact on functional, motor and cognitive decline in participants with HD. Completion rates were high, with 91.8% of participants completing the 65-week main study. These findings underscore the feasibility and robustness of long-term pridopidine treatment. In the overall population, the study did not meet its primary endpoint of change in TFC from baseline to week 65, or the key secondary endpoint of change in cUHDRS.

Several factors may inform interpretation and underscore the limitations of this trial. The trial was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, which impacted global healthcare access. As observed in other neuropsychiatric trials, a higher-than-expected use of ADMs was observed39,40,41. This may have introduced confounding, because many ADMs are associated with side effects such as sedation, parkinsonism and cognitive impairment that are well-documented in regulatory labels42,43,44,45 and can mimic or mask HD symptoms8,30,31. In addition to these symptomatic effects, the complex relationship between prolonged D2 antagonism from ADMs and the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) varies among participants46,47,48; further complicating the interpretation of treatment effects in trials like PROOF-HD, where symptomatic overlap may obscure true drug-related benefits.

Given that many ADMs are metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 (refs. 42,43,44,45,49,50) and that pridopidine inhibits cytochrome P450 2D6, it is also possible that pharmacokinetic interactions in the active treatment arm could have further interfered with measures of clinical outcome in the overall population51. These limitations suggest that ADM-related confounding may reduce the sensitivity of functional and cognitive measures in HD trials, and support the need for future studies to stratify randomization by ADM use or to prespecify subgroup analyses based on ADM exposure status. Although this study was not designed to test dosage strategies for ADMs, findings also raise the possibility that ADM dose minimization (as recommended in regulatory labeling) or careful ADM and dosage selection in combination with pridopidine may offer a viable strategy for symptom management20,24,31.

To assess the potential effect of pridopidine treatment in the absence of ADM interference, we performed a sensitivity analysis of an off-ADM subgroup, which excluded participants who received VMAT2 inhibitors or antipsychotics at any time during the trial. Although no significant difference with treatment was observed in the off-ADM cohort for TFC, this cohort was smaller than anticipated, and consequently may have limited statistical power. By contrast, nominally favorable trends were observed across multiple other outcomes, including in cUHDRS, TFC, SWR and Q-Motor23,24,52, particularly baseline to week 52, suggesting the potential for slowed progression relative to placebo over 1 year. These findings were based on nominal P values without correction for multiplicity and should be interpreted with caution. Here, participants off ADMs treated with pridopidine may have experienced numerically smaller declines in cUHDRS scores over 78 weeks. Note that modest annual reductions in cUHDRS (0.1–0.3 points) have been associated with a clinical meaningful benefit in HD29, underscoring the potential importance of these trends. In complementary post hoc responder analyses of cUHDRS, data further suggested higher response rates for pridopidine compared with placebo over time53. Improvements in SWR, reflecting cognitive flexibility and processing speed were also observed at early time points, consistent with possible cognitive benefit in a disease with relentless decline.

Objective Q-Motor results also provided rater-independent insight of motor function, aligning with clinical outcomes23,54. Compared with placebo, nominally significant improvements were seen in FT IOI (weeks 26 and 78) and Pro-Sup ITI (weeks 26 and 65). FT IOI, in particular, has been shown to detect motor impairments up to 20 years before clinical onset in HD gene carriers and to track longitudinal progression across disease stages23,55. It demonstrates a strong structure–function relationship, correlating with HD-related caudate and putamen atrophy as well as clinical progression in outcomes such as TMS and TFC2,23,55. These motor outcomes paralleled trends in cUHDRS and support the internal consistency of treatment effects across clinical measures, although these are secondary endpoints and require cautious interpretation.

Overall, participants treated with pridopidine in the off-ADM subgroup showed less decline than participants treated with placebo across multiple outcomes, but the subgroup size was limited, and the findings were not powered to support definitive conclusions. Nonetheless, the consistency of trends across function, motor and cognition suggests a treatment effect. To date, no approved therapy has demonstrated a definitive, consistent effect on global progression endpoints like TFC or cUHDRS in HD. Although preliminary, observed trends with pridopidine treatment highlight pridopidine's potential to address HD progression beyond symptom-specific treatments like VMAT2 inhibitors for chorea.

Consistent with earlier trials like PRIDE-HD21,22,23, pridopidine was well-tolerated, and with a safety profile comparable to placebo. High study completion (91.8% for 65 weeks) and long treatment duration support its feasibility for long-term use; an essential component for continued research and development efforts20,23,25. Open-label data from Open-HART also support the long-term safety of pridopidine20, with no treatment-related deaths or cardiac risk signals identified in PROOF-HD. Rates of psychiatric events and suicidality were in line with background HD risk, and no new safety concerns emerged6,25,35.

Pridopidine's therapeutic effects are closely tied to its potent and highly selective S1R agonist activity56. S1R is a chaperone protein involved in cellular stress adaptation, neuroprotection and synaptic function57. Activation of S1R by pridopidine has been shown to reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress, support calcium homeostasis and promote neurotrophic signaling14,16,58,59. These effects are particularly relevant to HD pathophysiology, which involves progressive striatal degeneration and impaired cellular resilience.

In conclusion, pridopidine did not demonstrate significant benefit in the overall PROOF-HD population. However, the consistent safety profile, pharmacologic rationale and the coherence of treatment effects across multiple outcomes in the off-ADM sensitivity analysis—findings not previously observed in any HD trial—identify a biologically plausible and clinically relevant patient population in which treatment benefit was observed. This merits further evaluation in confirmatory trials. Future studies should refine patient selection and account for the potential impact of ADM exposure through stratification and dosage strategies, which may preserve pridopidine's effects while also managing symptoms.

This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, multicenter clinical trial (PROOF-HD; ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT04556656, EudraCT number 2020-002822-10) aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pridopidine at a dose of 45 mg bid in participants with a TFC score range of 7–13 at screening. Recruitment took place across 59 international sites in Austria, Canada, Czechia, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, the UK and the USA. The trial was conducted primarily during the global COVID-19 pandemic, with the first participant enrolled on 23 October 2020, and the last patient completing the double-blinded portion of the study on 14 March 2023.

The study enrolled 499 participants, and participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either pridopidine or placebo (ITT population n = 249 placebo and n = 250 pridopidine). Randomization was stratified based on baseline HD stage (HD1 TFC 11–13 versus HD2 TFC 7–10) and antipsychotic use at baseline (yes or no). The randomization sequence was generated by the Sponsor's designated statistical team, and allocation was concealed from site investigators, participants and study staff throughout the trial. The study consisted of a screening period, randomization and a double-blind treatment period. The study was conducted over a period of 65–78 weeks, with the primary analysis taking place at 65 weeks to assess primary efficacy, key secondary and other outcomes, as well as safety. An additional variable 13-week double-blind treatment period was included to evaluate the durability of the treatment effect up to 78 weeks.

Following the baseline visit, participants underwent a 2-week titration period of 45 mg once daily, followed by 63 weeks of full-dose maintenance treatment (45 mg bid or matching placebo). Participants in the active arm received pridopidine at the clinically recommended dose of 45 mg bid orally administered as hard gelatin capsules, whereas those in the placebo arm received indistinguishable matching placebo capsules. Participants who completed the 65-week maintenance period entered a variable double-blind extension period of up to 13 weeks, concluding when the last randomized participant completed 65 weeks of treatment. In this common closing design, all participants remaining between weeks 65 and 78 completed ‘end of study' visits once the final participant reached week 65. This approach allowed for the collection of extended double-blind, controlled data to evaluate efficacy up to 78 weeks, while ensuring consistent double-blinding for all participants and investigators throughout the study.

Most participants were followed for 78 weeks, including the mITT population of 490 participants (98.2%), which comprised those who received at least one dose of the study drug and had valid baseline and post-baseline assessments. Of all participants, 458 (91.8%) completed at least 65 weeks in the main study period. There were two PP populations: one for week 65 and one for week 78. The week 65 per protocol (W65PP) population comprised 414 patients (83.0% of the ITT) and included participants from the mITT group who had valid TFC data at week 65, maintained >80% compliance with the study drug and had no substantial protocol deviations impacting TFC assessment. The week 78 per protocol (W78PP) population comprised 318 participants (63.7% of the ITT) and was defined similar to W65PP but included participants with valid TFC data at week 78.

The dose selection of 45 mg bid for pridopidine in the PROOF-HD study was based on evidence from previous research, notably the phase 2 PRIDE-HD study19,23,24. This study demonstrated the potential efficacy of pridopidine at this dose, particularly in early-stage HD patients. The 45 mg bid dose aimed to optimize efficacy while maintaining an acceptable safety profile, as observed in the PRIDE-HD study. The PRIDE-HD study also highlighted pridopidine's potential to maintain functional capacity in participants with TFC scores ranging from 7 to 13 over a 52-week period, with the most significant benefits observed in those classified as HD1 or HD2. Considering that individuals with HD1 and HD2 (TFC 7–13) typically experience an annual decline in TFC of roughly 0.8 to 1.0 points, the PROOF-HD phase 3 study was designed with a 65-week observation period24,29. This extended timeframe was chosen to allow sufficient opportunity to detect a potential maintenance effect of pridopidine compared to the natural decline anticipated in the placebo arm.

Sex and gender were self-reported by participants at screening and documented in the electronic case report forms. The study was not stratified by sex or gender, and no subgroup analyses were conducted for this study based on these characteristics. Participants received financial compensation as outlined in site contracts for each in-person clinic visit, as well as for telephone, virtual or home-based visits. Additional reimbursement for transportation or lodging costs was considered on a case-by-case basis with prior approval by the study contract research organization (CRO).

Inclusion and exclusion criteria were established to enroll participants with early to moderate HD, defined by motor, functional and genetic parameters. These criteria prioritized participant safety and facilitated the creation of a homogeneous study population, enabling accurate assessment of pridopidine's effects.

Managing participant discontinuation and withdrawal was crucial to ensure safety, compliance and data integrity. The stopping rule specified that participants had to discontinue the study drug if their Q-TcF exceeded 500 ms or was over 480 ms with an increase of more than 60 ms from baseline (as determined by electrocardiogram). In addition, participants with CrCl <30 ml min−1 were required to discontinue. Additional stopping criteria included suicidal ideation (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale score ≥4 or Problem Behaviors Assessment-Short Version (PBA-s) suicidal ideation >3), seizures, symptomatic or uncontrolled atrial fibrillation, confirmed ventricular tachycardia, presence of left bundle branch block, intracranial issues, cerebrovascular events, substance use disorders or pregnancy. Other reasons included adverse events, noncompliance, consent withdrawal or study termination. Discontinued participants were encouraged to attend scheduled visits. Participants could withdraw at any time, and the reasons for withdrawal were recorded.

The primary endpoint of the study was the change from baseline in the TFC score, at 65 weeks. The TFC is the standard and well-accepted clinical scale for staging and tracking the progression of HD. Scores range from 0 to 13, with 13 indicating no functional impairment and 0 representing complete incapacity. The scale assesses a participant's ability to manage domestic chores, activities of daily living, finances, care needs and occupation. The scale is designed to detect changes in the early stages of HD (HD1 and HD2) and exhibits a floor effect in advanced stages of the disease.

The key secondary endpoint was the change in cUHDRS score from baseline at 65 weeks (ref. 60). The cUHDRS is a composite measure comprising four components: TFC, TMS, SDMT and SWR. These components collectively assess functional, motor and cognitive outcomes, offering a comprehensive evaluation of clinical progression in HD.

A key assumption in using the cUHDRS in clinical studies is that neuroprotective therapies targeting disease mechanisms should result in concordant improvements across all components of the cUHDRS29,60. To evaluate this assumption and explore the contribution of each cUHDRS component at each study visit, post hoc forest plot analyses were conducted in the mITT and PP populations off ADMs. The components were rescaled using standardization factors from Schobel's formula (1.9, −14.9, 11.3 and 20.1 for TFC, TMS, SDMT and SWR, respectively) to visualize their relative contributions4.

Additional endpoints included Q-Motor measures, which provide objective, rater-independent quantifiable assessments of motor performance, in which an increase in performance indicates improvement with minimal or no placebo effects23,55,61. These tests evaluated motor skills essential for daily activities, including FT IOI Mean and FT IOI Standard Deviation (digitomotography), FT ITI, and Pro-Sup IOI and Pro-Sup ITI (dysdiadochomotography) measures. These assessments used precalibrated, temperature-controlled force transducers and three-dimensional position sensors to ensure high sensitivity and reliability across sessions and sites, reducing variability and placebo effects compared with clinical rating scales55. Data were transferred securely for centralized review and analysis was automated and blinded. FT IOI, FT ITI, Pro-Sup ITI and Pro-Sup IOI were analyzed to determine motor performance.

Cognitive performance was evaluated using the SWR and the SDMT, which assesses attention, processing speed and cognitive flexibility. The SWR evaluates attention and mental flexibility through the Stroop effect, where participants to read color names (for example, ‘red') printed in black ink, with accuracy and speed recorded over 45 s. Higher scores reflect better performance. SWR was evaluated both as an individual cognitive measure and as a prespecified component of the composite cUHDRS endpoint. The SDMT assesses psychomotor speed and working memory by having participants match symbols to corresponding numbers within 90 s, with scores reflecting the total correct responses (maximum of 110). Both assessments were administered alongside motor tests.

TMS evaluates motor features of HD including gait, balance, oculomotor function, dysarthria, dystonia and postural stability and chorea, where lower TMS scores indicate improvement. All study raters were trained and certified through UHDRS-TMS online certification provided by the European Huntington Disease Network Motor Working group in collaboration with the ENROLL-HD study platform55,62.

The primary outcome endpoint analysis was performed on the ITT population, or on the mITT population, depending on regional regulatory requirements. For the European Union (EU) regions, the primary endpoint was United Huntington's Disease Rating Scale-Total Functional Capacity change from baseline at 65 weeks. The primary estimand was a composite of treatment policy and hypothetical strategies, defined in the ITT population, which included all randomized participants. In non-EU regions, the primary analysis was conducted using a treatment policy strategy-based estimand in the mITT population, which included all participants in the ITT population who received at least one dose of the study drug and had valid in-clinic TFC scores at both baseline and at least one post-baseline time point. Here we present all data from the mITT, which excluded nine patients from the ITT population. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the PP population, which included participants from the mITT population who were on the study drug at week 65 (W65PP) or week 78 (W78PP), maintained compliance >80% during the study and did not have major protocol deviations impacting efficacy.

The statistical methods applied in the study, including sample size calculations, were prespecified in the protocol and detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), which was finalized before treatment unblinding. The null hypothesis stated that there was no difference between pridopidine and placebo in improving TFC at week 65. A restricted maximum likelihood-based MMRM was used to analyze in-clinic observed change from baseline at each post-baseline visit based on the primary estimand. The MMRM model included fixed effects for treatment, baseline value of the endpoint, region (Europe, North America), two randomization stratification factors (antipsychotic or neuroleptic use (yes, no) and baseline HD stage (HD1, HD2)), categorical week and treatment-by-week interaction. A random intercept for participant was included. An unstructured covariance matrix was used to model within-participant correlations. Kenward–Roger approximation was used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom.

Hypothesis testing was conducted hierarchically for the primary and key secondary endpoints, maintaining a two-sided Type I error level of ≤0.05 to control for multiple comparisons. The endpoints included in the hierarchical testing sequence were:

Change from baseline to week 65 in TFC (primary endpoint)

Change from baseline to week 65 in cUHDRS total score (key secondary endpoint)

Proportion of participants with improvement or no worsening (≥0-point change) at week 65 in TFC

Change from baseline to week 52 and week 78 in TFC

Change from baseline to week 65 in Q-Motor FT IOI Mean

Change from baseline to week 65 in UHDRS-TMS

Change from baseline to week 65 in SDMT

Change from baseline to week 52 in TMS

Proportion of participants with improvement or no worsening in Clinical Global Impression of Change at week 65.

Because the primary endpoint was not met, no further formal multiplicity adjustment was applied beyond the hierarchical testing procedure. Subgroup analyses, including those in the off-ADM population, were reported with point estimates, 95% CI and nominal P values, and were interpreted with appropriate caution. Prespecified sensitivity analyses included subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint (TFC) by baseline ADM status, as outlined in the SAP. Post hoc analyses were subsequently performed to evaluate cUHDRS and responder thresholds in the off-ADM subgroup.

Following the primary analysis, missing data were handled using a control-based pattern mixture model (PMM) under a Missing Not at Random (MNAR) assumption. In this approach, missing post-discontinuation outcomes were imputed based on placebo group trajectories. The assumed delta adjustment reflected a weighted estimate based on observed dropout patterns across treatment groups. Sensitivity analyses using PMM were performed for TFC, cUHDRS and other key endpoints. The results of these sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary MMRM findings, although nominal statistical significance was not reached in the overall population.

The sample size determination aimed to ensure sufficient power to detect a statistically significant difference in change from baseline in TFC between pridopidine and placebo at week 65 at 90% power and a two-sided significance level of 0.05. Specifically, a total sample size of 372 participants provided 94% power to detect a between-group difference of 0.7 points in mean change from baseline to 65 weeks in TFC, assuming an s.d. of 1.9 and a two-tailed t-test. To accommodate a projected dropout rate of 22.5%, the final target sample size was set at 480 randomized participants. This dropout assumption was empirically derived from the PRIDE-HD trial23, in which the combined dropout rate for the placebo and pridopidine 45 mg bid groups was 22.3% among participants with baseline TFC scores between 7 and 13. Under a MNAR assumption, modeling discontinued participants to follow the trajectory of placebo after withdrawal, the estimated treatment difference of 0.565 (a weighted average of 0.7 for completers and 0.1 for dropouts) with an s.d. of 1.9 yielded 90% power to detect a statistically significant effect.

Continuous variables were summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, s.d., quartiles); categorical variables were summarized using frequency counts and percentages. Using control-based PMM, sensitivity analyses were conducted under an MNAR assumption to evaluate robustness. Continuous outcomes were analyzed using MMRM, accounting for repeated observations and assuming data were missing at random. Continuous outcomes were analyzed using MMRM, accounting for repeated observations and assuming data were missing at random. The SP included all participants who received at least one dose of study drug and was analyzed according to treatment received.

We performed a post hoc responder analysis of pridopidine's impact on cUHDRS. However, despite the advantages of performing a responder analysis37,63,64, choosing a single specific cutoff to define a responder can be a limitation. To address this limitation, two complementary approaches were adopted. First, a post hoc CDF analysis was used, which does not require a specific responder cutoff but instead evaluates the entire range of responses, spanning from −10% to +10% change from baseline in cUHDRS score. The AUC difference between the pridopidine and placebo groups was assessed using a logistic model with a fixed effect for treatment. In addition, the CDFs between the treatment groups were compared nonparametrically using the KS test. Second, a specific threshold was analyzed, defined as at least a 5% improvement from baseline on the cUHDRS, a threshold considered reasonably likely to represent clinical significance given the progressive decline typically observed in HD.

All statistical tests were two-sided, with a significance threshold of 0.05. Subgroup analyses were prespecified to evaluate treatment effects by baseline HD stage, ADM use and other factors. For efficacy and safety outcomes, baseline was defined as the last nonmissing assessment before the first study drug dose. Change from baseline at scheduled visits to week 65 (weeks 26, 39, 52, 65) and to week 78 were analyzed using separate MMRM models to reduce potential bias from participants who did not reach week 78. End of study was defined as the time point when the last participant completed the week 65 visit or withdrew. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS v.9.4.

Given the potential of ADMs (antipsychotics or neuroleptics and VMAT2 inhibitors) to mask clinical measures of HD and potentially mask the efficacy outcomes of pridopidine8,65, subgroup analyses were conducted on participants who were off ADMs at any point during the study, including both at baseline and throughout its duration. The SAP included stratification at baseline based on antipsychotic use (yes or no) and, considering the biological plausibility that ADMs could negatively impact function and cognition in HD, subgroup analyses excluding antipsychotics and VMAT2 inhibitor use any time during the study were defined. These analyses were conducted in both the modified intent-to-treat mITT and PP populations (Fig. 1 and Table 1).

Participants were closely monitored throughout the study to ensure proper adherence to the dosing regimen. Adverse events were collected and reported in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Safety monitoring included tracking the incidence of TEAEs, SAEs and any events leading to treatment and study discontinuation (Table 2; Extended Data Table 1). Investigators assessed the severity of all adverse events, and their causality to determine whether they were related to the treatment with the study drug.

An independent safety monitoring committee reviewed unblinded data during the trial to ensure participant safety. The monitoring approach ensured a comprehensive evaluation of treatment exposure, adherence and safety.

This trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences International Ethical Guidelines, as well as the International Council for Harmonisation guidelines for Good Clinical Practice66. The trial protocol and all amendments were approved by an independent review board (IRB) and independent ethics committee (IEC).

Sensitivity analyses of the change in (a) TFC show that pridopidine treatment showed a numerical trend favoring pridopidine, slowing TFC decline as compared with placebo through Week 78 with maximal TFC difference at Week 52 (difference: 0.26 vs. placebo; n = 104 placebo, n = 91 pridopidine). (b) Skilled Motor Performance (Pronation-Supination Inter-Tap Interval [Pro-Sup ITI] Mean): Improvements were significant at Week 26 (LSMean difference = -38.06 msec; p = 0.007; n = 112 placebo, n = 95 pridopidine) and Week 65 (LSMean difference = -23.92 msec; p = 0.04), with numerical trends favoring pridopidine at other timepoints. (c, d) Pridopidine treatment mitigated declines in motor function in mITT participants off ADMs. Negative values indicate improvement. Specifically: (c) Motor Variability (Finger Tapping IOI Standard Deviation [SD]): Significant reductions in variability were observed at Week 26 (LSMean difference = -0.43; p = 0.035; n = 112 placebo, n = 95 pridopidine), with trends favoring pridopidine at later timepoints. (d) Pronation-Supination Inter-Onset Interval (Pro-Sup IOI) Mean: Significant improvements were observed at Week 26 (LSMean difference = -17.2 msec; p = 0.044; n = 112 placebo, n = 95 pridopidine). Each panel represents mean change from baseline with 95% confidence intervals. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. All statistical tests are based on mixed-effects models for repeated measures (MMRM) applied to the mITT population off ADMs. Negative values indicate improvement for all motor outcomes.

(a) Pridopidine showed a 0.37-point difference in TFC versus placebo at Week 78 (placebo: n = 160; pridopidine: n = 158). (b) For the cUHDRS, pridopidine slowed decline compared with placebo, with nominal statistical significance observed through Week 52 (Week 26: p = 0.006, placebo: n = 99, pridopidine: n = 78; Week 39: p = 0.003, n = 99, n = 76; Week 52: p = 0.035, n = 97, n = 78) (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01). (c) Pridopidine demonstrated improvements in cognitive function (SWR) with significance reached at Week 26 (p = 0.034, n = 99, n = 78), Week 39 (p = 0.023, n = 99, n = 77), and Week 52 (p = 0.019, n = 97, n = 79) (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01). (d–g) For motor outcomes, negative values indicate improvement. (d) Motor Skills (Finger Tapping Inter-Onset Interval [FT IOI]): Pridopidine resulted in significant improvements at Week 26 (p < 0.0001, n = 99, n = 78), with sustained differences through Week 78 (n = 76, n = 74; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ****p < 0.0001). (e) Motor Variability (FT IOI Standard Deviation [SD]): Significant reductions were observed at Week 26 (p < 0.01; n = 99, n = 78) (**p < 0.01). (f) Skilled Motor Performance (Pronation-Supination Inter-Tap Interval [Pro-Sup ITI]): Improvements were significant at Week 26 (***p < 0.001), with trends favoring pridopidine through Week 78 (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; n = 99, n = 78). (g) Pronation-Supination Inter-Onset Interval (Pro-Sup IOI): Significant improvements were observed at Week 26 (**p < 0.01; n = 99, n = 78) and Week 78 (*p < 0.05; n = 76, n = 74). All data represent mean change from baseline in the PP population off-ADMs. Statistical significance was assessed using mixed-effects models for repeated measures (MMRM). P values are nominal and unadjusted for multiplicity. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

(a) This post hoc analysis presents the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of percent change from baseline in cUHDRS scores through Week 78 in the PP population of participants not receiving antidopaminergic medications (ADMs). Pridopidine consistently demonstrated higher response rates compared with placebo, with significant differences observed at Week 26 (AUC = 0.63, p = 0.003; KS Test p = 0.008; placebo n = 99, pridopidine n = 78) and Week 39 (AUC = 0.63, p = 0.001; KS Test p = 0.02; n = 99, n = 76). Trends favoring pridopidine persisted at Week 65 (AUC = 0.56; n = 97, n = 78) and Week 78 (AUC = 0.61; n = 60, n = 60). These results highlight pridopidine's potential to improve or maintain function in participants off ADMs, with pronounced effects observed during the first 39 weeks. (b) A threshold-based analysis revealed that a ≥ 5% improvement in cUHDRS was achieved in approximately twice as many participants receiving pridopidine compared with placebo at Week 26 (p = 0.006) and Week 39 (p = 0.004) (**p < 0.01; *p < 0.05). All statistical tests were two-sided and unadjusted for multiple comparisons. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals (CIs). AUC = area under the curve; KS test = Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.

Gene expression is modulated jointly by transcriptional regulation and messenger RNA stability, yet the latter is often overlooked in studies on genetic variants. Here, leveraging metabolic labeling data (Bru/BruChase-seq) and a new computational pipeline, RNAtracker, we categorize genes as allele-specific RNA stability (asRS) or allele-specific RNA transcription events. We identify more than 5,000 asRS variants among 665 genes across a panel of 11 human cell lines. These variants directly overlap conserved microRNA target regions and allele-specific RNA-binding protein sites, illuminating mechanisms through which stability is mediated. Furthermore, we identified causal asRS variants using a massively parallel screen (MapUTR) for variants that affect post-transcriptional mRNA abundance, as well as through CRISPR prime editing approaches. Notably, asRS genes were enriched significantly among a multitude of immune-related pathways and contribute to the risk of several immune system diseases. This work highlights RNA stability as a critical, yet understudied mechanism linking genetic variation and disease.

Code for reproducing the RNAtracker gene categorization results and other data analysis scripts is available via GitHub at https://github.com/gxiaolab/RNAtracker and via Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15528784 (ref. 55). We used bbduk from the BBmap package (v.38.91) (https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/) for read adapter trimming, STAR47 (v.2.7.8a) for read mapping, Picard Tools (https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) (v.1.94) to remove PCR duplicates and extract uniquely mapped reads, NeoloopFinder43 (v.0.3.0) for CNV predictions, rrvgo52 (v.1.6.0) for GO enrichment analysis, PLINK56 (v.1.9) to obtain tag SNPs and bedtools (v.2.30.0)57 to overlap genomic regions. Perbase (v.0.10.0) (https://github.com/sstadick/perbase) was used to obtain variant allelic counts in the CRISPR prime editing sequencing data. MPRAnalyze48 was used to identify functional variants in the MapUTR data. S-LDSC54 was used to estimate disease heritability. FUSION.compute_weights.R from http://gusevlab.org/projects/fusion/ was used to build gene prediction models. For analyzing whole-genome sequencing data, we used bwa mem58 (v.0.7.17) for read mapping and CNVpytor41 (v.1.3.1) for identifying CNV regions. The VGAM59 (v.1.1) R package was used to compute probability density values and simulate allelic counts. Genome coordinate conversions were performed using liftOver (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/workflows/html/liftOver.html). Other R packages used for plotting include ComplexUpSet60, ComplexHeatmap61 and AllelicImbalance62.

Senators grilled Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, on Thursday about vaccines, the firing of federal health officials and other matters.Credit: Andrew Harnik/Getty

US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr defiantly defended his controversial actions to upend public health at a Senate hearing on 4 September. Kennedy, a long-time anti-vaccine advocate, also made unfounded allegations about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and accused the medical establishment of corruption.

What was supposed to be a routine hearing about the health-care agenda of Republican President Donald Trump was anything but. The hearing devolved at several points into a shouting match, as senators grilled Kennedy on turmoil and a leadership shake-up at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which he oversees, and on his efforts to block research on mRNA vaccines.

In response, Kennedy repeatedly alleged that scientists, including researchers at federal agencies, had colluded with the pharmaceutical industry. He also emphasized the high rates of chronic disease in the United States, citing them as justification for his agenda. “That's why we had to fire people at the CDC,” he said at the hearing.

In turn, several senators accused Kennedy of stacking advisory panels of independent scientists with members whose views on vaccines fall outside the scientific consensus. “This is not a podcast,” said Senator Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado, referring to Kennedy's frequent appearances on conservative media outlets. “This is the American people's health that's on the line here.”

Only last week, Trump fired Susan Monarez as CDC director, barely one month into her tenure. In an opinion piece published today in The Wall Street Journal, Monarez wrote that she was dismissed after being told to fire top career CDC scientists and “preapprove the recommendations of a vaccine advisory panel newly filled with people who have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric”. In June, Kennedy fired all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a group that provides vaccine recommendations to the federal government, and appointed new members, some of whom are outspoken critics of US vaccination policies.

At the hearing, Kennedy denied he had told Monarez to pre-approve the vaccine panel's recommendations, and said she was lying. He claimed he had fired her because he asked her if she was “trustworthy” and she said “no”. Asked for comment after the hearing, Monarez's attorneys said that “secretary Kennedy's claims are false, and at times, patently ridiculous”.

Will RFK Jr's vaccine agenda make America contagious again?

After her firing, four top CDC officials resigned in protest. Kennedy admitted at the hearing that he had asked Monarez to fire career CDC staff members.

Kennedy repeatedly criticized the CDC during the hearing, saying it was the most corrupt US health agency, and perhaps the most corrupt agency in the entire federal government. To justify the recent shake-up at the CDC, he pointed to its performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. The CDC staff members “who put masks on our children, who closed our schools, are the people who will be leaving”, he said in his opening remarks.

At one point, he said he did not know how many people had died from COVID-19 in the United States — or the number of lives saved by COVID-19 vaccines — during the pandemic. “I don't think anybody knows, because there was so much data chaos coming out of the CDC,” he said, without elaborating. (The CDC says some 1.2 million people in the United States have died from COVID-19 to date.)

Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana, asked Kennedy whether Trump deserved a Nobel Peace Prize for the initiative he launched in 2020, during his first term as president, to accelerate the development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy said yes. Several senators were incredulous at this statement, given that Kennedy has cut more than US$500 million in funding for research projects investigating mRNA vaccines, and has slammed the initiative repeatedly in social-media posts.

The hearing also made clear who Kennedy is soliciting scientific advice from — and who he's shutting out.

Anthropic has agreed to pay at least $1.5 billion to settle a lawsuit brought by a group of book authors alleging copyright infringement, an estimated $3,000 per work. In a court motion on Friday, the plaintiffs emphasized that the terms of the settlement are “critical victories” and that going to trial would have been an “enormous” risk.

This is the first class action settlement centered on AI and copyright in the United States, and the outcome may shape how regulators and creative industries approach the legal debate over generative AI and intellectual property. According to the settlement agreement, the class action will apply to approximately 500,000 works, but that number may go up once the list of pirated materials is finalized. For every additional work, the artificial intelligence company will pay an extra $3,000. Plaintiffs plan to deliver a final list of works to the court by October.

“This landmark settlement far surpasses any other known copyright recovery. It is the first of its kind in the AI era. It will provide meaningful compensation for each class work and sets a precedent requiring AI companies to pay copyright owners. This settlement sends a powerful message to AI companies and creators alike that taking copyrighted works from these pirate websites is wrong,” says colead plaintiffs' counsel Justin Nelson of Susman Godfrey LLP.

Anthropic is not admitting any wrongdoing or liability. “Today's settlement, if approved, will resolve the plaintiffs' remaining legacy claims. We remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery, and solve complex problems,” Anthropic deputy general counsel Aparna Sridhar said in a statement.

The lawsuit, which was originally filed in 2024 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, was part of a larger ongoing wave of copyright litigation brought against tech companies over the data they used to train artificial intelligence programs. Authors Andrea Bartz, Kirk Wallace Johnson, and Charles Graeber alleged that Anthropic trained its large language models on their work without permission, violating copyright law.

This June, senior district judge William Alsup ruled that Anthropic's AI training was shielded by the “fair use” doctrine, which allows unauthorized use of copyrighted works under certain conditions. It was a win for the tech company but came with a major caveat. As it gathered materials to train its AI tools, Anthropic had relied on a corpus of books pirated from so-called “shadow libraries,” including the notorious site LibGen, and Alsup determined that the authors should still be able to bring Anthropic to trial in a class action over pirating their work. (Anthropic maintains that it did not actually train its products on the pirated works, instead opting to purchase copies of books.)

“Anthropic downloaded over seven million pirated copies of books, paid nothing, and kept these pirated copies in its library even after deciding it would not use them to train its AI (at all or ever again). Authors argue Anthropic should have paid for these pirated library copies. This order agrees,” Alsup wrote in his summary judgement.

It's unclear how the literary world will respond to the terms of the settlement. Since this was an “opt-out” class action, authors who are eligible but dissatisfied with the terms will be able to request exclusion to file their own lawsuits. Notably, the plaintiffs filed a motion today to keep the “opt-out threshold” confidential, which means that the public will not have access to the exact number of class members who would need to opt out for the settlement to be terminated.

Authors and rights holders have been directed to provide their contact information to the plaintiffs' counsel through a dedicated website. In the coming weeks, if the settlement is approved, counsel says it plans to create a searchable database of all the works covered.

“I am hopeful that the settlement will receive wide support from copyright owners,” Maria Pallante, President and CEO of the Association of American Publishers, said in a statement. (Pallante consulted on the settlement agreement.) “Beyond the monetary terms, the proposed settlement provides enormous value in sending the message that Artificial Intelligence companies cannot unlawfully acquire content from shadow libraries or other pirate sources as the building blocks for their models.”

“Terms seem fair,” says Edward Lee, a law professor at Santa Clara University who closely follows AI copyright litigation. “It's the largest publicly reported copyright settlement.”

This is not the end of Anthropic's copyright legal challenges. The company is also facing a lawsuit from a group of major record labels, including Universal Music Group, which alleges that the company used copyrighted lyrics to train its Claude chatbot. The plaintiffs are now attempting to amend their case to include allegations that Anthropic used the peer-to-peer file sharing service BitTorrent to illegally download songs, and their lawyers recently stated in court filings that they may file a new lawsuit about piracy if they are not permitted to amend the current complaint.

Almost 500 people were detained Thursday in an immigration raid at a new Hyundai manufacturing complex in Georgia.

The massive raid highlights growing tensions between President Donald Trump's anti-immigration policies, his tariff-fueled trade negotiations, and his promise to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.

“This was the largest single-site enforcement operation in the history of Homeland Security Investigations,” said Steven Schrank, a special agent in charge of the agency's Atlanta investigations, at a press conference, according to the Associated Press.

Schrank said 475 people were arrested, most of them South Korean nationals. He added that those detained had either crossed the border illegally, overstayed their visas, or were under a visa waiver program that kept them from being able to work. However, The Wall Street Journal reports that some of those arrested were LG Energy Solution employees who were in the U.S. on business travel.

South Korea's foreign ministry spokesperson Lee Jaewoong was quick to criticize the raid.

“The business activities of our investors and the rights of our nationals must not be unjustly infringed in the process of U.S. law enforcement,” Lee said in a televised statement, according to the AP.

The raid comes months after the U.S. and South Korea finally reached an agreement following tense trade talks. Earlier this summer, the two sides agreed to impose a 15% tariff on South Korean imports in exchange for $350 billion in promised investments in the U.S.

Trump has repeatedly used the threat of tariffs to pressure foreign governments and corporations into pledging more investments in the United States. Companies like Apple and  OpenAI have all committed billions in recent months, hoping to secure favorable treatment from the administration.  Hyundai also recently promised to increase its U.S. investments to $26 billion.

Despite this, the raid specifically targeted the construction site of a new EV battery plant, a joint venture between Hyundai and LG Energy Solution. The upcoming factory is near a separate $7.6 billion Hyundai EV-manufacturing complex in Georgia that officials have called the largest manufacturing project in the state's history. Hyundai has said the EV complex is expected to create 8,500 jobs by 2031.

Hyundai did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo. However, HL-GA Battery Company, the joint venture with LG Energy Solution, told the AP that it is cooperating with authorities and has paused construction at the plant in the meantime.

The halting of the factory's construction comes at a bad time when manufacturing jobs in the U.S. continue to shrink. The U.S. unemployment rate went up to 4.3% in August, its highest level since 2021, according to a new report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Manufacturing jobs, specifically, fell by 12,000 jobs last month and are down 78,000 over the past year.

                              What happens here matters everywhere.

Microsoft's Satya Nadella and Bill Gates were at the White House on Thursday night, part of a high-profile gathering of tech leaders who combined praise for President Donald Trump with promises to invest in U.S. infrastructure, manufacturing, and artificial intelligence.

The discussion felt at times like a high-stakes poker game, with Trump pressing each executive to reveal the size of their bets on America's future, like a dealer asking players to ante up.

Nadella told Trump that America's tech leadership depends on innovation and global trust in U.S. technology, praising the administration for creating conditions where “the rest of the world can not only use our technology, but trust our technology more than any other alternative.” 

The Microsoft CEO also highlighted AI education and workforce training as “perhaps the most defining issue” for the future, thanking First Lady Melania Trump for putting skilling and opportunity at the center of the administration's AI push.

Gates focused on what he called his “second career” of philanthropy, linking it back to the innovation that defined his years at Microsoft. He told Trump that AI could help accelerate progress in global health — acting as “a doctor for everyone in Africa,” giving farmers better advice, and expanding opportunities for children to learn. 

He compared the potential of AI-driven health innovation to the government's Operation Warp Speed vaccine program, saying the U.S. could take “the seeds” of research in areas like HIV and sickle cell disease and, with the right support, “put them together” to achieve breakthroughs much as it did with COVID-19 vaccines.

Gates did not reference the congressional hearing earlier in the day with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Health and Human Services secretary who has voiced skepticism about vaccines and clashed with public health officials over U.S. immunization policy. 

Later, when the discussion was opened up to reporters, Trump was asked if he had confidence in Kennedy. Trump described Kennedy as “a very good person” with some “different ideas,” adding that he liked the fact “he's different.”

Others at the table included OpenAI's Sam Altman; AMD CEO Lisa Su; Apple's Tim Cook; Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg; Google's Sundar Pichai and Sergey Brin.

The roundtable discussion felt like “passing a camera around to take turns wishing a distant, unloved uncle a very happy Thanksgiving,” in Wired's estimation.

Earlier in the day, companies made a series of announcements in conjunction with the White House AI Education Task Force meeting.

Chatbots are great, but good old human-to-human contact can't be beat, and Thursday night at GeekWire's Seattle HQ, we caught up with several startup leaders for a party deck version of “Geek on the Street.”

RELATED: Inside the minds of Seattle startup founders: Fundraising, hiring, and navigating their biggest challenges

Artificial intelligence was of course of a relevant topic. We wanted to know how founders and CEOs are using AI to make their jobs easier or to help their companies run smoother. We also wondered whether investors or customers are pressuring startups to look and sound “more AI” than they really are.

And finally, in an age of generative AI, agents, and other technologies that are blurring the lines between who really does what work, we asked our guests what the most human element is that they bring to work each day. It's inspiring to hear about their appreciation for trust, humor, energy, passion and more. 

Keep reading for answers to our questions, which have been edited for brevity and clarity.

Seattle-based Augmodo helps retailers track inventory and manage data via a variety of tech, including specially designed “Smartbadges” worn by store employees.

What's your favorite AI use case right now?

“For myself, personally, it's actually doing research on individual customers. We work in the retail space, so if you wanted to get every address of every store that would be a very long process to try and mine that. You can actually do that as a deep research task in Gemini and compile that report in a couple minutes. … I'm a little bit skeptical of a lot of the use cases now, but in every area of excitement or hype cycle that you have, it takes a while for things to distill down.”

Do you feel pressure from investors or customers to look more AI than you really are?

“Definitely on the investor front. The more you can AI-a-fy things from an investor pitch, you have to say, ‘Here's how everyone thinks about AI, and here's our unique twist on it.' Customers, at least in the retail space, they don't care what technology [you're using]. They're just like, ‘Does it provide an ROI or not?' You can [track inventory] manually right now, or if you do that digitally or with AI or whatever, they really don't care.”

What's something you as a human still provide to your company that AI doesn't? 

“Trust. Especially in a small team, like, ‘Hey, Dom has this, Joe has that,' I can trust that it's all getting done, rather than an AI system with that constant hallucination. And even with the customer, there's a reason why, even post-Covid, people get on planes and visit customers in person.”

Wavely Diagnostics is a University of Washington spinout that developed a smartphone app that uses acoustic signals to detect signs of an ear infection.

What's your favorite AI use case right now?

“I have two examples of how I used it in the last 24 hours, and both of them were hugely time saving. The first one, we needed to create an unsubscribe link in our emails and a landing HTML page where people go to confirm their unsubscribe and tell us why. I went to ChatGPT and less than two minutes later we were done. … Another way I use it as CEO is to write. I don't ask it to write for me. I write a draft, I put it into Claude of ChatGPT and I say, ‘Here's my draft. Can you take a look at it?' And then, depending on what it's for, it revises it and it invariably does an excellent job. I did the thinking, but what it does is it gives it the polish.”

Do you feel pressure from investors or customers to look more AI than you really are?

“I got an email today from an investor of ours, basically saying, ‘If you're not AI native, in terms of how you build, you're dead in the water.' It is an expectation that you build with AI right now in order to get venture funding. My reaction to that is I think that a couple of years from now, there's gonna be a heck of a lot of tech debt that companies are going to be wading through if they're relying too much on GenAI to write everything for them. It's a tool. Some people think it's a replacement. I don't agree with that.”

What's something you as a human still provide to your company that AI doesn't? 

“A little bit of humor. A little bit of … we all talk about our kids not letting us sleep at night. Fundamentally, companies are built by teams of people. You've got to have good relationships. You've got to enjoy being together, or why the heck are you going to work so many hours side-by-side?”

HouseWhisper a Seattle-based startup that relies on generative AI to help real estate agents stay organized with help on following up with clients, scheduling, CRM updates and more.

What's your favorite AI use case right now?

“I've been using it a lot for creating product ideas. I take customer feedback and my ideas and I start brainstorming with AI. I use ChatGPT or Gemini when I drive from my home to downtown Seattle, I'm talking, brainstorming ideas. And then I get to the office and I talk to engineers and we get to the solution. It's a thinking partner for me.”

Do you feel pressure from investors or customers to look more AI than you really are?

We are actually explaining a lot to our customers about what AI is, so from a customer perspective I don't. From an investor perspective, maybe to use it in certain other parts of the business, for example, doing more marketing with AI tools. But no, it has not been a pressure.”

What's something you as a human still provide to your company that AI doesn't? 

“I think the bringing the energy and the emotions and the passion to the day-to-day and motivating the rest of the teammates, I think that's unique to us, to humans. And every time we encounter a problem, how we can turn around and go fast and motivate the team, I think that's unique. That will not be replaceable.”

Seattle-based startup Loti helps celebrities, politicians, and other high-profile individuals protect their digital likeness in a chaotic world of deepfakes and IP rights.

What's your favorite AI use case right now?

“Well, we built over 40 different proprietary machine learning models. With that, we can do facial and voice recognition across the internet to find instances of media that should not be online of folks, and then we can get that removed. Without AI I guess we could do what Google does with a reverse image search, but that's not very effective. It really takes these very bespoke models to actually be able to what we do.” — Rebekah

Do you feel pressure from investors or customers to look more AI than you really are?

“I definitely get that it's easier to fundraise if you talk about AI a lot. There's a certain amount of words you can use. If I said ‘agentic' too loudly here, I'd probably get someone to throw a check at me. Essentially we try to sell fundamentals of our business. What do people really want? What problems are you really solving? And AI is just sometimes a cheaper way to get it done.” — Luke

What's something you as a human still provide to your company that AI doesn't? 

“I don't think you can have self-regulation of nearly anybody — companies or AI. I think that it does require some level of human oversight. AI is obviously a fantastic tool. But ultimately there still needs to be a human to say, ‘This is a tool that's gonna be useful for humanity,' and today AI isn't gonna be able to do that.” — Rebekah

Seattle-based Caddi uses generative AI to automate basic business operations such as customer onboarding, email management, document organization, data entry and invoicing.

What's your favorite AI use case right now?

“As a founder, you have many different hats. I've been using AI for coding, of course. I've built some automations that automatically draft follow-up emails to all the clients and all the conversations that I've had. I've used AI to prepare for meetings with customers. I have Claude and ChatGPT and all these AI tools open all the time in my phone, in my laptop. There's a screen dedicated for them.”

Do you feel pressure from investors or customers to look more AI than you really are?

“I think a lot of companies feel that pressure. In our case, there is a component that is heavily AI and if these models didn't exist our company couldn't exist. The rest of the platform, all the infrastructure of how we guide the AI, how it gets built, how we validate it, how the user interacts with it — that's not AI. And that is becoming increasingly more important than the AI component. You can have a chip for your laptop, but if you don't have a keyboard or screen or anything, it doesn't work.”

What's something you as a human still provide to your company that AI doesn't?

“Given that AI has been trained on past data, a lot of the things that AI spits out are things that somewhere in the past it made some certain sense, like the way we write emails, or maybe the way we structure an idea. But as a startup you're effectively building something that has never existed before. So you can prompt it however you want, but it won't give you the answers that you need. It will just support you to make decisions faster or type things faster. But that pattern recognition in your conversations with users, in how your users are struggling with something or learning something or getting excited about something — that is something that I don't see AI being able to replicate.”

Robot vacuums that can climb stairs are now officially a thing if IFA 2025 is any indication. At the Berlin tech show, Eufy announced the MarsWalker, a dang stair-climbing mech suit that your robot vacuum can wear. And Eufy plans to release it in the spring of next year, with pricing to be announced later.

Robot vacuum owners have been waiting years for a couple of things: a robot that actually does what you want with no compromises (we're not there yet) and the ability for them to actually get up and down your stairs without you (we're close!). A few companies have shown off stair-climbing robots before; consider the Migo Robotics Ascender, an ambitious project that can climb and clean your stairs, but that one hasn't made it to the world yet. The closest thing to it on the market right now is the Dreame X50, which, admittedly, can only handle tiny steps.

Eufy's new idea is one of the wilder—and somehow the most realistic—yet. Here's how it worked when I saw it at IFA: a compatible Eufy robot vac (in this case, the Eufy Omni S2) and the MarsWalker each leave their respective docks, then have a robotic meet-cute where the Eufy robot slips inside the MarsWalker and they start rolling towards the stairs. As they approach the stairs they're planning to ascend, robotic arms extend from the MarsWalker's front and the back, and reach for the first step. On contact, the front arms raise the MarsWalker and the treads drive it forward until they touch with the step, then it just cruises on up.

I watched the MarsWalker do this over and over again on a small set of wooden stairs that only went up in one direction. But Eufy says it works fine with stairs that reach a landing and turn, either at a right angle or back in the other direction. I asked a member of Eufy's research and development team who was on site, and he tells me the MarsWalker can potentially handle spiral staircases too, but they'd have to have a wide curve. If I get a chance to review it, I'll try it on the spiral stairs in my own home.

I asked Eufy's representative about the MarsWalker's future compatibility, and he said the company plans to make other robot vacs that work with it. The device won't be backward compatible. The rep said the company is attempting to make the Eufy Omni S1 Pro work with it as well, but it sounds like that's far from a given.

The MarsWalker has a way to go before it can truly conquer stairs—it doesn't clean the stairs themselves, after all. But if it works as Eufy hopes it will, this little robot can get from one floor to the next all by its onesie, saving you from having to carry your robot vacuum upstairs (which, if you're me, you just don't do) or buy separate vacuums for each floor. And really, it's probably a good thing for Eufy to try to master getting up and down the stairs first before moving onto the next thing. Baby steps.<

Eufy's robot vacuums, like many on the market today, can save multiple maps of your house so you can move them around, but with this new approach, it creates a full map of all of your floors without you having to initiate separate map-making runs for each floor.

The Omni S2 is a new robot, and a follow-up to its Omni S1 Pro self-cleaning robot vacuum with a great big tower of a cleaning base. Eufy says the Omni S2 is aimed at solving a number of issues that robot vacuums have, not just their inability to climb stairs. Those include the robots' inability to adapt to different floor surfaces, terrible carpet performance, tendency to get their filters clogged with dust and pet hair, and the fact that even the best mop-bots can't actually disinfect your floors.

The Omni S2, which Eufy expects to sell for $1,599 in the U.S. in January, will have 30,000Pa suction (that's higher than the Omni E28's 20,000Pa and way higher than the S1 Pro's 8,000Pa), a self-cleaning mop, and can rid floors of “99.999%” of bacteria and pathogens. As it cleans, it farts out pretty smells, with the company's presentation showing it diffusing scents like “Citrus and Basil,” “Bamboo and Sage,” and “Bergamot and Lychee.”

Also, those 3D maps I mentioned earlier? Eufy says the Omni S2, even without the MarsWalker, uses those to avoid obstacles and messes, adapting to your home as it cleans. Without the MarsWalker, the S2 can climb up to 5cm transitions to different floors. Like the S1's dock, Eufy says the S2's UniClean Station 2.0 can empty, wash, dry, and refill the S2 with cleaning solution for the next run.

Warner Bros. is suing AI startup Midjourney for copyright infringement, alleging that the company allows users to generate images and videos of characters like Superman, Batman, and Bugs Bunny without permission. 

As first reported by Reuters, Warner Bros. says that Midjourney knowingly engaged in wrongful conduct, noting that the company previously restricted subscribers from generating content based on infringing images but recently lifted those protections.

“Midjourney has made a calculated and profit-driven decision to offer zero protection for copyright owners even though Midjourney knows about the breathtaking scope of its piracy and copyright infringement,” the complaint reads. 

The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, the return of any profits earned from the alleged infringement, and a halt to further violations.

Warner Bros.' lawsuit follows a similar one filed in June by Walt Disney and Universal against Midjourney for copyright infringement involving characters such as Darth Vader, Bart Simpson, Shrek, and others. In this case, Midjourney has argued that using those works to train generative AI models is legal under the fair use doctrine of U.S. copyright law.

Midjourney did not respond to TechCrunch's request for comment.

X, formerly Twitter, has started rolling out its new encrypted messaging feature called “Chat” or “XChat.” 

The company claims the new communication feature is end-to-end encrypted, meaning messages exchanged on it can only be read by the sender and their receiver, and — in theory — no one else, including X, can access them. 

Cryptography experts, however, are warning that X's current implementation of encryption in XChat should not be trusted. They're saying it's far worse than Signal, a technology widely considered the state of the art when it comes to end-to-end encrypted chat. 

In XChat, once a user clicks on “Set up now,” X prompts them to create a four-digit PIN, which will be used to encrypt the user's private key. This key is then stored on X's servers. The private key is essentially a secret cryptographic key assigned to each user, serving the purpose of decrypting messages. As in many end-to-end encrypted services, a private key is paired with a public key, which is what a sender uses to encrypt messages to the receiver. 

This is the first red flag for XChat. Signal stores a user's private key on their device, not on its servers. How and where exactly the private keys are stored on the X servers is also important. 

Matthew Garrett, a security researcher who published a blog post about XChat in June, when X announced the new service and slowly started rolling it out, wrote that if the company doesn't use hardware security modules, or HSMs, to store the keys, then the company could tamper with the keys — brute-forcing them for example since they are only four digits — and potentially decrypt messages. HSMs are servers made specifically to make it harder for the company that owns them to access the data inside. 

An X engineer said in a post in June that the company does use HSMs, but neither he nor the company has provided any proof so far. “Until that's done, this is ‘trust us, bro' territory,” Garrett told TechCrunch. 

The second red flag, which X admits on the XChat support page, is that the current implementation of the service could allow “a malicious insider or X itself” to compromise encrypted conversations.

This is what is technically called an “adversary-in-the-middle,” or AITM attack. That makes the whole point of an end-to-end encrypted messaging platform moot. 

Garrett said that X “gives you the public key whenever you communicate with them, so even if they've implemented this properly, you can't prove they haven't made up a new key” and performed an AITM attack. 

Another red flag is that none of XChat's implementation, at this point, is open source, unlike Signal's, which is openly documented in detail. X says it aims to “open source our implementation and describe the encryption technology in depth through a technical whitepaper later this year.”

Finally, X doesn't offer “perfect forward secrecy,” a cryptographic mechanism by which every new message is encrypted with a different key, which means that if an attacker compromises the user's private key, they can only decrypt the last message, and not all the preceding ones. The company itself also admits this shortcoming. 

As a result, Garrett doesn't think XChat is at a point where users should trust it just yet. 

“If everyone involved is fully trustworthy, the X implementation is technically worse than Signal,” Garrett told TechCrunch. “And even if they were fully trustworthy to start with, they could stop being trustworthy and compromise trust in multiple ways … If they were either untrustworthy or incompetent during initial implementation, it's impossible to demonstrate that there's any security at all.”

Garrett isn't the only expert raising concerns. Matthew Green, a cryptography expert who teaches at Johns Hopkins University, agrees. 

“For the moment, until it gets a full audit by someone reputable, I would not trust this any more than I trust current unencrypted DMs,” Green told TechCrunch. (XChat is a separate feature that lives, at least for now, with the legacy Direct Messages.)

X did not respond to several questions sent to its press email address.

One of the world's most sought-after drugs has officially become a vital medication. The World Health Organization has just added semaglutide—the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy—to its list of essential medicines.

The WHO's Model Lists of Essential Medicines is designed to improve affordability and access for the world's most impactful drugs. Semaglutide and other GLP-1 drugs are among 20 new additions to the list, and it's clear why. GLP-1s have completely reshaped how clinicians treat type 2 diabetes and obesity, with more possible uses being explored or on the horizon—but the most effective versions are expensive, scarce, and often aren't covered by insurance.

“The new editions of essential medicines lists mark a significant step toward expanding access to new medicines with proven clinical benefits and with high potential for global public health impact,” said Yukiko Nakatani, assistant director-general for health systems, access and data, in a statement.

The WHO first released its list of essential medicines in 1977. With the new additions, there are some 523 essential medicines for adults and 374 for children.

The list was initially aimed at identifying the drugs most needed in developing countries, but it has since become a global guide, highlighting the medicines most likely to broadly improve public health worldwide. More than 150 countries use the WHO's recommendations to help decide which medications to prioritize purchasing, to cover through public insurance, or to otherwise make more available and affordable.

How Ozempic Works—and What's Still a Mystery

That's why it's so notable that semaglutide and two other GLP-1 drugs (dulaglutide and liraglutide) have been added to the essential medicines list this year. These drugs mimic GLP-1, a hormone that regulates the body's hunger cues and our metabolism, among other things. Tirzepatide—which combines GLP-1 with another hunger-related hormone, GIP-1—has also been added to the WHO's list.

GLP-1 drugs, and particularly semaglutide and tirzepatide, are game-changers for diabetes and obesity treatment. The drugs reliably help people with type 2 diabetes control their blood sugar, and they're much more effective at helping people lose weight than through diet and exercise alone. They're also safe and generally tolerable, although gastrointestinal side effects like nausea and diarrhea are common.

Both diabetes and obesity can lower a person's lifespan and raise their risk of many other chronic diseases, including cancer. And it seems as though these drugs may already be turning the tide against obesity in particular: 2023 was the first year in a decade that the adult obesity rate in the U.S. dropped.

As effective as GLP-1 drugs are, they're also largely out of reach for many of the people most eligible to take them. Even with recent price drops, the latest versions still cost hundreds of dollars a month to buy out of pocket, and in the U.S., public and private insurers will often not cover them.

The WHO's move to add them to its essential medications list is a direct play to bring the cost of GLP-1s down. Public health officials could take actions like prioritizing access to the people most likely to benefit from GLP-1s, encouraging the development of generic versions, and making them more easily available through primary care.

People on Ozempic Are Drinking Way Less

“Achieving equitable access to essential medicines requires a coherent health system response backed by strong political will, multisectoral cooperation, and people-centered programs that leave no one behind,” said Deusdedit Mubangizi, the WHO's director of policy and standards for medicines and health products, in a statement.

Canada is expected to become one of the first countries to approve generic versions of semaglutide as early as next year. The U.S., however, will likely wait until 2031 at the earliest.

Hah, I totally believe it. When I moved to the US on a K-1 fiancé visa, I stood in the non-immigrant line at LAX (moving at its usual glacial pace, well over an hour or more in line), only to be "told" that I was in the wrong line, because I was immigrating to the US (It's not: it's a non-immigrant visa with a defined path to immigration: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrat...).So after realizing I was arguing at a brick wall, I schlepped over to the (thankfully shorter, but still notable) immigrant visa line, waited, waited... with the absolutely predictable result that when I got to the counter I got a withering look and a tone that made it clear the agent felt she was speaking to a slow-minded child. "This is a non-immigrant visa. You need to go to that line." "I know, that line sent me here." "You need to go to that line." Thankfully that time I got a different agent. Nearly missed my connecting flight to Seattle, even though I had planned for a 4.5 hour layover for the visa process.

Not remotely likelyMuch more likely? 450 koreans working here legally but not carrying papers on them because american is supposed to be a free country.

reply

I am not an immigration judge or a prophet, so I don't know how every case will turn out, but 450 is a lot. It's enough that even if some are here legally, as would be expected since people are detained for reasonable suspicion not proof, it would still be hundreds of illegal immigrants.Most of the immigrants are not from South Korea, they're from central/south america. My understanding of the situation so far is that some South Koreans came here to manage the project, some on questionable visas themselves, and they hired hundreds of laborers (illegally). If you want to build a factory in the US you should follow the laws we have, you can't pick and choose which laws to follow.

ICE, by their own account, has a pretty solid track record now of arresting people en masse, to pump up numbers, and then sorting out who is actually working illegally much later… after dehumanizing and incarcerating people unjustly.So, i don't believe their numbers and i don't believe that they know who they have arrested.

When reporters asked DHS about that when they were crowing about their "roundup" of 900 or so workers. "That's not part of the scope of this.

Aiding someone in staying in the country without authorization? Felony. "Tough on crime", my ass.

If they came to the USA legally it's hard to understand how they didn't have the right to do things like consult on the build-out of the new factory.If anyone wants to argue the ESTA doesn't allow this (despite the explicit wording that it does) you're basically saying no more international business conferences and no more business trips to USA offices without a very heavy weight multiyear immigration process.Which is fine if you want to come out and suggest that. It'll kill what's left of Vegas, the airlines, conference centers, etc. It would also harm any international business in the USA but if you really really want to go around saying "ICE are right to detain the South Koreans here" I'm OK with that.

Similarly, Germany was the de facto enemy of the Ally aligned world in the 40s and only a few short decades later best friends with most.You can identify countless similar atrocities in US history after which relations stabilized within a few years.Most in life are short term oriented and it's rare that these things produce lasting effects on perception.Does anyone care or even remotely think about what Bush did as president 20 years ago?

I don't think that's a great example.  A few years after the bombs, Douglas MacArthur was ruling Japan.  They didn't have much of a choice. Japan was occupied for almost 7 years, had their constitution rewritten to make them essentially reliant on the US for security.

It's undeniable that by and large Japanese sentiment towards the US bounced back quickly, despite a traumatic and expansive war

Then Trump decided his shitty Nobel Prize mattered more and threw 20 years of hard work in the dump.The consensus in India is that America is perfidious. You claim that countries have goldfish memories, but that doesn't seem to be the case with Indo-American relations. It was immensely hard to build this relationship and easy to burn it.But who knows? Maybe you have an insight into how Indian people think.

The effects of this insular isolationism can only be explained by simplicity that doesn't hold up in reality: things will be more prosperous for us if we keep what we have to ourselves. But in truth growth is growth. To build prosperity, we need more production, which means more people. Perhaps your share gets bigger, but the pot gets smaller.

You are thinking of a tide that lifts all boats.The people supporting these policies don't want all boats to be lifted - they want prosperity for themselves and subjugation for anyone else.The power imbalance is the point.  Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.

"People coming here" is not inherently good or bad. Some people would be good for the country, and some people would be bad. I'm speaking of individuals here, not groups. The issue is that the electorate at large feels like it has been given a choice between two extremes: "Effectively allow ANYONE to come here and stay as long as they want" and "Don't let ANYONE come here". If you give a people a choice of two extremes, don't be surprised if they choose the extremism you don't like.Reconceptualize MAGA as voting AGAINST what the Democrats are offering, instead of FOR what Trump is offering, and it might make more sense.

The issue is trust. Why should voters trust that Kamala Harris will implement immigration policies they want? Why should they expect her not to yield to the most extreme elements in her party, which believe that borders are a fiction and should not exist? Look at Barack Obama's "evolution" on gay marriage over the course of his political career. Now take an issue that is far more important than gay marriage - how is she going to stop unlimited unskilled immigration? How is she going to stop fraudulent claims of refugee status? How is the whole immigration problem itself going to be solved, if you posit that every one of the 10 million "unauthorized immigrants", and every one of the refugee claimants, needs multiple appearances in court to resolve their situation?

It's a little more complicated than what you wrote, but basically: yes.[edit] Example study construction: pick some issue where there's been a heavy propaganda push against it from one party, but a law they opposed passed anyway. Ideally, something like a tax increase, that can directly affect voters in a way they might reasonably be expected to understand and know about. Observe that the (say) tax hike affects not more than 2% of the population you're studying. Survey. Observe that 35% or 40% of people say the new tax law increased their taxes, and very nearly all of them favor the party that opposed the hike and was claiming or implying it would affect more people than it did.Repeat similar studies over a period of decades, always with familiar outcomes. Draw conclusions.Separately, you can probe basic understanding of how our government & various policies or laws work. You'll find half of everyone not knowing how marginal income tax rates work, that almost all the people who think our foreign aid spending is way too high believe it's 10x, 20x, 30x higher than it actually is, et c. Generally speaking, voters hardly know how anything works, so of course they buy lies about it. That's not me being shitty, it's what the evidence overwhelmingly says is true. And this is far from an exhaustive treatment of alarming traits & behaviors of the electorate.

All most all the replies to your comment have nothing to do with the substance of what you said.

Ask any reMarkable E Ink tablet owner, and they will effuse about the mostly glare-free paper-like screen, many document templates, and notetaking experience that nearly mimics writing with pen and paper. People just adore their reMarkable devices. For the e-paper device maker's next act, it's going smaller with the Paper Pro Move, a more pocketable version of its Paper Pro color E Ink tablet with a smaller 7.3-inch display.

See reMarkable Paper Pro at Amazon

Priced at $449 and available today, Sept. 3, the Paper Pro Move has dimensions (7.7 x 4.24 inches) that more closely resemble a reporter's notebook. Even with my small palm, I could comfortably grip the Paper Pro Move in one hand and use the included Marker stylus to write on it. At 230g (0.51 pounds) and 6.5mm thick (0.26 inches thick), it also slipped easily into the chore jackets that I've been fond of lately.

It's a handsome device that works exactly like a smaller version of the Paper Pro. About the only thing that I find a turnoff is the thick, inch-ish tall bezel on the bottom of the 1,696 x 954 color E Ink display. While I got used to it over time, I wish the bezels were symmetrical and the Paper Pro Move even shorter. On the plus side, the density of the pixels is higher compared to the Paper Pro—264 PPI versus 229 PPI—which means content does appear just a smidge sharper. reMarkable says the Paper Pro Move can render the same 20,000 colors as the Paper Pro.

I'll have a full review of the Paper Pro Move when I've spent more time with the device, but so far, I've found it very convenient to have a pocketable e-paper tablet. It may just be the fact that I'm a journalist who has to jot down a lot of notes for product briefings and interviews, or that I seem to have a to-do list that keeps ballooning every day, so the Paper Pro Move fits into my workflow. While the Paper Pro Move is mostly a vertically oriented device, you can also use it horizontally if that's your cup of tea; the UI adapts to the widescreen position. However, I do think that there's a strong case to be made for the new reMarkable device if you prefer writing in Moleskines or Field Notes and you're looking for something just more digital.

The big sell for the Paper Pro Move isn't just that it'll replace a physical notepad and pen or pencil, but that you can do stuff like search your handwritten notes, convert handwriting into text, and manipulate drawings and doodles and whatnot. There's also a beta feature that lets you send a webpage to view on the Paper Pro Move, and AI software will strip out the images and even reformat with sub-headlines and stylizations like bolding. I got a preview of this AI reformatting, and while it's not perfect, it does make an ad-infested website more readable on the go, especially offline. The handwriting-to-text recognition is also hit or miss—even AI can't perfectly convert the worst chicken scratch. Sorry, doctors, your unreadable handwriting is probably still unreadable to artificial intelligence.

 

The Paper Pro Move comes with 64GB of storage, which is good for up to 810 digital notebooks, and is the same amount you get in the Paper Pro. Battery life is rated at up to two weeks, but that may be without the backlighting turned on. I need to double-check with reMarkable on that. reMarkable says that the device can charge from 0-90% in “less than 45 minutes.”

Again, I'll have more in-depth thoughts soon on performance and battery life, but I think there's a good niche for the Paper Pro Move. It's not going to be for everyone—get an iPad if you want a multipurpose tablet that does messaging, videos, games, music, and more—but it's definitely for somebody who wants a focused device for jotting stuff down and will pay for it. Because let's be real, you're less likely to write down your notes on the go if you need to pull out the larger Paper Pro from your backpack to do it. The Paper Pro Move with Marker costs $449, but there's also a bundle that includes the Marker Plus, which comes with an eraser on the end, for $499. reMarkable is also selling Folio cases in three different materials, starting at $69.

FarmHQ, an agtech startup based in rural Burlington, Wash., has raised $500,000 from investors to grow its irrigation technology business, bringing its total funding to nearly $5 million.

The company has blossomed with more than 200 customers in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Australia, and its revenue has more than doubled year-over-year. 

With the new funding, FarmHQ plans to expand its technology and services for farms that use center pivot irrigation, which is the most common sprinkler system but tricky to automate. The sprinklers create circular crop patterns visible when flying over agricultural areas. The startup also aims to nearly double its headcount to nine employees by the year's end.  

While FarmHQ is marking significant growth, it has also been navigating challenges created by new U.S. tariffs on China and Canada. The startup is seeking domestic supplies for some of the hardware components it previously sourced from China, but they often cost more or aren't available in the U.S., said co-founder and CEO David Wallace. 

On the sales side, Canadian farmers represent 18% of the company's business. That country has levied retaliatory tariffs against the U.S., making some customers to the north more reluctant to make purchases. 

The trade battles are creating “confusion and frustration,” Wallace said. 

Wallace and his brother Connor founded their company is 2020. The two grew up on the family's potato farm in Skagit Valley, but left for college and jobs with tech companies.

They turned their attention to agtech after seeing firsthand how physically demanding and resource inefficient it was to operate water irrigation systems. The sprinklers could malfunction and flood crops, and required farmers to regularly go into the fields to monitor and control the systems.

RELATED: Irrigation tech startup led by farming experts blossoms with revenue growth and new cash

The Wallaces launched CODA Farm Technologies, which rebranded last year to FarmHQ, to tackle the problem. Their technology regulates the water flow and shares irrigation data in real time to a smart phone dashboard. The platform can pair with a customer's existing sprinklers and be deployed on irrigation pumps, valves and flow meters.

Irrigation innovation could help the agricultural sector, which is getting hammered economically as costs rise and profits decline. In the U.S., that's being driven in large part by a labor shortage that has worsened as the Trump administration has pursued and arrested undocumented workers.

“Automation, digital transformation and workforce development are key strategies to address the labor shortage,” states a June 2025 report from FTI Consulting. “Companies must prioritize adopting technology, improving working conditions and fostering partnerships to drive innovation and efficiency.”

Additionally, water conservation is becoming increasingly important as the planet continues warming. In the U.S. alone, 36 states are currently in moderate to more severe droughts.

Wallace said customers are happy with FarmHQ's products and services, which includes perks like free replacements for sensors should they break. 

“Every grower wants the opportunity to evaluate the product for a season before they go all in,” he said, adding that most accounts are tripling their purchases after the first year. “We're happy we earn their trust quickly.”

Despite FarmHQ's success, the overall sector is bumpy. Agtech investments worldwide have been in steady decline since 2021, according to PitchBook data. Funding in the second quarter of this year totaled $1.5 billion, a 23% drop over the same period last year.

One of those rounds went to Verdi, a Vancouver, B.C., startup that announced $4.7 million in funding in May. The company is also tackling irrigation automation.

Isotopes AI came out of stealth on Thursday with a healthy $20 million seed round.

It offers an AI agent to solve a problem that data analytics products have struggled with for decades: The people who know how to run the big data infrastructure are not the ones who actually need to use the data.

With LLMs, business managers can ask questions of their data in natural language. Isotopes' agent, Aidnn, can provide answers and draft complex planning documents, gathering data from wherever it's stored, like finance apps, ERP, CRM, and cloud storage.

There are countless agentic business analytics offerings out there, but Isotopes' co-founders have a unique pedigree. Their product is so sophisticated, the startup has already applied for 10 patents, co-founder CEO Arun Murthy told TechCrunch.

Just over 20 years ago, when Murthy was in his mid-20s, he worked at Yahoo on the team that built an open source project called Hadoop. Hadoop spurred the initial Big Data frenzy of the 2010s. 

In 2011, Yahoo spun it out into a company called Hortonworks, with Murthy as co-founder and chief product officer. Just four years after launch, Hortonworks went public. But the rise of new cloud storage tech took its toll on Hadoop's market, and Hortonworks eventually merged with its biggest rival, Cloudera. The merged company was taken private in 2021 after famed activist investor Carl Icahn got involved.

Murthy went to Cloudera for a few years during that turmoil, managing about 200 people. Yet, he says, even there he saw the age-old data access problem. He remembers quarterly conference calls with Wall Street analysts grilling execs on operating details. 

They couldn't always answer because they didn't have access to the data. “It was embarrassing,” he admits now. “We were a big data company selling this.”

In 2021, he left that job with no real plan on what to do next, and a VC introduced him to Scale AI's Alexandr Wang. After a few chats with Wang and a bit of consulting work, Murthy joined Scale as chief technology officer. 

It was like “getting a PhD at Scale,” he describes. “Understanding what drives these models and how to improve them.” 

But when his old buddy from Hortonworks, Prasanth Jayachandran, called him, the two decided to do their own AI startup. They persuaded their third-cofounder, Gopal Vijayaraghavan, also from the Hortonworks days, to join them and in late 2024 founded Isotopes. Their seed round was led by Vab Goel at NTTVC. (Goel was previously at NorWest Ventures.)

The founders' backgrounds has allowed them to build an agent that can find data from wherever it is stored (be it Salesforce or Snowflake), but then also clean the data. The agent also maintains plenty of context memory to be useful for complex tasks.

“This is far beyond a simple chatbot,” Murthy said. For example, if the team is asking Aidnn to draft a report on monthly recurring revenue trends, “the data that you want to chat with actually doesn't exist, at least the form that you need to chat with. It's a multistep plan, a very complex plan: extract metadata, read the data, clean and normalize, join the data, prorate revenue, aggregate.”

The agent also shows its steps, reasoning, assumptions, and points to anomalies in the data. It will even make recommendations on how to proceed. Isotopes also promises that enterprise customers can deploy without sharing any of their data to the AI model makers powering the agent.

Still, as sophisticated as Isotopes may be, the startup faces plenty of competition. Incumbents like Salesforce's Tableau already offer agents (amid Salesforce's major AI agent push), and plenty of other startup founders with impressive pedigrees are in the market, too, such as WisdomAI.

Seattle startup founders are navigating a tricky mix of opportunity and challenges as they search for durable ways to scale. 

That's the word from entrepreneurs who stopped by our office Thursday for a fun summer deck party in Seattle's Fremont neighborhood. 

We spoke to startup leaders about fundraising, hiring, go-to-market, profitability, return-to-office policies, and what's keeping them up at night. They ranged from a founder who just launched her bootstrapped startup in the HR sector, to an engineering vet who just raised a Series B round for his logistics software company. 

Read on for quick key takeaways from our interviews. Big thanks to our longtime partner Davis Wright Tremaine and GeekWork recruiting partners Prime Team Partners for making the event possible.

Hiring

Several founders said they aren't having trouble finding talent, particularly in the Seattle region. “It's just still a great area to hire people,” said Tony Small, CEO at heyLibby, which raised $4.5 million this year for its AI sales and receptionist software.

Others noted the value of tapping into their networks to find new colleagues, or hiring people who were recently laid off. 

Filling specialized roles remain tough for some startups. “That requires a relaxing of our requirements for in-office and casting a wider net nationally,” said Milton Perque, CEO at radar tech startup Kapta Space, which raised $5 million earlier this year. 

RTO

Founders were split on their return-to-office policies. 

Some stressed the importance of in-person collaboration. “Being able to get on a whiteboard whenever, or just turn around and ask somebody a question — it's a huge unlock,” said Peter Williams, CEO at Muir AI, which raised $3.25 million in 2023.

Small said his team tried renting out co-working space but abandoned that plan given long commute times for different employees. “After two months it wasn't paying off,” he said. 

Anna Rodriguez, co-founder at heyLibby, added that it's a “huge advantage” to be able to hire across the globe, versus just in the Seattle area.

Fundraising

The funding environment feels like a tale of two worlds, said David Tsai, CTO at GoodShip — easier if you're a hot AI startup, harder for everyone else. 

GoodShip, a freight logistics software startup that just raised $25 million, found itself in the middle of that trend. 

“We didn't found the company with an AI mission, but we are finding ourselves to be in a strong position to apply AI to this problem space,” Tsai said.

Caitlin Rollman is just getting her talent management software startup, Talvita, off the ground. She's leaning toward bootstrapping to avoid wasting valuable time. 

“We'd have to really push very hard and spend a lot of energy to actually raise right now,” she said. “The amount of time it would take to raise would mean going and spending a month or two dedicated to raising, versus building the product. And if we build the product in a month or two or three, we can get to the point where we actually didn't even need the raise in the first place.”

Profitability vs. sales

Taylor Halliday, co-founder at Seattle help desk software startup Ravenna, is 100% focused on growth after raising $15 million in April.

“The focus is on proving that we are building something viable and [customers] are paying us,” he said. “There's no pressure around profitability.”

Williams of Muir AI shared the same sentiment. 

“We think the biggest impact that we can have for the world and our customers is to continue to grow the business as large as possible,” he said. “We're really focused on kind of pushing those metrics.”

Small said you can never assume a successful fundraising round is around the corner — so building a business that turns a profit is important.

“We want to grow really fast and get to our next round,” he said. “But we don't want to grow really fast and then run out of money in a year.”

Biggest challenges

Founders noted the broader economy and shifting federal government policies as potential challenges. 

Muir AI launched in 2022 as a sustainability startup, helping other companies curb their carbon footprints. It still has that mission but tweaked its pitch to focus on providing companies with ways to reduce supply chain costs.

“The macroenvironment has been interesting,” Williams said. “We've had to pivot along the way to make sure our business is going to be resilient with everything that's going on.”

Perque said he's watching how the Department of Defense is treating small startups such as Kapta Space. “The VCs want to see that the DoD has an appetite to work with smaller companies,” he said.

Halliday of Ravenna said his company is still searching for the perfect go-to-market messaging. 

Rollman of Talvita said speed itself is a worry. “How do we move fast is the thing that stresses me out,” she said.

Rodriguez of heyLibby said marketing may be more important as technology becomes less of a differentiator with the advent of AI tools. “Speed isn't necessarily a differentiator, but it's a way to win,” she said.

Tsai of GoodShip advised other founders to focus on building products that solve problems that customers will pay for — with both their time and money. 

“It's making sure that whatever you're doing, you're actually creating value — long-term value, in particular — from the resources you're deploying and not just chasing the optics,” he said.

Superman director James Gunn is doubling down on his recent Instagram post where he said that the second season of Peacemaker is essentially the “prequel” to upcoming Man of Steel sequel Man of Tomorrow.

Responding to a fan on the platform, Gunn reiterated that the season finale of the current Peacemaker series will lead “directly” into Man of Tomorrow, despite the fact that three other DCU projects—Supergirl, Lanterns, and Clayface—will all come out in-between.

Peacemaker‘s highly-acclaimed second season sees the character exploring an alternate universe via his personal collection of inter-dimensional doorways inherited from his late, white supremacist father who built his own personal TARDIS for extra storage space while also being actively hunted by Rick Flag, Sr. wanting vengeance for killing his son in Suicide Squad. 

How exactly that will tee up the don't-call-it-a-sequel sequel to Gunn's Superman, we don't know. But given Peacemaker‘s many-layered plot, there'll certainly be a surplus of material to pull from. It does however raise an interesting question: Will audiences have to actually see Peacemaker—a big ask for some, given the show's wanton hardcore violence, full-frontal nudity, offensive language, and existence on a boutique streaming platform—before they can enjoy Man of Tomorrow?

Almost certainly not, right? There really has yet to be a tie-in series to a superhero franchise that necessitated actually watching them before the next theatrical movie. Marvel's tie-in shows on Disney+ have rather infamously reset themselves to status quo before their final episodes air: Loki was dead at the beginning of his series and remains dead by the end of it. Wanda Maximoff is grieving the death of Vision at the beginning of WandaVision, and despite her efforts, sets out to destroy reality in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Agatha Harkness is brainwashed at the end of WandaVision, and is stone cold dead by the end of Agatha All Along. A new Captain America threatens to replace the Falcon in The Falcon and Winter Soldier, but a few lines of dialogue in Thunderbolts confirms that didn't happen. Ditto Isaiah Washington's reappearance in Captain America: Brave New World. Gunn's own Creature Commandos also didn't end up baring any weight on the narrative flow of Superman… so no, you likely won't need to see Peacemaker before Man of Tomorrow.

However, the suggestion that you might want to in order to fully get the movie is certainly impish if you have a kid who's really into Superman. Gunn likely watched a lot of inappropriate, R-rated material as a kid—and look how he turned out! At its core Peacemaker is about an unstable man-child with an over-developed sense of justice learning to become a slightly better, slightly more balanced person, while also retaining that sense of justice so it can be put to better use. Isn't that basically Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood?

Whatever the case, your kids are likely already watching way weirder shit on Youtube.

Man of Tomorrow is currently slated for a July 9, 2027 release date, while Peacemaker season two is currently airing on HBO Max.

Tesla's board is asking shareholders to sign off on a massive, unprecedented pay package that could turn its CEO, Elon Musk, who is already the world's richest man, into the first trillionaire.

If the plan is approved, Musk would need to reach several performance benchmarks over the next 10 years to get the full payout.

The board said in a securities filing on Friday that the pay package's primary goal is to retain “Mr. Musk to lead Tesla through its next phase of transformational growth.” In other words, the board wants Musk's full attention on Tesla. But Musk, who's been running the company since 2008, is also juggling four other ventures: SpaceX, xAI, Neuralink, and the Boring Company.

Musk's ruinous forays into politics have also hurt Tesla's brand. In 2024, he endorsed Donald Trump for president, poured millions into Trump's campaign, and led a shakeup of the federal government via the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk's politics triggered backlash that included incidents of arson and vandalism at Tesla stores and charging stations. Meanwhile, Tesla logged two of its worst quarters in years, with global vehicle deliveries down 13%. In Europe, sales are especially dire.

The new pay proposal follows a Delaware judge's decision to block Musk's previous $55 billion compensation plan from 2018, siding with shareholders who said the deal was unfairly approved. Tesla has appealed the ruling. And in August, the company offered Musk about $29 billion in stock if he agreed to stick around for two more years.

Under the new plan, Musk could be awarded up to 423 million shares, worth about $143 billion at today's prices and equal to roughly 12% of Tesla's stock. Musk already owns about 13% of the company. To cash in, he has to stay on as CEO or hold another executive office and hit a series of production and market-cap milestones.

The award is split into 12 tranches. The first unlocks if Tesla's market cap, currently hovering around $1 trillion, doubles to $2 trillion. The next nine tranches require an extra $500 billion each, and the final two require a trillion-dollar jump each.

For Musk to take home the full payout, Tesla would need to hit a market value of $8.5 trillion within the next decade, about eight times higher than its current assessment. That would make Musk's stock haul worth more than $1 trillion.

The plan also ties his payout to some ambitious operational goals, including delivering 20 million vehicles, putting a million robotaxis on the road, and rolling out a million Optimus humanoid robots.

You have to travel across the world to find just how Americans are devoid of choice for interesting phones. At IFA 2025, I went hands-on with Tecno's Slim phone—or at least I tried to hold onto its incredibly thin frame. It's an apt name for such an irregular phone, one that has me asking whether Samsung and—potentially—Apple need to rethink what people really want from frisbee-light phones.

China-based Tecno has a penchant for weird mobile devices. The company recently revealed a Phantom Ultimate G Fold tri-fold concept phone that wraps around itself, like the letter “G.” The Tecno Slim, on the other hand, is a real product that people in Asia and Europe can buy, but folks in the U.S. are still out of luck. There are two versions of the Slim, a 4G “Spark Slim” version that's 5.93mm and a 5G “Pova Slim” model at 5.95mm. Those numbers are largely meaningless compared to actually having the device in hand. Not to put too fine a point on it, but it may be the thinnest mobile phone that I've held. There's just a few millimeters distance from the edge to the bottom USB-C port. The waterfall-type screen, where the edges slope down toward the back, adds to the sensation that I'm holding a thin pane of glass rather than a traditional smartphone.

The $1,100 Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is 5.8mm thick, so it's still winning in terms of pure thinness. The difference between the two is the Tecno Slim doesn't give up much in pursuit of a thin frame. It has an AMOLED display with a 1.5K resolution and a blistering 144Hz refresh rate (Apple, eat your heart out). Despite its light feel, it still packs a 5,160mAh battery that allows for 45W fast charging. The S25 Edge packs a 3,900mAh battery. Rumors for Apple's ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air suggest the device could also sacrifice battery life on the altar of pocketability.

Tecno promises users will net between 24 and 28 hours of battery life. Tecno also claims it's figured out thermal issues with a 0.3mm-thick vapor chamber. And to top it off, the Slim is surprisingly cute, too. The rear camera cutout looks like a googly-eyed face. Depending on what actions you take, the rear lights might blink or wink at you. Imagine if the lights on Nothing's latest phones before the Phone 3 had a little bit more personality.

The two major discrepancies between the Slim and other modern phones are the cameras and chip. The Spark Slim uses a Helio G200 while the Pova Slim is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6400 5G+—a lower-to-mid-range chip. These are not going to be the fastest, most capable phones around. It's also an Android 15-based device, which—depending on your appreciation for Material 3 Expressive—is either a point for or against the thin phone.

Every design will have its tradeoffs. Tecno's device will be worse off if you prioritize phone performance and camera capabilities. The Slim will be available sometime soon, Tecno told me, though there's no pricing information just yet.

Lenovo has announced a true successor to the Legion Go. The Legion Go 2 still has an 8.8-inch display and detachable controllers, but adds the new AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor, up to 32GB of RAM, hall effect joysticks, and more.

The design is very similar to the prototype shown at CES earlier this year, but now we know much more.

The display has dropped down to 1920 x 1200 from 2560 x 1600 on the original model. This makes enough sense, considering the majority of modern AAA games couldn't run at that high resolution. Lenovo is making up for the lost pixels by using an OLED touchscreen with a variable refresh rate of 30 Hz - 144 Hz.

Processor

Up to AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme (8 cores / 16 threads)

Graphics

Up to AMD Radeon 890M graphics (integrated)

Memory

Up to 32GB LPDDR5X-8000

Storage

Up to 2TB M.2 2242 PCIe Gen 4 SSD

Display

8.8-inch, 1920 x 1200, OLED, 144 Hz, touch

Battery

74 WHr

Ports

2x USB Type-C, 3.5 mm headphone jack, microSD card reader

Dimensions

System with controllers: 11.64 x 5.38 x 1.66 inches (295.6 x 136.7 x 42.25 mm)  Without controllers: 8.11 x 5.38 x 0.90 inches (206 x 136.7 x 22.95 mm)

Connectivity

Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3

Starting Price

$1,049.00

Release Date

October 2025

Additionally, Lenovo is offering up to 2TB of storage on board, with a microSD card slot that can support another 2TB. The battery is also getting a boost to 74 WHr, from 49.2 WHr on the original.

To fit all of this, and the requisite cooling, Lenovo has made the Legion Go 2 quite thick. Without the controllers, it's 0.9 inches thick, up from 0.79 inches. Add the controllers, and it's 1.66 inches thick. With the controllers attached, the system weighs 2.03 pounds (up from the 1.88-pound original).

Lenovo claims that the detachable TrueStrike controllers are "more ergonomic" with a "smoother" feel and a "smarter" button layout. They definitely look less bulky, but we'll need to get more hands-on time with them to say for sure.

 




The controllers now have Hall effect joysticks that should prevent drift, and a redesigned D-Pad sits on a pivot disk. They also feature three customizable buttons through Legion Space and still feature the "FPS mode" from the previous generation, letting you use the right controller like a vertical mouse.The right controller still has a touchpad, but there is not a corresponding one on the left side.

The ports haven't changed — Lenovo still offers two USB Type-C ports (one on top and one on the bottom), a microSD card slot on the bottom, and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. Now, the power button has a fingerprint reader for faster login.The Legion Go 2 is set to launch in October, starting at $1,049.00. That's quite a bit more than the original Legion Go, which launched at $749.99 in 2023. If you want something cheaper from Lenovo, you may need to opt for the Legion Go S.

Lenovo also announced its new LOQ Tower 26ADR10, a 26-liter system using AMD's Ryzen 7 8745HX mobile processor and Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs, up to an RTX 5070 Ti.

 




The LOQ tower can be configured with up to 64GB of RAM (DDR5-5600 SODIMMs) and up to 4TB of SSD storage, as well as up to an 850 W power supply. The system also features two HDD expansion slots to add even more storage.

The LOQ desktop is set to launch this month, starting at $999.99.

Lenovo knows how to impress. Its IFA concepts can rotate or follow you around.

Lenovo is not a company that likes to play it safe when it comes to its products. It consistently pushes the boundaries of what form factors are possible with its products, as seen in the eye-catching ThinkPad Plus G6, which features a rollable screen.

As Lucas Rossi, Executive Vice President of Lenovo and President of the Intelligent Devices Group, told us in a roundtable discussion at IFA, "I think we have the credit for the company that takes more risks. Meaning, we try, we experiment, and there are… projects that never see the light. But many times, the experiments that fail seed for the experiment that makes it happen."

Lenovo showed off its first foldable laptop concept in 2017. At the time, the ideas and technology behind that foldable project couldn't immediately be incorporated into a production product. However, the intellectual property would eventually find its way into the Moto Razr smartphone, "which is now selling in the millions," according to Rossi.

With that in mind, it's possible that we'll see the fruits of Lenovo's labor with the ThinkBook VertiFlex Concept and Smart Motion Concept in future products.

With a few exceptions, the aspect ratio of a laptop's display is fixed. In modern laptops, you'll find laptop displays that usually have a 16:9, 16:10, or 3:2 aspect ratio in a landscape orientation.

However, the ThinkBook VertiFlex, which leaked last week as “Project Pivo,” features a 14-inch display that can rotate without you needing to stow the keyboard (like a 2-in-1 convertible). Instead, the lid contains a pivot point that allows the screen to rotate from its standard landscape orientation to portrait mode. And there are no motors involved. You just grab the corner of the screen and pull it up until it pivots into vertical mode.

 




Lenovo says that this capability for an on-demand portrait mode allows the display to become more ergonomic, letting you see more text on the screen when editing documents or displaying code. The portrait mode also comes in handy when mirroring your smartphone to your laptop using Lenovo's Smart Connect software. Then, when you want to watch a movie or play a game, you just pivot the screen back into its default landscape orientation.

The switch (in software) from landscape to portrait is instantaneous, and the ThinkBook VertiFlex is still in ultrabook territory, weighing just 3.06 pounds with a thickness of just 0.7 inches. That's not as thin or light as the best ultraportable laptops, but it's not too far off.

 




Computer docks are usually pretty dull. Typically, they're in a long rectangular or stubby book-shaped form factor and sit on your desk to connect your various peripherals, laptops, and storage devices. The Smart Motion Concept still has that standard dock functionality, with the usual assortment of USB, video, and Ethernet ports, but it also serves as a stand for your laptop.

But Lenovo adds a dash of AI to its Smart Motion Concept by using your laptop's built-in webcam and a motorized gimbal system to track your head movements and alter the position of your laptop, in conjunction with the stand, to keep it at the peak of ergonomic efficiency using a motorized gimbal system. The dock can even take input from your laptop's microphones to track where your voice is coming from when you're speaking.

 




It's eerie to see the Smart Motion Concept working in person as it turns and adjusts its height as you move from side to side or up and down. In practice, it works similarly to last year's Lenovo Auto Twist AI PC concept. But building this functionality into a dock makes more sense, since you won't have to toss out all those expensive motors and the motion tracking when it's time to upgrade to a new laptop.

There's no guarantee that either the ThinkBook VertiFlex Concept or the Smart Motion Concept will make it to production. However, compared to some of the more outlandish concepts we've seen in the past, both concepts should have relatively little resistance in the on the potential path to production and a product you can actually buy.

The Louvre, one of the greatest art museums in the world—home to the Mona Lisa—has an uneasy relationship with its neighbor, the River Seine. In 2016, the Louvre's curators rushed to relocate priceless artworks after the Seine, which flows through Paris, breached its banks in a flood. That's far from the only time floodwaters exacerbated by climate change have threatened the museum. It happened again, for example, in 2018.

But the Louvre also depends on the Seine. For the fickle river helps the museum maintain cool temperatures and humidity levels conducive to the long-term preservation of centuries-old art. It's possible thanks to a sprawling network of pipes, pumps, and cooling machines that connect to the Seine. Hundreds of Parisian buildings rely on this network—but none more than the Louvre.

“For the district cooling, it's the biggest client that we have,” says Raphaëlle Nayral, secretary general of Fraîcheur de Paris, the company that runs the cooling system. An average-size office building draws about half a megawatt of cooling power, whereas the Louvre soaks up 12 megawatts, Nayral explains.

Paris' cooling network is one of just a few around the world that make use of bodies of water within, or near to, towns and cities. Water is 800 times denser than air, so using it to soak up heat can be extremely efficient. Plus, unlike traditional air conditioners, water-based cooling avoids dumping heat into the air directly outside a building, which heightens the temperature of built-up areas relative to their surroundings, known as the urban heat island effect.

While river- and lake-fed cooling networks are growing in Paris, Toronto, and the US, for example, there are headaches on the horizon. As the world warms, buildings are demanding more and more cooling—plus, some bodies of water are getting so hot in the summer that their usefulness for cooling purposes is dwindling. District cooling networks may seem an innovative response to climate change but, all the same, climate change could push some of these systems to their limits.

As the water temperature of the Seine rises as a result of climate change, its cooling potential diminishes.

“In the old days, it was more like a luxury project,” says Deo de Klerk, team lead for heating and cooling solutions at the Dutch energy firm Eneco. Today, his company's clients increasingly ask for district cooling as well as district heating systems. Eneco has 33 heating and cooling projects under construction. In Rotterdam, Netherlands, one of the company's installations helps to cool buildings, including apartment blocks, police offices, a theater and restaurants, using water from the River Meuse.

It's not hard to see why cooling technologies are getting more popular. A few years ago, Nayral moved out of Paris. She remembers the heat waves. “My routine during the weekend was to go to the parks,” she says. Nayral would sit there well into the evening—reading Les Misérables, no less—waiting for her apartment to cool down. Recently, she has increasingly found herself spending time in shopping malls, where air-conditioning is plentiful, in order to make it through searing hot French summers. This year, unprecedented heat waves hit France and other countries in Europe.

The city of Paris is now desperate to help its denizens find cool refuges during spells of extreme heat. A key component of Parisian climate adaptation plans is the river-supplied cooling network, the pipes for which currently cover a distance of 100 kilometers, though this is due to expand to 245 km by 2042. While around 800 buildings are served by the network today, those in charge aim to supply 3,000 buildings by that future date.

Systems such as Paris' do not pump river water around properties. Rather, a loop of pipework brings river water into facilities where it soaks up warmth from a separate, closed loop of water that connects to buildings. That heat transfer is possible thanks to devices called heat exchangers. When cooled water in the separate loop later arrives at buildings, more heat exchangers allow it to cool down fluid in pipes that feed air-conditioning devices in individual rooms. Essentially, heat from, say, a packed conference room or tourist-filled art gallery is gradually transferred—pipe by pipe—to a river or lake.

The efficiency of Paris' system varies throughout the year, but even at the height of summer, when the Seine is warm, the coefficient of performance (COP)—how many kilowatt-hours of cooling energy you get for every kilowatt-hour of electricity consumed by the system—does not dip much below 4. In the winter, when offices, museums, and hospitals still require some air-conditioning, the COP can be as high as 15, much higher than conventional air-conditioning systems. “It is absolutely magnificent,” boasts Nayral.

But those summer temperatures are increasingly a concern. This summer, the Seine briefly exceeded 27 degrees Celsius (81 degrees Fahrenheit), says Nayral. How can that cool anything? The answer is chiller devices, which help to provide additional cooling for the water that circulates around buildings. Instead of blowing out hot air, those devices can expel their heat into the Seine via the river loop. The opportunity to keep doing this is narrowing, though—because Fraîcheur de Paris is not allowed to return water to the Seine at temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius, for environmental reasons. At present, that means the river can accommodate only a few additional degrees of heat on the hottest days. Future, stronger heat waves could evaporate more of that overhead.

“We will have to make a decision. Can we run the chillers at a higher temperature range, so we can still have a heat exchange with the River Seine—or do we want to develop other facilities?” says Nayral. Those other facilities could include underground reservoirs of cool water. My suggestion of deepening or otherwise altering the Seine to increase the volume of water in it, potentially helping it to maintain lower temperatures, is politely rebuffed, however. “The banks of the river Seine are protected by UNESCO,” says Nayral.

I ask the question, however, because there are some district cooling networks that rely on much deeper water—which is consistently cool all year round. One example is the lake-source cooling system used by Cornell University in upstate New York. “People are so proud of this project,” says Fengqi You, professor in energy systems engineering at the university. Cornell's network pumps water from the gigantic Lake Cayuga nearby, accessing it at a depth of 76 meters. The water there is as cold as a fridge, barely reaching 4 degrees Celsius at any time of year. So effective is this system that it can provide about 98 percent of the annual cooling load required by 113 buildings on Cornell's campus.

This network does use some mechanical refrigeration, but it has an overall COP of around 20, says Cole Tucker, interim associate vice president for energy and sustainability at Cornell: “So, I mean, it's pretty incredible.” However, even Tucker acknowledges that rising temperatures mean the demand for cooling is rising, and this will increase the university's reliance on mechanical chillers.

Separately, the Canadian energy firm Enwave has recently boosted the capacity of a district cooling network in the city of Toronto. Like Cornell's, this network also relies on cold lake water harvested at a considerable depth: 83 meters. “There really aren't many systems like this globally,” says Carson Gemmill, vice president of solutions and innovation at Enwave. The water removed from the lake actually goes on to become drinking water at a treatment plant in this case. After being treated, the water picks up heat from city buildings when it intersects with heat exchangers and the urban cooling loop. “We just warm up that drinking water a little bit,” says Gemmill, noting that only heat is transferred—there's no risk of contaminating the drinking water somehow.

Toronto's network serves roughly 100 buildings at present, including hospitals, city buildings, commercial offices, and residential properties. Beefy tunnel-boring machines working beneath the city have allowed the system to expand over time. Gemmill explains that new pipes carrying cool water were placed within a concrete floor at the base of these specially constructed tunnels, which are around 3 to 4 meters in diameter.

Using large bodies of water as giant heat sinks makes sense, given how much heat they can absorb, says Martin Hendel, a researcher at ESIEE Paris, an engineering school within Gustave Eiffel University. However, district cooling networks including Paris' can be expensive to install and maintain—meaning they work best in densely populated areas such as cities where large numbers of people will likely benefit from them. “These things are usually built for areas that have a lot of office space,” adds Hendel. “Office space tends to be cooled all year round.” That's partly in response to the heat generated by servers and computer equipment.

Nayral acknowledges that expanding Paris' cooling network is tricky. France's capital is drenched in history—so digging in new infrastructure is often slowed by the requirement to allow archaeologists time to excavate any potentially important artifacts. This was also the case for London's newest subterranean railway, the Elizabeth Line, originally known as Crossrail.

But Nayral points out that, in some areas, Paris' network makes use of the large old tunnels of the city's sewer system. There's enough room to sling the cooling network's pipes into these, she explains.

If the network is to expand as intended and more than double in just 17 years, then the engineers working on it will need to use every avenue, or tunnel, available to them. The need is serious—extreme heat is killing people in Paris and other cities. “In past centuries, access to heat was really a social gap between rich and poor,” says Nayral, noting that, today, it is perhaps access to cool spaces that increasingly divides us. But that's where municipalities can step in. “This is the job of cities,” says Nayral, “to provide shelter.”

Smart glasses are pretty exciting right now, not just because they're increasingly popular, but because they're not quite mainstream yet, which means companies are still allowed to get very weird with them. It's in that nascent zone of experimentation that you get some interesting stuff, and that definitely includes Inmo's Air 3 AR glasses.

There are lots of cool / quirky things about Inmo's Air 3—which announced a Kickstarter as a part of IFA 2025—but my favorite thing is that it tackles one of the most vexing issues with AR glasses as they stand: the UI. To control the Inmo Air 3, the smart glasses come with a smart ring that acts as a button, a touchpad, a mouse, and it also helps track the movement of virtual objects in the display. It reminds me of what Meta is likely cooking up with its pair of smart glasses (a wristband that reads your body's electrical signals), but with a lower footprint.

The other major highlight of these smart glasses is that, with the help of a micro OLED display from Sony, the Air 3 are not only full-color, but they're 1080p and have up to 600 nits of brightness. It's a relatively small field of view at 36 degrees, but it covers 100% sRGB, which is a far cry from competitors like Rokid Glasses that only show overlays in a Matrix-like green color. On paper, these smart glasses are equipped to do everything you wish you could do with Meta's Ray-Bans, and with those extra capabilities, Inmo is planning a lot.

One thing Inmo envisions is lots of 2D apps that you can use in your smart glasses for things like doomscrolling X or Snapchat, if that's a thing that people still use. There's a built-in Google Play store, so pretty much anything you could download on there should be possible to use in the Air 3, which runs Android 14. One of the most compelling use cases is using the smart glasses as a virtual screen. Similar to competitors in the space like BigScreen, Inmo envisons its smart glasses as a way of gluing a big screen on your eyeballs—the Air 3 translates to a 150-inch screen, according to the company.

To do all of those things, Inmo is loading the Air 3 up with a Qualcomm Snapdragon XR processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, which it says should enable up to three “independent floating virtual screens.” There's also a 16-megapixel ultrawide camera for pictures and computer vision, and an array of mics and speakers so you can use a voice assistant or listen to audio playback.

My biggest questions are the same as any pair of AR glasses that claim to do all this stuff. One is battery life; according to Inmo, the Air 3 has a 660mAh battery, though it doesn't give figures on how that translates to battery life. The other thing is weight, and Inmo hasn't shared figures in that department, so I'm going to go ahead and assume these weigh a great deal more than less capable competitors from Rokid or Meta.

Either way, the Air 3 is doing some interesting stuff, especially in terms of UI and display, and whether or not any of it pans out, it's hard not to appreciate the exercise in “how the f**k are we going to make smart glasses work?” Inmo's Kickstarter officially launches on Sept. 15, and its Air 3 glasses will cost $899.

There's a powerful and unexpected frontier where artificial intelligence is making a critical impact, and it's not a place you might expect. While we're familiar with AI's use in everything from product recommendations to self-driving cars, it has an important, and often overlooked, role in correctional facilities.

In most industries, AI is viewed through the lens of efficiency and growth. However, bringing advanced technology into a sensitive environment, like prisons and jails, where safety and human ethics intersect sparks a different conversation. In correctional facilities, AI's purpose is far more profound. It is a matter of safety, public trust, and social responsibility. For this reason, the conversation around AI in corrections must move to the forefront as a critical strategic imperative.

When applied responsibly, AI in corrections delivers three essential benefits: safer facilities, more efficient operations, and better rehabilitation outcomes.

Before AI, secure technology like purpose-built tablets was already transforming correctional facilities. These aren't just gadgets; corrections staff tell us the secure, controlled devices help replace idle time with purpose. They provide individuals with educational content, vocational training, mental health resources, and connections they need to change their lives. This shift has led to more manageable and calmer facilities, benefiting staff and the incarcerated.

AI is the next great leap forward in creating scalable safety and rehabilitative impact. Consider how it has transformed other industries, from rapidly identifying cybersecurity threats to flagging real-time financial fraud. In corrections, AI applies these same principles to one of the most complex and sensitive environments in our society, bringing unprecedented levels of safety, efficiency, and rehabilitation.

AI-powered tools provide a new layer of support for officers on the ground, helping them create a safer environment for everyone. Predictive analytics, for instance, can analyze patterns in digital communication to identify potential conflicts before they escalate. This functions as an early-warning system to give officers the crucial time and context they need to de-escalate situations, enhancing their judgment with data and insights that can protect the incarcerated community.

In a field facing persistent staffing shortages, AI also addresses a crucial need for improved efficiency. Much like AI's ability to systematize patient data entry in hospitals, where nurses are freed up for more personal care, AI can automate repetitive administrative tasks in prisons and jails. This shift allows correctional officers to repurpose time on office-based duties and get back to the front lines where their human skills are needed most. By dedicating more time to social and psychological support, officers can focus on safety and programming with incarcerated individuals, which directly improves morale and overall security within the facility.

Ultimately, AI is not a replacement for human judgment; it offers augmented intelligence across a field and profession, where the human element is and always will be the most critical component. Technology can process and distribute massive amounts of information faster than any person, alerting well-trained officers to potential threats. This allows them to apply their nuanced understanding, empathy, and discretion. When AI detects non-compliant communication or behaviors, officers can interpret unspoken dynamics, build trust, and make decisions that no digital tool can.

By approaching AI with both optimism and a commitment to responsible use, we can harness its strengths to augment the human judgment that ensures fairness and accountability. Responsible use means setting clear boundaries on how AI is applied, making sure it supports human decisions rather than replacing them, that data is used transparently, and that safeguards are in place to prevent bias or misuse.

This technology is a powerful enhancer, amplifying the capabilities of those trusted to keep our communities safe. The most secure path forward is one in which innovation and human insight work in tandem. It's about leveraging the best of technology to empower the best of humanity, ultimately creating safer communities, reducing taxpayer costs, and building a stronger system for everyone.

Lenovo isn't shy about trying new things. Last year, the PC maker teased a concept laptop with a transparent screen. Earlier this year, the ThinkBook Flip concept employed a flexible OLED display that folded over the top of the laptop lid, ready to flip up whenever you needed the extra screen space. At CES 2025, we saw a ThinkBook with a rollable OLED screen that expanded upward automatically at the touch of a button—this one is a real product you can actually buy.

Get ready for another whacky concept. At IFA 2025, the tech exhibition in Berlin, Lenovo unveiled its latest idea: the Lenovo ThinkBook VertiFlex. This is a laptop with a screen that can manually swivel from a standard horizontal orientation to vertical.

By default, the ThinkBook VertiFlex Concept looks like a normal 14-inch laptop. Look closely at the screen's edge, however, and you'll see a second layer jutting out; that's the actual screen. Grab the right corner edge of the screen and push it upward, and the display will smoothly swivel up into a vertical orientation.

The back panel the screen is mounted on has a felt backing to keep everything smooth and scratch-free, and you can even prop a phone up here in this orientation. There's a mechanism inside that manages the motion and keeps it operating smoothly. Despite this, the PC is still fairly slim at 17.9 mm, and it weighs roughly 3 pounds. (The 14-inch MacBook Pro is around 15 mm thick and weighs 3.4 pounds.)

I use a dual-screen setup with one vertical monitor next to my main ultrawide monitor at home. Having a vertical screen is a game-changer, as it's perfect for applications that utilize more vertical space. Email is a great example, so are apps like Slack, anything to do with PDFs, and even most word processing software. But I've yet to change my screen orientation in the middle of a workflow.

With the VertiFlex, the idea is that I'd use the standard laptop screen when watching a video or browsing the web, and then switch it to portrait orientation when I need to work on a document or am responding to teammates in Slack. Unlike some of Lenovo's more recent concepts, this one isn't adding more screen space, just changing how you use the laptop. The good thing is that there's no real delay going from one orientation to another, so it'll be interesting to see how this impacts day-to-day use and if it will improve the way we work or hamper it.

As usual, Lenovo says the VertiFlex is a concept but could be a real product. Lenovo has previously turned some of its concepts into purchasable products, like the $3,500 ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable, so don't be too surprised to see the VertiFlex hit store shelves at some point. Since it doesn't require a flexible OLED screen that folds or rolls, the cost could be significantly lower than some of these other devices, which is always a plus.

The VertiFlex isn't the only concept Lenovo showed off. Imagine a laptop stand that swivels around on a base, following your face. That's what the Lenovo Smart Motion Concept is all about.

It's a laptop stand equipped with motors that can raise whatever laptop rests on top, lower it, and swivel it around so that the screen is always facing you. It can do all of this motion by tracking your face via the webcam, or via a ring you wear that supports gesture controls. It's likely not something Lenovo is considering for the average home, more so for businesses where a user needs to move around a workstation, but also access a laptop at a moment's notice. The stand also doubles as a docking station, with multiple ports at the base to connect various peripherals.

The rest of Lenovo's IFA announcements are not as eye-catching, a mix of spec bumps for specific laptops or other minor updates to existing devices, like the new Glacier White color for the ThinkPad X9. There are a handful of new products, though. Lenovo announced two new midrange and budget Android tablets, the Yoga Tab ($550) and the Idea Tab Plus ($270), not to mention Lenovo's first-ever 26-liter gaming tower, the LOQ Tower 26ADR10 ($1,000), and a 4K 31.5-inch OLED monitor with a 240-Hz screen refresh rate—the Legion Pro 32UD-10 ($1,100).

Lenovo also shared more concrete availability and pricing details of its hyped-up Legion Go 2 gaming handheld, which it first revealed at CES 2025. This Windows 11-based handheld will start at $1,049 for the base model, and sales will kick off in October. That's a $449 price bump from the original, though this newer version sports a bigger OLED display with a 144-Hz refresh rate, has Hall effect joysticks, and a bigger battery capacity.

And there's another good reason why so many real-world signals are sparse (as you say) in the FT domain in particular: because so many real-world systems involve periodic motion (rotating motors, fly's wings as you noted, etc). When the system is periodic, the FT will compress the signals very effectively because every signal has to be harmonic of the fundamental frequency.

Well, stable systems are can either be stationary or oscillatory. If the world didn't contain so many stable systems, or equivalently if the laws of physics didn't allow so, then likely life would not have existed. All life is complex chemical structures, and they require stability to function. Ergo, by this anthropic argument there must be many oscillatory systems.

Ordinary differential equations can describe any system with a finite number of state variables that change continuously (as opposed to instantaneously jumping from one state to another without going through states in between) and as a function of the system's current state (as opposed to nondeterministically or under the influence of the past or future or some kind of supernatural entity).Partial differential equations extend this to systems with infinite numbers of variables as long as the variables are organized in the form of continuous "fields" whose behavior is locally determined in a certain sense—things like the temperature that Fourier was investigating, which has an infinite number of different values along the length of an iron rod, or density, or pressure, or voltage.It turns out that a pretty large fraction of the phenomena we experience do behave this way.  It might be tempting to claim that it's obvious that the universe works this way, but that's only because you've grown up with the idea and never seriously questioned it.  Consider that it isn't obvious to anyone who believes in an afterlife, or to Stephen Wolfram (who thinks continuity may be an illusion), or to anyone who bets on the lottery or believes in astrology.But it is at least an excellent approximation that covers all phenomena that can be predicted by classical physics and most of quantum mechanics as well.As a result, the Fourier and Laplace transforms are extremely broadly applicable, at least with respect to the physical world.  In an engineering curriculum, the class that focuses most intensively on these applications is usually given the grandiose title "Signals and Systems".

We have discovered a method (calculus) to mathematcally describe continuous functions of various sorts and within calculus there is a particular toolbox (differential and partial differential equations) we have built to mathematically describe systems that are changing by describing that change.The fact that systems which change are well-described by the thing we have made to describe systems which change shouldn't be at all surprising. We have been working on this since the 18th century and Euler and many other of the smartest humans ever devoted considerable effort to making it this good.When you look at things like the chaotic behaviour of a double pendulum, you see how the real world is extremely difficult to capture precisely and as good as our system is, it still has shortcomings even in very simple cases.

A learning that describes chaos well enough may not want to be associated with "calculus", or even "math" (ask a friendly reverse mathematician about that)https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2021/04/09/period-three-impli...Somewhat tangentially, if Ptolemy I had responded (to Euclid) with anything less specific ---but much more personal--- than "check your postulate", we wouldn't have had to wait one millennium.(Fermat did the best he could given margin & ego, so that took only a century or so (for that country to come up with a workable strategy))Less tangentially, I'd generalize Quigley by mentioning that groups of hominids stymie themselves with a kind of emergent narcissism. After all, heuristics,rules and even values informed by experience & intuition are a sort of arrogance. "Tautology" should be outlawed in favour of "Narcissism" as a prosocial gaslighting term :)

I would say that the it's very difficult to imagine a world that would not be governed by differential equations. So it's not just that life wouldn't exist it's that there wouldn't be anything like the laws of physics.As a side note chaotic systems are often better analysed in the FT domain, so even in a world of chaotic systems (and there are many in our world, and I'd argue that if there wasn't life would not exist either) the FT remains a powerful tool

In practice this is probably true, but I can see another possibility. The system could follow a trajectory that bounces around endlessly in some box without ever repeating or escaping the box.

For example, the concept of homeostasis in biology is like this. Lots of things are happening inside the living body, but it's still effectively at a functional equilibrium.Similarly, lots of dynamic things are happening inside the Sun (or any star), but from the perspective of Earth, it is more or less stationary, because the behavior of the sun won't escape some bounds for billions of years.

And also, just because an employee is producing more code or more reports or more trades or more summaries per day, that doesn't guarantee the company will make more money. If you enabled your market analysts to make twice as many trades per day, you will likely lose money if they actually did that. Because they were already finding the good trades, and now they are also making the not-so-good trades and maybe even the unlikely trades.And also, in the longer term not being shown in existing studies, you are in an arms race with your competitors. Like advertising, you will be spending a lot of that money in order to counter the spending of your competitors, and you both lose the game of prisoners dilemma, the only winner being the arms dealer selling to both sides.

Two new papers from Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology and Gastroenterology shed light on how gut-brain interactions, influenced by both biology and life circumstances, shape eating behaviors. Together, they highlight the importance of multidisciplinary, personalized approaches to digestive health and nutrition. 

Researchers found that stress from life circumstances can disrupt the brain-gut-microbiome balance. This disruption may alter mood, decision-making, and hunger signals - increasing the likelihood of craving and consuming high-calorie foods. 

The paper examined how social factors, such as income, education, health care access, and biological aspects, interact with the brain-gut-microbiome to influence eating habits and obesity. 

By understanding these interactions, clinicians can better tailor treatment and support to individuals living with obesity, ultimately enhancing outcomes and quality of life. 

In the first general population study of its kind, researchers found that adults with disorders of gut-brain interaction are significantly more likely to screen positive for symptoms of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. 

Key findings: 

Symptoms include sensory-based food avoidance, lack of interest in eating, and fear of aversive consequences. 

These individuals experience significantly greater health burdens and reduced quality of life - regardless of body mass index. 

The study highlights the need for routine avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder screening and integrated GI-mental-nutritional health care to better support patients with disorders of gut-brain interaction. 

Key takeaway: These papers show that gut-brain communication is central to eating behavior disorders and that non-biological stressors - like discrimination or past illness - can shape physiological responses. Clinical tools must address not just what patients eat, but why.

As BioDlink, a leading global CDMO, affirms its commitment to strategic alliances to support biotech innovation worldwide as it marks 15 years of operations. Alliances are gaining momentum across the APAC region, where the first half of 2025 has seen a sharp rise in collaboration—24 new regional partnerships and counting—signaling a shift toward quality, speed, and cost efficiency.

Dr. Jun Liu, CEO and Executive Director of BioDlink, notes that biotech companies are increasingly joining trusted ecosystems like BioDlink's to accelerate development and manufacturing to grow the market together in their globalization strategy. These companies demand not only high quality and fast delivery, but also a blend between quality, speed, and cost. Complex therapies such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) demand meticulous fine-tuning to optimize combinations and targets, making reliable, agile partnerships essential.

For ADCs, we can complete the entire process from DNA synthesis to toxicology study material release in just 7 months, and the full IND application within 11 months. For monoclonal antibodies, the timelines are 6 months and 10 months, respectively.

In the face of global competition, it is more important to build a win-win global ecosystem than go for the lowest price. Driven by customer needs, we strive to balance quality, speed, and cost to maximize value.”

Dr. Jun Liu, CEO and Executive Director, BioDlink

BioDlink's ongoing collaboration with GlycanLink exemplifies this approach, developing the GL-DisacLink® platform, an advanced site-specific conjugation (1-enzyme 1-step) technology that enhances ADC stability and efficacy beyond conventional linker methods. BDKcell®, BioDlink's proprietary cell line construction platform, has a rapid development cycle of 14 weeks. These innovations offer significant process advantages, including high uniformity, simplified workflows, short reaction times, reduced off-target effects, and reduced overall production costs.

For global biotech companies seeking to develop new ADC targets, bispecific ADCs, dual-payload ADCs, PDCs, TCE-ADCs, non-internalizing ADCs and novel format ADCs, success also hinges on the ability to scale projects under stringent regulatory frameworks. Their evaluation includes whether alliance partners bring robust capabilities and a verifiable regulatory track record, including delivery reliability, process patents, and end-to-end chemistry, manufacturing, and control (CMC) systems.

Building on a strong foundation of 107 pre-clinical studies, 38 clinical studies and 8 pre-BLA studies (as of December 31, 2024), BioDlink's global growth strategy is laser-focused on leveraging key areas such as ADCs, providing differentiated value to alliance partners, and unlocking ecosystem synergy, for instance, Kexing Biopharm covers global licensing, while BioDlink focuses on commercial supply.

Partnering with innovative biotechs like MediLink Therapeutics, Escugen, and Smart Nuclide, BioDlink has emerged as the go-to CDMO for ADC and RDC projects. Furthermore, BioDlink's comprehensive CDMO platform for antibody drugs (mAbs/BsAbs), ADCs, fusion proteins, and other bioconjugates delivers:

BioDlink's competitive edge stems from its one-base, end-to-end streamlined platform for antibody drugs, ADCs, fusion proteins and other bioconjugates focused on three core customer needs: quality, speed, and cost-efficiency. Dr. Jun Liu also highlights: “Within China, we were among the first CDMOs to focus on antibodies and ADC-based antibodies and retain a first-mover advantage. We are going global with like-minded clients and alliance partners, with a commitment to sustainable success.”

Students who lean on coffee and energy drinks to power through nonstop studying may be fueling the very stress, anxiety, and depression they are trying to fight, new research warns.

Study: Caffeine Intake Mediates the Relationship Between Problematic Overstudying and Psychological Distress. Image credit: PeopleImages/Shutterstock.com

Excessive caffeine intake may be associated with and potentially aggravate psychological distress in students with problematic overstudying behavior, as reported by a new study published in the journal Nutrients.

Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive substance worldwide. Primarily obtained from coffee, caffeine improves alertness, attention, cognitive functions, and performance during physically and mentally demanding tasks. These properties make caffeine most popular among university students, who sometimes consume energy drinks to boost their performance while studying.

Moderate caffeine intake has been found to improve mood due to its energizing effects. However, existing evidence indicates that excessive caffeine intake can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and panic attacks. Caffeine is known to directly act on the Hypothalamic–Pituitary–Adrenal axis, leading to increased secretion of stress hormones, potentiation of cardiovascular and neuroendocrine stress reactivity, and subsequent induction of overall stress level.

Given the higher reliance of students on caffeine intake for performance boosting and the possible negative impact of caffeine on psychological distress, the current study was designed to investigate whether caffeine intake mediates the association between problematic overstudying and psychological distress among university students.

Problematic overstudying, also known as compulsive studying behavior or study addiction, is an addictive behavior and an early form of work addiction. Such behavior can potentially reduce functioning in other life domains and trigger negative health consequences.

Like the characteristic features of excessive caffeine intake, study addiction is associated with states of high alertness and arousal despite increasing fatigue, which in turn can lead to high and chronic stress and poor quality of life. Given these similarities, the current study aimed to explore the stress-mediating role of caffeine among students with study addiction.

The study included two separate groups of university students: 436 students in the first group and 3421 students in the second group, including undergraduate, postgraduate, and PhD students.

The Bergen Study Addiction Scale and Perceived Stress Scale-4 were used to assess participants' study addiction and psychological distress, including stress, anxiety, and depression. All participants were asked to provide information on their daily caffeine intake for the mediation analysis.

Higher levels of study addiction symptoms were linked with greater caffeine intake and higher levels of perceived stress, anxiety, and depression in both groups.

The study analysis revealed that caffeine intake partially mediates the relationship between study addiction and perceived stress in both study groups. A similar mediating effect of caffeine intake on the relationship between study addiction and anxiety and depression was observed only among students from the second group.

The study suggests that caffeine intake may partially contribute to increased risk of stress, anxiety, and depression among university students with study addiction. Students who are addicted to studying are more likely to consume caffeine, as observed in the study.

The mediating effects of caffeine were small and partial, highlighting the presence of other factors, including excessive efforts, perfectionism, and social isolation, which may also contribute to higher levels of perceived stress, anxiety, and depression in addicted individuals.   

Students consider excessive caffeine intake as a coping strategy, as caffeine triggers arousal, improves attention and alertness, reduces fatigue and pain, enhances mood, and helps distract from problems. However, in students with study addiction, high intake of caffeine may function as a maladaptive and potentially addictive pattern of mood regulation, rather than an effective coping strategy.

The study finds a positive association between caffeine intake and depression among students from the second group, which contradicts previous reports stating that higher caffeine intake is associated with a lower risk of depression. However, in line with the current study findings,  prior research has reported that higher caffeine intake is associated with an increased risk of suicidal tendency among shift workers.

This study suggests that shift workers consume more caffeine due to long working hours and sleep deprivation, which in turn increases the risk of depression. The current study findings may be partially explained by similar mechanisms associated with high study workload, long studying hours, and high academic stress related to study addiction.

The study did not find any mediating effect of caffeine intake on the relationship between study addiction and anxiety and depression among students belonging to the first group. This might be due to insufficient statistical power from the small sample size.

Overall, the study findings suggest limiting caffeine intake and promoting healthy alternatives, such as rest and recovery, to support the mental health of students with problematic overstudying.

Despite vaccines and treatments, SARS-CoV-2-the virus that causes COVID-19-continues to pose a global health threat, driven by new variants and its ability to hijack human cells in ways that still aren't fully understood. Now, scientists at Scripps Research have pinpointed dozens of human proteins that SARS-CoV-2 needs to complete its full life cycle, from entering a cell to replicating and releasing new viral particles.

Published in PLOS Biology on June 12, 2025, these findings could open the door to new drug strategies that target our own proteins rather than the virus itself, potentially leading to new treatments effective against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, even as the pathogens continue to evolve.

To find out which human proteins SARS-CoV-2 relies on, the research team used a technique called genome-wide small interfering RNA (siRNA) screening. This method can individually inhibit human genes in cells that are naturally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, revealing which proteins the virus requires to replicate. The team uncovered 32 proteins essential for the earliest stages of infection, 27 proteins that the virus uses later, as well as cellular pathways it exploits-some previously known and others newly discovered.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, our lab has long been focused on antivirals that target SARS-CoV-2, but what this work underscores is the importance of shifting toward understanding how the virus interacts with the host. By identifying the human proteins that coronaviruses rely on, we can now think about developing the next generation of pan-coronavirus therapies-treatments that could be effective not just against today's SARS-CoV-2, but even a future SARS-CoV-3. Because these strategies target the host, they're also less likely to be undermined by viral mutations and drug resistance."

Sumit Chanda, professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research and co-senior author of the study

Among the proteins identified, two emerged as especially promising drug targets. The first, perlecan, is a large protein studded with sugar chains found in the extracellular matrix-the supportive meshwork that surrounds and organizes our cells. The research team discovered that SARS-CoV-2's spike protein can latch directly onto perlecan's sugar chains, helping the virus attach to and enter human cells. Blocking that interaction could prevent infection from taking hold.

"Perlecan could be acting almost like a co-receptor for the virus," says co-senior author Laura Martin-Sancho, who was formerly a staff research scientist at Scripps Research and is now an assistant professor of molecular virology at Imperial College London. "If we can target that interaction, we may be able to stop infection right at the door."

The second protein, Baculoviral IAP Repeat Containing 2 (BIRC2), is part of a cellular inflammation pathway. In cultures of human cells and in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, drug compounds known as second mitochondria-derived activators of caspases (Smac) mimetics-originally developed to trigger cell death in cancer and to "wake up" dormant HIV so it can be targeted by the therapy-successfully inhibited BIRC2, slashing viral levels in an animal model.

"With BIRC2, the really striking part is that our lab had been working with Smac mimetics for years in HIV research," adds Chanda. "To suddenly see them show antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 was a big surprise."

Importantly, the team tested the same human proteins against three other coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and a seasonal coronavirus. Of the 47 proteins tested, 17 were consistently used by all three viruses, including proteins that help viruses fuse with cells, copy themselves, and exit to infect new cells. This suggests that blocking human proteins that the viruses depend on could form the basis of drugs effective against past, current and potentially future pandemic coronaviruses. Because host-directed antivirals target human proteins rather than viral proteins, they're less likely to be undermined by the virus's rapid mutation rate.

"If we have such antivirals ready ahead of time, we could deploy them early in a future coronavirus outbreak," points out Chanda. "That gives us a higher barrier to resistance and the potential to block multiple viruses with a single therapy."

Next, the researchers plan to explore whether the same host proteins are also used by other respiratory pathogens such as influenza and RSV. They'll also continue testing the safety and efficacy of promising compounds in future studies.

The death rate from hypertensive kidney disease (high blood pressure-related kidney disease) increased by 48% in the U.S. over the past 25 years, with continued differences across demographic groups, according to preliminary research presented at the American Heart Association's Hypertension Scientific Sessions 2025. The meeting is in Baltimore, September 4-7, 2025, and is the premier scientific exchange focused on recent advances in basic and clinical research on high blood pressure and its relationship to cardiac and kidney disease, stroke, obesity and genetics.

This is the first study to examine 25 years of national data on hypertensive kidney disease deaths across all U.S. states and major demographic groups. Despite national efforts to reduce health inequalities, Black individuals still had over three times the death rate compared to other groups of people."

Joiven Nyongbella, M.D., an M.P.H. candidate and internal medicine resident at Wayne State University/Henry Ford Rochester Hospital in Detroit

High blood pressure (when the force of the blood pushing against the walls of vessels is too high) is a known risk factor for kidney damage. It is the second leading cause of end-stage kidney disease and contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality. Untreated high blood pressure can lead to serious outcomes, such as heart attack, stroke, heart failure and progression to kidney failure. Globally, the rate of death from chronic kidney disease increased 24% from 1990 to 2021, according to the American Heart Association's 2025 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics.

This study, looking at data from 1999 – 2023, found age-adjusted mortality rate (AAMR) for hypertensive kidney disease deaths increased 48%. Men, people living in the South and Black or Hispanic adults had higher than average death rates.

"High blood pressure isn't just about strokes or heart attacks - it's also a major cause of kidney disease and death, especially in Black and Hispanic communities," said Nyongbella. "The message is simple: check your blood pressure, treat it early and don't ignore it, because it can quietly lead to life-threatening kidney problems."

In this study, researchers reviewed data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) WONDER database from 1999 to 2023 for all death certificates noted with hypertensive renal disease as the cause of death. The analysis found:

"This study provides important observational data indicating a concerning rise (48%) in age-adjusted deaths due to high blood pressure-related kidney disease over the last 25 years, especially among men, and Black and Hispanic individuals," said American Heart Association volunteer expert Sidney C. Smith Jr., M.D., FAHA. "These findings are in line with the recently released 2025 AHA/ACC High Blood Pressure Guideline and AHA's Presidential Advisory on Cardiovascular Kidney Metabolic (CKM) Health. Both papers emphasize the importance of early treatment for high blood pressure, its direct link to kidney disease, as well as the impact of social factors among high-risk populations." Smith is a cardiologist and professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina's School of Medicine, a past president of the American Heart Association and a co-author of the 2025 AHA/ACC High Blood Pressure Guideline; he was not involved in this study.

There are several limitations to the study's findings. Of note, the study relied solely on death certificate data, which may include errors due to missing or mislabeled causes of death. In addition, individual health factors like access to care, medication use or diet were not available, so future research is needed to investigate these factors in addition to health data.

When 72-year-old Richard Sabbagh collapsed in his Brooklyn home this past April, his son's quick action—and the rapid response of the multidisciplinary stroke team at NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn—saved his life and got him back on his feet in record time.

The morning of his stroke, Sabbagh, a senior security supervisor at the New York Stock Exchange for nearly 44 years, knew something was wrong from the moment he stepped out of the shower. He began to experience sudden brain vibration and loss of movement on the left side of his body. His son Robert, a professional boxer who is unfortunately all too familiar with head injuries, recognized the symptoms right away and called 911. An emergency medical services (EMS) team from NYU Langone quickly responded. "They were moving so fast," Sabbagh said. "From the moment they walked in, you could tell they knew exactly what to do."

Paramedics Julia Mishiyeva and Keiji Shibata, who have worked for NYU Langone EMS for nearly 25 years combined, have seen countless stroke calls, but this case stands out as one where every step went right. Stroke calls demand rapid and precise action. When the pair arrived at Richard's home, Mishiyeva and Shibata instantly began a targeted assessment. Once Richard was safely moved to the ambulance, they administered supplemental oxygen and activated a stroke code before leaving the scene, alerting NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn's stroke team. This early coordination meant that a CT scanner was ready, along with lifesaving treatments, such as the clot-busting medication tenecteplase (TNK), that could be considered the moment he arrived.

"Time is brain," said Shibata. "When blood flow is blocked, brain cells begin to die, leading to permanent damage or worse. The sooner we act, the better the outcome. Richard's case showed how critical timing is." Both paramedics credit NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn's system for making the handoff seamless. At NYU Langone, a stroke alert is activated immediately—neurology, radiology, and the full team are ready in advance. "In Richard's case, everything lined up," Mishiyeva added. "The 911 call came quickly, we recognized the symptoms, and the hospital was prepared. That's what led to such a great outcome."

As soon as the ambulance pulled up to the Emergency Department doors, the team was ready to act. "The doctors were waiting for me as soon as we arrived and diagnosed the clot," Sabbagh said. The team prepared for a possible mechanical thrombectomy, but after administering the TNK, the blockage dissolved almost immediately, avoiding the need for further intervention.

Matthew D. Sanger, MD, a vascular neurologist at NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn, who oversaw Richard's care, credits the outcome to preparation and collaboration. "This was a textbook example of how our multidisciplinary approach—spanning neurology, emergency medicine, radiology, nursing, and therapy—sets us apart. We work together seamlessly to achieve the best patient outcome," he said, "and Richard is the perfect example of that."

Within hours, Sabbagh's symptoms had dramatically improved, and just two days after his stroke, he was discharged home and required no significant rehabilitation.

A stroke survivor once before, having had a transient ischemic attack seven years ago, Richard is now more committed than ever to his health. "Our most precious commodity is life. Our biggest enemy is death," Sabbagh said. "If it wasn't for the team at NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn—the paramedics, the ER staff, and Dr. Sanger—I don't know where I'd be today."

Robert echoes that sentiment: "My father's care was nothing short of incredible. My advice to other families is simple: pay attention to the warning signs and don't waste time."

NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn is a Joint Commission-certified Comprehensive Stroke Center, recognized for providing around-the-clock advanced stroke care and accredited rehabilitation services, and has earned Get With The Guidelines®-Stroke Gold Plus, Target: Stroke Elite Plus, and Target: Stroke Advanced Therapy Honor Roll awards.

A newly published clinical trial in Nutrients highlights pork's role in military nutrition, showing that meals containing lean pork support better recovery, mood and anabolic status in cadets performing intense tactical fitness exercises compared to plant-based meals. 

The randomized controlled trial, conducted by Texas A&M University and funded by the National Pork Board (NPB) and the U.S. Department of Defense, evaluated whether pork-based or plant-based military-style Meals, Ready-to-Eat (MREs) influenced recovery after the Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) in cadets. 

Over the course of the double-blind, crossover trial, cadets who consumed lean pork-based MREs showed significantly lower cortisol levels, higher testosterone-to-cortisol ratios and decreased inflammation compared to when they consumed plant-based meals. They also reported less muscle soreness in the lower body, particularly in the medial and lateral thigh regions. 

These physiological markers tell us that the cadets recovered better with pork. We saw a more favorable anabolic state, reduced urinary nitrogen losses, and even improved sleep and mood scores - all critical for readiness and resilience in tactical athletes." 

Drew Gonzalez, Ph.D., lead study author, postdoctoral researcher at Texas A&M

Importantly, both the pork- and plant-based MREs were matched for total calories and macronutrients, highlighting the importance of protein quality - not just quantity - in recovery. 

Cadets who consumed lean pork-based meals reported greater self-reported appetite satisfaction and lower depression scores than those who ate plant-based alternatives. Depression scores declined by more than 50% within 48 hours of consuming pork MREs. 

"Protein quality goes beyond muscle," said Kristen Hicks-Roof, Ph.D., RDN, LDN, FAND, FNAP, director of human nutrition at NPB. "We're seeing early signs that better protein sources like pork may influence mood, motivation and mental stamina - critical components of military performance." 

While both diets allowed cadets to replicate their performance on the ACFT after 72 hours, those consuming lean pork experienced physiological advantages that could support faster long-term recovery in real-world military settings. 

The pork diet group showed reduced markers of protein degradation (such as urinary urea nitrogen), lower inflammatory markers (like IL-8) and better mood states post-ACFT. Meanwhile, cadets consuming the plant-based MREs exhibited greater muscle soreness and slower hormonal recovery. 

"This wasn't just a lab trial - these were real cadets under military protocols, with real meals that looked and tasted like field-ready MREs," said Richard Kreider, Ph.D., senior investigator on the study. "These data suggest pork can be a valuable asset for tactical fueling." 

With only one pork-based option among the 14 U.S. military MRE menus currently in rotation (as of 2023), the study authors suggest increasing the use of pork or fortifying plant-based MREs with creatine and essential amino acids. 

"Our findings show that when cadets consume high-quality protein like pork, their bodies respond more favorably to physical stress," said Gonzalez. "This has important implications for performance, recovery and long-term readiness in active-duty personnel."

Hydrogels-materials like gelatin that can absorb and hold water-can aid wound healing and enable slow-release drug delivery, but they usually break down in acidic environments like the stomach. Inspired by the properties of gastric mucus, a team of researchers and clinicians led by Zuankai Wang of Hong Kong Polytechnic University have developed an acid-resistant hydrogel called "ultrastable mucus-inspired hydrogel" (UMIH). Publishing September 4 in the Cell Press journal Cell Reports Physical Science, they showed that UMIH improved gastrointestinal wound healing in animals and outperformed a clinically approved mucosal protectant (a material used to protect the stomach lining). 

UMIH has potential for treating gastroesophageal reflux, gastric ulcers, and post-surgical wound protection and can be combined with endoscopic delivery for minimally invasive therapy. In both rat and pig models, it not only sticks firmly but also helps wounds heal faster and better." 

Bei Li, coauthor of Sichuan University

Like other hydrogels, UMIH consists of a meshwork of polymers that absorb water to create a strong but jelly-like consistency. To make it acid resistant, the researchers incorporated three key molecular components into UMIH's structure: a protein called ELR-IK24 that binds to hydrogen ions under acidic conditions to reduce local acidity; tannic acid, which enhances the hydrogel's ability to stick to surfaces; and a molecule called HDI that stabilizes the hydrogel's structure under acidic conditions. 

"UMIH represents a major step forward in biomaterials for gastrointestinal repair," says Dr. Wang. "Its strong adhesion, durability, and scalable manufacturing process position it as a promising platform for clinical translation." 

In lab tests under acidic conditions (pH2), UMIH showed 15× stronger adhesive abilities compared to aluminum phosphate gel (APG), a clinically approved mucosal protectant and antacid that is used to manage gastric ulcers and acid reflux. And whereas APG degraded completely after 3 days, UMIH still maintained 50% of its structural integrity after 7 days in acidic conditions. UMIH was not associated with any toxicity issues in lab-grown gastrointestinal cells. It also inhibited the growth of E. coli and S. aureus bacteria, indicating that it has antimicrobial potential.

"UMIH achieves an adhesion strength 15 times higher than that of clinically approved materials in acidic conditions," says coauthor Xiao Yang of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. "It remains stable for 7 days and shows excellent biocompatibility and significant tissue repair capability." 

In pig and rat models of esophageal injury, UMIH adhered tightly to wounds and improved healing compared to control animals and animals treated with APG. UMIH was associated with less tissue damage, reduced inflammation, and it promoted the growth of new blood vessels, which is essential for healing. 

Clinical trials will be needed to validate UMIH's safety and efficacy in humans, but the researchers say that it has good potential for commercialization. 

"This is a material that's ready for both the operating room and the production line," says coauthor Feng Lou of Sichuan University. "UMIH is low-cost, easy –to –mass produce, and built from components with established safety profiles. In [the] future, we plan to integrate UMIH with drug release systems and implantable flexible electronics to create smart gastrointestinal devices that can treat and monitor in real-time."

Former male high-level rugby players in New Zealand have a 22 percent increased risk of developing Alzheimer's and other dementias later in life compared to men in the general population, according to new research from the University of Auckland.

The project is co-led by senior lecturer Dr. Stephanie D'Souza from the COMPASS Research Centre in the University's Faculty of Arts and Education and Dr. Ken Quarrie from New Zealand Rugby.

Researchers examined long-term neurodegenerative disease risk outcomes for almost 13,000 men who played provincial-level or higher rugby between 1950 and 2000 and compared them with 2.4 million New Zealand men, matched on age, ethnicity and birthplace.

Out of every 1,000 men in the general population, 52 died from, or were diagnosed with, a neurodegenerative disease over the follow-up period from 1988 to 2023, but among former rugby players, the number was 65 per 100, says the study's lead author, PhD student Francesca Anns.

"This is an extra 13 cases per 1,000 people over the study period, or around four extra neurodegenerative disease cases per year, given the size of the player cohort," she says.

And she says both international/professional and provincial/first-class amateur players had higher risks than the general population, although the risks were greater at the higher playing level.

"Our analysis also showed that players in backline positions had greater risks than forwards, with the risk for backs increasing further the longer they played or the more matches they played, a pattern not observed for forwards."

Anns says the increased risk of disease typically became apparent from the age of 70 onwards, with no evidence of earlier-onset illness.

Co-lead investigator Dr. Stephanie D'Souza says these results are consistent with research into other collision sports from the US, Scotland and Italy, but the effect sizes in their study were slightly smaller than most previous reports.

That may reflect differences in how the study was designed, including the size and make up of our comparison group, the fact that our study included both provincial and international players, rather than only elite professionals, and how cases were identified, as well as differences in how rugby was played in New Zealand over the decades we studied."

Dr. Stephanie D'Souza, co-lead investigator 

The study is part of the Kumanu Tāngata project, which is focused on investigating the long-term health outcomes of first-class rugby players using de-identified linked data, which mean names are removed.

It adds to growing evidence linking collision sports with later-life brain health risks, believed to be due to exposure to head knocks, says D'Souza.

"While the research can't prove causation, the consistent pattern across multiple studies strengthens the case for a connection. In this study, higher risks were seen in players who competed at the international or professional level, as compared to those who only played provincially, and for backs whose risk increased with more years and matches played."

She says these patterns showing higher risk with both greater intensity and longer duration of play suggest a possible 'dose-response' relationship.

"The position differences also indicate that the nature of contact, not just the number of head impacts, may be important in understanding risk."

The study's authors recommend that collision sports organizations limit player exposure to head impacts and manage suspected concussions proactively, while continuing to communicate openly about both the benefits and risks of participation in sports like rugby.

Neurodegenerative diseases in male former first-class New Zealand rugby players by Francesca Anns, Kenneth L. Quarrie, Barry J. Milne, Chao Li, Andrew J. Gardner, Ian R. Murphy, Evert Verhagen, Craig Wright, Susan Morton, Thomas Lumley, Lynette Tippett and Stephanie D'Souza has been published in Sports Medicine.

A team of researchers found there is a possible molecular connection between air pollution and an increased risk of developing Lewy body dementia. The study builds on a decade of research linking exposure to fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) -- from industrial activity, residential burning, wildfires, and vehicle exhaust-to a higher risk of developing these diseases. The findings add to a growing body of evidence indicating how environmental factors may trigger harmful protein changes in the brain that lead to neurodegeneration. The research is published in Science.

Lewy body diseases are a group of neurodegenerative disorders marked by the abnormal buildup of a protein, alpha-synuclein, in the brain. These clumps, known as Lewy bodies, are a hallmark of the conditions Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia.

In their new work, the team discovered that exposing mice to PM2.5 triggered the formation of abnormal alpha-synuclein clumps. These toxic protein clusters shared key structural and disease-related features with those found in the brains of patients with Lewy body dementia.

We have identified a novel strain of Lewy bodies formed after exposure to air pollution. By defining this strain, we hope to establish a specific target for future drugs aimed at slowing the progression of neurodegenerative diseases marked by Lewy bodies."

Xiaobo Mao, PhD, corresponding author, associate professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and a member of the Johns Hopkins Institute for Cell Engineering

The research began with an analysis of hospital data from 56.5 million U.S. patients admitted between 2000 and 2014 with neurodegenerative diseases. The team focused on patients hospitalized for the first time with Lewy body-related conditions and used ZIP-code-level data to estimate their long-term exposure to PM2.5. The scientists found that each interquartile range increase of in PM2.5 concentration in these zip code areas resulted in a 17 percent higher risk of Parkinson's disease dementia and a 12 percent higher risk of dementia with Lewy bodies. 

"This is among the first human epidemiological study to zero-in on a dementia subtype linked to Lewy bodies," said Xiao Wu, PhD, co-first author of the study and assistant professor of Biostatistics at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. "The statistical association we uncovered is even stronger than what previous studies found when lumping all Alzheimer's and related dementias together-highlighting Lewy body formation as a potentially pivotal pathway that warrants deeper biological investigation, says "We hope to inspire researchers to conduct both epidemiologic and molecular studies that focus on dementia subtypes linked to Lewy bodies."

Exploring the biological reason for this association between exposure to PM2.5 and Lew body dementia, the team of researchers exposed both normal mice and genetically modified mice lacking the alpha-synuclein protein to PM2.5 pollution every other day for a period of ten months. 

"In normal mice, we saw brain atrophy, cell death, and cognitive decline-symptoms similar to those in Lewy body dementia," says study collaborator Ted Dawson, MD, PhD, the Leonard and Madlyn Abramson Professor in Neurodegenerative Diseases and director of the Johns Hopkins Institute for Cell Engineering. "But in mice lacking alpha-synuclein, the brain didn't exhibit any significant changes."

The researchers then studied mice with a human gene mutation (hA53T) linked to early-onset Parkinson's disease. After five months of PM2.5 exposure, these mice developed widespread pockets of alpha-synuclein and experienced cognitive decline. Observed through biophysical and biochemical analysis, these protein clumps were structurally distinct from those that form during natural aging. 

The team also set out to determine whether air pollution effects varied by location. They found that mice exposed to separate samples of PM2.5 from China, Europe and the United States led to similar brain changes and development of alpha-synuclein pockets, suggesting that the harmful effects of PM2.5 may be broadly consistent across different regions.

The researchers say changes in gene expression in the brains of PM2.5-exposed mice were strikingly similar to those found in human patients with Lewy body dementia which indicate that pollution may not only trigger the build-up of toxic proteins but also drive disease-related gene expression changes in the human brain. 

"We believe we've identified a core molecular link between PM2.5 exposure and the propagation of Lewy body dementia," Mao says. 

While genetic factors play a significant role in neurodegenerative disease, the scientists say people can potentially control their exposure to pollution. 

The next goal of the researchers is to determine which specific components in air pollution are driving these effects. Understanding that could help guide public health efforts to reduce harmful exposures and lower the risk of disease, notes the research team.

By identifying this novel strain of Lewy bodies formed after exposure to air pollution the authors of the study hope to establish a specific target for future drugs aimed at slowing the progression of neurodegenerative diseases marked by Lewy bodies.

Few people with high blood pressure were using salt substitutes, even though they are a simple and effective way to lower sodium intake and manage blood pressure, according to preliminary research presented at the American Heart Association's Hypertension Scientific Sessions 2025. The meeting is in Baltimore, September 4-7, 2025, and is the premier scientific exchange focused on recent advances in basic and clinical research on high blood pressure and its relationship to cardiac and kidney disease, stroke, obesity and genetics.

High blood pressure occurs when the force of blood flowing through the blood vessels is consistently too high. High blood pressure can lead to other serious events such as heart attack and stroke. Using data from 2017 to 2020, 122.4 million (46.7%) adults in the U.S. had high blood pressure and it contributed to more than 130,000 deaths. Too much sodium and too little potassium in the diet are risk factors for high blood pressure.

Overall, less than 6% of all U.S. adults use salt substitutes, even though they are inexpensive and can be an effective strategy to help people control blood pressure, especially people with difficult-to-treat high blood pressure. Health care professionals can raise awareness about the safe use of salt substitutes by having conversations with their patients who have persistent or hard-to-manage high blood pressure."

Yinying Wei, M.C.N., R.D.N., L.D., lead study author and Ph.D. candidate in the departments of applied clinical research and hypertension section, cardiology division, at UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas

Salt substitutes are products that replace some or all of the sodium with potassium. Potassium salt tastes similar to regular salt, except when heated it can have a bitter aftertaste. Many foods contain some sodium in their natural state, however, the largest amount of sodium comes from processed and packaged foods and meals prepared at restaurants. The American Heart Association recommends consuming no more than 2,300 mg of sodium a day, with an ideal limit of less than 1,500 mg per day for most adults, especially for those with high blood pressure. For most people, cutting back by 1,000 mg a day can improve blood pressure and heart health.

This study is the first to examine long-term trends in salt substitute use among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2003 to 2020, researchers analyzed the use of products that replace salt with potassium-enriched or other alternative salts.

The investigation focused on people with high blood pressure, and an additional analysis was conducted among adults eligible to use salt substitutes, including people with normal kidney function and those not taking medications or supplements that affect blood potassium levels. Some salt substitutes contain potassium, and they can raise blood potassium to dangerous levels in people with kidney disease or those taking certain medications or potassium supplements. Excessive potassium can lead to irregular heart rhythms. People with high blood pressure who are thinking about switching from regular salt to a salt substitute should first consult with a health care professional.

The analysis found:

"Salt substitute use remained uncommon over the last two decades including among people with high blood pressure," Wei said. "Even among individuals with treated and poorly managed or untreated high blood pressure, most continued to use regular salt."

"This study highlights an important and easy missed opportunity to improve blood pressure in the U.S.-the use of salt substitutes," said Amit Khera, M.D., M.Sc., FAHA, an American Heart Association volunteer expert. "The fact that use of salt substitutes remains so low and has not improved in two decades is eye-opening and reminds patients and health care professionals to discuss the use of these substitutes, particularly in visits focused on high blood pressure." Khera, who was not involved in this study, is a professor of medicine, clinical chief of cardiology and director of preventive cardiology at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.

The study has several limitations. First, information about salt substitute use was self-reported, so there may have been underreporting or misclassification. In addition, all types of salt substitutes were included in the analysis, therefore, the analysis could not specifically separate potassium-enriched salt from other types of salt substitutes. Finally, the survey data did not capture how much salt substitute the participants used.

"Future research should explore why salt substitute-use remains low by investigating potential barriers, such as taste acceptance, cost and limited awareness among both patients and clinicians," said Wei. "These insights may help guide more targeted interventions."

MORRISTOWN, N.J. — It's been nearly two months since we last saw the United States men's national team in action. Expect one thing to remain the same. 

Back in July, the USMNT narrowly lost the Gold Cup final to Mexico in front of a sold-out, heavily pro-El Tri crowd of almost 71,000 in Houston. On Saturday, the Americans are likely to be the away team on home soil once again, with most of the full house at 26,500-seat Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, New Jersey, expected to be rooting for Korea Republic and superstar forward Son Heung-min.

It comes with the territory for the USMNT.

"Whatever stadium we play in … We should be able to perform," U.S. fullback Sergino Dest said Friday.

Perhaps it will even help.

With no grueling, marathon World Cup qualifying slate to help prepare them for next summer's 48-team fútbol fest, Mauricio Pochettino's team needs all the adversity it can get. Add in the fact that the Koreans, who advanced to the round of 16 at Qatar 2022 before being eliminated by Brazil — boast a deep and talented squad beyond Son.

Saturday's contest in the shadow of New York City represents an invaluable opportunity.

"South Korea is a very good team, a good challenge for us," Pochettino said at his pre-match press conference.

Dest was one of several U.S. stars left off the Gold Cup roster for a variety of reasons. He's back, as is Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah. So are forwards Folarin Balogun and Josh Sargent. And with the planet's biggest sporting event just six more tuneup matches away, they need to get into the habit of winning as soon as possible. 

The last time a full-strength U.S. team convened, for the Nations League finals last March, they were upset by Panama and Canada in Los Angeles. Yet for Pochettino, winning on Saturday and in another exhibition on Tuesday (against Japan in Columbus, Ohio) is secondary to team-building. 

Results now don't count. The plan is to use these games to gain information that will help them beat whoever they'll face next June and July when it does.

"The most important [thing] is, in these types of games, is how we are going to compete," Pochettino said. " It's always good to win, because that gives you more confidence and trust. But I think the objective is to try to add players and new faces that really start to buy the ideas that we started to build when we started the Gold Cup."

So far, so good.

"You see their quality," Houston Dynamo midfielder Jack McGlynn said of working alongside PSV Eindhoven's Dest, AC Milan's Pulisic and Marseille's Weah. "You see why they're at the teams they're at. So it's been a great week of training. Obviously, getting to build connections with them, both on and off the field, has been amazing."

Pulisic, who got into an unfortunate public spat with Pochettino over the summer after he asked the coach to rest during the Gold Cup, has been particularly impressive this week, according to McGlynn.

"He's a leader for us," he said of Pulisic, adding that the USMNT star has been beating defenders and scoring goals at training almost at will. "You can give him the ball," McGlynn said, "And something will happen."

On Friday, Pochettino again insisted that he and Pulisic have moved forward.

"We all make a mistake sometimes because we read the situation in a different way," the coach said. "Christian is happy to be here."

Good thing. For if the Americans are to make a deep run on home soil next summer and win over millions of new fans in the process, they'll need Pulisic and the rest of the usual suspects to be their top players. As Pochettino noted, "we don't have too much time until the World Cup."

"The main group is starting to understand what we want, and if we want to arrive at the World Cup in our best condition, they need to know each other and, at some point, we need to start to cut and…increase the players that we believe that we're going to be in the World Cup, but always keeping that mentality.

"That, for me, is going to be success in the next two games."

Egypt wins the match in the first half 1 - 0.

Ethiopia needs to increase the pace and improve the quality a little in the final third of the field.

It's hard to tell whether he was going to shoot or cross. In any case, the ball is cleared. Excellent turn and pass by Mohamed Salah, who sends a teammate to the back line, but the cross comes to nothing.

The first chance of the match was wasted by the home team, who started at a fast pace. The match is tied in the begining.

This Saturday, the United States Men's national team are back in action, hosting South Korea at the Sports Illustrated Arena. While Concacaf sides may be kicking off the road to World Cup qualification during this window, Mauricio Pochettino will be taking a look at finalizing his World Cup squad since the USMNT have booked their place as a host nation. South Korea will also be coming to America in 2026, already advancing through AFC World Cup Qualification, giving Pochettino an ample test for his experimental squad. 

Pochettino has almost completed a full year in charge of the USMNT, and results have been mixed, with him winning 10 matches and losing six. Failing to win the Concacaf Nations League and Concacaf Gold Cup while also struggling against top opposition from abroad, this window is a chance for the USMNT to build momentum as the matches will only get harder from here on out. With regulars such as Christian Pulisic, Tim Weah, Folarin Balogun, and Sergino Dest back in the squad, Pochettino will have no shortage of players to choose from, but there is a lack of experience in key areas like goalkeeper, where Matt Freese leads the way with only seven caps.

What will be needed for the USMNT to defeat South Korea?

Under Pochettino, Antonee Robinson has operated as an aggresive possession fullback, being able to push possession higher up the pitch, interchanging with Christian Pulisic and Malik Tillman. While Robinson isn't in this squad, his role will provide optimism as to how Dest can spark the attack. Someone comfortable playing up the pitch, Dest can create devastating overlaps with Tim Weah to keep a defense on their toes. The PSV man does come with defensive liabilities, but they're ones that are worth managing since he's such a strong creator. Next to Chris Richards and Tim Ream, there's enough defensive cover if Dest gets caught forward, so during this window it will be important to see if he can get back to his best. If so, Pochettino can dream of a much stronger team in October when his defense is mostly solidified. Fullback play was one of the strengths of the USMNT, and this window is the first time in a year that we'll have an opportunity to see why that was the case.

The race to be the starting nine at the World Cup is on. Balogun will have a chance to earn his first start under Pochettino now that he's fully healthy and in the Monaco setup, but that doesn't mean that he won't have competition. Balogun only has one goal this season and has struggled to replicate his form with Reims since moving to Monaco, but one of the hottest strikers in the world will be ready for an opportunity if it comes his way. Josh Sargent has scored in five consecutive games for Norwich City and has six goals in all competitions to start off the season. It has been five years since he has scored a goal for the USMNT, but that doesn't mean that he isn't still confident in his chances to end that drought during this camp. If Sargent is able to get things going, he could be in a position to start a second consecutive World Cup.

Much of the news around the USMNT this summer was around who wasn't with the squad during the Concacaf Gold Cup, namely Christian Pulisic who opted to stay home and get some much-needed rest after a long season with Milan. Despite the fact that the Gold Cup usually features the USMNT B team, Pulisic drew criticism from former USMNT players who were questioning his drive. The easiest way to put that behind him is by contributing to the national team during this window now that he's back in the fold. Someone who plays with plenty of pressure every time he puts on a USMNT shirt, it will only build if results don't turn around sooner than later.

Throughout the 2025 season, Sounders FC's Cristian Roldan has proven himself to be one of the most efficient deep-lying midfielders in MLS.

On Wednesday, Sept. 3, his hard work came to fruition with his first U.S. National Team call-up since 2023.

“Sometimes it does take 30 games to stand out, especially when they're not looking for you right away,” said Sounders General Manager & Chief Soccer Officer Craig Waibel. “But I do think over the course of the season, he's really risen to the top of that chart in that position in our league.”

The last time the midfielder earned a spot on the USMNT roster, he played a vital role in the 2023 Concacaf Gold Cup competition, coming up big with an assist against Saint Kitts and Nevis. Now, he has the opportunity to showcase his talents on the world stage once again under new head coach Mauricio Pochettino in a pair of friendlies against Korea Republic and Japan.

“As an organization, it's always a proud day when you see a guy get called in,” said Waibel. “He is showing a lot of young players the blueprint of how to get there and how to go about it.”

The Sounders veteran has been a workhorse in the central midfield since transitioning to the role late into the 2024 season. In 2025 alone, he's contributed to 10 assists and two goals across all competitions for the Rave Green.

He most recently caught people's attention in the FIFA Club World Cup, where he tallied a goal in the Sounders' first group stage match against Botafogo. Head Coach Brian Schmetzer even described him as “the best player on the field,” in the team's matches against the Brazilian side and Spain powerhouse Atlético de Madrid.

Still, Waibel believes it's been his consistent work rate since the start of the year that has ultimately pushed him back into the USMNT conversations.

“I don't think he elevated his play throughout the season. I actually think this is where he came in, and the difference is he just hasn't ever gone down,” said Waibel. “I think he's played at a high level, far above the league average, in the position all year with, you know, maybe minutes of playing below that level, but not games.”

It is clear Roldan can compete with the best of the best in MLS, North America and clubs from around the world. While the midfielder already has 33 caps under his belt with the USMNT, he's ready to make a statement during the September camp to cement his place on the team for the long term — especially with FIFA World Cup 2026 less than a year away.

“I always feel like I have a lot to give, whether it's on the field, off the field,” said Roldan. “I'm a competitor. I'm going to make the guys around me better [and] I'm going to compete at a very high level.”

Scotland travel to Denmark in World Cup qualifier action

All the goals as they go in | Email Barry

Denmark 0-0 Scotland: Oof! Having just come on as a sub, Max Johnston avoids being sent off for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity. He headed the ball on to his own upper arm while contesting a high ball from deep and was the last man back. Having given the Scotland substitute a yellow card, the referee was summoned to his pitchside monitor but stuck by his original decision that a booking would suffice. It's good officiating but if I'm honest, I thought the original decision was extremely harsh. Johnston headed the ball on to his own arm, where it hit his short sleeve. Maybe the ref saw a little push? Whatever his view, it's a let-off for Scotland.

Greece 5-1 Belarus: The comeback is on.

Denmark 0-0 Scotland: Anders Dreyer lets fly with a shot from distance that fizzes inches wide of Angus Gunn's upright and ripples the side-netting. Moments later, neither Che Adams nor Grant Hanley bother making the run that would have enabled one of them to get on the end of a cross from Andy Robertson that could not have been more inviting if it contained an RSVP card. Aaron Hickey is replaced by Max Johnston. There's 20 minutes left in Copenhagen.

Greece 5-0 Belarus: Christos Tzolis piles the hurt on Belarus in Piraeus, in a match Steve Clarke and his Danish counterpart Brian Riemer will both be watching with interest in the coming days.

Iceland 3-0 Azerbaijan: Isak Bergmann Johannesson scores his second goal of the night to put the game beyond Azerbaijan.

Italy 0-0 Estonia: Approaching the hour mark in Bergamo and Italy have yet to break the deadlock against Estonia. If they fail to win tonight their chances of qualifying for next summer's World Cup are going to be in serious mild jeopardy.

Iceland 2-0 Azerbaijan: Cologne's Isak Bergmann Johannesson has doubled Iceland's lead in Reykjavík, so he has.

Denmark 0-0 Scotland: Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg goes close for Denmark only to have a curled effort that was heading inside the foot of the upright deflected out for a corner by Grant Hanley. McTominay has soldiered on despite injuring his knee while overstretching in a bid to relieve Damsgaard of the ball. Here's hoping it's nothing too serious and the Ballon d'Or nominee can run it off.

Slovenia 1-1 Sweden: Sandi Lovric levels for the home side a minute after the break in Ljubljana.

Denmark 0-0 Scotland: Joakim Maele throws himself in front of a John McGinn shot inside the Denmark penalty area and the ball goes out for a corner. Denmark struggle to clear the inswinger but eventually win a throw-in off Hickey. Moments before that McGinn shot, the Scotland midfielder had tried to play the ball into the path of a lung-busting Ryan Christie gallop into the Denmark penalty are but underhit his pass. It's a great start to the second half by Scotland but Scott McTominay has just gone to ground injured.

The second half is under way: Mikkel Damsgaard gets the ball rolling for the Danes and there don't appear to be any changes in personnel on either side. If Scotland can hold out for a draw or even nick a win tonight, it would be a fantastic start to their qualifying campaign.

Group B: Slovenia 0-1 Sweden

Group B: Switzerland 4-0 Kosovo

Group C: Denmark 0-0 Scotland

Group C: Greece 4-0 Belarus

Group D: Iceland 1-0 Azerbaijan

Group D: Ukraine 0-1 France

Group I: Italy 0-0 Estonia

Group I: Moldova 0-2 Israel

Group L: Faroe Islands 0-1 Croatia

Group L: Montenegro 0-1 Czechia

View the World Cup qualifying tables

Half-time: A game that Denmark have dominated, albeit without creating any clear-cut chances adjourns for the half-time interval. I'll tell you who the Danes could do with in their attempts to break down this obdurate Scottish defence – Christian Eriksen, who has scored in their past three games but was dropped from the current squad.

Greece 4-0 Belarus: Dimitrios Kourbelis has added a fourth to Greece's tally in Piraeus in tonight's other Group C encounter.

Denmark 0-0 Scotland: Steve Clarke's side are living on the edge in Copenhagen but look like they might make it to half-time without conceding. They have had one excellent chance, a headed opportunity that Ryan Christie put wide of the far post after connecting with an excellent John McGinn cross. That aside, Denmark have been hammering on the door.

Moldova 0-2 Israel: As things stand, Gennaro Gattuso's Italy, who are drawing at home to Estonia, will be third in Group I behind Norway and Israel with a game in hand over the side that's beating Moldova. The Italians couldn't conceivably fail to qualify for three consecutive Wortld Cups, could they?

In other qualifiers I've failed to mention thus far, Croatia are a goal up against Faroe Islands and Czechia lead by the only goal of the game away at Montenegro. Both those games are in Group L, which is being bossed by a Czechia side who have played more games than anyone else.

WSL: Approaching half-time at Stamford Bridge, it's 1-0 to Chelsea in their match against Manchester City because of course it is. Aggie Beever-Jones put the reigning champions ahead and you can follow the second-half with Rob Smyth …

Switzerland 2-0 Kosovo: The Swiss have rattled off a quickfire double against Kosovo, with Manuel Akanji and Breel Embolo scoring two goals in three minutes in their Group B encounter.

Greece 3-0 Belarus: As Denmark and Scotland play out a stalemate in Copenhagen, Greece are already laying down a Group C marker. They've just gone 3-0 up against Belarus in what is amounting to a turkey-shoot.

Slovenia 0-1 Sweden: With much of the focus in Lujbljana on a player that recently left Newcastle, one who recently joined them has opened the scoring for Sweden. Anthony Elanga, take a bow.

Greece 2-0 Belarus: Greece have doubled their lead in Piraeus, with Vangelops Pavlidis doubling their tally against the team likely to end up as Group C whipping boys. Having said that, with Scotland among the four teams, it would not come as a massive surprise if they have some competition for fourth place. Pavlidis spanked a beauty of a half-volley past Pavel Pavlyuchenko in the Belarus goal after connecting with a sublime assist from Karetsas.

Denmark 0-0 Scotland: With 15 minutes played at Parken, it would be fair to say Scotland are under the Denmark cosh. They're conceding corner after corner and their defending reeks slightly of desperation but they're holding out for now.

Ukraine 0-1 France: Michael Olise has opened the scoring for the visitors in Wroclaw, where fellow “visitors” Ukraine are hosting France. The Bayern Munich man stroked a precision shot into the bottom corner from 18 yards after connecting with a low Bradley Barcola cross from the left.

Denmark 0-0 Scotland: Scotland get an early warning when Morten Hjulmand sticks out a leg to steer a Mikkel Damsgaard free-kick swung in from the left and prod the ball straight into Angus Gunn's breadbasket. It's a terrible miss but he was offside, due in no smart to the commendably high line Scotland were keeping as the free-kick was taken.

Denmark 0-0 Scotland: Denmark midfielder Pierre Emile Hojbjerg has picked up an early yellow card for a foul on John McGinn.

Greece 1-0 Belarus: Elsewhere in Group C, Konstantinos Karetsas has taken just three minutes to fire Greece ahead in their qualifier against Belarus in Piraeus. The 17-year-old midfield talent plies his trade with Genk in Belgium.

WSL: It's scoreless at Stamford Bridge after 17 minutes of the curtain-raiser between Chelsea and Manchester City but the visitors have roared out of the traps against the reigning champions. Rob Smyth has the latest …

1 min: Scotland might not win the World Cup but at least Andy Robertson can sit any future grandchildren he might have on his knee and tell them about the time he won the toss ahead of their first qualifier for the 2o26 tournament. His side get the ball rolling as assorted qualifiers get under way across the continent.

Denmark: Despite having scored in each of Denmark's past three games, Christian Eriksen has been dropped from tonight's squad. Brian Riemer decided to leave the 33-year-old out because he hasn't managed to find a club since leaving Manchester United in June. He is believed to have been keeping himself fit by training with the Swedish club Malmo, but Riemer clearly feels he has not done enough to merit inclusion tonight.

Scotland: It's no great surprise that Steve Clarke has made seven changes to the experimental side that hammered Liechtenstein in a friendly in June. Rarely one to inspire huge confidence while playing for his country, Angus Gunn is back in goal in place of the injured first choice Craig Gordon, while it's great to see Brentford's Aaron Hickey back in defence after a near two-year absence with various injury issues. John Souttar and Grant Hanley also come into the back four.

In midfield, Scott McTominay and Ryan Christie are in for Billy Gilmour and Lennon Miller, while Lyndon Dykes will play as a lone striker in front of Che Adams. Ipswich Town's George Hirst has to make do with a place in the bench but is likely to see some action.

Easy wins for Spain and Belgium, battling victories for Wales and Northern Ireland, Germany lost their first World Cup qualifier away from home against Slovakia and Poland came from behind courtesy of a Matty Cash thunderbolt to take a point and dent Dutch hopes of qualifying for the World Cup. Read on …

The new WSL season gets under way tonight, when Chelsea begin their latest title defence by hosting Manchester City at Stamford Bridge. Sam Kerr is back in the Chelsea squad after 20 months on the sidelines with a serious knee injury and her head coach Sonia Bompastor has said the Australian will play some part in the game.

Slovenia v Sweden: Having missed pre-season and spent most of the past six weeks alone kicking footballs into an empty goal in a secluded corner of Newcastle's training ground, it's no great surprise that Alexander Isak is not in Jon Dahl Tomasson's starting line-up to face Slovenia tonight. Liverpool's brand new striker is among the substitutes, with Viktor Gyokeres and Anthony Elanga having got the nod ahead of him.

Chelsea v Manchester City … live! You can follow the action from the WSL season curtain-raiser at Stamford Bridge with Rob Smyth's minute-by-minute report.

Denmark: Schmeichel, Kristensen, Andersen, Andreas Christensen, Maehle, Dreyer, Hojbjerg, Hjulmand, Damsgaard, Dolberg, Biereth.

Togo, North Korea, Panama, Saudi Arabia and Wales have featured in the World Cup since Scotland last did in 1998 and while Sterve Clarke's side are desperate to end their hiatus, the next six matches will dictate their fate and the legacy of their long-serving head coach. Words: Ewan Murray …

After yesterday's wins for Wales and Northern Ireland, Scotland get their campaign to qualify for next summer's World Cup in the USA, Canada and Mexico under way with a trip to face Denmark at Parken in Copenhagen. In a four-team group with Greece and Belarus, one imagines the Scots, Danes and Greeks will each fancy their chances of winning the group and consider any finish below a playoff spot an unmitigated disaster.

In terms of Fifa world rankings, Denmark are highest at 21st, Greece are next at 39th, Scotland are 47th and while Belarus (97th) are technically in the role of group whipping boys, they are exactly the kind of minnows Scotland are fabled for tripping up against. It will come as no surprise whatsover if they cause Steve Clarke's side and the two higher ranked nations in Group C problems, even if they are currently obliged to play their home fixtures in neutral venues due to their ongoing involvement of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In the group's other fixture, they play Greece in Athens tonight.

As well as monitoring the Scots, we'll keep tabs on the other Uefa qualifiers taking place around the continent, making sure to check in on Sweden's Group B opener against Slovenia in Ljubljana. Unless he's gone on strike and demanded a move to another, more successful nation, Alexander Isak could feature for the Swedes in his first match of the season. Having successfully agitated for a summer move to Liverpool, the former Newcastle striker seems unlikely to start given that he can't conceivably be match fit and hasn't had a proper pre-season but could appear off the bench.

Elsewhere, history suggests the qualifier between Switzerland and Kosovo has the potential to be spicy, while Ukraine get their campaign under way with an eyecatching “home” game against France in the Polish city of Wroclaw. Having failed to qualify for either of the past two World Cups, Italy really need a home win against Estonia if they are to avoid further embarrassment. It would be a seismic shock if Croatia were to slip up against the Faroe Islands in Torshavn.

Global superpower France will make a belated start to its 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign as it faces Ukraine in Poland on Friday.

Ukraine and France travel to Wroclaw on Friday for a showdown on neutral soil as both teams seek an early leg up in their efforts to qualify for the 2026 World Cup. Les Bleus are major favorites to seal top spot in the qualifying group that also contains Iceland and Azerbaijan, hoping to cement their place in the tournament finals for the eighth consecutive edition.

Ukraine, meanwhile, hasn't featured on the main stage of a World Cup since 2006 and faces France on Friday, hoping this can be the start of the revolution. Serhiy Rebrov's side have drawn their last two meetings with Didier Deschamps' men, but it's been almost 12 years since Ukraine last managed a win in this head-to-head.

And that's what's required if Zbirna is to have any chance at first place in qualifying Group D, though second will still advance to the play-offs as an alternative route. Meanwhile, an away match against Ukraine (albeit on neutral ground) looks likely to be the toughest trip on France's schedule as it seeks to live up to its favorite billing.

Liverpool striker Hugo Ekitike was a late call-up to Deschamps' squad as a replacement for injured Manchester City midfielder Rayan Cherki. Meanwhile, Ukraine center-back Ilya Zabarnyi will see some familiar faces on the opposing team after he joined Paris Saint-Germain from Bournemouth in a deal worth $76 million.

Denmark and Scotland will finally get their 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign off the ground in Copenhagen on Friday.

Better late than never, Scotland and Denmark will face off on Friday as the two teams begin their bids to qualify for the 2026 World Cup. There are now fewer than 10 months until North America hosts the biggest sporting event in the world, and only now are Denmark and Scotland beginning their quests to clinch a place.

Both teams have been distracted by the UEFA Nations League, where Denmark reached the quarter-finals back in March before being ousted by eventual champion Portugal. Scotland, on the other hand, was relegated from League A at the first attempt following a play-off defeat to Greece.

As fate would have it, Steve Clarke's side will come up against that same opponent in UEFA qualifying Group C, with Denmark and Belarus being the other two contenders. Scotland won its last clash against the Danes almost four years ago in qualifying for the 2022 World Cup, though the Red and Whites returned the favor with a 2-0 win of their own at Parken.

Rasmus Hojlund will look to make an impact for Friday's hosts, having recently left Manchester United to join Napoli on loan, though he's yet to represent the Italian outfit just yet. The same can't be said for Scotland midfield duo Scott McTominay and Billy Gilmour, however, who have already etched their names in Naples history and should line up opposite their new team-mate.

U.S. men's national team coach Mauricio Pochettino said he is looking forward to reuniting with his former player, Son Heung-min, when the U.S. faces South Korea on Saturday in New Jersey.

“It is going to be an amazing opportunity to see each other,” Pochettino said. “We really love each other. He was a very important player, one of the most important players in my tenure in Tottenham. I was always chasing him, because when I was in Southampton, also I wanted to sign him, but he decided to move to a different club. He moved from Hamburg to Leverkusen. But then, when we moved to Tottenham, we chased him again, and we convinced him to join us in Tottenham.

“And I think, now, he's a legend. After 10 years, he's a legend at Tottenham. He is one of the best players in the world. He is an amazing player, but he's an amazing person.”

Pochettino has often pointed to Lionel Messi's influence on Major League Soccer and the reputation of the American domestic league. For Pochettino, Messi's ability to succeed in MLS and stay at a high level when playing with Argentina has reinforced his belief that the league is strong enough to feed American players into his side.

The Argentine coach said Son's signing with LAFC has the same level of impact. LAFC paid a record transfer fee for Son, and the Korean has made an instant impact, setting up goals in his first three games in Los Angeles.

“What (Son) is going to add to the MLS, I think, is (that) this type of player is going to help in the evolution of the game, for sure,” Pochettino said. “He is going to be an example for the teammates, but also for the players that are going to face him during the competition.”

Pochettino pointed out Messi's influence the night before in his final home World Cup qualifier against Venezuela, scoring twice to lead Argentina to a win.

“When we talk about the players for the national team, when I talk about the level of the MLS, it's really high because the best player (is here),” Pochettino said. “If you had the chance yesterday to watch the game, Argentina and Venezuela, Leo Messi is the best player in the world, and if he is playing here, I think the level is really good. I'm not saying that it's the best in the world, but it can match other leagues in the world. Now, with the addition of Son, the level is growing, and the evolution is really good.

“And, for sure, the interest in the rest of the world in the MLS is higher than before (adding) Son.”

Son and South Korea should present a strong challenge for Pochettino's team, which is searching for positive results after advancing to the Gold Cup final this summer.

Several key faces are back in the squad this week, including Christian Pulisic, Sergiño Dest, Tim Weah, Josh Sargent and Folarin Balogun.

“South Korea is a very good team,” Pochettino said. “Good challenge for us. And I think it's important to see the way that we want to compete with new faces, a little bit (of a) different team than we were playing in the last Gold Cup. But I think it is always important, because the challenge for us is to arrive in the best condition to the World Cup, and I think to give options to different players that maybe didn't play before is important because this is a challenge that we need to (see) between our players.”

MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Less than a year into the Thomas Tuchel era and England has seen little to suggest its decades-long wait for a trophy will end at next year's World Cup. 

The German coach goes into the latest round of World Cup qualifiers on the back of two chastening performances in June, including a 3-1 loss at home to Senegal.

The other match, an unconvincing 1-0 victory over Andorra, was described by one British newspaper as England's “worst ever” win.

Tuchel, hired last October and in position since January, was appointed because of his trophy-winning pedigree at Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Bayern Munich and charged with the responsibility of delivering England's first trophy since its one and only World Cup triumph in 1966.

Reminders of the expectations on him are rarely far away. 

“I get a lot of tips that's for sure. But always in a friendly manner,” Tuchel said of his encounters with England fans on the street. “Most of them just say, 'Bring it home, Thomas.' And that's basically the task.”

The decision by the English Football Association to appoint a foreign coach to succeed Gareth Southgate was a contentious one. Let alone the fact that Tuchel is German, historically one of England's fiercest rivals in soccer.

There was criticism from some sections of the media, with one newspaper greeting the appointment by publishing a back page headline declaring it was a “dark day for England.” 

Criticism since has been more focused on England's performances. Even Tuchel complained about his team's attitude in the narrow win against the 173rd-ranked Andorra. 

The teams meet again at Villa Park on Saturday when improvement is expected. 

“The camp (at the end of the season) is always a bit of a tricky one in terms of coming from holidays and coming after a long season, being tired,” Tuchel said on Friday. "And then the need to restart the engines after a long season, so yeah, we take all of this into our observations.

“We had our learnings so we made our decisions to make it more competitive for the next three camps.”

Those three camps will complete England's World Cup qualifying campaign. It tops Group K with maximum points after three games. The away fixture against Serbia on Tuesday will likely be the trickiest match remaining. 

Under Southgate, England reached back-to-back European Championship finals and the semifinals of the 2018 World Cup. Yet by the end of his reign — defeat to Spain in the final of Euro 2024 — the patience of some fans had begun to wear out. 

That is the measure of how high the bar is for Tuchel, who won league titles with PSG and Bayern Munich and the Champions League with Chelsea.

His contract runs only until the end of next year's World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

“I'm happy where the team is, and we can feel it that it's a change of attitude if you finally arrive in the World Cup season,” he said. 

While England's men have been waiting decades to taste glory, the women's team have enjoyed consistent success under Sarina Wiegman, including back-to-back European Championship titles, the most recent in July.

Does that add to the pressure on Tuchel to follow suit?

“If it's something, it's a good omen,” he said. “It's possible. There's no curse on English teams, so it's a good omen, and we will do our very best to follow the example.”

The USMNT star might be the best talent in his federation, but there are plenty of other names waiting to burst onto the scene

We all just assumed that Christian Pulisic is the best player in CONCACAF. That is, of course, the natural order of things - especially if you are of the USMNT persuasion. After all, he is the go-to guy for Milan, a constant threat for the national team, and a top performer in pretty much every notable big game he has featured in of late.

But is that really the case? Pulisic missed two months of football this summer after electing to sit out of the Gold Cup, and watched from home as the rest of CONCACAF staked their claim. In short, there's a sense that others could have caught up. U.S. teammate Tyler Adams has been excellent of late, while Canada's Jonathan David has shown that he is good enough to earn a true step up for Juventus, who have dreams of European glory.

Chelsea prepared for their opening fixture of the new Women's Super League (WSL) season by announcing the acquisition of Alyssa Thompson for a new club-record fee.

The U.S. Women's national team (USWNT) star is the latest arrival in a summer dominated by big money signings. On the same day Thompson was unveiled, London City Lionesses made Grace Geyoro the most expensive signing in women's football history with a deal thought to be worth £1.43 million ($1.92 million), while Arsenal paid £1 million to whisk Olivia Smith away from Liverpool in July.

Thompson is expected to cost just less than that seven-digit sum before add-ons are included. BBC Sport are one of many sources which describe the deal as the biggest in Chelsea's history, surpassing the £900,000 spent on Naomi Girma in January.

Angel City, the NWSL side which paid £335,000 to have the first draft pick in 2023 which they used to select Thompson straight out of high school, hailed the agreement as “one of the highest transactions in global women's soccer.”

Leaving her local club in Los Angeles represents a sizeable upheaval for the 20-year-old. “I love LA,” Thompson told Chelsea's official website. “I love playing there. I love being with my sister. I love my family. But what I also know is that I want more for myself, and I want to experience different things. I feel like Chelsea is such an amazing club.

“It was definitely a difficult decision to make to leave my family, my friends, and my home,” she continued. “I've never left home before, but once I heard about the offer, I really wanted to do it. I knew it would be so good for me. I felt like I'd be able to grow not just as a player, but also as a person.

“I decided now was the right time because I felt in my gut that I wanted to go, and I've never felt like that before about other hard decisions that I've made in the past.”

Thompson has signed a five-year contract stretching until 2030. The jet-heeled winger will watch her new teammates begin the defence of their league title at home to Manchester City on Friday evening at Stamford Bridge.

Angel City forward and U.S. women's national team winger Alyssa Thompson has officially signed with Chelsea FC. After a protracted negotiation between the two clubs, multiple reports put the transfer somewhere between $1.3 million and $1.5 million. The fee marks a new transfer record for both clubs. A five-year contract with Chelsea is in place for the rising star, who first cracked a major USWNT roster during the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. 

The move makes Thompson one of the most expensive transfers in women's football history. Reigning NWSL Champions Orlando Pride recently set a new record of $1.5 million with the new acquisition of Lizbeth Jacqueline Ovalle from Liga MX Femenil's Tigres Femenil, though London City Lionesses stole all the transfer deadline day headlines with a global record fee for France midfielder Grace Geyoro for a record $1.9 million. 

The 20-year-old USWNT international signed a contract with Angel City earlier this year, a new deal through 2028, alongside her sister, defender Gisele Thompson. Following the news of Thompson's departure, Angel City annonuced an additional contract extension with Gisele through 2029.  

The attention around the transfer is significant for the global market, as rising fees and valuations increase. The move also highlights the growing financial power of top NWSL and European clubs and their ability to attract top talent across leagues. Thompson's arrival at Chelsea will place her among an already strong offensive side. 

Though the Blues striker Mayra Ramirez is rehabbing from hamstring surgery, Sam Kerr is back at full fitness following an ACL injury, and Lauren James, Guro Reiten, Aggie Beaver Jones and Johanna Rytting Kaneryd are among Chelsea's attackers. The move will also reunite Thompson with USWNT teammates Catarina Macario and Naomi Girma.

While Thompson's departure is a blow to Angel City's playoff hopes, a potential substantial fee can provide resources for future high-profile moves. 

If the global market was unfamiliar with Thompson before, that's no longer the case moving forward. After a record-setting arrival to the league as a high-school player, where Angel City traded with Portland Thorns and Gotham FC to ensure the No. 1 pick in the 2023 NWSL Draft, the Los Angeles side spent $450,000 to welcome her to her hometown club. 

Her fearless feats on the ball quickly got the attention of NWSL fans, and her early goal scoring and play making earned her a spot on the U.S. national team for the 2023 World Cup. In her two and a half seasons in NWSL, she's scored 15 goals and notched 11 assists. The winger is on a bounce back year, after managing a minor back injury in early 2024, and has plenty of MVP chatter around her 2025 season with Angel City.

The 20-year-old is considered to be Angel City's best player with the ability to both score and set up teammates. A top prospect still years out from her prime, her move overseas would be considered a major loss for a club that is currently in a playoff push, and for a league that boasts it is a top-flight place where the best in the world play.

No move like this happens unless a player wants it to come to fruition. With a new era in rising transfer market values for women's soccer players, Thompson is getting the opportunity to grow her career in a way that star players before her may not have. It's also a chance to develop her game in a new environment. 

Thompson has long been tied to American youth systems before turning pro, including Total Futbol Academy, a boys' club in MLS Next, Major League Soccer's academy system. 

The California native turned pro and played with her hometown NWSL team, and has continued her ascent as a next-gen prolific player in the league. But during Thompson's short two and a half years with Angel City, she's had four different coaches. Between full-time managers and interim head coaches with Freya Coombe, Becki Tweed, Sam Laity, and now Alex Strauss, the instability is notable. 

Stability, with a five-year deal and opportunity to develop into one's prime career years, at a top club like Chelsea, is lucrative for many prospects. With roster management already part of Chelsea's start to the 2025-26 campaign, with injuries to starters Mayra Ramirez and Lauren James, the timing seems right to make her way into the roster as a potential starter.

"Chelsea is such an amazing club, one of the best in the world. Being able to play with players that are the best in the world is an amazing opportunity at such a young age," Thompson said statement. "I want to learn, grow and develop a lot. I feel like Chelsea is such an amazing environment to do that in."

U.S. national team head coach Emma Hayes has been vocal about developing young players at their own pace. The skipper reignited the U-23 program alongside various international windows in 2025 alongside the senior national team. The former Chelsea FC manager is familiar with success in London. Hayes won 15 trophies with the Blues before being named to the lead position with the USWNT, including seven league titles and five FA cups.

It also means a one-time next-gen prospect elevates to a present-day profile player. An injury in 2024 kept Thompson off the USWNT rosters for the 2024 Concacaf W Gold Cup and the 2024 Summer Olympics. Her 2025 season has gone the complete opposite way. With typical starting forwards unavailable for selection throughout the year, the winger has quickly gone from bench-depth player to key starter. 

The USWNT's exciting "Triple Espresso" attacking line of Sophia Wilson, Mallory Swanson, and Trinity Rodman didn't exist in 2025. Wilson and her husband recently welcomed a baby, while Swanson is expecting. Rodman has missed large stretches of matches for club and country as she manages a back injury. If the intersection of timing and opportunity is everything, 2025 has aligned for Thompson.

U.S. women's national team forward Alyssa Thompson has made a major – and somewhat surprising – move, departing Angel City of the NWSL for English giants Chelsea.

ESPN reported Thursday that the clubs had agreed to a transfer fee of just under $1.5 million, with unspecified bonuses that could boost the deal's value to nearly $2 million in the future.

The $1.5 million figure is the world record for a transfer fee in women's soccer, a mark that was set just last month when the Orlando Pride acquired Lizbeth Ovalle, a winger for the Mexican national team. That said, it may have fallen late Thursday, with French outlet L'Equipe reporting that London City Lionesses had spent roughly $1.92 million to acquire midfielder Grace Geyoro from Paris Saint-Germain.

Thompson, 20, should be eligible to play for Chelsea once the relevant transfer paperwork and work visas in the United Kingdom are approved. The Women's Super League season begins on Friday, with Chelsea hosting Manchester City in a clash of title contenders. Chelsea is hoping to win a seventh consecutive title, six of which came during current USWNT head coach's Emma Hayes' tenure.

Thompson, whose younger sister Gisele remains an Angel City player, has 22 USWNT caps, scoring three goals in those appearances. In 16 NWSL appearances for Angel City this season – where she was widely considered the team's best player – the elder Thompson scored six goals and added two assists. She departs having posted 15 goals and 11 assists in 62 total regular-season appearances for the L.A.-based club.

Thompson's departure from Angel City arrived rather abruptly, with buzz around Chelsea's interest only coming to the surface in recent days. On Monday, the Los Angeles native was held out of Angel City's 2-1 win over Bay FC, with the club listing her as an "excused absence" on the official NWSL availability report.

Chelsea's urgency to complete the move likely stemmed from the realities of soccer transfer rules. English women's teams had until 6 p.m. ET Thursday to complete transfers; otherwise, a player would not be eligible to play in any competitive game until the secondary transfer window opens on Jan. 1, 2026.

Here's what to know about USWNT attacker Alyssa Thompson joining Chelsea:

Alyssa Thompson's move to Chelsea is major news on both sides of the Atlantic, and could have huge short- and long-term implications in the NWSL.

For Chelsea, the math is fairly straightforward: Thompson is one of the sport's top young players, with her ability to beat defenders off the dribble a prized quality. Her speed in the open field will make her one of the WSL's fastest players, and her new head coach, Sonia Bompastor, will be able to underline this transfer as evidence that the Blues are not resting on their laurels.

From Thompson's perspective, there are also major positives at play. Back in January, the forward signed a contract extension running through 2028, but Chelsea, which – thanks to very different league rules, have fewer financial restrictions to cope with than Angel City – is expected to have given her a significant raise. With USWNT teammates Naomi Girma and Catarina Macario already playing for the Blues, Thompson will have friendly faces to guide her as she adjusts to a different environment.

The parties that might not be so happy with the situation are Angel City and the NWSL as a whole. Through her play, local roots, and some injury trouble for veteran stars, Thompson had become the face of ACFC. Her skill set and marketability (particularly in Los Angeles) will be immensely difficult to replace long-term, and virtually impossible during the 2025 season.

Why so difficult? The NWSL transfer window closed last month, and while trades are still possible until the roster freeze date on Oct. 9, the other 13 teams will know that Angel City has just had a financial windfall while also walking into a bind in terms of their roster composition. After winning two straight, ACFC sits in ninth place on 23 points, trailing NJ/NY Gotham FC for the eighth and final postseason berth by a single point with eight games to play.

For the NWSL, the news may be even worse. While speculation that the league is doomed to lose all of its stars to free-spending European sides remains unfounded, there's no pretending that losing one of the league's best young players mere months after she had signed a long-term contract isn't a blow.

The problem stems less from Thompson's departure and more from the nature of her move. It's no disrespect to Ovalle to say that – with a long-term contract in place, Thompson's age, and her potential to become one of the very best attacking players in the world – Chelsea should have been expected to pay a significantly higher fee to get Angel City to engage in talks.

Instead, Thompson is off to London without breaking the global transfer record, which seems like a serious undervaluation. Chelsea entered the talks with all the pressure of completing a transfer against an impending deadline, yet looked for all the world like a team that landed a player whose value will skyrocket in the very near future.

For the NWSL, that's the problem. It's one thing for Chelsea, Arsenal, and French giant OL Lyonnes (whose owner, Michelle Kang, also owns the Washington Spirit) to have interest in the league's superstars. That's going to happen, because the NWSL has such a long list of outstanding players. It's another thing entirely to see a player in that class depart with no near-term means of replacing them, and at a price that does make sense stacked up against the other major transfers over the last 12 months.

Whether it's by raising the salary cap, calendar changes to align with European transfer windows, or creating new rules that allow teams more leeway to retain their most in-demand players, the NWSL will have to seriously consider major changes in response to what seems like a clear vulnerability.

US Soccer will belatedly honor one of its most accomplished players on Saturday – as good a time as any to re-assess his groundbreaking career

In a sense, the real surprise isn't that it took almost six years for Michael Bradley to get his flowers for his long and laureled United States men's national team career. It's that he agreed to receive them at all.

That sort of thing is, after all, extremely un-Michael Bradley.

Still, before Saturday's friendly between the US and South Korea at Sports Illustrated Stadium, New Jersey's native son will have no choice. He'll have to stand there, in the spotlight, the center of attention, and wave to the crowds for a little while. The now-38-year-old head coach of New York Red Bulls II will be honored for a career in which he amassed the third-most US caps of all time and the second-most assists, starting every game at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups.

From 2006 through 2019, Bradley had one of the most accomplished spells in men's national team history. And, somehow, also one of its most controversial. In none of his 151 USMNT appearances – captaining the Yanks in 48 of those matches – was there total consensus that he ought to be there, even as the do-it-all central midfielder methodically climbed to one of the historic powers of Serie A with Roma. But as a boring debate over the merits of his game dragged on year after year, its effect was muted or altogether negated by the fact that Bradley himself didn't seem to care even the tiniest bit. The only person in the American soccer community who didn't seem to have a loud and public opinion about Michael Bradley was Michael Bradley.

We sat down for a one-on-one interview once, a long time ago. Bradley emerged from the elevator and passed over the many fine and frilly couches scattered about the hotel lobby. He chose, instead, to sit on a little stool by a comparatively sad, plastic table in a corner. It may have been a kids' corner, I can't remember. Then, for 40 minutes, his pale green eyes beneath his heavy brow barely broke contact with mine as he thought deeply about everything he was asked and deeper still about how to answer carefully and diplomatically. The spell was only broken, briefly, when I wondered about a tattoo on the inside of his biceps and he recoiled and tugged down his sleeve to hide it. “No, that's OK,” he said politely.

Such was his searing intensity during the interview that Bradley didn't notice until it was over and he rose to walk away how uncomfortable he'd been in the little stool, wincing in pain as he stretched his back.

Bradley was not adequately appreciated in his time. Through little fault of his own, he became a kind of Rorschach test for however it was you already viewed the American men's program. If you believed that American soccer was beset by favoritism and nepotism and that certain players' ascent was preordained, Bradley seemed to confirm that. Although he was given his national team debut under Bruce Arena, he became a leading player under his father, Bob Bradley, about whom the fanbase nursed their own unreasonably strong misgivings.

If, conversely, you thought a new age had dawned in which even a born-and-raised American could grind his way up the sport's ranks – from the New York/New Jersey MetroStars, to Heerenveen, to Borussia Mönchengladbach, to Chievo, and finally to Roma before returning to North America with Toronto FC – Bradley was proof positive of that as well.

His case seemed to cut right to the id of a soccer community and its deep-seated hopes and insecurities.

He also didn't do much to boost his flagging popularity. When he spoke, Bradley was always incredibly guarded, although he took a laudable stance in criticizing President Trump in 2017. He could be ornery, especially when he was younger. He really didn't seem to have anything other than soccer and family going on in his life; or if he did, he didn't care to share any of it. He'd been that way even as a kid. Sports Illustrated told of a time when an 8-year-old Bradley refused his uncle's offer to buy him fried chicken because, as young Michael put it, “That's not what soccer players eat.”

But if you cared to look carefully and honestly, you would discern perhaps the best midfielder the nation has ever produced. What was always remarkable about Bradley was that he didn't have any standout physical or technical attributes, yet he willed himself into an excellent player all the same. He was solid-to-good across the board – Athletic, but not a monster. Technically sound, without being a maestro. What elevated him was an unshakable zeal for whatever tasks he'd been assigned on the field – and they varied wildly, as far as central midfielders go. He ran all day and read the game as if he'd been handed the manual. He could break up a counterattack or ping a diagonal ball to unlock a defense. He was relentlessly competent, never had a half-hearted game. His application to his craft was total.

It's just that midfielders who are on the ball a lot get a pass wrong sometimes, and that those tasked with covering a lot of ground lose their man on occasion. Then, inevitably, there would follow an outcry. For Bradley, there never seemed to be the same kind of tolerance for mistakes that others were granted.

While he captained the side when it lost to Trinidad and Tobago on the fateful 2017 day when the USMNT missed their first World Cup in 32 years, the program's modern nadir, Bradley set the standard every day that he was on the national team, protecting and prolonging its culture.

“Getting to know him, watching him work and operate and the professionalism that he showed every single training session, every camp, listening to the way that he speaks about and approaches the game, preparing himself – all things that a lot of guys were able to take from him,” said current US captain Tim Ream. “I'm sitting here today because of some of the things and conversations that him and I have had. The leadership that he showed from all the time that we were together, was something that I always left camp in awe of, and now still try to use those examples today.”

Michael Bradley made the players around him better, too. He just didn't get credit for that either.

London City Lionesses boss, Jocelyn Precheur, revealed how they tried to make the biggest splash of their short history by targeting England superstar Beth Mead ahead of their maiden season in the Women's Super League. The newly promoted side, looking to build instant credibility among the elite, lined up an audacious move for the Arsenal talisman who was instrumental in the Lionesses' Euro 2025 triumph.

Well, that went great.

Germany has returned to embarrass itself in the global stage yet again. Following nearly 10 disappointing years of continuous losses and a steady decline, the country hit a new low, as they granted Slovakia an easy 2-0 win. The lofty aspirations from manager Julian Nagelsmann, who claimed the aim was to win the World Cup 2026, were proven to be mere words as Germany helplessly failed by dint of a solid Slovakian performance. Here are the observations from the game.

There has not been a single aspect of the game in which Slovakia did not upstage Germany.

There are two ways a team can be better than their opposition: either they truly outclass the opposition with an otherworldly performance, or the opponents are just terrible and the team have done the bare minimum right. Slovakia mostly belongs to the latter — the team that managed to execute very basic, simple, yet effectual football. There was much wrong with die Mannschaft. The home team at Bratislava simply took advantage of this — the inability to pass, the poor press tolerance, the near-absent defense and the attack that shut down with even the bare minimal pressure. One may argue that both goals were the result of Germany's breakdown, but they deserve due credit for the beautiful passing in their goal build-ups and the picture perfect finishes.

The hero of the hour, Leo Sauer was otherworldly. He tore through Germany, with explosive pace and a terrific vision for goal. Additionally the Slovak striker David Strelec had a goal and an assist to his name. Both Sauer and Strelec played a little over 80 minutes, and completely dismantled the German defense and midfield. Other mentions go to Ondrej Duda at midfield and goalkeeper Martin Dúbravka.

Slovakia were compact, well-coordinated, and the best of all, even older players pulled their weight. That is the hallmark of a team that deserves every win they get.

As extreme as it sounds, the truth is that there has been a complete tactical breakdown in Germany. Some may hate to admit it, but Nagelsmann clearly did not instruct the team appropriately enough. Somehow the Germans could not string a single pass together, and were even worse off the ball — look at any tackle made and not one looks clean, let alone effective. Goretzka playing out of position did more for the attack than Serge Gnabry. Kimmich floats around in arbitrary positions — from midfield to right back, to left centreback. It begs the question — why move at all without a plan in mind? The backline is severely depleted as wing-backs progress forward but it is also the former's job to make recovery runs and that does not happen when every defender has already lost their man.

Antonio Rüdiger somehow had his worst ever Germany performance. His decline at club seems to have bled into his performances for the country and given tonight's performance, it is of doubt as to whether he will start further games in the presence of other personnel. Jonathan Tah continues to exhibit the same questionable performances he has shown at Bayern Munich lately, if not worse, being very mistake prone.

The attack looks toothless and the options at bench did not satisfy either. Florian Wirtz looked stuck and unhappy and despite his best attempts could not outplay his markers. Nick Woltemade looked terribly underwhelming and the decision to play him as striker is a head-scratcher. The fact is, that the attacking answer lies in neither Nadiem Amiri, nor Karim Adeyemi — the team simply needs to go back to the drawing board and figure out tactics afresh.

Whom do you blame for Germany's fall from grace?

Is it:

a. The DFB for retaining ineffective coaches for too long and failing at developing young talent, or,

b. Julian Nagelsmann for his nonexistent tactics, poor choice of players and terrible setup, or,

c. The players for having played like amateurs?

The fact is that Germany desperately need to qualify for this World Cup. Blaming Tah or Rüdiger for being terrible and ball watching in the Slovakian final third helps no one if they do not plan on fixing things. Maximilian Mittelstädt and Oliver Baumann may have saved the country from a worse outcome, but this still is not an acceptable state of affairs for Germany. Perhaps, it might be ok to accept that the former Weltmeister Germany will not be a part of the World Cup — for they have hit a new low. Congratulations to Slovakia on having won their first game in months.

The German national team hit the road to face Slovakia, looking to get off on the right foot for this round of World Cup qualifier action.

That did not happen.

Julian Nagelsmann — as he is prone to do — did some experimenting with his lineup and it did not work as the team dropped a 2-0 decision. The players were bad, the coaching was not great, and it was not a banner effort overall.

Rising national soccer star Alyssa Thompson is moving to the United Kingdom to play for Chelsea FC, in a surprise deal that takes her away from her hometown team and her younger sister. 

Thompson signed to Chelsea in "one of the highest transactions in global women's soccer," Angel City FC announced Friday, although the exact financial terms were not announced. The 20-year-old forward had re-signed a contract with Angel City in Los Angeles earlier this year, which would have kept her at the club through 2028. 

"I love L.A.," Thompson said in a release from Chelsea on Friday. "I love playing there. I love being with my sister. I love my family. But what I also know is that I want more for myself, and I want to experience different things. I feel like Chelsea is such an amazing club."

The deal was announced after Chelsea told fans that Colombian forward Mayra Ramírez will be sidelined indefinitely to rehab a hamstring injury that required surgery.

Her younger sister, Gisele, had also signed her own extension with Angel City at the same time. The sisters have become staples of the team, even scoring the first sister-to-sister goal in the National Women's Soccer League during a game in May.

Rumors swirled over the last week that Thompson was in talks to move to the Women's Super League, much to the dismay of her Los Angeles fans. Some showed up to the team's Monday match with signs begging her not to go. 

But Thompson was not at the game, marked as an excuse absence on the availability report as speculation intensified. 

Angel City is desperately fighting to secure a playoff spot as the NWSL season comes to a close in a few weeks, a spot only guaranteed to the top eight teams. The Los Angeles club is currently ninth in the standings, just behind Gotham FC. 

The two teams are set to face each other on Sunday, and Angel City will have to do so without one of its top scorers. 

It's unclear how Angel City will cope with losing Thompson as the NWSL transfer window ended on Aug. 25, and Thompson is currently the second-highest scorer on the team. She's given them six goals so far this season,  just two behind former teammate Riley Tiernan. 

The team also just lost defender Alanna Kennedy and midfielder Katie Zelem to the U.K., as both women signed to the London City Lionesses. 

Thompson was drafted by Angel City at the age of 17 in January 2023, which at the time was a historic move as the NWSL had never drafted a high schooler. She gave up a chance to play at Stanford and chose to turn pro in her hometown. 

Her younger sister was signed to the team later that year, in what the sisters described as dream come true opportunity to play together. 

They've both been called up to the U.S. women's national team as coach Emma Hayes has been looking to add depth in her roster through developing younger players.  

She scored her first goal for the senior national team in October last year in an international friendly against Iceland. Since then, Thompson has scored two more goals and totaled three assists for the national team. 

Thompson will join her USWNT teammates Naomi Girma and Cat Macario at Chelsea. Girma left the San Diego Wave for Chelsea in January in a deal that made her the first million-dollar player in women's soccer. 

It's an incredible opportunity for Thompson's career development as she grows into a household name for soccer fans. 

Chelsea is considered one of the best clubs in the women's game, with a stacked roster full of international stars. English players Lucy Bronze and Hannah Hampton are returning to the squad after helping England win the UEFA European Women's Championship this summer.

Rising national soccer star Alyssa Thompson is moving to the United Kingdom to play for Chelsea FC, in a surprise deal that takes her away from her hometown team and her younger sister. 

Thompson signed to Chelsea in "one of the highest transactions in global women's soccer," Angel City FC announced Friday, although the exact financial terms were not announced. The 20-year-old forward had re-signed a contract with Angel City in Los Angeles earlier this year, which would have kept her at the club through 2028. 

"I love L.A.," Thompson said in a release from Chelsea on Friday. "I love playing there. I love being with my sister. I love my family. But what I also know is that I want more for myself, and I want to experience different things. I feel like Chelsea is such an amazing club."

The deal was announced after Chelsea told fans that Colombian forward Mayra Ramírez will be sidelined indefinitely to rehab a hamstring injury that required surgery.

Her younger sister, Gisele, had also signed her own extension with Angel City at the same time. The sisters have become staples of the team, even scoring the first sister-to-sister goal in the National Women's Soccer League during a game in May.

Rumors swirled over the last week that Thompson was in talks to move to the Women's Super League, much to the dismay of her Los Angeles fans. Some showed up to the team's Monday match with signs begging her not to go. 

But Thompson was not at the game, marked as an excuse absence on the availability report as speculation intensified. 

Angel City is desperately fighting to secure a playoff spot as the NWSL season comes to a close in a few weeks, a spot only guaranteed to the top eight teams. The Los Angeles club is currently ninth in the standings, just behind Gotham FC. 

The two teams are set to face each other on Sunday, and Angel City will have to do so without one of its top scorers. 

It's unclear how Angel City will cope with losing Thompson as the NWSL transfer window ended on Aug. 25, and Thompson is currently the second-highest scorer on the team. She's given them six goals so far this season,  just two behind former teammate Riley Tiernan. 

The team also just lost defender Alanna Kennedy and midfielder Katie Zelem to the U.K., as both women signed to the London City Lionesses. 

Thompson was drafted by Angel City at the age of 17 in January 2023, which at the time was a historic move as the NWSL had never drafted a high schooler. She gave up a chance to play at Stanford and chose to turn pro in her hometown. 

Her younger sister was signed to the team later that year, in what the sisters described as dream come true opportunity to play together. 

They've both been called up to the U.S. women's national team as coach Emma Hayes has been looking to add depth in her roster through developing younger players.  

She scored her first goal for the senior national team in October last year in an international friendly against Iceland. Since then, Thompson has scored two more goals and totaled three assists for the national team. 

Thompson will join her USWNT teammates Naomi Girma and Cat Macario at Chelsea. Girma left the San Diego Wave for Chelsea in January in a deal that made her the first million-dollar player in women's soccer. 

It's an incredible opportunity for Thompson's career development as she grows into a household name for soccer fans. 

Chelsea is considered one of the best clubs in the women's game, with a stacked roster full of international stars. English players Lucy Bronze and Hannah Hampton are returning to the squad after helping England win the UEFA European Women's Championship this summer.

MORRISTOWN — When United States national team defender Max Arfsten jumped into a small-sided soccer match on Sept. 4, Ryder Jacobs knew exactly what to do. The 11-year-old was determined to slide-tackle him.

"It's our only shot," Jacobs said afterward. "But I didn't really get a chance. They were just dribbling past me."

Arfsten and teammate Sebastian Berhalter spent a few minutes in each of the youth club matches at the last session of Soccer Forward Play Day, a community engagement event designed to bring together people who love "the beautiful game." The men's national team has been practicing at the Red Bulls' facility in Hanover Township ahead of a Sept. 6 friendly against South Korea at Sports Illustrated Stadium.

Jacobs, who plays for Randolph Soccer Club 12U, wore a navy No. 10 USMNT jersey with Christian Pulisic's name on the back. He was one of the few youth players at the event who watches the national team, though even he didn't recognize Arfsten or Berhalter — the son of former national team coach Gregg Berhalter, a Tenafly native.

"You guys are the future," former national team defender C.J. Brown said to the youngsters, who play for Randolph SC, Chatham United, Morris United, and Madison SC. "This is the now. I'm the way past."

The event began with an adult kickaround and networking opportunity, bringing together executives like New Jersey Youth Soccer CEO Evan Dabby, who recalled playing with Gregg Berhalter at Tenafly; Brianna Keys, the NYNJ World Cup host committee director of social impact; and Cosmos CEO Erik Stover, a Morristown resident.

Special Olympics New Jersey athletes, mostly from Sparta Unified, also took to Delbarton's Ryan Family Field with their partners. Green Wave soccer players stepped up to play alongside them, offering pointers and encouragement.

Arfsten, meanwhile, dribbled through all the Randolph United 11U and 10U players, going goal to goal on the small field as the boys stared.

"When you're playing soccer, it's a human connection," said Delbarton center back Will Antenen, whose 10-year-old sister C.J. played with Chatham United in the later session.

"There's something special about being on the field together," Antenen said. "It gets rid of our differences. ... As someone who plays competitively, sometimes you take it too seriously. To be able to come out and play for the fun of the game is special."

I've lived in the United States my whole life, but my family is from Colombia. We visited relatives often when I was a kid, and those trips usually involved three things: soccer, soccer and more soccer. 

Most afternoons were spent kicking a ball around the finca, or a nearby parking lot, or even a dirt road. And every time a game came on, the entire town shut down for a couple hours as people crowded around whatever TV or radio they could find and enjoyed the broadcast. Soccer is more than a sport for me; it's a reminder of my culture, a game that crosses boundaries and is enjoyed all over the world.

In Colombia and many other countries, soccer is a source of national pride. So it's fun to see this pride expressed in a country like the United States with its melting pot of cultures and heritages. Even if I'm not keeping up with the game, the family group chat is buzzing with activity whenever Colombia is playing, and when I do get out to live events, I need only spot someone in a matching yellow jersey to make a new friend.

John Hoyos, right, with a family friend at the Copa América finals, in which Colombia played Argentina.

Hisense is an official sponsor of next year's FIFA World Cup™, and with products like its 116-inch Class UX Series model with RGB-MiniLED technology, the company is showing it understands how to outrun the competition. Here's what to know about the two tournaments and how Hisense is involved.

Meet industry creators, contributors and emerging thought leaders that have paired with CNET's award-winning editorial team to provide you with unique content from different perspectives.

Although their names are similar, the FIFA World Cup and FIFA Club World Cup are different events and have different dynamics.

The FIFA Club World Cup, which concluded this past July, places 32 already-existing teams from around the world into a new tournament format. This revised structure means more teams, more matches and more opportunities to yell "GOOOOOALLLLL!" at your screen of choice.

In contrast, the World Cup's entrants are the nations themselves. Each qualifying country enters one team of its best players, a requirement that focuses national pride and creates universal appeal. Next year's FIFA World Cup will be hosted across Canada, the United States and Mexico, the first-time multiple countries will share hosting duties during the same tournament.

The FIFA World Cup gives a voice and presence to smaller countries and helps them be seen on the big stage. When Croatia made it to the World Cup final in 2018, for example, they were the second-smallest country by population to ever do so. Countries big and small compete for the coveted title, and it's easy to tap into both national pride and the contagious enthusiasm of others in this event format.

In 2026, the FIFA World Cup will expand from 32 to 48 teams, which will allow more countries to compete and introduce their cultures at one of the most epic tournaments for any sport. Case in point: Both Jordan and Uzbekistan have already qualified and will make their World Cup debuts next year.

Since first partnering with FIFA in 2018, Hisense has marked four milestone collaborations: initial branding at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, content cooperation via FIFA+ in 2022, technology integration in VAR operations at the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 and now the upcoming FIFA World Cup 26 sponsorship. Each step strengthened Hisense's global presence and commitment to enhancing the fan experience.

A massive event deserves a massive screen. Enter Hisense's 116-inch Class UX Series model, the world's largest RGB-MiniLED TV.

In an RGB-MiniLED TV, the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) themselves are red, green and blue, rather than only white LEDs with a color filter. The result is cleaner contrast, higher peak brightness and better overall color accuracy.

As a career-long filmmaker, I probably know and care more about color accuracy than the average soccer fan. But you don't need to memorize the industry jargon or tech specs to appreciate the difference: Once you've seen it, you believe it.

Hisense is the origin of RGB-MiniLED and debuted it at CES earlier this year, and with this 116-inch stunner, you'll see the picture difference on a grand scale that's sure to get people talking.

With Hisense at the helm, your next watch party will please your guests no matter what country they're cheering for (except when Colombia is playing, in which case you should cheer for them, although I might be biased). When a technology brand like Hisense's products are being used by events as massive as important as the FIFA World Cup, you know they're doing something right.

In the aftermath of the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup Final, the U.S. Men's National Team leaders commended the culture fostered over the almost seven weeks in camp together. It felt like an important building block under head coach Mauricio Pochettino, who at the time of the Gold Cup had been with the USMNT for less than a year.

Veteran center back Tim Ream said the players developed a better understanding of Pochettino's expectations. Moving forward, it's up to everyone in this camp to continue that momentum.

“The guys who were here during the Gold Cup, we know what the standard needs to be, and what it is going forward,” Ream said. “Just making sure everybody's being held accountable, pushing each other, making sure we're on the same page —we're on the same team. We're trying to move things forward and make sure we're in a good position moving into the next year and into the World Cup.”

Twelve players return from the Gold Cup on Pochettino's latest 24-player roster as the USMNT gets set to face Korea Republic (Sept. 6; Harrison, New Jersey) and Japan (Sept. 9; Columbus, Ohio). That marks half the roster that will mix and apply that standard with 12 others called up in September.

Midfielder Tyler Adams said after the final in July that the standard must translate quickly, anticipating the current moment when the team regrouped in the fall.

“Continuing to try and push the standard of what we're trying to achieve and become a winning team is super important,” Adams said ahead of the friendly against Korea.

That standard is built on a culture of players determined to compete for their country. Pochettino has stressed at different times during his year-long tenure the importance of playing with pride for the crest; he sees that hunger serving as a baseline of a winning team.

Forward Tim Weah watched the Gold Cup unfold from afar while his then-club Juventus competed in the FIFA Club World Cup. He followed it closely, watching his teammates grind out gritty wins on the way to a final, including a defining penalty shootout in the quarterfinal against Costa Rica.

“I think we're just building off of that,” Weah said. “The group is looking lovely right now, loving the vibes and loving the energy that we have. The quality in training has been amazing. Being back after not being with them in the summer is just an amazing feeling, and anytime I'm here, I try to keep that vibe.”

Including the two September matches, the USMNT has three international windows this year to continue building under Pochettino. While Ream said there's no more pressure than usual, it's still an ultra-importantopportunity together with the 2026 FIFA World Cup in sight.

 “People will say, ‘Oh, it's a friendly.' But with the amount of time between now and the World Cup, there's no such thing as friendly games,” Ream said. “You have to be on it every single training session, every single game. The pressure is there on everybody to try to make the World Cup squad, and this is an opportunity for everybody who's here to perform.”

In recent interviews, the legendary U.S. forward has opened up on motherhood, and inspiring change as she navigates retired life.

Alex Morgan's football career is built on breaking barriers.

Even in retirement, the former United States Women's National Team (USWNT) forward is continuing to shatter glass ceilings.

In a recent move, a company she is a founder in – Togethxr – announced a partnership with English club London City Lionesses.

The side, who were promoted to the Women's Super League ahead of this season, will don the company's slogan “Everyone Watches Women's Sports” on their jerseys.

“We're joining forces to reaffirm that the future of women's sports is here,” Morgan said.

“It's global, and it's inevitable. London City Lionesses were born to disrupt football, and Togethxr was born to disrupt sports media.”

Alex Morgan with daughter Charlie.

Recently Morgan gave birth to her second child Enzo, five years on from having daughter Charlie.

Having one child while still actively playing and one while retired has made for vastly different experiences for the 36-year-old.

“It's been so great just being able to take a lot more time this time around with the kids,” she explained to SELF.

“At this time [with Charlie], I was moving to London to play with Tottenham Hotspur; I felt my body stretching in ways I wasn't used to before.

“[After her second pregnancy], I felt like I took care of my body, but I also gave it the grace to not go for a run or get in the gym… my body responded really well this time around, in being able to give birth and get back to feeling good.”

If she had given birth while still pursuing her career the second time around, Morgan will be well equipped for far better conditions, largely thanks to her own work behind the scenes.

Post-giving birth to Charlie, coming back to the field required major adjustments from both clubs and the NWSL itself.

“It was very difficult because there were no rules, there was no standard for moms in the NWSL or even on the national team,” she said on the Call Her Daddy podcast.

“It was interesting because I was being pulled in a million directions; I was trying to be a great mom, and I was trying to a great soccer player, so now having to write new rules and advocate for all moms [for] the future [of] soccer was a lot at once.

“There were a lot of challenges to work through and a lot of barriers to break down – now in the NWSL, we can proudly be able to stand tall and [know that] you can do it all, have a family and continue playing, which wasn't always the case.”

A post shared by Alex Morgan (@alexmorgan13)

Morgan has repped the iconic no.13 on the back of her jersey for the majority of her career.

In a move that speaks to her impact in this sport and the club itself, the San Diego Wave will be retiring her shirt.

A ceremony will take place on 7 September, cementing yet another chapter in this history-making career of hers.

“I feel so fortunate that I got to play five years with my daughter – on the field with her after games, special moments walking out before the game with her, her being in the stands waving to me,” she said.

“It's not only seeing them and how my journey is so unique to me, but also all the advocacy that I've worked for.”

Morgan has undeniably spearheaded the growth of women's football worldwide – though her boots are hung up, she is showing no signs of slowing down.

Lionel Messi could be coming to the end of his international career with Argentina ahead of next summer's FIFA World Cup

Lionel Messi has cast doubt over his participation at the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Messi, who will be 39 by the time the finals roll around next summer, scored twice as he signed off in style during Argentina's 3-0 win over Venezuela on Thursday.

The Inter Miami forward has already confirmed he will play no part in La Albiceleste's final CONMEBOL qualifier against Ecuador next week.

 




Signing off in style in his last official match in the country, over 85,000 fans packed into Estadio Monumental to catch one final glimpse of arguably their country's greatest-ever player.

Messi spoke to the media following his side's victory in Buenos Aires, admitting he is still unsure whether he will play at the 2026 edition in the United States, Mexico and Canada.

 




"Because of my age, the most logical thing is that I won't make it," began the 38-year-old forward.

"There are so many emotions, I've experienced so many things on this field. It's always a joy to play in Argentina with our people. We've been enjoying match after match for many years. I'm very happy; being able to finish in this way here is what I always dreamed of.

The ex-Barcelona star said he will listen to his body following Inter Miami's latest MLS season, but admits he is still swaying towards missing out next summer.

"Same as I said before about the World Cup that I don't think I'll play another," Messi added. "But well, we're almost there, so I'm excited and motivated to play it. Like I always say, I go day by day, going by how I feel.

 




"I'm trying to feel good and, above all, being honest with myself. When I feel good, I enjoy it, but when I don't, honestly, I don't have a good time, so I prefer not to be there if I don't feel good. So we'll see. I haven't made a decision about the World Cup.

"I'll finish the season, then I'll have pre-season, and there will be six months left. So, we'll see how I feel. Hopefully, I'll have a good pre-season in 2026 and finish this MLS season well, and then I'll decide."

Hello! It's the end of an era at Tottenham Hotspur. And a massive jolt in Premier League circles.

On the way:

No analysis of Tottenham Hotspur is complete without some reference to Daniel Levy. The seasons they lost, the fabulous stadium they acquired, the trophies they didn't win, and the Europa League they collected in May: all of it had Levy's fingerprints on it.

The Europa League was Spurs' first significant honour in 17 years, and for some time now, portions of their fanbase have been desperate to oust Levy, objecting to a fairly bare timeline of success. Yesterday, without any warning, they got their way. Levy departed his role as club chairman after almost a quarter of a century in the job.

I can't stress how much of a bolt from the blue this is. Jack Pitt-Brooke writes this morning of the rank and file being in complete shock. Levy has been synonymous with both the evolution of Tottenham and the evolution of the Premier League, one of the competition's most prominent (albeit guarded and private) figures. Controversial or not, on his watch, Spurs have changed beyond recognition. The stadium they opened in 2019 is football's equivalent of a palace.

But it's a fact that tangible achievement on the pitch has been sparse. Tottenham made a fist of challenging for the Premier League title on a couple of occasions, never quite crossing the line, and they reached the 2019 Champions League final, but the reality of being also-rans niggled their fans, as did a high turnover of coaches and their comparatively low wages-to-revenue ratio. In the eyes of some, ambition was sacrificed on the altar of stable management.

And it seems that latterly, Tottenham's majority owner, the Lewis family, grew tired of Levy's safe hands, too. According to a source spoken to by The Athletic, it was they who chose to remove Levy from the boardroom after a forensic review of operations. “Generations of the Lewis family support this special football club, and they want what the fans want — more wins, more often,” the source said. “This is a new era.”

With hindsight, maybe we should have seen this coming. Spurs have undergone a sweeping change of personnel in the past few months, from the technical area — where Thomas Frank replaced Ange Postecoglou — to the appointment of a new CEO, Vinai Venkatesham. Peter Charrington, a close ally of the Lewis family, is replacing Levy in a new role of non-executive chairman.

In a statement, Levy said he was “incredibly proud of the work I have done” and what can't be denied is that he leaves behind a modern, upwardly mobile club with an estimated value of £4bn ($5.4bn). Spurs are in rude health and have plenty going for them, with an arena to envy. Levy earned a reputation as a ferocious negotiator of transfer deals. Under his control, they just couldn't translate that health into regular trophies. His presence had become divisive among their supporters.

My first thought on reading the news of his shock exit was: does this mean Tottenham are for sale? Informed indications, along with the tone of the Lewis family statement, suggest they are not, but we'll see. I'll also watch with interest now to find out a) if Spurs' competitive edge actually sharpens, and b) how history remembers Levy. “When I'm not here, I'm sure I'll get the credit,” he told The Overlap only last month. Time might well be kind to his legacy.

The parting of ways between Manchester City and Ederson was one of those scenarios that seemed to be in the ether for ages. Perhaps the fact it was on the cards for so long explains why he left this week without the attention given to Kevin De Bruyne.

As I wrote on Monday, Ederson is a Premier League all-timer: a winner of just about every trophy there is to win and a man who changed the nature of goalkeeping in the division.

Thom Harris has written about his time in England today and as you pick through the memories, you'll be reminded of just how revolutionary he was. He epitomised Pep Guardiola's attitude that a goalkeeper should be as competent in possession as an outfield player.

Ederson's positioning, his outlandish passing over distance (above), and his courage on the ball set a new standard, and nothing says that better than the doubt about whether new signing Gianluigi Donnarumma — one of the world's best — has the skill with his feet to fill big shoes, big gloves, and an era-defining hole.

On Sunday, San Diego Wave will honour Alex Morgan by retiring her No 13 jersey. She's one of a select few who merit that special form of acknowledgement, an icon who brought women's football to the fore.

Think of Morgan and you naturally think of her famous pink hairband. I loved reading the story of its incarnation and I hadn't realised the trademark fashion accessory was made from nothing more than pre-wrap, a modest product designed for athletes' ankles to stop them from rolling. Funny how these things grow legs.

Manchester United forward Bryan Mbeumo produced a top-class performance, helping Cameroon to a comfortable 3-0 victory over lowly Eswatini.

Mbeumo has certainly looked the part since joining United during the summer transfer window from Brentford.

He has undoubtedly been one of United's better players during what has been an uncertain start to the new season, with his displays earning him a nomination for the club's August Player of the Month award.

Mbeumo scored his first goal for United in the embarrassing EFL Cup defeat to Grimsby Town before opening his Premier League account in the subsequent game against Burnley.

The 26-year-old was named in the starting XI for Cameroon's World Cup qualifier against Eswatini on Thursday and led his nation to a dominant win.

Mbeumo wasted no time in asserting himself on the game, playing a big role in Cameroon's opener just six minutes into proceedings.

He fired a shot from outside the box, which struck Gift Gamedze before looping over the Eswatini goalkeeper and into the back of the net. Unluckily for Mbeumo, it was judged to be an own goal.

Less than 20 minutes later, the United man was at it again, this time delivering a sumptuous pinpoint cross inside the box to Georges-Kevin Nkoudou, who rose highest to head home.

Arthur Nvom added a third just moments after, securing the victory for Cameroon and dashing whatever hopes Eswatini may have harboured of a comeback.

Mbeumo was on the pitch for 82 minutes before he was taken off.

Also on the pitch for the Indomitable Lions was Andre Onana, although he was largely a bystander in front of goal and didn't have much to do.

Mbeumo and Onana are back in action on Tuesday, 9 September, when Cameroon take on table leaders Cape Verde at Estádio Nacional de Cabo Verde.

A few weeks ago, Noahkai Banks was just checking his e-mail and he saw a message in his inbox from U.S. Soccer.

It was unsurprising at first because he knew the United States U-20 national team was having a camp during the September window and as a regular, he was expecting a call-up to that team. 

Once he started reading the e-mail, it was much different than what he expected. It was a formal call-up by Mauricio Pochettino to the senior national team for friendlies against South Korea and Japan. 

Banks, 18, was stunned by the news and quickly made all the appropriate phone calls. 

“I was very surprised to be honest, and my first reaction was I couldn't believe it and I called my mom instantly,” Banks told Soccer America at the team's camp in Morristown, New Jersey. “She couldn't believe it as well. And then after my coach called me.”

A sold out stadium of 85 thousand in Buenos Aires witness two farewell Lionel Messi goals in World Cup qualifier.

Lionel Messi made sure he had good memories of playing a home qualifier with Argentina's national team for the last time in his illustrious career.

The former Barcelona forward scored twice on Thursday in Argentina's 3-0 victory over Venezuela in front of a raucous sellout crowd that had gathered at Estadio Monumental to bid him farewell.

“Being able to finish this way here is what I've always dreamed of,” Messi said.

“I've experienced a lot of things on this pitch, both good and not so good, but it's always a joy to play in Argentina, in front of our fans.”

Messi is yet to give any clues about when he will retire from the top level of the sport, but the qualifiers for the 2030 World Cup will begin in 2027, when he is 40.

The Argentina captain scored in the 39th and 80th minutes, and Lautaro Martinez added a goal in the 76th.

Messi now has 36 goals in South American World Cup qualifiers and remains the all-time scoring leader.

His Inter Miami teammate, Luis Suarez, has 29 goals in continental qualifying, but he has retired from Uruguay's national team. Bolivia's Marcelo Moreno Martins is third with 22.

Looking ahead, Messi clarified he will only compete in next year's World Cup if he feels physically fit.

“I'm excited, eager. It's day by day, feeling the sensations. If I feel good, I enjoy it; if not, I'd rather not be there,” he said, adding that the nine months until the tournament kicks off “is a long time”.

Already qualified, the World Cup champions extended their tally to 38 points and will remain atop the South American qualifying standings regardless of what happens in the last round next Tuesday.

Venezuela, trying to qualify for its first World Cup, remains on 18 points and in seventh place. They're still in contention to advance to an intercontinental playoff.

FIFA World Cup ticket sales begin next week and fans can expect sharp price increases

Dynamic pricing will be in play as soon as tickets go on sale for next summer's World Cup, FIFA has confirmed.

The practice has been unpopular with regular event-goers for some time but rocketed to mainstream attention when tickets for Oasis's UK comeback tour and the 2025 Club World Cup went on sale.

Dynamic pricing automatically changes the cost of tickets for an event in line with demand, surprisingly always upwards and rarely in the other direction.

 




Football's governing body has revealed that the cheapest World Cup tickets will start at £44 and the most expensive final ticket will start at £5,760. No pricing in between has been confirmed.

“FIFA never ran a baseline study to determine how much revenue could be generated from 2026 World Cup ticket sales without dynamic pricing, suggesting the topic was never really up for debate,” according to The Guardian.

 




The Guardian reports FIFA's dynamic pricing for the Club World Cup yielded mixed results and did indeed drop, a remarkable indictment of the low level of interest in some of those matches.

World Cup tickets will surely be a different story. They'll be sold in four different stages between September and next summer and fans can expect the starting prices to be long forgotten by the time they get their hands on them.

“The pricing structure is expected to be put into place immediately for the first phase of ticket sales,” writes Alexander Abnos. “Prices will fluctuate based on demand from that point on, meaning that some matches will have higher minimum price points than others before the World Cup draw has even begun.

“The practice has also attracted complaints from fans priced out of events – including in high-profile cases surrounding Oasis's tour and last season's FA Cup final.”

 




FIFA also confirmed it would “operate a resale marketplace” to cut off scalpers. Individual ticket buyers can buy a maximum of four tickets per match and are limited to ten matches across the World Cup.

The 23rd World Cup will be played, surely with with no little controversy, in the United States, Mexico and Canada in June and July next year.

48 teams will play 104 matches in 16 host cities in the newly expanded tournament, for which the finals draw will be made in December in Washington, D.C.

“The draw had been expected to be held in Las Vegas, which is where it was completed when the US hosted the 1994 tournament,” according to BBC Sport.

“However, the draw, on 5 December, will instead go ahead at the Kennedy Center – the performing arts venue where [Donald] Trump is chairman.”

 Novak Djokovic has busted out two different on-court moves after his 2025 US Open wins, both to honour his daughter Tara. 

 Most recently, after his quarter-final win over Taylor Fritz, the seventh seed delighted — and, perhaps, perplexed — fans by pretending to take a slug from a bottle, then performing a shoulder-shaking dance. 

 This, he said, was to send a message to his daughter on her eighth birthday, explaining that the choreography is from the chart-topping song “Soda Pop” from her fave film, KPop Demon Hunters, Netflix's most watched movie ever. 

 “We are at home doing different choreographies, and this is one of them,” the Serb superstar said while still on court. “Hopefully I'll make her smile when she wakes up in the morning.” 

 Djokovic, who is in the hunt for his 25th Grand Slam singles title, has also reprised his impression of a violin virtuoso, tucking his racquet under his chin to use as an instrument. This move was inspired by Tara too, who had just learned to play when he concocted it two years ago.

 While Djokovic “soda-pops” his way into the semi-finals, other winners are showcasing new moves too. Here's a look at some signature celebrations—and what they mean.

 Alcaraz Takes A Swing  
Who will be celebrating after Friday's match between Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz? On his way into the semi-final showdown, the Spanish star has used his racquet to simulate a golf swing, a gesture he directed toward golfing great (and pal) Rory McIlroy, who was in the stadium when Alcarez beat Reilly Opelka in Round 1. 

  “I think I own it,” Alcarez said of the move after he swung a second time, celebrating his Round 2 defeat of Mattia Bellucci.

For the third year running, Aryna Sabalenka has played her way into the US Open final, outlasting Jessica Pegula in three sets. Pegula had her moments, but Sabalenka's 42 winners and eight aces made the difference.

Once again, Aryna Sabalenka has played her way into the US Open final. On Thursday night she fought back from a set down, beating Jessica Pegula 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 with the kind of grit and serving power that has come to define her run at the top.

It will be Sabalenka's seventh Grand Slam final -- her fourth in the past five majors and her third in a row in New York -- leaving her one win from successfully defending her US Open title. She'll face Amanda Anisimova for the trophy on Saturday.

"In this match I was actually just trying to take one step at a time," Sabalenka said afterward. "I was, like, it's OK if you didn't close it from the first match point. You're playing great tennis. Just go try and [be] better."

The roof was closed over Arthur Ashe Stadium as the rain arrived, creating still conditions that suited both players. Pegula took full advantage early, playing a sharp, measured opening set that kept Sabalenka off balance. She limited herself to only three unforced errors, stayed aggressive on return and drew the crowd into every rally.

Sabalenka steadied in the second. Her game grew sharper, while Pegula's level dipped, producing nine errors in that set alone. By the end, the power numbers told the story: Sabalenka finished with 43 winners to Pegula's 21. Sabalenka also hit eight aces. 

The deciding set delivered the night's biggest drama. Pegula carved out four break points but couldn't convert, as Sabalenka's serve again held firm.

That reliance on her serve would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. After reworking her motion in 2022, Sabalenka's delivery has become the backbone of her game, and it was the weapon that ultimately separated the two on Thursday night.

Pegula gave credit to the level on both sides, admitting she couldn't find the breakthrough late.

"Yeah, I thought it was really high-level," she said. "I don't really know what else to say. I don't know how I didn't break back in the third.

"I mean, I thought I played some really good points to win the first. She upped her level, started serving a lot better in the second. Then I felt like it was really even in the third. Like, there wasn't that much difference. I felt like we were both serving pretty well."

She added that, despite the loss, she felt her approach was sharper than in previous meetings.

"I think strategically I played her much better than I have played her the last few times," Pegula said. "I feel like going into the next match, I kind of know what I need to do. Obviously executing it is a different story.

THAT ROAR 🐅#USOpen pic.twitter.com/om2LEAmpMR

"I think there were some things, very small things, I could have done different at the end, but it's, like, I mean, I'm nitpicking things. If she's going to come out and I was hitting some good returns and she's going to blast first-ball winners, literally some of them on the line, I don't know what I'm supposed to do about that."

For Sabalenka, the takeaway was another chance at the biggest prize.

"I'm super excited to give myself another opportunity, another final," Sabalenka said. "If I'll be able to hold that trophy, it's going to mean a lot for me. I'll be just the happiest person on earth probably."

The 23-year-old American looked on the brink of defeat at several points against Osaka—but steadied herself in the second set, dominating the tiebreak and carrying that momentum through the decider. She closed out the late-night contest just before 1 in the morning after a marathon two hours and 56 minutes on court.The semifinal was a showcase of two of the sport's cleanest ball-strikers, both in the midst of resurgent second acts. Osaka was returning from a mental health break and maternity leave after giving birth to daughter Shai in 2023, while Anisimova also stepped away from tennis in 2023 before launching her comeback.Anisimova is now enjoying a career-best season, winning her first WTA 1000 title in Doha and making her long-awaited Top 10 debut in July after reaching the final at Wimbledon. At this time last year, she was ranked No. 50 in the world.

Rajeev Ram is taking the high road after fellow American Mardy Fish took shots at him on social media during the build-up to the US Open.It all started two weeks ago, when Jannik Sinner retired mid-match from the Cincinnati Open final due to illness, and then withdrew from US Open mixed doubles with Katerina Siniakova—leaving a spot open in the new 16-team draw.Read More: US Open forges new world with revamped mixed doubles tournamentTennis Channel's Jon Wertheim suggested on X (formerly Twitter) that 41-year-old Ram should replace him as a wild card, but many were surprised to see a sharp rebuke from Fish, 43:“How bout another actual tennis player?” Fish wrote.The comment sparked backlash, with many questioning the animosity and pointing out the irony given Fish's 2021 Netflix documentary Breaking Point, in which he opened up about his own mental health struggles in sports.

How bout another actual tennis player

Speaking on an episode of The Changeover Podcast, Ram admitted he was “shocked” by the comments and called out what he saw as hypocrisy.“It is really strange… I mean, the guy that positioned himself as the mental health advocate, and rightfully so, is taking shots at another player—as you said, a compatriot—from behind a keyboard,” Ram said.“No matter what I might think about somebody personally, I could never see myself doing that in a million years.”Ram also expressed concern for Fish's wellbeing: “I mean, I hope he's okay. I don't think he's okay, if he's doing that kind of thing, but I hope he finds a way to get better from that.”He reflected on their strained relationship, but stopped short of revealing details.“He's actually somebody I looked up to for a really long time,” Ram said. “He's a couple years older than me… He had a great career, was a Top 10 player, was our Davis Cup captain for a while.“We haven't spoken to each other in three years, since… summer or fall of 2022.”

It was in the fall 2022 when Fish, as Davis Cup captain, controversially left Ram—then the world No. 1 in doubles—off the U.S. team. Fish instead selected Taylor Fritz, Frances Tiafoe and Tommy Paul, along with Jack Sock as the doubles specialist. The decision backfired when the U.S. crashed out in the quarterfinals—losing the deciding doubles rubber against Italy.Moments after the loss, which came on Thanksgiving Day, Ram seemed to add salt to the wound with an X post: “How's everyone's Thanksgiving going?”Read More: Happy Thanksgiving... or not?

Fish, who reached three Grand Slam quarterfinals and peaked at No. 7 in the world in the early 2000s, retired in 2015 after a years-long battle with anxiety and depression. He served as U.S. Davis Cup captain for three years before stepping down in January 2023.Ram is a six-time Grand Slam champion, winning four titles in men's doubles with Joe Salisbury—including three straight at the US Open (2021-2023), along with two mixed doubles titles with Barbora Krejcikova.On Wednesday, Ram and Nikola Mektic, the No. 11 seeds, were eliminated from the US Open men's doubles after falling to No. 14 seeds Michael Venus and Yuki Bhambri, 6-3, 6-7 (6), 6-3.

NEW YORK—To borrow a phrase from the neighboring New York Mets, Ya gotta believe.Jessica Pegula did that, and even took a one-set lead over world No. 1 and frequent tormentor Aryna Sabalenka. She hit just 15 unforced errors against 21 winners, and lost only four points on serve entire third set.But belief, and a lot of great tennis, ultimately weren't enough against her opponent's bold barrage Thursday night in Arthur Ashe Stadium. A zoning Sabalenka was simply too good, defending her turf with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory that puts her in the US Open final for the third straight season."She came up with some ridiculous shots," an incredulous Pegula said in her post-match press conference. Indeed, nearly half of Sabalenka's total points won—43 of 90—were winners."Like, I didn't feel like I did much wrong. So, yeah, it seemed like the level was really high, and we were pushing each other every single game."

Under constant attack, the fourth-ranked American battled throughout the two-hour and five-minute battle, often from deficits. It was admirable, if futile."She played incredible tennis as always," the defending champion said in her on-court interview. "She's just a great player, great fighter—always tough matches."Pegula had lost her last three collisions with Sabalenka, all in massive finals, including at last year on this court. She had lost seven of their nine meetings overall, each in straight sets. But ignoring the past, Pegula locked in on the present. And as a result, this meeting was the most competitive, and compelling, of their rivalry.

It didn't appear to be heading in that direction from the onset. In total command of her service games, Sabalenka took a brisk, 4-2 first-set lead. The pressure on Pegula to take care of her own service games was enormous.Then, a plot twist: Pegula broke. Yes, it was via Sabalenka double fault, but a break is a break. Then Pegula held at love—and broke again. Now she led 5-4.Riding a wave of momentum, Pegula held another time at love to cap an unexpected four-game run. The crowd, which included plenty if a minority of Sabalenka support, responded."The crowd was insane, as always," Pegula said. "Arthur Ashe, 7:00 p.m., there is no place better to play as an American. So that's something that was really fun. The atmosphere is incredible, like always."Pegula needed two things, in my mind, to make an upset possible: a fast start, and the crowd to become a factor. Two boxes checked, one set down.

Pegula served brilliantly, winning 71 percent of her first serves—just one percentage point behind Sabalenka—and 62 percent of her second-serve points. But only converting two break points proved pivotal.© 2025 Getty Images

But none of it fazed Sabalenka, who at 27 after three major titles may still be approaching her peak. Once again, she took a 4-2 lead. This time, though, she followed with an easy hold.Emblematic of the entire match, Pegula didn't go away, forcing the best from her opponent. It took Sabalenka three set points, but she took this semifinal to a third set."It maybe dipped a little bit in the second," Pegula said of her serve. "I mean, she served a lot better in the second, as well."Then I felt like it was really even in the third."

When Sabalenka took a 2-0 lead in the decider, the pressure on Pegula's service games somehow intensified. She answered the call repeatedly, winning 18 of 22 points on serve in the third set (9 of 11 on both first and second serves), including love holds in her last four service games. Considering the circumstances, it was one of the finest serving displays of the 31-year-old's entire carerer.Pegula would also reach break point four times in the set, including three times in the 3-2 game.Sabalenka didn't blink."The first game, unfortunately, ended up being the difference," Pegula said of the final set, "but after that I was holding really easily and I felt like just putting so much pressure on her serve every single time. I thought I served so much better than when I played her last time."

The only time Sabalenka did blink was on her first match point: Scrambling behind the baseline, Pegula hit a defensive lob to keep her chances alive. They remained so when Sabalenka, with plenty of time, bashed an overhead into the net."I was super emotional," Sabalenka said about the miss, which elicited the biggest crowd reaction of the night. "I was just, like, 'Oh, my gosh, no way it's happening. Please, just close this match.'"Why was Sabalenka so emotional? As she told TENNIS.com's David Kane, "Because I badly wanted to give myself another opportunity, another final, and I want to prove to myself that I learned those tough lessons and I can do better in the finals."

She plays really fearless, and that works for her. Jessica Pegula on Aryna Sabalenka

Sabalenka gave Pegula a lifeline, but she didn't give away much else. The Buffalo, N.Y. native saved a second match point with a crisp backhand Sabalenka couldn't handle, but she not earn another break point."I thought it was really high-level," said Pegula, who hit 21 winners against 15 unforced errors, and won just two fewer total points than Sabalenka. "I don't really know what else to say. I don't know how I didn't break back in the third."Like the second set, Sabalenka was pushed to a third set point—a third match point. Once again, the third time was a charm for Sabalenka.And now, she's into her third consecutive US Open final."I think I really played great tennis," Sabalenka said. "I think I handled that pressure really well."I'm super proud of this win."

TECH TALK – The best Monza mods in the quest for speed 

2025 Italian GP FP2: Onboard as Norris sets the fastest lap of second practice at Monza

It was an early end to Friday practice for Kimi Antonelli at his home Grand Prix in Italy with a spin into the gravel trap.

Kimi Antonelli has admitted that he simply “pushed a bit too hard” too early during second practice for the Italian Grand Prix, with a spin ending his session after just 10 minutes of running.

Antonelli, returning to the scene of his dramatic FP1 debut 12 months ago, lost control of his Mercedes at the exit of Monza's Lesmo 2 corner in the opening exchanges of FP2 and ended up beached in the gravel.

Talking through the moment, which followed a similar off during FP1 at Zandvoort last time out, Antonelli said: “I mean, I just pushed a bit too hard for the grip in the moment. It was a shame. The day was looking good; I had a good FP1 and then the start of FP2 was looking strong.

“My confidence is still high, just obviously tomorrow I will have to do a bit of a different programme [in FP3]. We'll try to be ready for anything.”

He added: “I felt pretty confident [before that]. We were moving in the right direction with the set-up. Obviously it's a shame to miss laps, but on my side I'll try to get ready and to deliver the best job tomorrow.”

As for Saturday's action and what might be possible when it comes to Qualifying, Antonelli is hoping the “amazing” home atmosphere can spur him on to a strong result in what looks set to be another ultra-close session.

“I think Qualifying is going to be very tight, as always,” he said. “It looks pretty close out there – in four-tenths there were 10 cars [at the end of FP2]. It's going to be very tight.

“But as I said, the pace felt pretty good today. We'll just try to deliver the best job as possible and try to start as far forward as possible tomorrow.”

On the other side of the Mercedes garage, George Russell ground to a halt in the closing stages of FP1 with a hydraulics issue, but he got back out on track for the start of FP2 and ended the day in 10th position.

“It was a tricky day to be honest,” Russell said afterwards. “I think always when you come to Monza, you're back on that low downforce [package], so the car's sort of floating around and the rear's pretty loose. It didn't feel spectacular out there for us today.

“Obviously it's very close on the leaderboard; I think I was P10 but only three-tenths off – usually three-tenths would be just behind the McLarens. It's tight, I expect that to be the same tomorrow, and I'm sure we can make some improvements.”

'It was tough' - Lawson admits Racing Bulls 'missed a little bit' in Friday practice

Dunne ‘learned a lot' in FP1 outing for McLaren at Monza

Lando Norris and McLaren were the combination to beat as practice continued at Monza on Friday afternoon.

Lando Norris put McLaren at the top of the timesheets during Friday's second practice session for the Italian Grand Prix, leading the way from Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Williams' Carlos Sainz – while home driver Kimi Antonelli spun out early on.

After Lewis Hamilton led a Ferrari 1-2 in first practice, to the delight of the passionate Tifosi packing Monza's grandstands and grass banks, drivers and teams returned to the track for another hour of running on Friday afternoon – FP2 getting under way at 1700 local time.

All 20 cars were quick to emerge from their garages when the green light switched on at the end of the pit lane, with Oscar Piastri reclaiming his McLaren from F2 racer Alex Dunne and Franco Colapinto taking his Alpine back from reserve Paul Aron following their FP1 outings.

Despite a cracked mirror, Piastri posted the fastest time of the opening minutes with a 1m 21.212s, before team mate Norris (who had coincidentally lost one of his mirrors altogether) lowered the benchmark to a 1m 21.012s – both drivers initially running medium tyres.

Drama then ensued when Alpine driver Pierre Gasly went too deep entering the Ascari chicane, ran through the gravel and littered stones over the track, before Antonelli lost control of his Mercedes through Lesmo 2, beached it at the exit and caused a red flag.

A brief stoppage followed as marshals cleared Antonelli's car, allowing McLaren to carry out some mirror repairs on Piastri and Norris' cars, with 45 minutes still remaining on the FP2 clock when Race Control declared that the circuit was clear once more.

FORMULA 1 PIRELLI GRAN PREMIO D'ITALIA 2025

Further runs on Pirelli's medium and hard compound tyres duly triggered a flurry of changes at the top of the times – Leclerc clocking a 1m 20.937s, Max Verstappen producing a 1m 20.710s and Sainz getting down to a 1m 20.583s.

Elsewhere, Piastri and Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto were shown clattering the kerbs at the exit of Lesmo 2, while Albon just about held onto his Williams after a dramatic mid-corner snap through Lesmo 1 – the latter two asking for checks to be carried out on their floors.

Around halfway into the session, drivers began to make the switch to the soft tyres, bringing a new pace-setting effort of 1m 19.878s from Norris, despite the Briton being forced to abandon his first lap on the red-marked rubber via a moment exiting the Roggia chicane.

Leclerc and Verstappen experienced troubles of their own on the soft rubber; Leclerc running wide exiting Lesmo 2 and reporting “no grip at all – like zero”; and Verstappen reporting that his car was becoming “really jumpy” and “really nervous on every little bump”.

When the final soft-shod laps came in, before drivers switched their focus to longer runs, Leclerc made a significant improvement to go second to Norris by 0.083s, before another off at the Ascari chicane, while Sainz backed up his early-session pace to slot into third.

Piastri wound up in fourth position, ahead of a trip to the stewards for allegedly entering the fast lane of the pit lane before the session restart, followed closely by Hamilton – who had a late trip through the gravel at the exit of Lesmo 2 – and Verstappen.

Albon underlined Williams' strong start to the weekend in seventh, despite his earlier dramas, ahead of Nico Hulkenberg's Sauber, Yuki Tsunoda's Red Bull and George Russell's Mercedes, which returned to the track for the start of FP2 after his early-day hydraulic issues.

Isack Hadjar was the quickest Racing Bulls driver in 11th, from Bortoleto (also noted by the stewards for an apparent yellow flag breach) and the Aston Martin and Haas machines of Lance Stroll, Oliver Bearman, Fernando Alonso and Esteban Ocon.

The final positions were filled by Lawson, Gasly, the sidelined Antonelli and Colapinto, with drivers and teams now set to reconvene in the paddock to dig through the data and prepare for Saturday's final practice session at 1230 local time.

TECH TALK – The best Monza mods in the quest for speed 

2025 Italian GP FP2: Onboard as Norris sets the fastest lap of second practice at Monza

While Ferrari has yet to win a race this season, the loyal Tifosi will be hoping drivers Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton can use the positive energy around Monza to come out on top

Monza's Temple of Speed, nestled in the dense woodland of a royal park, is the home of Italian motorsport and a place where Ferrari's faithful – the Tifosi – come to pay homage to the racing team whom they worship.

Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton knows what this place means to Italy, having made 18 Grand Prix appearances here, but he's about to experience it in a very different way at the 19th time of asking.

This time, he'll be dressed in red, Ferrari red, and he will be one of two drivers who Italy will want to win. The Briton knows a little of what it feels like already, having received the adoration of the Ferrari fans at Imola earlier this year for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, but Monza is another level.

'It was tough' - Lawson admits Racing Bulls 'missed a little bit' in Friday practice

Dunne ‘learned a lot' in FP1 outing for McLaren at Monza

Lewis Hamilton is preparing for his first race weekend at the historic Monza circuit as a Ferrari driver.

Lewis Hamilton is embracing the “good energy” from Ferrari's passionate fans as he aims to give them something to cheer about at the Italian Grand Prix – despite heading into it with a grid penalty.

Hamilton has experienced a mixed first season at the Scuderia, with plenty to get used to on and off the track, but the seven-time World Champion starts his Monza weekend in high spirits after some special pre-race activities.

Indeed, Hamilton and team mate Charles Leclerc were greeted by a huge crowd of Tifosi at a Ferrari gathering in Milan on Wednesday, underlining the incredible support both drivers and the team will have behind them this weekend.

“It was such a unique experience,” said Hamilton during Thursday's driver press conference. “Already from yesterday morning, getting to [the Ferrari factory in] Maranello, when you walk in and see the Ferrari logo… I still have to pinch myself.

“There are people outside the factory always. I've never seen fans outside the factory before, in any of my years. You see that every single time [here]. There's clearly just so much love for this brand, and what it means to people.

“To be in Milan, really in the heart of it all, seeing the fans and just how passionate they were, it was intense, but very, very positive. I really tried to harness all of that good energy that they gave us.”

As for what Ferrari might be able to achieve at Monza, Hamilton expressed cautious optimism following the “loads of positives” he felt at the Dutch Grand Prix last time out.

“Every weekend is the first time driving this car at a track, and the approach is different from my previous experiences,” he reiterated. “When you go to these places the set-up's different, so it's always new, which I'm enjoying at the moment.

“I think Ferrari have generally gone pretty well [here] in the past years. Obviously they won here last year, with a great strategy and great drive from Charles.

“I'm just really keen to see how the car works here. We're definitely learning from weekend to weekend, [with] loads of positives to take from the last, so we just have to keep building on that.”

Pushed on whether he has wondered what it would be like to stand on the Monza podium as a Ferrari driver, Hamilton added: “Honestly, I haven't, simply because I've been on that podium plenty of times here.

“I know what it's like to be up there, I've seen how it's been for other Ferrari drivers, and anything I try to imagine it'll be far from it, of what that feeling could be.”

Nonetheless, Hamilton is aware of the task ahead given that he will take a five-place grid penalty on Sunday, having been penalised for a yellow flag breach on the reconnaissance laps before the Zandvoort race.

“It's going to be challenging this weekend,” he commented. “Qualifying is already… it's already so close between us all, so just getting into Q3 is tough, getting into the top five is very, very tough.

“Then, on top of that, to be set back five places is not great when you're going into your first Monza [race] with Ferrari, but it gives me more to fight for and I'm very motivated to make up those places.”

Jorma Taccone is on the mend after a frightening accident that happened while celebrating his daughter's fifth birthday. The TV comedian, actor, and writer, best known for his nine-year run on “Saturday Night Live” as part of The Lonely Island alongside Andy Samberg and Akiva Schaffer, updated fans on his health during the latest episode of “The Lonely Island and Seth Meyers Podcast.”

Phoning in from his hospital bed, Taccone joined Samberg, Schaffer, and Seth Meyers to share what happened. 

A post shared by The Lonely Island and Seth Meyers Podcast (@lonelymeyerspod)

“We've had an incident with one of our members that we're gonna address right off the top,” Meyers said before handing it over to Taccone, who began recounting the ordeal with humor despite his pain.

Taccone explained that the accident took place in August as he was painting a mural on the side of a barn for his daughter's birthday celebration. He admitted he had borrowed a rickety ladder despite warnings.

“I'm probably 20 feet off the ground on this very rickety ladder… the base of the ladder is not good,” Taccone recalled. “In this moment, my life flashes before my eyes. I'm like, ‘Oh no, I've got to get off this ladder.' I had enough time as I'm falling to be like, ‘I'm going to die.'”

Taccone said he fell straight onto his lower back, taking the full force of the impact. “Then I do a lot of screaming and cursing. Keep in mind, it's my daughter's fifth birthday party, so it wasn't the coolest way to start the day. I'm like, ‘Call an ambulance!'”

The accident left Taccone with significant injuries, including a shattered pelvis, a damaged disc, and a detached sacrum, all requiring surgery. “It takes a while to schedule the surgery because they wanted to do the front part and back part as well,” he explained.

His doctors have told him he may be able to walk again in three to six months. “So we shall see,” Taccone said, noting that he currently requires assistance to stand. He is undergoing acute rehab and physical therapy as part of his recovery.

Despite the severity of his injuries, Taccone managed to joke about the experience with his longtime collaborators. “It's definitely no joke, and it's not the funniest way to start a podcast,” he said with a laugh.

His friends and co-hosts responded with heartfelt support. Akiva Schaffer told him, “We love you, and you know we've been worried sick.” 

Taccone, who shares two children with wife Marielle Heller, said the experience has been life-changing, but he is grateful to be surrounded by love, humor, and encouragement as he heals.

Anthropic has agreed to pay at least $1.5 billion into a class action fund as part of a settlement of litigation brought by a group of book authors.


	The sum, disclosed in a court filing on Friday, “will be the largest publicly reported copyright recovery in history, larger than any other copyright class action settlement or any individual copyright case litigated to final judgment,” the attorneys for the authors wrote.


	The settlement also includes a provision that releases Anthropic only for its conduct up the August 25, meaning that new claims could be filed over future conduct, according to the filing. Anthropic also has agreed to destroy the datasets used in its models.

	The settlement figure amounts to about $3,000 per class work, according to the filing.

Read the terms of Anthropic's copyright settlement.


	A hearing in the case is scheduled for Sept. 8.


	Last month, Anthropic and the authors' group said that they had reached a “settlement in principle” of the creators' lawsuit.


	In June, U.S. District Judge William Alsup ruled that Anthropic's use of the books in training models was “exceedingly transformative,” one of the factors courts have used in determining whether the use of protected works without authorization was a legal “fair use.” His decision was the first major decision that weighed the fair use question in generative AI systems.


	Yet Alsup also ruled that Anthropic had to face a trial on the question of whether it is liable for downloading millions of pirated books in digital form off the internet, something it had to do in order to train its models for its AI service Claude.


	“That Anthropic later bought a copy of a book it earlier stole off the internet will not absolve it of liability for the theft but it may affect the extent of statutory damages,” the judge wrote.


	Alsup's summary judgment ruling came in a case brought by a group of authors, including Andrea Bartz, author of The Lost Night: A Novel, The Herd, We Were Never Here, and The Spare Room. They argued that the use of their works to train Claude violated copyright law.

	











	A trial in the case was scheduled to start in December.


	Anthropic's deputy general counsel, Aparna Sridhar, said in a statement, “In June, the District Court issued a landmark ruling on AI development and copyright law, finding that Anthropic's approach to training AI models constitutes fair use. Today's settlement, if approved, will resolve the plaintiffs' remaining legacy claims. We remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery, and solve complex problems.”


	Despite the huge pay out, Anthropic still sees the judge's earlier ruling as a victory, as he determined that their use of copyrighted material in training models was a “fair use.” With it unlikely that Congress will pass any kind of legislation at this point to address such use, and President Donald Trump siding with tech firms, courts have been left to resolve such disputes.


	Nevertheless, the judge found potential liability in the way that Anthropic obtained the material for its models, by downloading materials from online libraries. Anthropic faced the risk of prolonged litigation and losing on that point.


	The settlement comes as Hollywood studios have been stepping up challenges to the use of the intellectual property in AI systems. On Thursday, Warner Bros. Discovery sued Midjourney, claiming that an AI image-generation service resulted in AI outputs of characters from Superman to Tweety Bird. WBD was joining two other legacy studios, NBCUniversal and The Walt Disney Co., in seeking court judgments against the company. 


	The authors' legal team, led by Justin Nelson of Susman Godfrey, wrote in the filing that on “a per-work basis, the settlement amount is 4 times larger than $750 statutory damages amount that a jury could award and 15 times larger than the $200 amount if Anthropic were to prevail on its defense of innocent infringement.”

The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein once said that “if a lion could speak, we could not understand him.” That our references and experiences of the world are so different that even a shared language could not allow humans to commune with an animal.

In Ildikó Enyedi's “Silent Friend,” communication between plants and people lies far beyond words, but it is perhaps possible to connect with them more profoundly than we previously assumed. Her cinema has never been content with surfaces, instead preferring to peer beneath the everyday

 










Never a filmmaker content with surfaces, her Enyedi has always been about peering underneath the everyday and finding something curious. Her 2017 Golden Bear winner “On Body and Soul” married tenderness with surrealism in a love story set around, of all places, a slaughterhouse, while “The Story of My Wife” wrestled with love blossoming out of initial callous indifference. Her latest, “Silent Friend,” premiering in competition at Venice 2025 before moving on to Toronto, extends this fascination with the invisible — this time, through the unlikely vantage point of a ginkgo tree.

The premise is deceptively simple. A single tree in a German university town serves as silent witness to a century of human longing. The film is structured as a triptych: in 1908, Grete (Luna Wedler), the school's first female student faces near constant misogyny, discovers the universal patterns of life hidden in plants through her black-and-white photography. In 1972, Hannes (Enzo Brumm), a gangly farm boy adrift in a hedonistic haze of hormones and counterculture, stumbles upon a revelation through his contact with a love interest's geranium. And in 2020, Tony Leung plays Tony, a Hong Kong neuroscientist specializing in babies who, during the enforced silence of the COVID lockdown, experiments in a new field of botany that could force communion with the ginkgo itself.




			Popular on IndieWire		






It's a bold structure, and Enyedi makes it even more distinctive by shooting each era in a carefully composed style: 35-millimeter monochrome for Grete's rigidly ordered world, lush 16mm for Hannes's impressionistic haze, and sharp digital clarity for Tony's solitude. This tripartite structure gives “Silent Friend” a rigor that makes time itself another character. The giant ginkgo doesn't change much, but everything around it does, and Enyedi seems determined to show us how fragile, and culturally contingent our idea of reality, really is.

 










Yet for all of its conceptual richness, “Silent Friend” is also a film prone to indulgence. Enyedi has often made meditative cinema, but here her restraint in some sequences verges on suffocating. Entire passages seem content to let us watch leaves rustle, characters linger, or silence stretch far beyond narrative necessity. She clearly wants us to sink into the slowness of “tree-time,” but there's a thin line between contemplative and inert. At 147 minutes, the film occasionally crosses it, settling into rhythms more punishing than profound.

What continually saves it — and this is hardly a suprise — is Tony Leung. At this point in his career, Leung doesn't need to prove anything, but he proves everything anyway. Enyedi reportedly wrote the role specifically for him, and it shows. This is less a performance than a presence: a study in silence, longing, and grace. With barely a handful of lines, roaming around the pandemic-emptied university halls, Leung communicates galaxies. The way he tilts his head, watches the only passerby he's likely to see that day through a cafeteria window, or simply shares screen space with a tree carries a truly heartbreaking portrayal of loneliness.

Few performers embody the old-school charisma of international art cinema quite like him. He recalls the aloof elegance of Alain Delon or the masculine grace of Marcello Mastroianni, but with a warmth and melancholy that are uniquely his. “Silent Friend” may revolve around a tree, but it is Leung who convinces you that the tree is worth examination.

 










The supporting cast makes their mark, if less indelibly. Luna Wedler makes Grete a formidable and fiercely intelligent character, particularly in one sharp-witted confrontation against a panel of sneering professors who want to belittle and humiliate her; her black-and-white sequences, inspired by the photography of Karl Blossfeldt, are also the most striking in the film. Enzo Brumm, in his first major role, captures the awkward, floating energy of a youthful uncertainty and first love. And Léa Seydoux, in a brief but potent turn as a scientist of plant communication who remotely mentors Tony is magnetic as ever. She and Leung's contact is virtual, but Seydoux's charisma is strong enough to bridge the gap and give the pair a tender chemisty. 

There's a compelling shift in power dynamics over the 112 years the film covers, where women are valued only for their chastity, only to become subversive, sexually empowered scientists performing cutting-edge experiments, or delivering TED Talks and mentoring other scientists at the top of their game.

Still, no matter how much Seydoux sparkles or Wedler steadies, this is Leung's film. The ginkgo may be the titular “silent friend,” but the most moving silence belongs to him. His performance transforms the movie from an intellectual exercise into a work of genuine feeling. Without him, “Silent Friend” would risk being remembered as a handsome, cerebral curio. With him, it becomes something more: a haunting meditation that lingers in the mind even as the pacing tests one's patience.

 










Enyedi's direction remains admirable for its ambition, drawing inspiration from Thomas Nagel's famous essay “What Is It Like to Be a Bat?” and neuroscientist Anil Seth's work on consciousness, framing human life as a shared hallucination that nature quietly resists. But whether these ideas resonate will depend largely on one's tolerance for the subdued.

In the end, “Silent Friend” is a film of contradictions, profound, complex, and beautiful, but occasionally interminably boring. Still, Tony Leung commands the screen with such economy of gesture, such magnetic stillness, such sheer star power. And while that ginkgo will hopefully live for another 112 years, legacies like his have the power to extend even further.

Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) audiences hosted the world premiere of Christy, a new biopic from director David Michôd. The film stars Sydney Sweeney as legendary boxer Christy Martin and Ben Foster as her husband and coach, Jim Martin.

Guests on the red carpet included Sweeney, Foster, Christy Martin, Katy O'Brian, David Michôd, Chad L. Coleman, Jess Gabor, Marvin LaViolette, Shailene Woodley, and more.

The film chronicles the life of “Cole Miner's Daughter” Christy (Sweeney), raised in West Virginia, earned herself a basketball scholarship to college. After dominating “Toughwoman” contests in the late 1980s, she began training with coach Jim Martin (Foster) and launched a highly successful professional boxing career in the sport's early days.

However, her public success was a stark contrast to her private life. She married Jim, who was 25 years her senior, and their codependent relationship spiraled into a cycle of drug abuse, financial ruin, and physical and psychological abuse. Just as Christy is making historic strides in her sport, she's forced to contend with a horrendous private life — climaxing in an act that nearly kills her.

Black Bear will release the film theatrically in the US and will hit screens on Nov. 7 in time for awards season.

EXCLUSIVE: Another high-profile package has found a home as Netflix has landed the pic Saturn Return starring Charles Melton, Rachel Brosnahan and Will Poulter.


	The film is a Chicago-set romance exploring the themes of love, loss and life's complicated turns in the 10 years between the aspirational young love of college and the complicated realities of adulthood. The pic will be directed by Greg Kwedar, with Plan B producing, along with Emily Wolfe. The film is written by Gaelyn Golde with revisions by Kwedar and Clint Bentley, who are reteaming with Netflix on the heels of the streamer acquiring their Sundance breakout Train Dreams. The film is based on an original script by Golde.

Country singer Lainey Wilson is welcoming fans right into her home!

In a new video for Architectural Digest's YouTube page, the ACM Entertainer of the Year opens her front door to AD's camera, saying “Welcome to my house here in Nashville. Come on in. You don't even have to kick your boots off.”

And if you're wondering if Lainey's “country girl” persona extends to her decor, you don't have to get very far into the tour to see that it definitely does.

“This is the first home that I've designed,” the “Somewhere Over Laredo” singer says in the video. “I feel like I have my fingerprints on everything in this house.”

From cowboy wallpaper to a stained glass window featuring a desert scene with a cactus motif, Lainey Wilson's love of southwestern design shines through in every room.

Even her stairs carpeted in leopard print are a nod to her country heritage. “I've always been a sucker for leopard,” Lainey explains. “My first pair of bell bottoms were blue leopard print, and so I had to have leopard carpet on the stairs.”

Viewers are also introduced to artwork featuring her 31-year-old horse Tex. And they meet her real life dog French bulldog. Lainey scoops the pup up, telling the camera, “This is my baby, Hippie Mae Wilson. This is her house and I'm just living in it.”

In the living room, she shows off curtains made of fabric she had shipped overseas, revealing, “Three different times, the ship had pirates. And I am not even playing. They stole my curtains three different times, and finally the fourth time, we got the fabric over here.” 

“They were worth it,” Lainey enthuses. “So, the pirates, they got some good fabric.”

When Lainey Wilson takes Architectural Digest into her kitchen, she reveals that it's the hub of the home, where she and fiancé Devlin “Duck” Hodges not only prepare food but where she writes songs and where they entertain some pretty high profile friends.

“I had Miranda Lambert and her husband Brendan over the other night, and me and Duck were cooking for 'em. And right before they got here, I was like ‘is Miranda Lambert really coming to our house?' Like, that would have been weird if you'd have told me that about ten years ago. Now she's one of my buddies.”

Lainey says she and Duck love hosting and having people over. 

The “Heart Like a Truck” singer reveals that Duck has grilling skills, saying, “He can make a mean steak. And one of my favorite meals is jalepeno poppers and Duck's steak.”

A post shared by Wrangler (@wrangler)

The 15-minute YouTube video even takes us inside Lainey Wilson's closet.

And they are full of her signature bellbottoms!

“I've always been a sucker for bellbottoms,” Lainey tells AD. “I remember putting them on when I was nine-years-old. And I remember how they made me feel, made me feel sassy, made me feel like I could do anything, and so I never grew out of it.”

As a recent guest on Taste of Country Nights, Wilson admitted she likely owns well over one-thousand pairs of bellbottoms, saying, “I have completely lost count, but, I've worn a new pair on stage each time for the past 15 years, so..”

Lainey refers to her style of music as “Bell Bottom Country” and even named her 2022 album that.

She has a bar in Nashville named “Bell Bottoms Up,” where she performs sometimes when she's in town. And she recently released a single by the same name recorded at London's Abbey Road Studios.

Carpenter now has two U.K. No. 1 LPs to her name.


													By
												

	Thomas Smith



	She's back where she belongs: Sabrina Carpenter has romped to No. 1 on the U.K.'s Official Albums Chart with Man's Best Friend (Sep. 5).


	The new LP gives Carpenter her second chart-topper in little over a year following 2024's Short n' Sweet, which spent five weeks at No. 1. “Manchild,” the lead single from her new LP, earned two weeks at the summit of the U.K.'s Official Singles Chart earlier this summer.   


	Carpenter also claims 2025's biggest opening week for an international artist, with 85,500 units shifted in the first seven days. Lady Gaga's Mayhem held the record previously (55,000) but North Shields-born rocker Sam Fender's People Watching is still the one to beat, which debuted with 119,000 units back in February.

	











	Carpenter currently has three albums inside the top 40 with Short n' Sweet (No. 8) and 2023's Emails I Can't Send (No. 23) both receiving a bump. On Thursday (Sep. 4), she treated fans with surprise bonus track “Such a Funny Way,” which is available to download from her website. “The sentiment is one i always thought could really be the end of Man's Best Friend in another universe! i didn't want you to wait too long to have it and get to know it,” she wrote on her Instagram profile.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Irish country-pop star CMAT scores a career-high with her third LP Euro-Country peaking at No. 2. The Dublin-born singer-songwriter — real name Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson — has performed extensively at U.K. and European festivals this summer, including Glastonbury and All Points East festival. The LP features “Take a Sexy Picture Of Me” which inspired a viral TikTok dance earlier this year.


	Bryan Adams earns his 12th top 10 LP with Roll With The Punches (No. 3) and he's closely followed by Oasis' greatest hits collection Time Flies… (1994-2009) (No. 4). Swedish rock band The Hives score their fourth top 10 record with The Hives Forever Forever The Hives landing at No. 5.

This is it. The hordes of lackeys were dispensed with. The love interest's betrayal has been accounted for. The MacGuffin has been tracked down. The sociopathic second-in-command has died in spectacular fashion. All that's left is the final boss battle. After a contentious first, second, third, and fourth round, The A.V. Club‘s Action Franchise Tournament enters into its final fight with two all-timers ascending towards the throne: It's Police Story vs. Mad Max. 

Jackie Chan's three-ring Jackass stunt circus or George Miller's ridiculous death race—only one of these decades-spanning juggernauts will hold the title of the greatest action franchise of all time. You, the readers, still have a chance to decide the fate of your chosen winner in our poll, but after the fall of the near-deities Ethan Hunt and Neo, we've found our final champion.

It's not surprising that neither of these last two action franchises are American. Hollywood has always been a pioneer in the realm of blockbusters and franchises, but its abilities with and interest in adding action to that mix have always come second to what that action serves: A perpetual-motion machine whose replicable formula of set pieces, heroic quips, and boilerplate plots consistently prints money and fill the molds of action figures. So many American action franchises bury their stunts in other genre elements, or shoehorn action sequences into otherwise unrelated intellectual properties in order to give them a four-quadrant summer-flick zing, that the relatively recent resurgence of more action-forward fare has been greeted with a renewed popular and professional appreciation for stunt performance as a discipline.

But the best action is often the purest—and representing Hong Kong and Australia are two of the most primal action franchises ever made. Jackie Chan's cop stories are so boiled down to their base components that his character is alternatively called Chan Ka-kui or Chan Kwok-wing or Zhong Wen or simply Kevin or Jackie. These films aren't named for him, but so vaguely titled they're almost anonymous: Their star is simply an incredible cop who gets disgraced, maintains his personal dignity and devotion, then redeems himself through incredible feats of individual effort for the greater good. Similarly, even if Tom Hardy didn't replace Mel Gibson as Max Rockatansky, the internal timeline of the franchise makes him being a single person living through the films' desiccated nightmare nigh impossible. He's an idea, a symbol. These aren't people so much as they are vessels made for motion, bodies built to be endangered.

And yet, through this purity, the franchises approach different thematic philosophies. The Mad Max films live in defiance of authoritarianism, which the franchise fears will inevitably raise its iron fist when the world falls apart. Officer Rockatansky, beaten-down nihilist highway patrolman, gives way to Max, semi-hopeful wanderer. He faces down gang leaders and self-appointed dictators alike as he searches for the remnants of his humanity, this pattern culminating in Furiosa's (Charlize Theron) revenge mission against Immortan Joe. “As the world falls around us, how must we brave its cruelties?” asks Furiosa. For Miller's ecologically devastated world, reinvention, adaptability, and unfussy collaboration is key in order to survive, and to confront the unflinching despots at the top.

Police Story, though, is mostly about a single supercop's superior coppage, and all the jokers around him who get in his way with their “rules” and “laws.” It's unsurprising that a series named Police Story, a franchise that is the baby of an increasingly conservative director/star in Chan, has always had a regressive streak—one that gets more grim and personal as the series goes on. (It's not a coincidence that Police Story: Lockdown involves the lead's estranged relationship with his gay daughter.)

It would actually prevent that series from being the platonic cop franchise ideal, though, if it had any bigger ideas or a more progressive perspective. It is a power fantasy, plain and simple, one of personal injustices being overcome through singular feats of physical prowess—of might quite literally making right. It's just silly enough, in most of its films at least, that the pricklier parts of its subgenre go down smooth.

Well, that, and the Police Story movies contain some of the best stuntwork ever captured by cameras, bar none. It's amazing that Jackie Chan is still alive. The two-and-a-half-minute credit sequence of behind-the-scenes action from the first movie is better than most full action films, and probably contains more broken glass:



These supercut outtakes don't do justice to do-it-all China Drama Academy student Chan's ability to tell stories with his fights, to make jokes with his blows, and to add drama to his stunts. If Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd have a direct modern descendent, it's Jackie Chan. The plots of the Police Story movies don't matter because the only narrative that's needed is baked into the action sequences. (This is also how Chan and Edward Tang wrote the first film: Props and locations and action ideas first, the bits of plot linking them together later.) When Michelle Yeoh joins in for Supercop, and is so good in it that she gets her own spin-off, it's the only kind of step forward the series needs: A miraculous new addition who can actually hang with Chan's energy and elegance, expanding a virtuoso performance into a double act.



Apart from Yeoh's freak-matching, though, Police Story finds itself running out of ways to one-up itself over the course of its run—and its increasingly sour repetitions are less enjoyable than those of Mad Max, which iterates in imaginative new directions even as the chases and fights and fascists blur into one another. As George Miller expounds upon humanity's cartoonish id, positing that the end of the world will in fact be dumb as hell and full of silly names (a prediction that clocked some recent governmental developments from decades away), his movies only become more impressive and more mythic. The flame-spitting, guitar-swinging, Cirque du Soleil chases that eventually grow from the early Outback muscle-car grit feed into an industry's desire for sequel extravagance, but they also reflect that when times become dire, the fables we tell ourselves only get bigger and more urgent. When things fall apart, normalcy doesn't rise—a Thunderdome does.

Just as Police Story has some of the jumps and crashes to end all jumps and crashes, Mad Max has chases to end all chases featuring vehicles to end all vehicles. Fury Road, a perfect there-and-back film Frankensteined from two epic chases welded together, uses every filmmaking trick in the book (and the dedication of a massive group of technicians suffering in the desert) to capture speed, distance, and danger with a clear eye and a full heart. 

﻿

And that means Fury Road, the best film of its decade, can't lose. Its impeccably realized dystopia sparkles with hope, glinting at a finish line its ensemble reaches together against all odds. Max and Furiosa and War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult) and all the practical effects and seamless VFX wizardry that support them—they band together at the climax of a series that dreams of our demise. The trilogy before it and the prequel following it might not achieve its majesty, but they serve different purposes. They ground the legend, show how a person can become something greater than themselves, while goosing our heart rates so that they beat in rapid unison. We leave the theater impressed, inspired, exhausted, in awe. The Mad Max movies are quintessential underdog stories, flooring it in the face of doomsday—action-movie power trips worth taking to the end of the road, and beyond.

Winner: Mad Max

But you don't have to wander the wasteland with us if you don't want to. The favorite among a certain vocal commentariat, the quintessential secret agent James Bond, could steal the whole thing right out from under George Miller's nose—nonchalantly quipping and breaking stunt records all the way. Here's where you can finalize your selection for the winner in our poll, and decide if 007 and his Aston Martin outrace the death machines of Mad Max:

Josh O'Connor and Paul Mescal have been wanting to make “The History of Sound” (out September 12, from Mubi) for five years. But the two actors were both in such demand that it kept being pushed back until they finally became available at the same time. 

Now, O'Connor finds himself in the odd position of having to promote four movies coming out this fall. Is he tired? “Yeah, I am,” he said on Zoom just after the Telluride Film Festival. “I've maxed out a little bit.”

The two actors met during the pandemic, on Zoom, after O'Connor watched “Normal People” and like many of us, believed he was discovering an exciting young talent. He emailed his American agent: “You have to see this kid. He's amazing.” His agent had already signed him. It turns out Mescal had been watching O'Connor, as well. The two got on famously, and have been chums ever since. (Check out their hilarious recent appearance on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”)

“The History of Sound” director Oliver Hermanus went ahead with essentially the first draft of the script about two folk music collectors in love, Lionel (Mescal) and David (O'Connor) who travel the South trawling for cool songs to record for posterity. “It's the first script that Ben Shattuck had ever written,” said O'Connor. “We all loved the short story. He delivered a script about a month later, and it was perfect, miraculous. Paul and I were constantly unavailable, and we both refused to make it with anyone else. So we would get a date in, and then we kick it down the road, and then someone else would get another job. So we kick it down the road. And in the end, there was this three week gap between me going off to do ‘Challengers' press and ‘La Chimera' press. And so we shot all my stuff first in three weeks, and then I left Paul and Oliver to do it. The script was so good; it felt like one of those projects where you could lead with instinct, in the knowledge that I was playing opposite Paul, who's so gifted. It felt like a breeze.”

 










The two men reunited at Telluride over Labor Day. It was O'Connor's second time at the festival, after “La Chimera” two years ago. Then he was able to attend because he had been shooting Max Walker-Silverman's “Rebuilding” (Bleecker Street, November 7) nearby. The micro-budget indie (Sundance 2025) about a farm community recovering from wildfires had wangled a permit to shoot during the Actors Strike. “‘Rebuilding‘ was one of the most moving filmmaking experiences I've ever had,” said O'Connor. “There's a hopefulness to it. It's a small crew, and we were pitched up in the middle of nowhere in a town called Alamosa in Colorado. I went out there to work on a ranch for a little bit before we started.”

“The History of Sound,” while it involves a romance, is not overtly sexy. The two men fall in love for a time, but it's an intellectual relationship, a shared love of music. Mescal's Lionel is more comfortable with his sexuality than O'Connor's David. “At one point David says, ‘Do you worry about this?'” said O'Connor. “It's's obviously something he's considered. We later find out that he's married. He's contending with his sexuality at times. David feels shame for a number of reasons. I was drawn to the story because I found the immediate intellectual attraction exciting and refreshing. I also loved the idea of exploring synesthesia and music being associated to memory, but mostly my attraction to that character and to this story was to do with grief, in all its forms.”

 










O'Connor had lost someone he cared deeply about the year before. “The last few years, ‘La Chimera,' a lot of the work I've been doing, has been trying to compute that. What ‘History of Sound' grabbed for me was the idea of our memories of someone. Paul and I would often talk about the scenes we were doing. Were these factual scenes, or are these, through Lionel's eyes, his memories of that summer? And are they therefore influenced by what he knows now? That plays into the moments of sadness that David feels, or the moment of joy and fun and playfulness that they have.”

In both “The History of Sound” and “The Mastermind” (October 17, Mubi) O'Connor, who grew up in the West of England, had to maneuver his mouth around an American accent, “with great difficulty,” he said. “I've lost the accent now. But the letter R is swallowed. You do some gymnastics in your mouth to say the letter R. It's drawn out, whereas the American accent is a relaxed R, and so it's difficult for me to move my mouth in the way that it's supposed to for an American accent. It takes me a long time to get it right.”

After he shot “The History of Sound” in January and February of 2024, O'Connor went off and did the “Challengers” and “La Chimera” press tour, and then joined Rian Johnson's ensemble for “Knives Out,” followed by Massachusetts heist caper “The Mastermind” at the end of the year. 

 










Clearly, O'Connor is a Kelly Reichardt fan. “She makes the movies I want to watch,” he said. “I find them so funny. And there's often tragedy, and there's often mundane elements and sometimes, even, like in our movie, when I'm putting the pictures up in that barn, that shot is completely ridiculous. I like sitting with something. I don't like to be rushed when I watch things. And Kelly does that so beautifully. To do that kind of a role is bliss to me.”

“The Mastermind” was filmed on 35mm in long takes and immersed O'Connor, who was born in 1990, into the '70s. His character, Mooney, wears checkered shirts and brown corduroy and drives a gold '64 Chevy Nova. “Those cars are chaotic,” he said. “They're so hard to drive, they're beautiful machines. But the wheel, it takes about three full turns to take a slight right turn. Kelly and I spent a long time watching documentaries and sharing photographs and artwork from the period.”

Mooney is the father of young boys dealing (poorly) with male responsibility, as he's not fulfilling his role as breadwinner nor is he going off to war. “There's this post-60s political, problematic idea about our responsibility to peace and the Vietnam War,” said O'Connor. “He's too old to be called up. He's unemployed. He's an artist. And men who are artists, who are not working, there's shame to that. He's got a huge ego and low self esteem. That period did something to someone like Mooney.”

 










Reichardt and O'Connor took a long time to figure out which artworks Mooney was going to steal. “Arthur Dove is a great artist, but at the time, his work wasn't worth anything,” said O'Connor. “You're not going to get rich quick from some Arthur Doves, particularly at that time. They're of a particular taste. Mooney wouldn't steal a Picasso, because that's mainstream, he's full of ego. Yes, the grand heist fulfills the ego. But also, ‘if I'm going to steal art, I want people to know that I'm an art lover, I know art.' So Arthur Dove fulfills that. I didn't steal any old artist. I stole the up-and-coming artist that the regular Joe doesn't know about. So it's a point of pride for him. How it goes so wrong? He's deluded. He has no idea how much he screwed up. He's completely in denial throughout.”

Next up: The cast for the untitled Steven Spielberg science-fiction movie (Universal, June 12, 2026) written by David Koepp includes Henry Lloyd-Hughes, Emily Blunt and Colman Domingo, as well as O'Connor. “It's Spielberg at his best,” said O'Connor. “There couldn't be a more Spielberg movie. On my first day on set with him, I stood in a nondescript place, and there was rain, drips coming off the ceiling of this place, and a big beam of light from a car headlight. And some smoke. I thought, ‘This is so Spielberg.' I had a brilliant experience. He is everything that you dream him to be.”

 










O'Connor plays a priest in “Wake Up Dead Man” (November 26, Netflix), the third installment of Rian Johnson's “Knives Out” series, alongside Daniel Craig, Kerry Washington, Glenn Close, Josh Brolin, and Andrew Scott. “It's an amazing stacked up cast,” he said, “and I was just a part of it.” 

Joel Coen's second solo outing “Jack of Spades” is halfway through shooting in Scotland. “The energy on set is focused,” said O'Connor. “The experience of being directed by him might be one of the greatest ones I've had.”

There is a world where O'Connor would run away and go missing, get back to his garden in the West of England, make pots, and not do any acting for a long time. But that is an alternate universe. “I started in the theater, with a good number of years of auditioning and auditioning and getting turned down and turned down, being at the Royal Shakespeare Company, or in the Donmar and balancing that with working in pubs and restaurants,” said O'Connor. “What that does to you is, whenever a job finishes, you genuinely think this could be the last, and if you have imposter syndrome, like I do, and like most actors do, you're going, this next one will be the one where they go ‘Ah, we were wrong. He's rubbish.' So, you've always got that needling away in the back of your mind, which makes it difficult.”

 










He admits he may have overextended himself in one sense: “there's an element of mystery, which maybe we've lost, and that idea of an event movie coming out feels like a distant thing,” he said. He is going back to theater in Clifford Odets' “Golden Boy” on the West End. “You won't be seeing four films come out at the same time for a little while. That's all I say.”

CBS News said that Face the Nation will only broadcast live or live-to-tape interviews following Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem‘s complaints over edits made to her appearance on the show on Sunday.


	A CBS News spokesperson said, “In response to audience feedback over the past week, we have implemented a new policy for greater transparency in our interviews. Face the Nation will now only broadcast live or live-to-tape interviews (subject to national security or legal restrictions). This extra measure means the television audience will see the full, unedited interview on CBS and we will continue our practice of posting full transcripts and the unedited video online.”

Face the Nation has published full transcripts and unedited interviews online, but Noem complained that the broadcast “shamefully edited” an interview in which she made allegations about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the undocumented immigrant who has been at the center of much coverage about the Trump administration's deportation efforts. She alleged that CBS News edited the interview “to whitewash the truth about this MS-13 gang member and the threat he poses to American public safety.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Noem then posted video of her unaired response, in which she said of Abrego Garcia, “This individual was a known human smuggler, MS-13 gang member, an individual who's a wife beater, and someone who was so perverted that he solicited nude photos from minors. And even his fellow human traffickers told him to knock it off, he was so sick in what he was doing and how he was treating small children. So he needs to never be in the United States of America, and our administration is making sure we're doing all that we can to bring him to justice.”

	











	But, as some commentators have noted, what was edited out were a number of unproven allegations, including that he was an MS-13 gang member. Politifact noted that no charges have been filed on that claim that Abrego Garcia solicited nude photos from minors, while his attorneys has said that the allegations are hearsay.


	The new policy will put the onus on Face the Nation moderators to fact-check guests in real time. Ed O'Keefe had conducted the Noem interview, and was filling in for Margaret Brennan.


Face the Nation did post a transcript and video of the unedited interview on its website on Sunday. It included an editor's note about the portion cut from the broadcast. “Kilmar Abrego Garcia has been charged with two counts of human smuggling and has pleaded not guilty. He is currently in ICE detention pending trial. He has not been charged with any counts related to child abuse,” the note read.


	The new policy for Face the Nation follows Skydance's just completed merger with CBS-parent Paramount. The regulatory approval of the merger was beset with President Donald Trump‘s lawsuit against the network over the way that another interview was edited, a 60 Minutes segment with Kamala Harris from October. Paramount Global settled the lawsuit for $16 million, even though many legal observers say that it was without merit. As part of the settlement, Paramount Global said that 60 Minutes will released transcripts with eligible U.S. presidential candidates after those interviews have aired.


	As it sought FCC approval of the merger, Skydance also committed to hiring an ombudsman, tasked with taking complaints about coverage, while the chairman of the agency, Brendan Carr, has said that he would be “will be watching,” pointing to Skydance's commitment to “addressing bias and restoring fact-based reporting.” The FCC's authority over accuracy or bias in news coverage, however, is narrow, as the agency itself points out.


	Edits to taped interviews are commonplace throughout the news business. Trump claimed that 60 Minutes tried to make Harris look better by making edits to her interview, but he himself has benefited from such trims. Earlier in 2024, Fox News trimmed a portion of his answer to a question when he was asked about declassifying files related to Jeffrey Epstein. On Fox & Friends, Trump's answer was shown as, “Yeah, I would.” But his full answer, airing on Will Cain's Fox News radio show, was, “Yeah, I would…I guess I would. I think that less so because, you don't know, you don't want to affect people's lives if it's phony stuff in there, because it's a lot of phony stuff with that whole world.”

STOP BENDING TO THE REGIME

You are a NEWS organization.

Hence why any interviews shouldn't be selectively edited toward a specific partisan end.

I'm so tired of this crybaby administration and everyone bending over backwards for them!

Interesting they edit democrats interview to make them look better and republicans to make them look bad. But go ahead with the notion that they are unbiased.

Fox News enters the chat.

If they actually go through with this abe air the interviews live than I am okay with this response from them.

you've literally spent the last decade whining. go find a hobby.

Freud thought that, at least for some of us, the guilt comes before the crime. Seeking punishment for a pre-existing (probably Oedipal) feeling of shame and inadequacy, some of the incarcerated seek a reality that fits their self-identity. For them, crime is simply a tool for the good stuff: punishment and pariah status. Criminality as kink.

With his latest neo-noir, Cai Shangjun offers a full-throated endorsement of one of Freud's more contentious theories with a tale of a toxic romance necessitated by an irresistible vicious cycle. Set in gritty, smoke-filled Guangzhou — the world's sweatshop and home to the “Shein village” of cut-price clothing makers — Shangjun's China is not a happy or a healthy place. Nor are his characters. But good people rarely make for good movies.

Meiyun (Zhilei Xin) runs her own clothing brand in a slick shopping mall, where she broadcasts live walkthroughs of her latest products to fussy customers, who complain about issues beyond her control. Almost as curt are the doctors at the local hospital: Meiyun is six weeks pregnant but, with no hearable heartbeat, it's unclear whether the child will carry. Her gynecologist shows a striking disinterest in Meiyun's hope that it will come through; even in stoic China, the dispassion is breathtaking, the first sign of a harsh, unfeeling environment to which Meiyun is well-acquainted. The father of the child is Qifeng (Shaofeng Feng), a handsome married man whose own daughter seems to suspect something is off. Qifeng leaves much to be desired, apologizing to Meiyun for pressing her to get an abortion last time she fell pregnant. Meiyun confides, “The past will catch up with me. I will get what I deserve.”

It soon becomes clear what she means. Qifeng is Mr. Right compared to Baoshu (Songwen Zhang, in the best performance of the movie). Now a cancer patient in a room close to where Meiyun is being consulted, he is an older man from Meiyun's past, long before the mall and the livestreams and the trimmings of an honest life. Baoshu spent time in prison for a car accident prosecuted as a hit-and-run. But Baoshu was asleep in the backseat and Meiyun was behind the wheel. 

Baoshu's decision to take the blame and spend five years behind bars — not even telling his late mom the truth — continues to haunt both of them and causes an inescapable cycle of guilt. Meiyun briefly continues seeing Qifeng, setting up a love triangle that's like a cursed Chinese interpretation of “Materialists.” The two men's culture clash is funnier than you might expect and credit to a filmmaker who grasps the tone of what might otherwise have been a dour experience.

But it isn't fun for long. Baoshu exploits Meiyun's admittedly well-placed guilt, moving into her place and behaving like a pig (and worse). Meiyun is now forced to confront the shame she was able to disregard while Baoshu was locked up and out of her life. It sends her into a spiral that sets up an arresting second half of the film, which is part soap opera, part thriller.

 










The one constant is the unhappy couple's bleak surroundings. Shangjun's China is a grim setting. It's humid and gray, petty crime and exploitation abound, and even the hospital could really use a sweep. This is not the 21st-century China that the state is keen to project in films that play abroad — and these characters are not model 21st-century Chinese, either. The decision to allow its production and release (thus far anyway) is presumably the same rationale that saw Khrushchev allow Solzhenitsyn's “One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,” another story about unjust imprisonment and the burden of guilt, to be published at the height of censorship in 1962. Though it paints a dark picture of Stalin's Gulags, Solzhenitsyn's landmark autobiographical story is really about the freedoms Ivan can find within his prison camp over one “almost happy” day. The same applies to Shangjun's characters, whose unhappiness is primarily caused by their moral mistakes. True freedom, it suggests, is there to take it, if you can only break the cycle. 

Easier said than done. “The Sun Rises On Us All” soon becomes the disheartening but affecting story of a pair of broken people for whom salvation is simply unaffordable in a morally expensive world. Meiyun tells Baoshu he might as well stay at her place because “Life is hard everywhere”, a fairly concise expression of the existential nihilism to which they've both fallen. The alternative — the unknown — is more frightening still. So they must remain boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past. Westerners have long indulged in the idea that it's Catholics and Jews who suffer the most guilt. With his latest, Cai Shangjun says: try me.

 










“The Sun Rises on Us All” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Kate Middleton & Prince William are paying tribute after the death of a beloved royal family member. On September 5, the Prince and Princess of Wales released a joint statement following Buckingham Palace's announcement that Katharine, the Duchess of Kent, had died at age 92.

Their message, shared on social media, appeared in white text on a black background and was topped with their joint monogram.

“Our thoughts today are with The Duke of Kent and his family, particularly George, Helen and Nicholas,” they wrote. “The Duchess worked tirelessly to help others and supported many causes, including through her love of music. She will be a much missed member of the family.” 

The note was signed simply with their initials, “W & C.”

Katharine married Queen Elizabeth's cousin Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, in 1961 and remained a familiar presence at major royal events. 

She attended Prince William and Kate's wedding in 2011 and was closely connected to the family through her long association with Wimbledon.

Remembered for comforting players with hugs, the Duchess appeared at the tournament in 1994 with Princess Diana and a young William. 

Today, Kate carries on that tradition as patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, presenting trophies to winners each year.

The Duchess and the Duke of Kent welcomed three children: George, Earl of St. Andrews, Lady Helen Windsor, and Lord Nicholas Windsor. 

She was also candid about personal loss, speaking openly about a miscarriage and the stillbirth of her son, which she described as devastating but ultimately gave her greater empathy for others.

In 1996, she stepped back from royal duties and spent a decade teaching music at a primary school in Hull. Although she opted to live more privately, she continued to attend select royal family events, such as Trooping the Colour.

Buckingham Palace confirmed her death in a statement released September 5. “Her Royal Highness passed away peacefully last night at Kensington Palace, surrounded by her family,” the message read.

“The King and Queen and all Members of The Royal Family join The Duke of Kent, his children and grandchildren in mourning their loss and remembering fondly The Duchess's life-long devotion to all the organizations with which she was associated, her passion for music and her empathy for young people.”

Katharine, Duchess of Kent, is remembered for her kindness, her lifelong dedication to service, and her love of music, which touched many lives.

The New Line pic scared up the biggest preview number of the franchise, as well as the biggest of the year so far for a horror pic.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Let the haunting begin.


	Jolting the sleepy box office back to life as fall gets underway, New Line's The Conjuring: Last Rites scared up a franchise-best $8.5 million in Thursday previews in yet another win for the Warner Bros. film empire. That's also the biggest franchise gross of the year to date for a horror film after passing up the $5.8 million earned in previews by Sony's  28 Years Later.




The Conjuring: Last Rites stars Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson in their final turn as real-life paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Lorraine, but that doesn't mean the franchise is going anywhere. Last Rites is being billed as the ninth and final title in Phase One of The Conjuring Universe, which has become the top-grossing horror franchise in box office history after collecting more than $2.3 billion in global ticket sales. Next up is Phase Two.

	Directed by series regular Michael Chaves, Last Rites — a sequel to The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me to Do It — is based on the Warrens' investigation of the Smurl haunting in Pennsylvania. Mia Tomlinson and Ben Hardy also star, with Atomic Monster's James Wan and DC Studios co-chief Peter Safran returning to  produce.


Last Rites is headed for a domestic debut that could approach or cross $50 million, although New Line and parent studio Warners are being more cautious and sticking with $35 million. In 2013, the very first Conjuring movie opened to $41 million domestically. No subsequent franchise title has been able to topple that record, although many are betting on Last Rites to do just that.

	











	Overseas, the movie is expected to open to another $50 million from more than 60 markets against a net production budget of $55 million before marketing.


	Critics haven't been so kind to the new Conjuring movie — the same could be said for most installments — but early audience reaction is promising.

PinkPantheress radically reimagined her own songs and stuffed a full band into a cubicle for her Tiny Desk Concert, which NPR Music shared Friday.


	The British singer managed to cram eight tracks (and six band members) into the space of 23 minutes, delivering unique spins on tracks like “Pain,” “Illegal,” and “Girl Like Me.”


	“So these are obviously very different renditions from the originals of the songs I have,” PinkPantheress said before shouting out her backing band, which helped breathe new life into the tracks with their live instrumentation. “These songs sound so sick in this way.”

	The Tiny Desk concert boasted three tracks — “Girl Like Me,” “Illegal,” and the closing “Tonight” — from PinkPantheress' recent mixtape Fancy That, which was named one of Rolling Stone's Best Albums of 2025 So Far. The gig also gave fans a preview of the singer's upcoming An Evening With PinkPantheress tour that kicks off next month in Brooklyn.

	











	The NPR Music gig and the upcoming shows mark a return to the road for PinkPantheress, who previously canceled all of her scheduled 2024 appearances last year. “I was full up. There was something that I needed to address, and so I had to leave,” the musician told Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1 earlier this year. “And I did that for my own good. And obviously it was a very sad moment for people that wanted to see me but couldn't see me. But obviously, what goes around comes around, and I'll be back again.”

	On Thursday (Sep. 4), Cardi B accepted the 2025 Billboard impact of the year award at the R&B / Hip-Hop Power Players Event in Brooklyn.


	Presented by the senior director of R&B / Hip-Hop, Carl Lamarre, Cardi delivered a rousing speech, highlighting her love for hip-hop and building a long-lasting legacy. “Hip-Hop is a feeling. When I was growing up, I didn't want to be the Shakiras, the J-Los, and the R&B artists; I wanted to be like Trina and Lil Kim. I wanted to be like them.”


	Cardi's affinity for the culture continued when she spoke on wanting to fulfill her passions for hip-hop as a child growing up, who was once fearful that she would shatter her dreams living situation.

	“I'm just so happy that I'm a part of something that I love. I always dreamed about this career — I just felt like with the environment that I was in, dreaming was dreaming. Reality crushes your dreams. So I'm happy that my career is the career that I always dreamed of.”


	She added, “I want to be spoken about forever. We talk about all these hip-hop artists who came out 20 years ago and 30 years ago, and I want to be a part of that. I don't want to be a moment. I want to be a legacy so I can die in peace one day and my kids can be like, ‘That's my mama.'”


	Cardi was one of the handful of artists honored at the 2025 Billboard's R&B / Hip-Hop Power Players Event. Wu-Tang, a legendary hip-hop group, was inducted into Billboard's Hip-Hop Hall of Fame, while Leon Thomas, a rising star, earned breakthrough artist of the year.

	Thanks to A Complete Unknown and the forthcoming Bruce Springsteen biopic Deliver Me from Nowhere, the concept of musicians intentionally throwing their audiences for a loop is back in the national conversation. But as Joni Mitchell would be the first to tell you, no one made a fan base engage in more collective head-scratching and exasperation than she did nearly 50 years ago.


	Recruiting serious jazz players instead of the usual.A. studio cats, Mitchell spent several years discarding the daily-journal lyric writing and folkish melodies of her early work and wandering into more musically lyrically abstract territory on albums like Mingus and Don Juan's Reckless Daughter. As she told Cameron Crowe in Rolling Stone in 1979, “It's just that at a certain point, my poetry began to spill out of the form and into something more relative to a jazz sense of melody, which was restating the melody in variation.”


	At an equally certain point, her fans and many of her critic champions bailed, at least for many years. (Suddenly, it was her fans who were blue.) In retrospect, a sprawling album like Don Juan's Reckless Daughter has held up better than anyone might have thought in a year when L.A. rock was embodied by Hotel California and Running on Empty. But right up through her take on “Summertime” from her startling 2023 comeback at the Newport Folk Festival, Mitchell's love of jazz has never wavered. And the extent to which she wants it known that the music is as much a part of her DNA as singer-songwriter balladry — whether you, the listener, approve or not — clearly drives Joni's Jazz, the latest installment in her series of retrospective box sets.

	On the fourth volume of her Joni Mitchell Archives set last year, Mitchell explored the period from the making of Hejira up through the Shadows and Light live album cut with players like Jaco Pastorius and Pat Metheny. Joni's Jazz picks up that theme and runs with it. Spanning decades, albums, and cohorts, the set attempts to make the case that Mitchell's jazz period wasn't a fluke, that she was, in fact, a jazz singer of sorts all along.

	More often than not, she wasn't wrong. Alone along her peers, Mitchell was blessed with a limber soprano that could navigate vocalese, jazz melodies, and less predictable rhythms with a fluid ease, as a return visit to “Blue Hotel Room” from Hejira reminds you. Her version of “You're My Thrill” (from 2000's covers-heavy Both Sides Now) uncannily conjures Billie Holiday's original, and she and her collaborators wove horn arrangements into her work in a far more sophisticated and subtle way than what we encountered on jazz-rock albums of the Seventies. During an era when some of her troubadour friends were steering toward yacht rock, “You Dream Flat Tires,” from 1982's uneven Wild Things Run Fast, now sounds even more like a brave attempt at fusion. A demo of “Two Grey Rooms,” one of the sadly few previously unreleased tracks here, substitutes a wordless vocal for the lyrics of the finished version on Night Ride Home. It's not just a vocal showcase for her but actually more alluring in this form.


	But in a sign that Mitchell is perhaps still sensitive to the criticism that she wandered too far afield, Joni's Jazz can feel like a jazz improv that goes on a bit too long. Spread out over four CDs or eight LPs, the 61-track box feels at least one batch of songs too long. To reinforce the notion that she was thinking and sounding like a jazz singer from day one, Mitchell has dipped into her catalog for examples that prove her point (“Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire” from For the Roses) and some that really don't (“The Jungle Line” from Don Juan). On a version of “The Man I Love,” cut a while back with Herbie Hancock, Mitchell truly came into her own as a standards singer. But fans of her own writing will be tested by the inclusion of a few too many of those covers. In its determination to make its point, Joni's Jazz is a labor of love that still feels a little labored.

	SAVANNAH, Ga. — Tori Branum is a Marine Corps veteran, firearms instructor, and Republican candidate for Georgia's 12th congressional district.


	She's also a proud “America first” supporter of President Donald Trump. On Thursday, as agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security were still carrying out a raid at a Hyundai plant in rural Bryan County, just outside the district Branum is running to serve, she expressed pride in something else: her purported role in causing the raid, which resulted in the arrest of 450 people, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.


	“How do I feel about it? Good,” Branum tells Rolling Stone. “I have no feelings about the law. What's right is right and what's wrong is wrong.”


	The raid is one of the largest in ICE history, eclipsing a raid at a California cannabis farm that netted some 300 undocumented workers.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Branum says the Hyundai “megasite” — which opened in March and was hailed as a major economic development win for Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) — has been the subject of rumors for months that undocumented immigrants were working there or on construction sites within the massive, 2,900-acre complex. Three workers have died during construction at the site. 

	











	Aware of safety issues and rumors about undocumented immigrants working there, Branum says she came into contact with a local, Spanish-speaking union worker who had access to the site. The Hyundai plant itself is not union; many workers there are from South Korea and are in the United States on H1-B visas. The South Korean government confirmed to The New York Times that some South Korean workers were detained by immigration agents.

	











	While the plant itself is not union, construction sites at the facility have been staffed by union tradesmen, some of whom have complained about undocumented workers and unsafe conditions. 


	The union worker who came into contact with Branum “recorded some conversations they had with people,” she tells Rolling Stone. She claims the union worker had discovered that undocumented immigrants were working on construction projects at the plant.

	“They were a union member, and the people confided in them because they had helped them win lawsuits over unsafe working conditions,” Branum says. She declined to name the union worker who acted as the informant.


	From there, Branum says she reached out to ICE on the agency's website, and an agent then contacted her. 


	On Thursday, as agents from ICE, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Marshals, the DEA, and the FBI were still raiding the facility, Branum took credit for it on Facebook.


	“For months, folks have whispered about what's going on behind those gates now the truth is finally catching up (sic),” Branum wrote on her Facebook page. “I reported this site to ICE a few months ago and was on the phone with an agent.”


	The raid began with a masked agent telling workers that DHS had a warrant.


	“We're Homeland Security; we have a search warrant for the whole site,” the agent announced. “We need construction to cease immediately — we need all work to end on the site right now.”


	A second video from the plant shows dozens of workers in bright-colored safety vests sitting on the grass and standing around as ICE and HSI agents question them. Overhead, a helicopter operated by the Georgia State Patrol hovered in the air. A state patrol spokesperson tells Rolling Stone the agency's officers “served in a support function for the perimeter and aviation assets.” A spokesperson for the Bryan County Sheriff's Office says that agency had no role in the raid. Elected officials in Bryan County did not respond to requests for comment.

	In brief comments to local press, Schrank says the raid was a “judicially authorized enforcement operation” and that the agencies “thank the public for all of the thoughts as we conduct this operation exceptionally safely thus far.”


	RAIDS LIKE THURSDAY'S have become a common sight in communities across the country amid Trump's mass deportation campaign. Ostensibly aimed at undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes, the raids have also resulted in the detention and arrest of men and women without criminal histories. Panic and fear have ravaged migrant communities nationwide as masked agents have swarmed workplaces and neighborhoods in search of the “illegal immigrants” that Trump and his supporters like Branum want to see removed.

	











	“This is what I voted for — to get rid of a lot of illegals,” Branum tells Rolling Stone. “And what I voted for is happening.” 


	The masked immigration agents like those in Bryan County on Thursday — a sight that was once shocking but has become commonplace — were primarily from ICE's Enforcement Removal Operations division and DHS' investigative arm, HSI, according to videos reviewed by Rolling Stone. Those agencies and more were deemed guilty by a federal judge of widespread constitutional violations for racially profiling migrants during investigations and operations in Los Angeles and elsewhere. 


	As masked immigration agents have carried out their operations nationwide, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have expanded ICE's budget to hire thousands more agents, giving the agency more money than foreign nations' entire militaries. New and expanded immigration detention facilities have sprung up across the country, including at a military base in El Paso, the infamous Alligator Alcatraz in Florida, and Louisiana's Angola Prison. The Trump administration has even explored holding migrants at the original Alcatraz in San Francisco. 


	Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has backed the administration's claims that it can send undocumented immigrants to third-party countries to which they have no ties. Migrants from Mexico and South and Central America have been sent to Rwanda and Eswatini, prompting warnings from human rights groups about unsafe conditions in those countries. 


	As Trump's mass deportation plan has ramped up, members of the military have been increasingly conscripted into both immigration enforcement and local law enforcement operations. Along the U.S. southern border with Mexico, the Trump administration has created three new “national defense areas.” The special designation of these zones allows members of the military to detain migrants — a practice typically reserved for local and federal law enforcement agencies. The military's role in detaining migrants caught at the southern border is being challenged in court. 


	On Tuesday, two federal courts ruled that the Trump administration's use of the military for immigration and domestic law enforcement violated multiple laws. In California, Trump's use of the National Guard and the Marines during protests over immigration raids in June violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the military from domestic law enforcement operations, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer sided with the state of California in its lawsuit against the Trump administration, writing in his opinion that National Guard members and Marines violated the act by assisting multiple federal agencies during immigration and drug raids throughout the state. 

	











	When National Guard Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman warned that employing the guard to help with riot control or detain protesters was a likely violation of Posse Comitatus, DHS chief Gregory Bovino questioned Sherman's “loyalty to the country,” according to Breyer's opinion.


	In New Orleans, a panel of federal appeals court judges found that the Trump administration “improperly invoked” the Alien Enemies Act in its immigration efforts. Citing the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime law, Trump's administration sent hundreds of migrants to the dangerous CECOT prison in El Salvador without due process, based on the administration's claims the men were members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. 


	Two of the three judges for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the Trump administration did not provide sufficient evidence “that an invasion or a predatory incursion has occurred” by the Venezuelan government or Tren de Aragua members. A third judge, who was appointed by Trump, wrote a 131-page dissent disagreeing with his two colleagues. 


	The same day, Trump announced that U.S. forces had killed 11 people on a boat that he claimed was being piloted by Venezuelan drug traffickers. For months, the Trump administration has been building up the U.S. military's presence in the southern Caribbean, including off the coast of Venezuela. In all, seven warships and a nuclear submarine are either in the region or en route, Reuters reported, bringing the total number of sailors and marines in the area to 4,500. 


	As Trump has expanded military operations at the southern border and off the coast of Venezuela, he's also sent in the troops to American cities like Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., all while threatening — or “offering,” in Trump's words — to send the National Guard to places like Chicago, New Orleans, and San Francisco to tamp down on crime. (All forms of crime, including violent crimes, are down across the country from a spike in 2020, according to data from more than 95 percent of the nation's law enforcement agencies that was compiled and released last month by the FBI.)


	As summer turns to fall, Trump is deploying the military into wars of his own creation both at home and abroad.


	Whether it's sending the National Guard into Los Angeles to back up immigration agents there, into Washington, D.C., to supposedly fight crime, or having masked immigration agents cast a dragnet for undocumented immigrant workers like those in Georgia on Thursday, Trump supporters like Branum have largely backed the president has he has continued to expand the presence of the military and federal law enforcement into American life. 

	











	“I don't have a problem with it,” Branum says.

	As news of Thursday's raid spread, Branum began receiving threats for reporting the Hyundai plant to ICE. Her Facebook message requests are filled with “a lot of hate,” she says. But she's not backing down. 


	Just before 9 p.m., she posted a photo of herself lying in bed, holding a modified, AR-15-style rifle with a laser scope. “I'm kinda curious what that was [that] you said in my inbox,” Branum wrote.

Mark Ruffalo will soon be seen on the small screen in “Task,” back on HBO in the original drama series debuting Sunday, September 7. Brad Ingelsby's follow-up to “Mare of Easttown” centers on the “I Know This Much Is True” Emmy winner as an FBI Task Force agent assigned to a string of armed robberies, led by a family man (Tom Pelphrey), who hardly fits the profile of a career criminal.

IndieWire caught up with Ruffalo at the NYC premiere of the series, fresh off the heels of wrapping Lena Dunham's next feature, “Good Sex,” a few weeks ago in New York City. “I had the best time working with Lena,” Ruffalo told IndieWire. “I love her.”

“I knew her a little bit when she was younger,” he continued. “But we had the best time, Natalie Portman, Role Model, [and I]. It's twisted — Lena's stuff can be very twisted. It's super sexy, and it's very funny, and it has a rare quality of a romantic comedy that actually is being romantic and funny.” Role Model, whose real name is Tucker Pillsbury, makes his acting debut in the project. 

 










“He's going to surprise everybody,” Ruffalo added. He joked, “I mean, I hate him because he was such a natural. God damn you. God damn you, Tucker,” he laughed. “He's so good in it.”

“Good Sex” follows a 40-year-old couple's therapist, played by Portman, who finds herself back in the dating game after breaking off a decades-long relationship. The love triangle consists of a successful Manhattan man in his 50s, played by Ruffalo, and a Brooklyn hipster in his 20s, played by Role Model. Netflix bought the rom-com for a reported $55 million and will reportedly skip a theatrical release.

“I really just want people to sit on a couch with their moms and their besties and lean in,” Dunham said in an interview with Variety. “I love watching other filmmakers fight for the theatrical-release element — but I don't think this will live or die by that.”

In his review of “Task,” Ben Travers writes that the series may “bring to mind Michael Mann's ‘Heat‘ and Ben Affleck's ‘The Town,' or Bruce Springsteen's ‘The River' and Ruffalo's last HBO series, “I Know This Much Is True” — movies, songs, and shows that run bone-deep in their recognition of the distinctions that make us unique, the commonalities that connect us to each other, and the hands of fate that too often make you wonder what could've been.”

The 'Girl's Trip' and 'Wedding Crashers' stars play two polar opposites who discover they were married to the same man in the new project, which A Higher Standard is pitching to buyers at TIFF. 


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


Girls Trip star Tiffany Haddish has signed on to star opposite Isla Fisher (Tag, Wedding Crashers) in Double Crossed, a high-concept action-comedy being shopped to buyers at the Toronto International Film Festival. 


	Haddish and Fisher play Niki and Lara, two women with polar-opposite personalities who discover, at their husband's funeral, that they were married to the same man. As secrets from his life emerge, the unlikely duo embark on a perilous road trip to uncover the dangerous truth about the man they thought they both knew.

	Kestrin Pantera (Pretty Problems) is set to direct the film from a script by Shelby Enlow. Zero Gravity will produce the feature together with Jeffrey Greenstein's A Higher Standard, with A Higher Standard handling worldwide sales at TIFF. Principal photography is set to begin in the first quarter of next year.


	Zero Gravity's Mark Williams and Allie Loh with Orien Richman will produce alongside Greenstein, with Thayer Juergens executive producing and Rebecca Raichek overseeing development on behalf of A Higher Standard.


	“I couldn't be more excited about this film, this incredible team, and my first collaboration with Zero Gravity on what promises to be a fun-filled ride,” said Greenstein.


	“The combination of humor and explosions, what could be better,” added Williams.  “The script is very funny, our actors are very funny, now all we need is lighter fluid.”


	Haddish was last seen on the big screen in Bad Boys: Ride or Die, and has several features in the pipeline, including Matt Sukkar's action thriller The Deputy alongside William H. Macy, and Lil Rel Howery's feature Haunted Heist. Fisher was last seen in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, and in Netflix's George Clooney-starrer Jay Kelly, which celebrated its world premiere at the Venice film festival last week before heading to Telluride.

	











	A Higher Standard's upcoming slate includes the action comedy Playdate with Alan Ritchson and Kevin James, and the Kevin James-led romantic comedy Solo Mio. 


	Haddish is repped by UTA, Brillstein Entertainment Partners, and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole. Fisher is repped by UTA, and Sloane, Offer, Webber & Dern. Pantera is repped by CAA, Zero Gravity Management and Bloch Law.

Bing Liu, the writer/director born in China until his family moved him to the United States when he was five, has a Best Documentary Oscar nomination for his 2018 feature “Minding the Gap,” about male skateboarders in Rockford, Illinois. 

His narrative feature debut, “Preparation for the Next Life,” is produced by Orion Pictures and Plan B, from Brad Pitt, Jeremy Kleiner, and Dede Gardner — all following a similar path as Oscar-nominated docmaker RaMell Ross' own narrative feature debut “Nickel Boys,” also produced by Orion and Plan B, and also set up at Amazon/MGM Studios, and also a literary adaptation of an acclaimed novel. So why the hell is the studio burying Liu's film with a September 5 release date in the middle of fall festival season, and without sending it to any festivals?

The bittersweet immigrant love story at its core — starring cutie-pie it-boy Fred Hechinger (“The White Lotus,” “Thelma,” “Gladiator II”) as an army veteran and wildly promising discovery Sebiye Behtiyar as an undocumented Sebiye Uyghur woman, arriving in New York City amid great peril and pain — is as seemingly doomed as the movie's release strategy. Director Liu more than uncannily follows in Ross' footsteps, which led to a Best Picture and Adapted Screenplay nominations for “Nickel Boys”: Liu also worked as a camera assistant on fiction series and films outside his nonfiction efforts, bringing to “Preparation for the Next Life,” based on Atticus Lish's 2014 novel, a sophisticated visual sense.

 










That's even if the movie is uneven dramatically, weighed down by traumas and break-ups and breakdowns in the later stretches, and with too many shots of Aishe (Uyghur) jogging toward her future. Those scenes, long tracking shots held by cinematographer Ante Cheng's camera, don't tell us anything about Aishe other than how her soldier father, back in the Chinese province of Xinjiang she escaped where the Uyghur ethnic minority is persecuted, instilled in her a commitment to exercise and physical strength that becomes part of her preparations for the next life. If they tell us anything, it's to literalize how she's running from her past.

But the film's occasionally clumsy symbolism and sputtered drama aren't a reason to write off the film. On the contrary, “Preparation for the Next Life” is a promising narrative debut that also harnesses Liu's established bona fides as a documentary director. His observant approach to capturing the sights and sounds of New York's Chinatown and Lower East Side — the streets packed with extras, the kitchens where Aishe works steaming and bustling — displays what can only be a documentarian's attention to local detail and color.

 










Skinner is back in the United States, and in New York City with nothing but a backpack and baggie of anti-anxiety meds, after yet another tour of duty in the Middle East, and clearly dealing with undiagnosed PTSD and self-medicating with alcohol. Meanwhile, though Aishe speaks Mandarin and English (the latter a slight update from Lish's novel, in which her English vocabulary is limited), she is treated even by the landlord operating the Lower East Side hovel she's renting week after week as an outsider because she is Muslim. We get flashes of her perilous journey as a refugee from China to the United States, more so than is offered of Skinner's past, which he prefers not to divulge either. He spends much of his time on benders.

Martyna Majok's script would not work on the screen without the chemistry between Behtiyar (an actress wise for her years and lack of professional experience) and Hechinger, who fall fast in love all over New York City after a very only-in-the-movies encounter, in Times Square hotels and in a McDonald's or in the threadbare apartment Skinner rents, but are ultimately too damaged and from too disparate of cultural backgrounds to make it work. A late-breaking confrontation between the actors amid Skinner's escalating alcohol dependency is capably played by Behtiyar and Hechinger, in a film that has previously avoided overdramatics or sentimentality. A piano-driven score from “The Last Black Man in San Francisco” composer Emile Mosseri rings in your head long after the movie is over, a thing of true beauty. The cinematography is also up there with the year's best.

 










In a span of entire completed films evaporating off studios' rosters faster than a Titanic-bound submersible, does Amazon/MGM Studios want to be known as a corporation that treats artists similarly? “Preparation for the Next Life” begins a quiet release this weekend, and it doesn't feel like the studio is supporting it. There's an audience for this film, for those who like their romances unsentimental and spare, politically conscious without overheaping the messaging. It's a flawed but affecting film worth more than being treated as everything but a literal write-off.

Amazon/MGM Studios releases “Preparation for the Next Life” in theaters Friday, September 5.

	Blue-state governors are sounding the alarm that an increasingly “authoritarian” President Donald Trump has designs to disrupt upcoming elections with military assets.


	J.B. Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, is exhorting Americans to treat Trump's stated goals for deploying the National Guard to blue cities like Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Chicago with deep skepticism: “He has other aims other than fighting crime,” Pritzker told Face the Nation of Trump's threatened troop deployment to his state.


	“He'd like to stop the elections in 2026, or, frankly, take control of those elections,” Pritzker asserted. The governor added that by pre-positioning troops, Trump could attempt to impose his will on locally administered elections. “He'll just claim that there's some problem with an election — and then he's got troops on the ground that can take control.”Invoking the collapse of democracy in Germany in the 1930s, Pritzker warned that Trump has learned from “authoritarian regimes” across history — and that one of the primary ways authoritarians have consolidated power is to provoke “mayhem that requires military interdiction.” The governor continued, “Donald Trump is just following that playbook.” 


	Pritzker is not alone in issuing stark warnings about the danger Trump's domestic military deployments could pose to free-and-fair elections in this country. California Gov. Gavin Newsom also gave voice to the same concern during a conference call late last month, organized by the Democratic National Committee. Newsom said the National Guard troops, Marines, and other federal agents Trump has deployed to Los Angeles could be used to stoke fear at the ballot box — as soon as this November. 

	











	Trump recently extended the deployment of National Guard troops in California for another 90 days. “We still have federalized National Guard, interestingly assigned through Election Day,” Newsom said. “Is that coincidental? Through Election Day?!

	











	“That's a preview for the National Guard of things to come,” Newsom insisted. “Don't think for a second now that ICE and Border Patrol won't be showing up at a voting booth or polling places this November.” The California governor added, “We talk about authoritarianism, and I know it turns some people off. But at least we can submit that this is encroaching authoritarianism.”

	Concern about Trump using federal power to interfere in American elections — which are administered by state and local authorities — is not abstract. Just as he's ramped up National Guard deployments on two coasts, Trump has gone on a public offensive against mail-in voting — a move he said was inspired by a chat with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin.


	Vote-by-mail is a secure and popular method of casting ballots, relied on by absentee voters across the country. Universal vote-by-mail is practiced in red and blue states across the West. There is no evidence that mailed ballots create opportunities for fraud. But Trump is already using his presidential powers to punish states that rely on them. He justified his decision this week to relocate Space Force headquarters to Alabama because its current location, Colorado, “went to all mail-in voting,” Trump said, alleging the state therefore has “automatically crooked elections.”It's not difficult to connect the dots of how these paired developments endanger democracy: Ending remote voting, and then using military assets and federal law enforcement assets to intimidate voters at physical polling stations, could suppress turnout in large cities where opposition to MAGA policies is strongest.To be plain, any election interference by Trump would not be legal. “There is no law that allows the president to deploy the armed forces in any context to prevent a free and fair election, or to overturn the results of an election,” said Liza Goitein, a senior director of the pro-democracy Brennan Center on a recent call with reporters. Indeed, she added, “there are laws that specifically prohibit the armed forces from being involved in interference with an election.

	“That would be a coup, essentially, led by the president against our democracy,” she said.


	In his second term, Trump has not paid much heed to what's legal. In fact, a district court judge ruled this week that Trump's National Guard deployment in California violates a bedrock law called Posse Comitatus, because Trump is effectively transforming these troops into “a national police force with the president as its chief.” (The administration immediately appealed the ruling, which is stayed.)


	The 47th president is also playing with fire, rhetorically — toying with the authoritarian labels that his Democratic critics are appending to him. “They say … ‘He's a dictator! He's a dictator!'” Trump mocked in a recent Oval Office appearance, before adding with menace: “A lot of people are saying maybe we'd like a dictator.” (Trump then said he rejected the label, asserting he's just “a man with common sense” who knows “how to stop crime.”)


	A veteran of Trump's 2020 attempt to subvert an American election is already laying out ideas about how Trump could assert emergency control over future federal contests. Cleta Mitchell is an “election integrity” lawyer and right-wing activist who infamously joined Trump on the 2021 phone call in which he pressed Georgia state officials to “find” enough votes to overturn Joe Biden's victory in that state. 

	











	As flagged by Democracy Docket, Mitchell recently appeared on a podcast where she highlighted a president's ability to intervene in voting by citing a “threat to the national sovereignty of the United States.” Mitchell argued such a threat would be easy to “establish” because of how “porous” state-run elections are. “I think maybe the president is thinking that he will exercise some emergency powers to protect the federal elections going forward,” Mitchell said. 


	Trump's counterweights in the states are calling on Americans to wake up. “Nothing about this is normal,” Newsom said. “We're not going to act as if anything is normal any longer.” This exact note was echoed by Pritzker in a press conference this week warning against the deployment of federal forces to his state: “To everyone listening, but most especially to the press, I refuse to pretend that any of this is normal.”

	Pritzker denounced “the abject cruelty that we're seeing play out with the execution of Trump and Steven Miller's policies,” whether that's brutally rounding law abiding immigrants or responding to sandwich-throwing civilians by deploying armed military forces to the streets of the capital.


	The Illinois governor closed with a chilling warning that the past may be prologue. “Any rational person who has spent even the most minimal amount of time studying human history has to ask themselves one important question,” he said. “Once [the administration] gets the citizens of this nation comfortable with the current atrocities committed under the color of law, what comes next?”

	The MTV Video Music Awards will pay tribute to the late Ozzy Osbourne with an all-star performance featuring Yungblud and members of Aerosmith.


	Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, guitarist Nuno Bettencourt, and Yungblud will take the stage together at New York's UBS Arena this Sunday to deliver a medley of some of Osbourne's greatest hits.


	In addition to Osbourne's own classic music videos — like “Bark at the Moon” in MTV's infancy as well as Nineties-era visuals for “No More Tears” and “Mama, I'm Coming Home” — the heavy metal legend was a mainstay on MTV thanks to his hit reality show The Osbournes, which followed the hijinks of Ozzy and his family for four seasons and over 50 episodes in the early 2000s. The Emmy-winning series is also credited for kickstarting the wave of reality series centered around famous families, like the Kardashians. 


	Yungblud, Bettencourt, and Tyler were all among the artists who took part in Osbourne's Back to the Beginning farewell concert just weeks before Ozzy's July 22 death; Yungblud performed the Black Sabbath ballad “Changes,” while Bettencourt was featured in the backing band dubbed Tom Morello's All-Stars. Tyler, meanwhile, sang lead vocals of songs by Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith, but no Ozzy-fronted tracks at the Birmingham gig.

	The tribute also marks a now-rare reunion between Aerosmith's Tyler and Perry, as that band hasn't officially performed together since their farewell tour was canceled due to Tyler's vocal issues in 2023. While Aerosmith did reunite for a California wildfire benefit show earlier this year, the group has not announced plans for a makeup farewell tour.

	











	Sunday's VMAs will also feature performances by Sabrina Carpenter, Lady Gaga, Tate McRae, Alex Warren, Doja Cat, Jelly Roll, J Balvin, and more.

The fall festival firehose has opened. We're now inundated with new movie premieres (TIFF, for one, has a staggering 209 features), with Telluride wrapped and Venice heading into its final weekend.

On this episode of IndieWire's “Screen Talk” podcast, IndieWire Editor-at-Large Anne Thompson and Executive Editor Ryan Lattanzio break down the highs and lows of the fall festival circuit so far, from the standouts to the surprising misfires. Anne was in Telluride, which overlapped with Venice in programming a suite of Netflix titles, including Guillermo del Toro's lushly mounted “Frankenstein” (we're somewhat split on that one; Anne's a perennial del Toro head) and Noah Baumbach's “Jay Kelly.”

Starring George Clooney as an aging Hollywood star staring down a potential PR crisis after a scuffle with a former acting class peer, it's Baumbach's most sentimental movie yet, though Clooney and Adam Sandler as his manager are likely to score Oscar nominations. If you like your Baumbach brittle (Ryan is a self-described “‘Margot at the Wedding' gay”), then “Jay Kelly” is not for you. The movie Netflix ought to prioritize is Kathryn Bigelow's nuclear doomsday thriller “A House of Dynamite,” which went off spectacularly at Venice and next plays the New York Film Festival.

Back at Telluride, Anne was high on the Colorado mountains and the world premiere of Chloé Zhao's “Hamnet,” which earned ecstatic reviews and Oscar predictions across the board. Focus Features strategically brought Zhao's Shakespeare-era romantic tragedy, starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, to Telluride knowing it would get the best reviews there, and is the festival Zhao is loyal to.

Focus' other awards season horse in the race, “Bugonia,” they took to Yorgos Lanthimos' regular launchpoint in Venice, where it earned more guarded reviews compared to the rapturous Telluride reception. Ryan said that some of its bludgeoning satire — it's about an alt-right conspiracy nut (Jesse Plemons) who kidnaps a big-pharma CEO (Emma Stone) he thinks is an alien — felt like familiar Lanthimos schtick. Anne reveres the film and spoke to Jesse Plemons.

We both saw “After the Hunt,” which skipped Telluride to debut exclusively out of competition in Venice before opening the New York Film Festival. Luca Guadagnino's cancel-culture drama set in the world of academia did not play well at his native Italian festival, and on the eve of a rowdy press conference. Anne criticized the length and agreed with Ryan's review that the script is often muddled and incoherent despite a hefty performance from Julia Roberts as a philosophy professor grappling with her student's (Ayo Edebiri) against a colleague, played by Andrew Garfield.

The royal family is in mourning. Katharine, the Duchess of Kent, has died at the age of 92. Buckingham Palace confirmed the news on Friday, September 5, saying she passed away peacefully at Kensington Palace with her loved ones by her side.

“It is with deep sorrow that Buckingham Palace announces the death of Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Kent,” the statement read, according to the BBC. 

“The King and Queen and all Members of The Royal Family join The Duke of Kent, his children and grandchildren in mourning their loss and remembering fondly The Duchess's life-long devotion to all the organizations with which she was associated, her passion for music and her empathy for young people.”

Born Katharine Worsley, she married Queen Elizabeth's cousin Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, in 1961. The couple welcomed three children together: George, Earl of St. Andrews, Lady Helen Windsor, and Lord Nicholas Windsor. 

Katharine was also candid about her experiences with miscarriage and stillbirth, later sharing that the loss had the “most devastating effect on me” and gave her greater compassion for others facing similar heartbreak.

The Duchess stepped back from official royal duties in 1996 and went on to spend a decade teaching music at a primary school in Hull, where she was known as Mrs. Kent. “Only the head knew who I was. The parents didn't know, and the pupils didn't know. No one ever noticed,” she explained in a 2005 BBC Radio 3 interview, as reported by The Times.

In 2002, she also chose to stop using the “Her Royal Highness” title, though she continued to attend select royal events, including Prince William and Kate Middleton's 2011 wedding and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's 2018 nuptials.

Katharine's passion for music inspired her to launch the charity Future Talent in 2004. The organization helps children access instruments, tuition, and opportunities to nurture their musical gifts. 



She also volunteered at the Passage Night Shelter, supported cancer hospitals, and worked with UNICEF, reflecting a lifelong commitment to service.

Though she lived much of her later life away from the spotlight, the Duchess of Kent is remembered for her devotion to music, education, and charitable causes that touched countless lives.

Lynne Ramsay has never been one to shy away from disturbing portrayals of challenging subject matter, and her new film “Die My Love” sees the auteur probing the depths of postpartum depression. 

Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson star as a married couple who move to the countryside after having their first child, with Lawrence's Grace losing herself in a psychosexual frenzy as she adapts to her new life with a baby. 

The film premiered at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, where IndieWire's Ryan Lattanzio wrote that “I don't think there has ever before been such a psychologically immersive view of postpartum depression as ‘Die My Love' onscreen. The film careens between a dreary sludge of despair and eventual heart-palpitating nightmare, Grace caught in a mercurial storm of her own moods without ballast and unable to be understood by those around her.”

Ramsay directs from a screenplay she co-wrote with Enda Walsh and Alice Birsh, based on the novel by Ariana Harwicz. LaKeith Stanfield, Nick Nolte, and Sissy Spacek also star, with Lawrence, Martin Scorsese, Andrea Calderwood, Justine Ciarrocchi, Thad Luckinbill, Trent Luckinbill, and Molly Smith serving as executive producers.

While promoting the film at Cannes, Lawrence praised Ramsay's directorial vision and on-set presence while opening up about the experience of shooting “Die My Love” while pregnant with her own child.

“I'm not really an actor who brings my work home,” Lawrence said. “Part of what she's going through is the hormonal imbalance that comes from postpartum. She's also having an identity crisis. Who am I as a mother? Who am I as a wife? Who am I as a sexual person to my husband? Who am I as a creative? She's plagued with this feeling that she's disappearing. For me, I was four and a half, five months pregnant when we shot. I had great hormones! I was feeling great, which is the only way I would be able to dip into this emotion…also in terms of answering any question about my acting or performance at all, I had Lynne Ramsay as my director, so that kind of is it.”

A MUBI release, “Die My Love” opens in theaters on Friday, November 7. Watch the trailer below.

	The official teaser trailer for this year's big Cannes sale, Lynne Ramsay‘s Die, My Love starring Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson has landed and it's a wild ride. 


	The movie follows a mother named Grace (played by Lawrence) in rural America, battling psychosis as it takes a toll on her and husband (played by Pattinson). Sissy Spacek, Nick Nolte and LaKeith Stanfield also star.


	Grace tries to find her identity with a new baby in the isolated environment. Yet as she begins to unravel, it's not in weakness but imagination, strength and a stunning untamed vivacity that she discovers herself anew.

	











	Deadline's Damon Wise called the film a “brutal but beautiful story of a married woman's mental disintegration” in his review out of Cannes. He also posited that Lawrence's performance, which may be a career best, could land her a fifth Oscar nomination.

Amazon-backed firm Showrunner, led by Edward Saatchi, is using the film as a test case for how Hollywood can overhaul production. The results won't be commercialized — the tech giant hasn't obtained rights from Warner Bros. or Concord.

	Since the rise of generative artificial intelligence in 2022, the technology has mostly been plugged into parts of the production pipeline as far as its deployment in Hollywood. Think visual effects, dubbing and storyboarding. As it stands, it's mostly thought of as a tool to streamline certain processes and cut costs.


	But others have their sights set on completely overhauling the entertainment industry's use of AI. At the forefront: Showrunner, which plans to reconstruct the destroyed 43 minutes of Orson Welles‘ The Magnificent Ambersons.

	Amazon-backed Showrunnner announced on Friday a new AI model designed to generate long, complex narratives — ultimately building toward feature film length, live action films — for its platform completely dedicated to AI content that allows users to create their own episodes of TV shows with a prompt of just a couple of words. Over the next two years, it'll be utilized to re-create Welles' follow-up to Citizen Kane, a chunk of which was lost after studio executives burned the footage.

	The endeavor marks the tech's further encroachment onto Hollywood as it eyes the exploitation of AI tools embroiled in controversy over the possibility they were created using copyrighted materials from creators they could eventually displace. CEO Edward Saatchi ultimately envisions Showrunner as the “Netflix of AI” in which users can interact with and make fan fiction-esque versions of the intellectual property they're watching.

	











	“Year by year, the technology is getting closer to prompting entire films with AI,” Saatchi says. “Today, AI can't sustain a story beyond one short episode” but his company's technology is a “step toward a scary, strange future of generative storytelling.”


	The effort won't be commercialized because Showrunner hasn't obtained the rights to the film from Warner Bros. Discovery or Concord. If they “see a marketplace for it and a path for it outside of an academic context, then of course they have ownership of it,” Saatchi says. “The goal isn't to commercialize the 43 minutes, but to see them exist in the world after 80 years of people asking ‘might this have been the best film ever made in its original form?'”


The Magnificent Ambersons was filmed in 1941 at RKO's Gower Street Studios, now Sunset Gower Studios, in Los Angeles. The original cut was 131 minutes long, but Welles had conceded the right to the final cut. And once RKO took over editing, it deleted almost a third of the negatives for the film without the director's approval to free vault space. That footage was never found.


	At the time, the film was screened for critics and The Hollywood Reporter‘s review in July 1942 hailed the feature as “a screen offering of magnificent artistic merits,” noting that the 87-minute cut “is far from easy to summarize in ordinary catchline phrases.” For RKO, “Orson Welles is worth his weight in gold,” the paper said.

	











	Showrunner's endeavor will deploy a fusion of AI and traditional film techniques to reconstruct the lost footage. This includes shooting some sequences with live actors, with plans to use face and pose transfer techniques with AI tools to preserve the likenesses of the original actors in the movie. Extensively archived set photos from the film will serve as the foundation for re-creating the scenes.


	Helping to spearhead the project is Brian Rose, a filmmaker who's spent the last five years re-creating 30,000 missing frames from the movie. He's rebuilt the physical sets in 3D models, using them to pinpoint camera movements to match with the script, set photos, and archive materials. By his thinking, he's reconstructed the framing and timing of each scene, which will serve as the foundation for the re-creation.


	“There was, for example, a four-minute-long, unbroken moving camera shot whose loss is a tragedy,” Rose said in a statement. “The camera moves from one end of a ballroom and then back up the other end [while] you have about a dozen different characters walk in and out of frame, and crisscrossing subplots. It was really ahead of its time. Yet all but about the last 50 seconds of the shot was cut.”


	Tom Clive, a VFX expert on face-swapping and de-aging who previously worked for Metaphysic and recently joined Showrunner, will also be assisting.

Sesame Workshop will also continue to produce some original content for YouTube, and host workshops with creators to help them create entertaining and educational content.

YouTube is picking up some prime new real estate: Sesame Street.


	The video platform says that it has inked an expanded partnership with the nonprofit behind the show, Sesame Workshop, which will make YouTube the largest digital library of Sesame Street content available, including hundreds of classic episodes, beginning in January 2026.




Sesame Street, of course, will debut new episodes on Netflix and PBS in November, and Netflix has picked up about 90 hours of library episodes. Warner Bros. HBO Max also continues to make some library episodes available. YouTube, however, will top both of them, alongside new content created specifically for YouTube.

	YouTube says that over the past year Sesame Street content viewership was up by more than 130 percent, topping 5 billion views on the platform.

	Perhaps even more notably: Under the partnership, Sesame Workshop, will lead seminars for next YouTube creators “to share best practices on how to create content that is entertaining while also promoting learning.”


	The deal with YouTube caps off a tumultuous year for Sesame Workshop, which lost its output deal with HBO last December, though the streaming platform inked a deal to continue carrying some library programming.


	Netflix ultimately swooped in to secure rights to the show, inking a deal that also expands access by allowing episodes to debut on PBS Kids the same day they begin streaming on Netflix. That deal begins in November with season 56 of the show.

	











	YouTube, meanwhile, has become a bona fide juggernaut with regard to kids programming, thanks to creators like Ms. Rachel, and channels from the likes of Cocomelon.

The TIFF opener features reminiscences by colleagues including Steve Martin, Catherine O'Hara, Dan Aykroyd, Martin Short, Conan O'Brien, Mel Brooks and Tom Hanks.


							By 

	Michael Rechtshaffen



John Candy is having a bit of a moment. While it has been more than three decades since the beloved Canadian comic actor died tragically too soon, at the age of 43, of a heart attack, his legacy continues to burn brightly. Last year marked the 40th anniversary of Splash, the film that really jump-started Candy's big screen career; next month sees the release of the biography, John Candy: A Life in Comedy, penned by Paul Myers (brother of Mike); and this week the Toronto International Film Festival kicked off its 50th anniversary edition with the premiere of John Candy: I Like Me, a big-hearted documentary that's as embracing and generous of spirit as the man himself. It launches on Amazon Prime Video starting October 10.

	Directed by Colin Hanks, and featuring testimonials and reminiscences from those who knew him best — family, friends and colleagues including Dan Aykroyd, Catherine O'Hara, Martin Short, Steve Martin, Andrea Martin, Bill Murray and Hanks' dad Tom, who played his brother in the aforementioned Splash — the assessment of Candy's life and legacy provides ample cause for laughter while also provoking plenty of tears. Residing just beneath that easygoing, eager-to-please, everyman exterior was a chronic anxiety that reached a crippling peak during his final years.

The Bottom Line

	
	The affection is infectious.
	



Venue: Toronto International Film Festival (Gala Presentations)Airdate: Friday, October 10 (Prime Video)Director: Colin Hanks

								1 hour 53 minutes			






	As Hanks charts Candy's career trajectory from the Second City stages in Chicago and Toronto to cult sketch series SCTV to serving as John Hughes' muse in eight collaborations — including Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, from which the documentary derives its title, and Uncle Buck — he never loses sight of that nagging undercurrent of insecurity that would haunt the actor despite those successes. As O'Brien puts it, “This industry is very unhealthy for people-pleasers.”

	











	Toronto-raised John Franklin Candy was a shy, introverted big kid who was all of 5 years old when his own father died at age 35, also from heart disease. He'd gain confidence performing improv and sketch comedy, but it was his character work on SCTV, including his inspired takes on Pavarotti, Julia Child and Orson Welles, that made industry folk sit up and take notice.


	Spielberg would come calling with a part in 1941. Mel Brooks, on the high praise friend Carl Reiner had for Candy after directing him in Summer Rental, proceeded to cast him as the half-man, half-dog Barf in Spaceballs. “He stuck acting in his back pocket and behaved like a human being,” says Brooks of Candy's professional ethic.


	Despite all that good stuff coming his way, there was still that stubborn undercurrent of melancholy. In response to news of John Belushi (who had tried to persuade his old Second City buddy to join him on Saturday Night Live) dying of a drug overdose in 1982, SCTV colleague Dave Thomas tearfully recalls a despondent Candy saying, “Oh God, it's starting.” As Thomas elaborates, he carried the weight of his father's passing every day.


	Ironically, eating and drinking would become Candy's coping mechanism, even as he was aware of his family history. And while his wife Rose shares he would often work out with a trainer and go on extreme diets, she adds that “the industry wanted him big” and his representation wasn't exactly thrilled when he once shed close to 100 pounds.

	











	By the early '90s, when he was no longer picking the hits — as one interviewer not-so-gingerly puts it, “You've been in more turkeys than a stuffing mix” — Candy embarked on a second career as co-owner of the Canadian Football League's Toronto Argonauts, along with Wayne Gretzky and Los Angeles Kings owner Bruce McNall.


	By then increasingly plagued by panic attacks, he'd die in his sleep on March 4, 1994, while on location in Durango, Mexico, filming the ill-fated comedy Wagons East.


	Hanks — who previously directed a pair of music-themed documentaries, including All Things Must Pass: The Rise and Fall of Tower Records — knows to give the assembled wealth of comedic talent, along with Candy's widow and two adult children, all the space they need to share the many lively and affecting anecdotes. He accompanies those with a generous sampling of memorable movie and TV clips, archival interview and home movie footage, not to mention a stirring Cynthia Erivo cover of “Every Time You Go Away” by Daryl Hall & John Oates.

"At the time it made sense, but in hindsight you think maybe it could've been theatrical," Ravi Ahuja said at a Bank of America conference Thursday.

Sony Pictures CEO Ravi Ahuja says that the sale of KPop Demon Hunters to Netflix was the right decision for the studio, even as he acknowledged that in hindsight, it is possible that the animated musical could have become a theatrical franchise for Sony.


	Speaking at a Bank of America conference Thursday, Ahuja was asked by analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich whether KPop Demon Hunters could have worked in theaters for Sony.




	“This is the question we ask ourselves, everyone is asking us too. You know, I don't know. Obviously in hindsight it is such a big hit you think maybe it could've,” Ahuja said.

	“It was during the pandemic, it's k-pop themed, it was a very specific film, Netflix paid the whole cost plus a profit premium to us,” Ahuja added, explaining why the studio made the decision it did. “At the time it made sense, but in hindsight you think maybe it could've been theatrical, and in fact Netflix took it to theaters.”

	Indeed, in addition to being Netflix's biggest movie yet, Netflix brought a singalong version to theaters for one weekend, generating nearly $20 million in box office despite not playing in any AMC theaters.


	That does not mean that Sony would have been able to do the same thing.


	“It started out on Netflix, and word of mouth made it grow. In theatrical that is a lot harder to do,” Ahuja said, noting that theatrical movies need to make a cultural impact fast. “I think it was in the right home. I think KPop Demon Hunters' right home was Netflix, but year, it is an interesting question, could it have been theatrical? It is hard to say.”

	











	He added that while Sony Music does have some music rights, and that while Sony Pictures will produce any sequels (those talks are already beginning), Netflix owns the franchise, including merchandise rights.


	Ahuja said that he is “optimistic” about the future of the box office, noting next year's Spider Man and Jumanji movies, though breaking through will remain tough.


	“The theatrical bar, what is the bar you have to get over to make it theatrical … and I think for superhero movies the bar was relatively low,” Ahuja said of the state of franchise films. “Pretty much all of them would do incredible business, but now even superhero movies have to have originality, something different, an emotional connection.”


	“Things have to be cultural events, they have to be really appealing to some audience,” he added.


	The exec also laid out a vision for Sony under his leadership, focusing on “consistent, stable growth over time,” while exploring new areas.


	That includes experiential entertainment through the Alamo Drafthouse, which he noted is still “relatively under-penetrated in big cities.”


	“Our aspiration is not to be huge in theatrical distribution,” he added, instead leaning on that team to help forge direct consumer ties. 


	And he is thinking about digital media.


	“No media company has quite figure out how to work with the so-called creator economy, but we spend time on that, and hopefully we find a path there,” he said.

The coveted prop was used in 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi' and represented a rare opportunity for collectors.


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


	A lucky Star Wars fan is embracing the dark side, as Darth Vader's lightsaber from the franchise's initial trilogy has sold at auction for an astronomical sum. 


	The iconic character's screen-matched primary dueling lightsaber that was used in the films The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi sold for $3,654,000 when it hit the block from Propstore in Los Angeles on Thursday, becoming the highest-valued piece from the Star Wars franchise ever up for auction. The winning bid came in at a franchise record of $2,900,000 and reached the final total with the additional buyer's premium that is paid to the auction house.

Star Wars actor David Prowse and stunt double Bob Anderson both held the item onscreen. It carried a presale value estimate ranging from $1 million to $3 million.




			Popular on THR		







	This is said to be the only hero lightsaber from the original Star Wars trilogy to ever hit an auction. The Entertainment Memorabilia Live Auction coincides with this year marking the 45th anniversary of the release of The Empire Strikes Back.


	The Star Wars buying force was strong with the auction, as Anakin Skywalker's stunt dueling lightsaber for Hayden Christensen's character from the prequels went for $126,000, with the buyer's premium. This was nearly twice the presale estimate.

	











	Among the other items sold during the auction included Indiana Jones' bullwhip and belt that Harrison Ford used in Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, with the pair selling for $475,650. Also, Jean-Luc Picard's Ressikan flute, which belonged to Patrick Stewart's Star Trek: The Next Generation character, went for $403,200.


	Additionally, Rick Dalton's flamethrower tank and backpack, as Leonardo DiCaprio wore in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, sold for $346,500. 


	Earlier this summer, The Hollywood Reporter reported exclusively that Darth Vader's lightsaber would be hitting the auction block.


	“Surviving genuine lightsaber props from the original trilogy of films are exceedingly rare, and Propstore is honored to present this historic artifact in our September sale,” Propstore COO Brandon Alinger said in a previous statement. “It is a grail-level piece, worthy of the finest collections in the world.”


	In-person bidding took place at L.A.'s Petersen Automotive Museum on Thursday. Items will continue to be sold via online, telephone and absentee bidding as the auction continues through Saturday. 


	Back in 2022, Propstore sold a screen-matched model miniature X-wing fighter that is 22 inches long and was created for director George Lucas‘ original Star Wars film. The item went for more than $2.3 million.

In news that has led us to look at way more AI-generated pictures of Heath Ledger than we were expecting to this evening (i.e., one), Warner Bros. Discovery announced today that it's joining its fellow major Hollywood studios in attempting to sue the shit out of AI image and video company Midjourney. Earning a little “Hey, welcome to the fight” message from Disney—which, along with Universal, has been suing “bottomless pit of plagiarism” Midjourney for a few months now—WBD is seeking massive damages against the generative AI service.

And we'll say this for the lawsuit, publicly available here: It certainly makes a hell of a pitch for Midjourney's ability to spit out images of Warner Bros. Discovery's iconic characters. WBD's lawyers absolutely filled their filing with pictures of DC Comics characters, Looney Tunes characters, Rick And Morty, and more; the whole crux of their case rests on arguing that the technology in question is a credible threat to Warner Bros. Discovery's business model, granted, but some employee really filled up their “credible Tweety Bird copies” folder in the process.

As with the other Midjourney suits, Warner Bros.' attack on the tech company—which offers its services at rates ranging from $10 to $120 a month, along with the persistent knowledge that you're boiling a lake a day to generate the internet's nine billionth Batman picture—rests on two angles, one of which might carry a bit more legal weight than the other. One is focused on output: I.e., that by generating images of copyrighted characters, and then tacitly profiting off of them—via internal and external advertising, and the “Midjourney TV” video service that scrapes the company's own output for videos—Midjourney is infringing on existing copyrights. (For instance: WBD notes that it has a thriving business in poster sales and other officially licensed images, which Midjourney is directly competing with by letting users crap out as many copies of Rick Sanchez—who, somewhat hilariously, is legally defined here as “an animated eccentric mad scientist with spiky, baby-blue hair, and a unibrow of the same color”—as they'd like.) The issue here is that United States courts have yet to come down hard on the question of whether AI-generated material violates copyright, so it's a bit of a roll of the legal dice.

WBD might get slightly more traction by focusing on the ways Midjourney's AI is trained, which it intends to delve into deeply through discovery on the lawsuit. It'll be helped along by a few public statements Midjourney's execs made before they got slightly more lawyer savvy, apparently, including a 2022 quote from company founder David Holz that the team training the system “grabs everything they can, they dump it in a huge file, and they kind of set it on fire to train some huge thing.” At least one recent legal ruling has suggested that training on other people's material might fall under fair use—but that things can get a lot more murky if the plaintiff can prove that copyrighted material was used (and duplicated) in order to feed into the machine.

The upshot of all this is that there are now three major Hollywood studios targeting this one firm in particular, making it increasingly likely that the Midjourney fight will end up setting some kind of precedent for how courts handle AI going forward. Per THR, Warner Bros. Discovery is seeking “Midjourney's profits attributable to the alleged infringement or, alternatively, $150,000 per infringed work,” which could add up to a frankly astronomical sum.

The rapper has been sued over uncleared samples more than a dozen times throughout his career.

	Rachel Scharf



Ye (formerly Kanye West) has been sued for allegedly sampling a 1975 soul song without permission on his 2022 album Donda 2, marking the latest in a long line of similar copyright lawsuits against the controversial rapper.


	A legal complaint filed Thursday (Sept. 4) in federal court claims the Donda 2 track “LORD LIFT ME UP” includes a blatant sample of the song “Just Out of My Reach” by soul artist Sam Dees. The lawsuit is brought by an entity called The GRC Trust on behalf of Ginn Music Group, an Atlanta-based catalog company that owns Dees' publishing.


	“At no point…did defendants obtain authorization from GRC to use the composition in connection with the infringing work,” reads the complaint. “Defendants continue to exploit and receive monies from the infringing work, respectively, in violation of GRC's rights in his composition.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The lawsuit brings copyright infringement claims against Ye, his company Yeezy LLC and the rapper Vory (Tavoris Javon Hollins), who is featured on “LORD LIFT ME UP.”


	Also named in the complaint are London-based tech firm Kano Computing and its founder, Alex Klein. Kano partnered with Ye to release the rapper's branded Stem Player device, which was the only way to listen to Donda 2 when the album was first released in February 2022 (Ye released the LP on streaming for the first time just this year).


	GRC is asking for a judge to enter a legal injunction against Ye and award the publishing company “all profits of defendants … plus all losses of GRC, plus any other monetary advantage gained by the defendants through their infringement.”


	Reps for Ye, Vory and Kano did not immediately return requests for comment on Thursday.


	Ye has been sued repeatedly over the course of his career for supposedly using uncleared samples. Such lawsuits have been brought over the years by everyone from the estate of Donna Summer to a pastor whose sermon was allegedly sampled on the first Donda LP.


	Thursday's lawsuit is the second to claim infringement on the Donda 2 album. The first — brought by publisher Ultra International over an alleged sample of the 1986 Marshall Jefferson house track “Move Your Body” on the song “Flowers” — was confidentially settled in 2023.

Great American novelist and celebrated storyteller Ernest Hemingway's last surviving child, Patrick Hemingway, has died. Patrick Hemingway died on Tuesday, September 3. He was 97.

A post shared by Ernest Hemingway Official (@ernest.hemingway.official)

Patrick was the son of Ernest and Pauline Pfeiffer. He was born in Kansas City, Missouri, on June 28, 1928, and his death was announced by his grandson, Patrick Hemingway Adams, who shared a loving statement on behalf of the family.

Adams posted several photos on Instagram of his grandfather, including throwbacks to when he was young. In the caption, he shared the sad news. “Patrick Hemingway, renowned writer, wildlife conservationist, and second son of the legendary literary icon, Ernest Hemingway, died on Tuesday evening peacefully at his home in Bozeman, Montana,” the statement reads.

Like his famous father, Patrick was drawn to literature, Adams revealed in his heartfelt statement. “My grandfather was the real thing: a larger than life paradox from the old world; a consummate dreamer saddled with a scientific brain,” he wrote. “He spoke half a dozen languages and solved complicated mathematical problems for fun, but his heart truly belonged to the written and visual arts.”

Ernest's work is celebrated, with some of his most famous book titles including “The Sun Also Rises,” “A Farewell to Arms,” and “The Old Man and the Sea.”

More information about the brilliant life his son, Patrick, led was shared on the Ernest Hemingway Official website. This includes his time spent in Africa, where he was a skilled animal guide and wildlife expert. When Patrick's mother passed away in 1951, “He channeled his previous studies and passion for agriculture on his 2,300 acre farm in Tanzania where he had relocated with his first wife, Henrietta Broyles,” the Ernest Hemingway Official reports.

It continues, “Patrick gained global recognition for his safaris and expeditions. He served as a guide, expert, and honorary game warden in British East Africa. After his time there, Hemingway relocated to Bozeman, Montana, where he resided until the time of his passing.”

The post has served as an opportunity for fans and loved ones to react to the news, with an outpouring of love and support for the family. “Deepest condolences to you and your family. Legend,” a comment reads. “My heartfelt thanks for your grandfather's legacy Patrick,” another person shared. “Always liked the man in the interviews he gave. It's tough being a Hemingway I'm sure but he wore that burden with a light ease that was admirable always.”

Other reactions include, “Sorry to hear. My condolences,” “An amazing man,” and “They are together on the other-side now.”

	Are you ready for some football? Shaboozey sure is. The “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” singer has partnered with Amazon's Prime Sports for “Let ‘Em Know,” a new song that will be part of the Thursday Night Football show opening and a national marketing campaign.


	The song — snippets of which can be heard in the commercial below and will be part of the campaign rolling out Thursday (Sept. 4) — will premiere Sept. 11 with the Green Bay Packers and Washington Commanders game, and will lead TNF Tonight and Thursday Night Kickoff on Prime Sports each week. This is Prime Sports' fourth year streaming NFL games on Thursday nights.

	











	“Our collaboration with Shaboozey has produced an incredible campaign that showcases TNF as the ultimate fan experience,” Stacey Rosenson, head of U.S. sports marketing for Prime Video, said in a statement. “Shaboozey is the perfect artist to kick off TNF each week and reflects our commitment to capturing the energy of starting the weekend on Thursday nights.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	Composer Pinar Toprak's original anthem, commissioned for Thursday Night Football‘s debut in 2022, will continue to serve at TNF's theme music.


	Shaboozey's career continues to soar. “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” is the longest-running No. 1 by a solo artist on the Billboard Hot 100 at 19 weeks. His follow-up, “Good News,” stands at No. 1 this week on Billboard‘s Country Airplay chart.

	











	“Let ‘Em Know” continues Shaboozey's connection with the NFL: He performed a three-song medley at the Detroit Lions Thanksgiving halftime show in November 2024 against the Chicago Bears.

SANTA MARIA, Calif. (KEYT) - With Labor Day behind us now, holiday lovers are beginning to hum familiar tunes and break out their decorations for Halloween.

While it's still a month and half away, if anyone is dying to get right into the spirit, a show with growing audiences and new acts – Paranormal Cirque II – is performing at the Santa Maria Fairpark for one weekend only, September 5th through 8h.

This is one of the latest times in the year they've performed in the area, and Monday is their last show.

With more of an "R" rating, it's worth getting a babysitter for the little ones and bringing a date to ring in the Halloween season.

Doors open at 6:30 and the show starts at 7:30, and it's like any other circus with acrobats, contortionists, snacks and and beverages, just with a horror theme.

Three years into its mission, the James Webb Space Telescope has advanced the search for alien life more than any machine before it. What will it find next?

Imagine a planet twice as wide as Earth, covered in an ocean that smells like sweet cabbage.

Every day, a faint red star warms this ocean world and the uncountable masses of hungry, plankton-like creatures that inhabit it. They rise to the surface by the billions, joining together in a living, floating continent larger than Australia — spewing out a pungent gas as they knit sunlight into food.

The sulfurous gas steams out of the alien bloom, filling the air so fully that a lone telescope floating 700 trillion miles (over a quadrillion kilometers) away can sense it — faintly, for just a few hours every month, when the watery planet glides in front of its small, red star. For those few hours, the alien algae of the pungent planet make themselves known to Earth.

It sounds like science fiction ... but is it?

For the past two years, this question has been the subject of intense debate among alien-hunting scientists, with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at its center. Captured in the powerful telescope's crosshairs is the planet K2-18b, located around 120 light-years from Earth. There's no question that the planet itself is real. But its surface conditions, as well as its likelihood of harboring life, remain contested.

 




One group of researchers who has studied K2-18b with JWST for the last few years claims to have detected signs of dimethyl sulfide (DMS). This compound, which has a cabbage-like odor, is what many Earthlings think of as "the smell of the sea" and is only known to be produced by living, breathing phytoplankton. The team first reported hints of DMS in K2-18b's atmosphere in 2023, and has followed up with several papers since.

Outside researchers remain skeptical of this alleged DMS detection, however. They've cautioned that the team's detection relies on questionable data modeling and falls short of the threshold required to signify a new scientific discovery. Only further observations of the planet can truly settle the question.

But what isn't in doubt is that JWST's ultrapowerful infrared vision is giving humans the best-ever shot at finding extraterrestrial life.

Thanks to JWST, "we're learning more just in the last few years than we've learned in the preceding decades about the compositions of atmospheres outside the solar system," Eddie Schwieterman, an assistant professor of astrobiology at the University of California, Riverside who studies exoplanet habitability with JWST, told Live Science.

It's dogma in the search for alien life that where there's an atmosphere, there may also be water on a planet's surface — and where there's flowing water, there may be life. For the first time, JWST is bringing those alien atmospheres into focus.

"We are at a really important time in the search for life, in that we now have the technological capability to do it," said Victoria Meadows, a professor of astronomy at the University of Washington and director of the astrobiology graduate program. "Prior to JWST, we really did not have the capability to do this."

 




In the hunt for habitable planets — those that orbit in the "Goldilocks zone" of their home star, where liquid water can flow on the surface — JWST is in a class of its own.

Unlike Hubble and other optical telescopes, JWST can't directly image the surfaces of faraway planets. Nor can it detect radio waves and other potential "technosignatures" emitted by any advanced alien civilizations that might exist. The signs of life JWST seeks are far more elemental. They're not blurry snapshots of alien trackways or mysterious radio signals, but hints of molecules tumbling invisibly through space, far above a planet's surface.

"The first step in finding life is to find an atmosphere," Sebastian Zieba, a postdoctoral researcher at the Harvard and Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, told Live Science. "In order to have liquid water on the surface, you need an atmosphere."

Compared with its predecessor — NASA's infrared Spitzer Space Telescope (launched in 2003 and retired in 2020) — JWST is "better in every way," Zieba said. It can look farther across space and detect a broader range of infrared wavelengths than any telescope before it. Infrared emissions are crucial to the hunt for life, because those wavelengths are best at encoding information about the types of molecules that are absorbing or reemitting starlight in a planet's atmosphere.

For JWST to detect hints of an exoplanet's atmosphere, scientists must wait for a transit — the moment when a planet swoops in front of its home star, forcing that star's light to shine through the planet's atmosphere as seen from our perspective on Earth. In the case of K2-18b, for example, that happens once every 33 days.

 




"The planet passes in front of the star, and it backlights the atmosphere," Meadows said. "It's like a little halo around the planet."

That "halo" contains important clues about an alien world. As starlight streams through the planet's atmosphere, airborne molecules either absorb or reemit different wavelengths of light, changing what JWST sees when observing at those wavelengths. The unique signature of light compiled from these different wavelengths, called a spectrum, can reveal which molecules are in the atmosphere. This information, in turn, allows scientists to infer the planet's size, surface conditions, geography — and chances of supporting life.

For example, Meadows said, if JWST captures the spectrum of a planet that reveals high levels of methane and carbon dioxide absorption in its atmosphere, it could indicate a habitable world akin to Earth in the Archean eon (roughly 4 billion to 2.5 billion years ago), when primitive microbes were breaking down CO2 and spewing vast quantities of methane.

Proving those conditions exist on a planet trillions of miles away is the hard part.

After making a promising biosignature detection, the challenge then becomes proving that it can't be explained by a geological process, such as volcanism. Then, scientists must demonstrate that their detection meets statistical significance — a rigorous undertaking that requires many repeat observations of the planet and verification from independent researchers using their own data models.

"Webb data is very complex," René Doyon, a professor at the University of Montreal and principal investigator of JWST's Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) instrument, told Live Science. "People have been publishing results that are not always consistent. Depending on who reduced the data, you get a different answer."

It's here that early studies of K2-18b have fallen under scrutiny. Despite the tentative detection of DMS reported in two studies by a team of University of Cambridge-led researchers, outside experts have so far been unable to verify the result when looking at the same observations with different data models. Furthermore, the DMS detection only reached the three-sigma level of statistical significance, falling far short of the required five-sigma level. (A three-sigma level is around a 3 in 1000 chance of being a fluke, while a five-sigma value means a result has a probability of 1 in 3.5 million of being a fluke).

Nikku Madhusudhan, a professor of astrophysics at Cambridge and lead author of the two DMS studies, said this is no reason to ignore K2-18b as a candidate for a habitable world "teeming with microbial life."

"We have initial feelers for what we are seeing, but we could be wrong," Madhusudhan told Live Science. "So let's be open to being wrong and get more data. Only then can we confirm what we're seeing."

Schwieterman thinks it was "premature" to announce the detection of DMS on K2-18b, given the questionable statistical significance. However, he agrees that DMS is a promising signature of life that JWST should continue hunting for on other potentially habitable ocean worlds.

"The question we want to ask is, how common are global biospheres in the universe?" Schwieterman said. If there's complex life out there, including intelligent life, then "a big part of that question is, how common are the biospheres from which those more complex forms of life would originate?"

Even if life doesn't ultimately materialize on K2-18b, the distant planet is just one of many being targeted by JWST's keen infrared eye.

The telescope's search list includes some of the usual suspects, such as the TRAPPIST-1 system — the single most-studied star system beyond our own. The system contains seven rocky planets, at least three of which may be in the star's habitable "Goldilocks" zone. So far, though, JWST has found no hints of an atmosphere around any of those planets, possibly indicating that the host star showers its satellites with too much ultraviolet radiation to allow atmospheres to survive, Zieba said.

Doyon favors studying a world called LHS 1140 b, located 50 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cetus. Doyon and team's observations with JWST reveal that the exoplanet, once thought to be a rocky "super-Earth" six times as massive as our planet, is a much bigger oddball — or, perhaps, an eyeball.

 




"It may be a bull's-eye planet," Doyon said, describing a mostly ice-coated planet with a single blue "iris" of liquid water pointed toward its home star.

Using JWST data from two transits of LHS 1140 b, Doyon and colleagues reestimated the mass and radius of the planet and found "it cannot be explained as a rocky planet — it must have something between 10% and 20% of its mass in water," Doyon said. "It's a potential waterworld, and it's right in the habitable zone."

According to Doyon, LHS 1140 b doesn't resemble Earth so much as it resembles our solar system's icy moons Europa and Enceladus, both of which are suspected to harbor subsurface oceans that could support life. But unlike those moons, this planet is so close to its home star that some of its ice may have sublimated into gas, forming an atmosphere. It's even possible that the sun-facing side of the planet (which, like Earth's moon, is tidally locked) could heat up enough for the ice to melt there, revealing a liquid-water ocean beneath a cloudy sky. As such, this warm, blue "iris" could host life.

Doyon thinks this is one the likeliest known exoplanets to harbor an atmosphere.

"If I had to bet a beer on whether it has an atmosphere, it probably has one," he said.

Sadly, Doyon's beer will likely have to wait.

Although Doyon and his colleagues detected "hints" of a nitrogen-rich atmosphere around LHS 1140 b, he said it will take about a dozen more transits to prove whether there are other molecules indicative of an Earth-like atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide. Because LHS 1140 b becomes visible from Earth only four times a year, scientists would have to observe every possible transit for years to come before making any firm conclusions. It's a schedule that "really pushes JWST to its limits," Doyon added.

This underscores one of the telescope's biggest limitations: time.

 




In 2024, researchers around the world requested a total of more than 78,000 hours of JWST observation time — about nine times more than is available, according to the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), which manages JWST proposals each year. Of the more than 2,300 submissions, only 274 proposals were ultimately accepted, with exoplanet habitability research accounting for a small percentage.

That discrepancy is likely to widen with the passage of the Trump administration's proposed budget for 2026, which includes a nearly 50% cut to NASA's science budget, according to Live Science's sister site Space.com. If approved by Congress, the cuts would amount to a roughly 25% to 35% reduction in JWST operations, Neill Reid, multimission project scientist at STScI, said in July at the 246th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Anchorage, Alaska.

In the end, JWST may not uncover a smoking gun in the search for extraterrestrial life. But even if it doesn't, it will likely help scientists determine where to search next. Future telescopes will build on JWST's revelations, helping to fill in the missing gaps.

One major gap is oxygen. While the gas makes up about 21% of Earth's atmosphere and is a potent biosignature, "JWST can't do oxygen," Meadows said.

Multiple studies — including one co-authored by Meadows, in which researchers modeled what JWST would see if it studied Earth's atmosphere — have found that the telescope is simply not sensitive enough to detect oxygen. That poses a clear challenge to detecting Earth-like atmospheres.

Forthcoming telescopes could help account for that. For example, the Extremely Large Telescope — a powerful optical/near-infrared telescope being constructed in Chile that could see first light in 2029 — will be more sensitive to oxygen and water in planetary atmospheres than JWST is, Meadows said. It will also be able to peer all the way down to the surfaces of rocky planets — closer to where life and its byproducts are more likely to be, unlike the high upper atmospheres that are JWST's domain.

Further down the line, NASA's recently announced Habitable Worlds Observatory will take a census of planets around sunlike stars close to our solar neighborhood. Parsing visible, infrared and ultraviolet light signatures, the powerful observatory could potentially confirm atmospheres around dozens of Earth-like worlds. Currently, however, there is no planned launch date.

Can it be fixed?—James Webb telescope discovers oldest black hole in the universe

With JWST expected to remain operational at least into the 2030s, its era of discovery is just beginning. Will it find alien life? Maybe, maybe not. But in its first years, it's already leading scientists closer to that first tantalizing glimpse of evidence than any telescope has before.

And once that evidence is found — even if it's on a distant exoplanet that no human or probe will ever lay eyes on — there's no going back. Finding evidence of even one other inhabited planet would imply that there could be countless others out there, raising big questions about the prevalence of life in the universe, and where humans fit into it. The discovery of an alien world would change how we view the cosmos, as well as ourselves.

"Once we find a credible hint of evidence for life on an exoplanet … I don't think we're ever going to forget about that planet," Schwieterman said. "It's going to be both a scientific and cultural touchstone. Kids are going to learn about it in school."

In a gripping episode of Ninjas Are Butterflies, L.A. Marzulli dives deep into the mysteries of ancient giants, biblical prophecy and the cosmic battle between good and evil. From the elongated skulls of Paracas to the hidden histories of the Americas, Marzulli unpacks a world that challenges conventional archaeology and theology.

One of the most controversial topics Marzulli discusses is the Paracas skulls. Marzulli explains that while some claim modern DNA testing reveals anomalies, contamination remains an issue. “A Neanderthal is 99.5% identical to modern humans. The Paracas skull? 96.5%,” he notes. Marzulli emphasizes rigorous testing and peer-reviewed publications as essential to validate such discoveries, sharing how the third round of DNA analysis currently underway.

The episode also tackles the world of alleged hoaxes in archaeology, including the infamous Nazca mummies. Marzulli recounts personal experiences with purportedly altered mummies that were ultimately revealed to be constructs. “You cut the thumb off, the pinky off, elongate the remaining three fingers, cover it in plaster—voilà, you have your hoax,” he explains. Such cases underscore the importance of scientific scrutiny over sensational claims.

Marzulli then bridges these discoveries with biblical prophecy, particularly the “seed war” introduced in Genesis 3:15. He argues that throughout history, attempts have been made to corrupt the human genome, tracing back to the days of Noah and the Nephilim. Jesus' warning that the end times would mirror the days of Noah, Marzulli suggests, directly references these ancient giants whose bones were openly displayed in Jerusalem.

Marzulli also addresses how these spectacular phenomena connect with alien alleged abduction cases and hybrid experimentation. He draws connections between ancient texts, like the Book of Enoch and current reports of extraterrestrial encounters. According to Marzulli, these modern incidents echo the same patterns of interference seen throughout biblical history.

Ultimately, the episode is more than an exploration of giants, mummies or UFOs—it's a journey into the unseen spiritual battles that have shaped human history. Whether investigating ancient civilizations, mysterious artifacts, or the deep currents of Scripture, Marzulli's work invites a closer look at a universe where history, science, and prophecy intersect—and where the eternal battle between good and evil continues to shape humanity's destiny.

We love you, Malamar


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


In case you hadn't heard, Malamar is the undisputed best Pokemon of all time. Everyone loves Malamar, and you should, too. In fact, loyal fans and friends of Malamar have been spreading the love for the Gen 6 Dark/Psychic type, for no particular reason at all.

OK, but seriously, why is everyone suddenly talking about this big squid? Yesterday, a series of truly bizarre live-action videos were shared on official Pokemon social media channels, showing people celebrating Malamar in various ways – from a very enthusiastic artist making a mural, to a taxi driver with a car full of Malamar plushies, wearing what looks like some kind of cloak made of the things, too. Honestly, goals. Another dances to a cheering crowd while chanting, "My friend Malamar."

It seems pretty likely that these are all teasers for Malamar getting a Mega Evolution in Pokemon Legends: Z-A – we've had similarly interesting reveals for a couple of the other new ones, after all. The Malamar videos seem to be playing on the idea that the 'mon has hypnotic powers that can be used to make people do whatever it wants, and it's seemingly using them to make everyone love it and want to be its friend - There's something deeply sad about that if you think about it too hard.

Anyway, as the official Pokemon channels spread the love, fans have been following suit. "FUUUUCKKKK!!! I LOOOVE MALAMAR!!! GREATEST POKEMON OF ALL TIME!!!" one enthusiastic friend of Malamar declares. "Felt the urge to draw my Favorite Pokemon Malamar for some reason," says another, sharing some lovely new fan art of the 'mon.

Others, meanwhile, are creating their own Malamar chain letter messages, which you can bask in the glory of below. There's… a lot going on.

Anyway, the good news for any friends of Malamar is that – as Serebii reports – we can expect a "special 'celebration' of Malamar" to appear on the Pokemon social channels at 6am PT / 9am ET / 1pm GMT on Wednesday, September 10. Personally, I'm predicting that we're going to see a Mega Evolution reveal then, but it would be incredibly funny if it ended up being totally unrelated, and simply just a huge effort to make more people like one of Kalos' weirdest 'mons.

 Matt Cohen is on the case in Genoa City.


 The South of Nowhere and Supernatural alum has been cast as Detective Burrow on The Young and the Restless, Entertainment Weekly can exclusively reveal. He began taping last week and will first appear in the episode airing Thursday, Oct. 16.


 It is said that Detective Burrow, who is a new character on Y&R, will be front and center investigating a major case featuring some of the soap's key characters. Further details of the character are unknown at this time, but Genoa City has been in need of a new lead detective ever since the shocking death of Chance Chancellor (Conner Floyd) in July.


 The well-respected lead detective was fatally shot by Carter (Vincent Stalba) during a confrontation in the Monday, July 28 episode, and the police force has been without a leader ever since.


 Cohen is no stranger to the world of soap operas. He is well-known to daytime TV fans as Griffin Munro on General Hospital, a role which he played from 2016-2019. Fans of the CW series Supernatural will also recall Cohen playing a young John Winchester and the archangel Michael.


 Additionally, Cohen is a Daytime Emmy Award winner for his work as a correspondent and co-host on Entertainment Tonight from 2019-2023. More recently, in January, Cohen directed and had a starring role in the feature film, Exes, alongside Briana Buckmaster, Mark Sheppard, Felicia Day, and Ricky Whittle.


 He also produced and co-created the adult animated comedy Public Domain, which stars several fellow Supernatural alums. The first episode is available on the show's YouTube page.


 Cohen isn't the only former General Hospital star to make the leap to Y&R this year. Last week, EW confirmed Roger Howarth, whose daytime TV credits include years-long stints on General Hospital, One Life to Live, and As the World Turns, is also joining the CBS sudser in a new role.

 Howarth was most recently seen on General Hospital as Dr. Austin Gatlin-Holt, the third character he'd played on the ABC soap since 2012, after playing Todd Manning and Franco Baldwin.


 In a heartfelt note announcing his departure from GH in 2023, Howarth wrote, "Daytime fans are lovely and amazing and supportive and dedicated and I am deeply grateful to each sparkly one of them. I enjoyed my time at General Hospital and wish the cast and crew the best and continued success. It was a pleasure working with you all."


 In addition to Howarth and Cohen, it was also revealed last week that daytime TV veteran Tamara Braun would also be stepping into the world of The Young and the Restless, also as a new character named Sienna Bacall.

A Chinese man risks losing all his teeth after trying to make his own dentures with a special resin bought online, to save money on expensive dental procedures.

Ms. Liu, who runs a dental clinic in Tianjin, recently posted shocking photos of an elderly client who came in with both his upper and lower teeth caked in a hard, brown substance. He had allegedly been experiencing trouble eating because of his deteriorating teeth, so he decided it was time to get artificial dentures. However, he didn't want to spend too much on them, and knowing that dental work was expensive, he decided to make his own dentures using materials he bought online. Unfortunately, he made a mess of his teeth and was left with no other option than to seek professional help. To his despair, so far, no one has been willing to remove the DIY dentures.



“He was reluctant to spend money on dentures and bought materials for 5 yuan ($0.7),” Liu posted on Weibo. “He said the hospital didn't dare do anything, and I said there was nothing we could do either.”

5 yuan sounds like too good a deal to pass up, but Liu claims the DIY dentures were a complete disaster and the man now risks losing all his teeth, if he can find someone brave enough to remove the resin. The dentist used this unusual case as a cautionary tale, warning her followers to seek professional help instead of trying to fix their teeth themselves.



Although Ms. Liu didn't go into details about the man's attempt at making his own dentures, some speculated that he did not use ultraviolet light to harden the resin, causing it to slowly harden into an uncomfortable mold. People generally agreed that, while very expensive, dental work should be left to the experts.

Autopsy results have been released following the death of Daniel Rivera, 54, a paranormal investigator who died while on tour in Gettysburg this summer.

Adams County Coroner Francis Dutrow confirmed that Rivera died from a “cardiac-related” event and that his death was ruled natural. Dutrow also stated that the “Annabelle” doll, which was part of the tour, was not present in the hotel room where Rivera died in July.

Rivera was in Gettysburg for the “Devils On the Run” tour with the Annabelle doll, which was displayed in Adams County from July 11–13. The tour was reported to be sold out each day and continued after his passing.

Rivera was a senior investigator with the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR). The organization posted a statement following his death, noting his role in sharing paranormal experiences and education.

The Annabelle doll, originally a Raggedy Ann doll, is part of the “Conjuring” movie series storyline based on the cases of Ed and Lorraine Warren. NESPR states that the doll was placed in a glass case to contain what was believed to be an evil spirit.

The election supervisor in the western German state of North Rhine-Westphalia has told the media that the authority is aware of 16 candidates dying in the run-up to this month's local elections.

Elections will take place in the state on 14 September and voters will choose district, municipal and city councils, as well as mayors in most cities and district administrators.

But election officials say they are not concerned by the number of deaths and don't consider it significantly high.

But speculation has been rife on social media due to the rising number of deaths among candidates representing the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.

At the beginning of September, four candidates for the AfD were reported dead, and just days later that tally had risen to seven.

AfD co-chair Alice Weidel shared the news in a post on the social media platform X saying only, "Four AfD candidates dead."

The initial four deaths were among candidates representing the towns of Bad Lippspringe, Blomberg, Rheinberg and Schwerte.

State police looking into the initial four deaths, which were announced on 1 September, told the German Press Agency (dpa) that there was no evidence of any third party involvement.

Only in one case was an official investigation launched which didn't uncover any evidence of foul play.

The other three fatalities were determined to have died in circumstances that were not deemed suspicious.

Of the candidates whose deaths were announced on 2 September, one died of kidney failure while the other committed suicide.

On 3 September, the AfD branch in Remscheid told Politico that their candidate for Kremenholl was an 80-year-old who died of natural causes after a long illness.

Kay Gottschalk, the AfD state vice-president, said on Politico's "Berlin Playbook" podcast that there was no reason to view the deaths as anything other than a coincidence.

Nevertheless, it is planned to examine the cases "without immediately getting into conspiracy theory territory," he said.

North Rhine-Westphalia is Germany's third-largest state by area and has a population of more than 18 million.

More than 20,000 people are running for seats in the state.

If intelligent beings exist on distant planets, this could be how to find them.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In the endless search for technosignatures—signs from some technologically advanced intelligent alien civilization—we've done everything from monitoring radio arrays to hypothesizing about whether space rocks like ‘Oumuamua and 31/ATLAS are actually alien starships stealthily traversing the cosmos in disguise. We have even sent out technosignatures of our own—those golden records on both Voyager spacecraft come to mind—but have heard nothing back. 

Earthlings have been ghosted every time we tried phoning E.T. Now an international team of researchers associated with the SETI Post-Detection Hub at the University of St. Andrews in the U.K. has come up with an alien hunting playbook for NASA, which emphasizes what the agency's most important goals should be in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. They urge NASA to prepare for possible technosignature detections and highlight how it can carry out research based on evidence, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary work, communication, predictive strategies, and possible methods of detection for the future. 

NASA already has a strong astrobiology foundation in the form of its Astrobiology Federation, Center For Life Detection, and Biosignatures Standards of Evidence Workshop. Biosignatures are biological signs of life that could give away the existence of any life-form, such as microbes swimming around in an alien ocean, but technosignatures (such as the golden records, industrial emissions, and all the space junk we release into near-Earth orbit) can only be created by an advanced civilization. 

The SETI Post-Detection Hub advises NASA to zero in on what they call their six “key dimensions.” These include, according to a paper the research team recently posted to the preprint server arXiv, “advanced detection technologies and methodologies, innovative ‘Other Minds' paradigms beyond anthropocentric assumptions, humanities and social sciences for interpreting public response, ethics and governance, strategic foresight, scenario planning, and  anticipatory governance, public communication strategies and research, and global coordination on infrastructures for resilience and sustained preparedness.”

As we make our own advances in technology, we will also keep upgrading the ways we search for technosignatures. Some methods will involve AI, but others will merely take the form of improvements to how signals are analyzed, which could allow anomalous things that could not be seen before to be captured. NASA's upcoming, extremely powerful Vera C. Rubin observatory and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will both see further into space with more detail than anything ever has, which makes them ideal for seeking out technosignatures. In anticipation of both of these telescopes seeing first light, the research team suggests that NASA create a sensing strategy that can identify more complex structures than space rocks whizzing by.

Something else the SETI Post-Detection Hub strongly suggests is to push the limits of existing technology and (possibly) create new tech. They use LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory) as an outstanding example. LIGO revolutionized gravitational wave detection, and NASA could potentially develop a sensing system that does the same thing for technosignature identification. 

We could also work to narrow our search parameters by further analyzing environments like Mars, which could potentially tell us how likely alien planets are to spawn life. This is why the researchers want to see efforts to conserve the environment on the Red Planet—to prevent any microbial life-forms (if they exist) or signs of them (if they ever existed) from going extinct. Evidence of anything that is alive (or was once alive) on Mars could mean that other organisms are out there in the broader cosmos, though nobody knows whether these hypothetical organisms are intelligent by human standards. 

When searching for aliens, we may start with knowledge based on what we know of our home planet, but we also need to look beyond human cognition if we want to have any idea of what a technologically advanced civilization might look like. Figuring out the inner workings of alien minds is something we can never know we have right until and unless we actually run into other intelligent beings. However, the researchers propose that deeper research into non-human communication—such as AI, bioacoustics, and quantum computing—could give us some insights into how alien civilizations might communicate.

“NASA Astrobiology can establish adaptive operational frameworks for real-time global coordination, ensuring robust communication, governance, and technological resilience in the event of a detection,” the SETI team said. “We recommend that NASA embeds interdisciplinary expertise into ongoing research, policy development, and public engagement, and engages with international SETI PostDetection efforts.”

EXCLUSIVE: Mark Pellegrino (Supernatural), Matt Ryan (Constantine), Kelly Arjen (Adverse), Samm Levine (Inglourious Basterds), and Thomas Ian Nicholas (American Pie) are set to star in Outsider, a thriller-drama written and directed by Brian A. Metcalf (A Motel).


Outsider is about a man (Pellegrino) whose wife is taken by human traffickers while vacationing with her in another country. With the help of a local prostitute (Arjen), he sets out to track her down — but soon discovers just how powerful those responsible are. The film is due to begin shooting this month.


	Metcalf, Nicholas, Arjen, and Pellegrino are producing under their Black Jellybeans banner (Adverse), which is developing multiple film and television projects. Also in the pipeline is the upcoming series The Huntress, created by David Zanardi (Sixteen) and executive-produced by Zanardi, Shanyn Maguire (Palindrome), and Metcalf, who will also serve as showrunner.

German local elections in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia have been shaken by the deaths of 16 candidates, who all passed away one after the other. Police do not suspect foul play, but investigations are on.

Conspiracy theories around local German elections took off after 16 politicians who were due to stand in the polls scheduled for September 14, suddenly died. The candidates were supposed to stand for the local elections in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. However, 16 of them passed away one after the other, according to the election director. Wild conspiracy theories started doing the rounds in the country after the shocking deaths. Of the candidates who passed away, seven were from the AfD party, while one person each was from the SPD, the Social and Democratic Alternative (SDA), the FDP, the Greens, the Animal Welfare Party, the Independent Voters' Association (UWG), the Free Voters, the Referendum Party, and a voter group. Speculations about the sudden death started circulating on social media after four members of the AfD party died. Later, the number increased to seven.

The AfD party has grown in popularity ever since it was formed in 2013. The police have found no signs of foul play in the first four deaths. Meanwhile, the rest of the deaths are being probed. Conspiracy theories got a boost after the party's co-leader, Alice Weidel, presented data by an economist, according to whom it is almost impossible for 16 candidates to die one after the other. She shared a claim by retired economist Stefan Homburg, who pointed to the number of deaths, and said it was "statistically almost impossible".

Meanwhile, the sudden deaths have affected the election process since the time between nominations and elections is quite long. Four AfD candidates died — Ralph Lange, Wolfgang Klinger, Wolfgang Seitz and Stefan Berendes — were the first to pass away, after which the ballots had to be reprinted. Soon it was revealed that AfD reserve list candidates, René Herford and Patrick Tietze, had also died. The state's interior ministry then reported that candidates from other parties have also died. This included the Greens and Social Democrats politicians. North Rhine-Westphalia has a population of 18 million, and 20,000 candidates are reportedly running for office.

The police investigated the first four deaths and did not find anything suspicious. Detectives told Germany's DPA news agency that they were all due to some natural causes, which haven't been revealed by the families. The same is being said for the other deaths.

"We ran the hell out of there and didn't tell anyone because our friend's mom told us not to go there, and we didn't want to get in trouble. We never saw anything in the newspaper. It was one of those suburban towns that's always on lists for being super safe. As an adult, I realized they just don't publish the crime and sweep it under the rug."

"The bars on each window are what made me believe it. No one can break in and loot their relics from a bygone era. Something one would only think of if they are leaving a building alone for a long time. A protection that an average suburban home wouldn't need. 

I've asked around for years. No one knows who owns that home. No one has ever seen the owners, not even a glimpse of how the grass is cut each week. It's been a mystery, with the legend passed down from seventh-grader to seventh-grader, only to grow as old as the paint that covers the unused mailbox.

It's a house frozen in time. A small vortex of mystery in the shape of an ordinary ranch-style home. 

Who knows, maybe one day, in the distant future, an older couple will walk through the solid oak door again to find their lives just as they were the day they left."

"The item that was thrown into the woods was never found, as far as I know. On the loading dock was a woman's purse, complete with wallet, ID, checkbook, etc. 

I wish I could say how the story 'ended.'"

"The creepy detail, besides the fact that it was almost certainly someone local, is that the composite sketch that was made (a student returning to the dorm late at night had bumped into the likely murderer) looked strikingly similar to a man I knew by sight, who had always had a reputation for being violent."
