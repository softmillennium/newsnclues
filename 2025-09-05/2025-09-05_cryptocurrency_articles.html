                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto venture capital firm Sora Ventures aims to raise $1 billion to help bolster Bitcoin treasuries in Asia, the firm announced on Friday. Starting with $200 million from partners and investors, the firm seeks to accumulate a further $800 million for BTC over the next six months. “This is the first time that Asia has seen a commitment of this magnitude toward building a network of Bitcoin treasury firms, with capital commitment towards Asia's first $1 billion treasury fund,” said Sora partner Luke Liu in a statement. Instead, Sora's fund will act as a “central pool of institutional capital designed to both support these existing firms and fuel the creation of similar treasuries globally,” the firm said. Sora Ventures did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for details on exactly how its fund will operate. “This is the first time in history that institutional money has come together, from local to regional, and now to a global stage.” In July, the firm participated in an acquisition of Thailand's DV8, a publicly traded firm now undertaking a Bitcoin treasury model. The Bitcoin treasury phenomenon first started with Michael Saylor and his business software firm Strategy in 2020. Now more than 300 entities hold the top crypto asset on its balance sheet, with more than 3.7 million BTC accounted for, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net. Bitcoin is up 1.2% in the last 24 hours and trading at $110,842.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A virtual commentator on technology and investing, created by AI, known for combining macro trends with startup stories. - The service encrypts transaction details (sender, receiver, amount) while enabling verifiable compliance via cryptographic view keys, reducing cross-border costs by 70–90%. - This partnership targets the $1.2T global payroll market, aligning with growing institutional adoption of ZK technology for scalable, privacy-preserving enterprise solutions. Aleo and Request Finance's collaboration to launch a private crypto payroll service exemplifies this shift, leveraging ZK proofs to address real-world pain points in enterprise payments. Traditional payroll systems, even when digitized, often expose sensitive data to intermediaries, auditors, and public ledgers. Meanwhile, cross-border transactions incur high fees and delays, particularly for companies with distributed teams. Aleo's zero-knowledge infrastructure, combined with Request Finance's crypto payroll expertise, offers a novel solution. This means businesses can automate payroll and vendor payments without revealing sensitive data. For example, a multinational firm could pay employees in 30 countries while ensuring no individual's salary is visible to others, yet auditors can confirm compliance with local labor laws via cryptographic view keys [3]. Unlike traditional blockchains, where privacy is an afterthought, Aleo's Record model encrypts balances and transaction histories by default [2]. This is achieved through a modified UTXO (unspent transaction output) framework, where only authorized parties can decrypt data using cryptographic keys. For enterprises, this translates to a system where privacy isn't compromised, but regulatory requirements are met through selective disclosure. Request Finance, which has already processed over $1 billion in crypto transactions, brings operational expertise to the table [2]. Aleo's ZK infrastructure reduces transaction costs by 70–90% compared to traditional cross-border transfers, while eliminating the need for intermediaries [1]. For Web2 companies transitioning to Web3, this service bridges the gap between legacy banking standards and blockchain efficiency. Aleo's co-founder, Howard Wu, emphasized at Blockchain NEXUS 2025 that ZK technology is no longer a niche concept—it's a scalability and privacy enabler for mainstream adoption [2]. By addressing enterprise pain points, Aleo and Request Finance are positioning themselves to capture a significant share of the $1.2 trillion global payroll market, which is increasingly digitizing [3]. The strategic adoption of ZK in enterprise payments isn't just theoretical. Meanwhile, Request Finance's existing client base, including Fortune 500 companies, provides immediate traction for the private payroll service. From an investment perspective, the partnership taps into two high-growth areas: enterprise blockchain adoption and ZK-based privacy solutions. If the private payroll service gains traction, it could drive further demand for Aleo's infrastructure, creating a flywheel effect. Additionally, the technical complexity of SNARKs could slow adoption among non-technical teams. However, Aleo's focus on developer education—such as its Privacy Virtual Hackathon—suggests a long-term strategy to build ecosystem support [1]. By prioritizing privacy without sacrificing compliance or efficiency, they're addressing a critical gap in the digital economy. As global payroll systems continue to digitize, the winners will be those who can balance transparency with confidentiality—and Aleo and Request Finance are leading the charge.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The revival of these blockchains highlights that survival through downturns can strengthen credibility; their existing infrastructure and developer ecosystems now make them competitive in securing partnerships and large-scale pilots.

By December of 2022, Solana's price had fallen 95% from its peak. To critics, this was not just a market correction but confirmation of deeper weaknesses: multiple network outages, dependence on a few venture backers and proximity to the disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried empire. And yet, the Solana blockchain never really died, despite its coin's nosediving value. Developers kept building through the rubble, quietly shipping code. Three years later, Solana isn't just alive but is being included by the Trump administration in conversations about a national U.S. crypto reserve. Algorand, Cardano, BNB Chain and other so-called “zombie blockchains” that once looked destined for the graveyard are suddenly reappearing with renewed relevance. And in an industry notorious for boom-and-bust cycles, the reanimation of these networks says less about crypto market price charts and more about how the role of blockchain networks themselves are evolving in the broader economy. See also: Big Banks Pile Into Stablecoin Infrastructure as Wall Street Eyes Crypto Custody Alternative networks promised faster, cheaper transactions that might make crypto viable as daily currency. This reframing opens the door for networks once dismissed as “ghost chains” to play roles beyond speculative mania. Tokenized bonds, real estate, and commodities could reshape capital markets. In this context, zombie chains aren't necessarily disadvantaged. Their survival has given them credibility; their existing infrastructure and developer bases allow them to compete for pilots and partnerships. The blockchain race is no longer just about speed or decentralization; it's about who can provide reliable rails for trillion-dollar markets. Here's What CFOs Need to Know About Crypto Jargon After its brutal fall, many assumed developer migration would hollow it out. By 2024, Solana was hosting stablecoin experiments, new consumer-facing apps, and decentralized exchanges boasting speed that rivaled centralized players. Founded by MIT cryptography pioneer Silvio Micali, it was pitched as a high-performance, mathematically elegant blockchain. But today, Algorand is being positioned not as a mass-retail chain for speculative investors but as an institutional-grade solution for tokenization and compliance-heavy applications. Its “dead chain” years may have simply been incubation for the role it is now playing. Perhaps the strangest comeback belongs to BNB Chain, originally launched as Binance's in-house network for faster and cheaper trading. When U.S. regulators cracked down on Binance in 2023, many assumed the chain would collapse alongside its parent exchange. Instead, BNB Chain has remained one of the most used blockchains globally by transaction volume, powering gaming economies, decentralized apps, and low-fee token transfers. Perhaps the clearest sign that “zombie blockchains” are being resurrected lies in who is using them. This institutionalization is reshaping the perception of old networks. What once seemed like failures of consumer adoption may prove to be stepping stones toward enterprise-grade applications. We're always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Asia is stepping up its institutional adoption of digital assets, as two major announcements this week highlighted the region's ambitions to catch up with the West, especially the US, in crypto adoption. At Taipei Blockchain Week, Hong Kong-based Sora Ventures launched Asia's first Bitcoin treasury fund, backed by $200 million in commitments and aiming to purchase $1 billion in BTC within six months. Sora's new fund marks a milestone for Asia, where crypto treasury strategies have until now been fragmented. Unlike corporate players such as Metaplanet in Japan or DV8 in Thailand, which hold Bitcoin directly on their balance sheets, the Sora fund pools institutional capital into a centralized vehicle. The model is designed both to support existing Asian treasuries and to seed new ones globally, creating synergies across jurisdictions. Jason Fang, founder and managing partner at Sora Ventures, said the launch represents the first time that institutional money has come together, from local to regional, and now to a global stage for Bitcoin. Analysts say the move could catalyze a wave of corporate adoption across Asia, particularly if Sora succeeds in funneling $1 billion into Bitcoin in such a short timeframe. The fund has already attracted interest from regional institutions seeking to hedge against currency volatility. While Sora doubles down on Bitcoin as a treasury asset, Robot Consulting is betting on Ethereum as both an investment and a technological platform. The company, which listed on Nasdaq in July, said it would allocate up to ¥1 billion in ETH between Q4 2025 and spring 2026, using available cash and IPO proceeds. The firm is working to combine blockchain with AI data in addition to digital services such as automated compliance checks and dispute resolution. Robot Consulting will mark the valuation of its ETH holdings to market on a quarterly basis, with gains or losses disclosed in annual statements. Sora's initiative could bring cohesion to fragmented treasury efforts across the region, giving Asia a collective presence in Bitcoin markets. Meanwhile, Robot Consulting's ETH allocation illustrates how blockchain is being woven into specific industries, in this case, legal technology, rather than being treated purely as a speculative bet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The price of Bitcoin fell below $110,500 on Friday morning as August jobs data came in weaker than expected, which fueled concerns about a looming recession. Altcoins also saw gains erased as market volatility intensified. The US economy added 22,000 jobs in August, far below expectations and down from 79,000 in July, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. The sharp deceleration suggests businesses are pulling back on hiring, often an early warning sign of weaker demand and slowing activity. Gold hit a record $3,580 on the weak jobs data, while Bitcoin dipped to $112,500 before rebounding above $113,300, TradingView showed. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq also touched fresh highs, but crypto and equities quickly pulled back even as markets fully priced in a September Fed rate cut. In his most recent statements at the Fed's Jackson Hole event, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that the central bank kept the door open for a September rate cut. However, he also indicated it would not signal the start of an aggressive easing cycle. With policy rates now closer to neutral but still restrictive, he said the Fed can proceed carefully, while leaving room for adjustments if risks shift further. Markets are now looking ahead to the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, set for release on September 11, to gauge whether Fed rate cuts are on the horizon. September has historically been a volatile month for crypto and stocks. Last year, Bitcoin fell below $55,000 before surging after a 50-basis-point Fed cut. The rate move came amid rising unemployment, weak job growth, and recession fears.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Will an Ethereum Run Make It Hard for ETH Treasuries to Raise Cash? As Ethereum claws its way upward this week, a looming challenge threatens digital asset treasury (DAT) companies as their mNAVs have come close to 1 or slipped below it, with experts signaling potential trouble for future capital inflows. And for digital asset treasury companies, the value of their crypto treasuries can experience dramatic fluctuations. Data from Strategic ETH Reserve shows a steep drop in mNAV for key players. BitDigital and GameSquare Holdings Inc have seen there's slip, but hold above 1 so far. The downtick in mNAV tracks the broader crypto market's dip, with Bitcoin falling from its mid-August peak, when it set a new all-time high of $124,545.6, to $112,154, per CoinGecko. For DATs holding hefty Ethereum reserves—BitMine has $8.3 billion and Sharplink holds $3.7 billion worth of ETH—this erosion of premium could choke off their ability to raise cash without punishing existing investors. “I think that's why we've seen capital raises stall after a busy stretch earlier this year: Investors just don't want to pay the premiums for the same ETH exposure,” Arthur Azizov, founder and investor at B2 Ventures, told Decrypt. For DATs, mNAV is the lifeblood of capital raises, particularly through at-the-market (ATM) equity programs, where a premium over net asset value allows companies to issue stock without harming investors. While Ethereum's price volatility erodes mNAV cushions, relentless ATM share sales flood the market, driving down valuations, Azizov highlighted. Adding pressure, spot Ethereum ETFs offer investors direct exposure without the premium DATs once commanded, he said. According to Regterschot, a stagnant ETH/BTC price is another source that has pressured mNAVs' recent plunge, creating a feedback loop where fading premiums and rising share supply choke demand. A bullish Ethereum run could revive mNAVs, allowing DATs to issue stock on favorable terms and bolster ETH holdings, thereby restarting growth. But if ETH stalls or the crypto market turns bearish due to macroeconomic concerns, mNAVs could dip below 1, effectively putting a stop on new issuance. Without it, DATs may be forced to lean on staking yields, with netflows stalling as they navigate a constrained funding landscape.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin price strength disappears despite nonfarm payrolls data cementing Fed rate cut bets, and bulls are nowhere to be seen. Bitcoin disappoints with volatility around US jobs data, resulting in a dive under $111,000. BTC price action gives up all its gains while gold goes on to hit yet another all-time high. Bitcoin (BTC) flipped volatile at Friday's Wall Street open as US jobs data fell far short of expectations. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD reaching new September highs of $113,400 before dropping almost $3,000 in an hour. The US dollar's strength plummeted as a result, while gold hit new all-time highs. Reacting, market participants agreed that the course was now set for a key risk-asset tailwind event: the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates at its Sept. 17 meeting. Data from CME Group's FedWatch Tool underscored the likelihood of such an outcome. Kobeissi noted that the job numbers for previous months had also been revised down. “The labor market is far worse than you think: Not only was June's jobs number negative, but the US economy lost -357,000 full time jobs in August,” founder Adam Kobeissi added.

Popular trader Daan Crypto Trades flagged the 200-period simple (SMA) and exponential (EMA) moving averages on four-hour time frames. These have both acted as resistance for the past few weeks and are now being tested again,” part of an X post explained. “This is a very crucial level to reclaim for more upside,” fellow trader ZYN agreed about the pre-NFP price zone, adding that “bulls will be fully back” should $113,000 support return. Bearish perspectives remained, with crypto investor and entrepreneur Ted Pillows reiterating expectations of a drop toward $100,000.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) plan to hold a joint roundtable as a next step in their efforts to make the U.S. markets friendlier to financial firms, including crypto businesses. The heads of the agencies — SEC Chair Paul Atkins and Acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham — announced a joint roundtable for later this month to discuss prediction markets, decentralized finance and 24/7 trading in traditional financial markets, among other issues. "It's time to leave turf aside and really collaborate," Atkins said during a press call on Friday morning. Gary Gensler, the ex-chief of the SEC, set himself up as a crypto antagonist, taking companies to court and refusing to move forward on comprehensive crypto regulations, while then-CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam was marginally more open to conversations with the industry. For instance, the two agencies adopted distinct positions on which crypto assets were securities and which were commodities, including Ethereum's ETH, which both seemed to claim under their jurisdictions at different times. In the Friday call, Atkins and Pham presented a new united front, as the two said they're trying to bring innovators back from overseas jurisdictions and get set to oversee modern, round-the-clock markets. "We are doing great with all of our initiatives, and we look forward to continuing to work on this together with the SEC."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum (ETH), the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, is flashing powerful bullish signals as a rare inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and tightening supply dynamics fuel speculation of a $10,000 rally. This setup comes at a time when Ethereum is consolidating near $4,300–$4,400, holding firm above key support despite recent volatility. With institutional inflows, network upgrades, and long-term accumulation trends strengthening, analysts argue Ethereum could be primed for its next major breakout. While the ETH price today shows minor fluctuations, market analysts believe Ethereum's underlying fundamentals and technical signals support a major breakout. Ethereum recently reached an all-time high price near $4,950 in late August before undergoing a pullback and sideways trading. This resilience has been attributed to rising institutional demand, increased staking, and inflows into Ethereum ETFs. Crypto analyst Chami (@ChamiCrypto78) posted an analysis highlighting a massive inverse head-and-shoulders pattern forming on Ethereum's weekly chart. While this indicates slightly overbought conditions, Chami noted that short-term cooling could see ETH retest support around $4,100 before stronger buying pressure resumes. “Ethereum may briefly revisit $4,100 support before demand takes over, opening the door for a potential rally toward $10,000,” Chami explained. Adding to the bullish narrative, analyst @cas_abbe revealed on September 5 that Ethereum's Exchange Flux Balance has indeed turned negative for the first time, suggesting a significant shift towards long-term holding and reduced sell-side pressure, based on data from Alphractal. This reduction in liquid supply aligns with historic precedents where exchange outflows preceded significant rallies. Reports from AInvest show that major institutional investor BMNR holds 1.71 million ETH worth approximately $7.9 billion—around 4.9% of circulating supply. At the same time, BlackRock's Ethereum ETF and other US spot ETFs have attracted significant inflows, boosting confidence in ETH as a long-term store of value beyond speculative trading. Traders are closely watching critical Ethereum price levels to determine ETH's next move: Despite the bullish backdrop, some Ethereum news points to caution. Recent data shows several US spot ETH ETFs experiencing net outflows, signaling short-term cooling of institutional demand. Moreover, Ethereum's Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio remains elevated, raising concerns of possible overvaluation. Regulatory uncertainty in major markets adds another layer of risk, leaving some analysts cautious about short-term price action. While short-term volatility is expected, the long-term outlook for Ethereum remains bullish: With ETH trading above $4,400, the cryptocurrency finds itself at a pivotal moment. The inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and negative exchange balances signal strong bullish potential, while institutional accumulation through Ethereum ETFs provides additional support. ETH bounces back after rejection, eyeing $4,500 resistance for potential long or short setups. However, short-term risks—such as ETF outflows, profit-taking, and regulatory challenges—remain in play. For now, Ethereum stands at the crossroads of consolidation and breakout. Whether it can overcome short-term hurdles to ignite a rally toward $10,000 will define the next chapter in its evolution.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taiwan-based crypto venture capital firm Sora Ventures announced plans to build a $1 billion fund to invest in bitcoin treasury companies in Asia. Sora Ventures said on Friday in a press release that it aims to accumulate $1 billion in the next six months. It has secured $200 million in initial commitments from regional partners and investors. The fund is set to invest in Asia-based companies that hold bitcoin on their balance sheets, a strategy that has recently gained traction among listed firms in Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand, and South Korea. "This is the first time in history that institutional money has come together, from local to regional, and now to a global stage." Sora Ventures' latest plan builds on a series of acquisitions and investments in publicly traded companies that have adopted bitcoin as a treasury asset. In April 2024, Sora invested in Japan's Metaplanet and supported Metaplanet's 1 billion yen ($6.6 million) bitcoin purchase, according to the statement. Earlier this year, Sora Ventures acquired Hong Kong's Moon Inc., which has pivoted toward bitcoin and Web3-related investments following its rebrand from HK Asia Holdings. In July, Sora led a consortium that acquired Thai electronics retailer DV8 through a tender offer, aiming to replicate the Metaplanet model in Southeast Asia. Also in July, Sora and its partners took a controlling stake in South Korea's BitPlanet to back the company's expansion into digital assets.

The Trump family has a bitcoin mining company that started trading on the Nasdaq Wednesday.

Why it matters: Running mining rigs is one of the most policy-sensitive corners of the crypto industry, with its number one cost input being the price of power.

Catch up quick: American Bitcoin, backed by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., began publicly trading on Wednesday following a merger with a small-cap bitcoin miner, which allowed it to skip a traditional IPO process.

How it works: According to an investor presentation, American Bitcoin has a three-pronged strategy to provide leadership in the U.S. bitcoin industry:

Zoom in: Later in the presentation the company talks about building platforms and monetizing its surface area in the industry.

The big picture: The Trumps are entering the industry as competition has gotten fierce.

Between the lines: The cost of energy is crucial to a mining operation.

What we're watching: Nukes. We'll be curious to see if American Bitcoin comes out ahead of other miners in cutting deals with new nuclear plants, if they start getting permits.

💭 Our thought bubble: This could be yet another play to profit off of the presidency, but bitcoin mining takes a lot more elbow grease than running a meme coin or a second-tier stablecoin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Carter Woetzel '21 first stepped onto Bethel University's campus, the place already felt familiar. Three of his siblings had attended Bethel, and he had spent years hearing their stories about professors who cared deeply, a campus community that felt like family, and opportunities that inspired bold thinking. At Blaine High School, he had been part of the STEM program, taking rigorous college courses and graduating with 57 college credits already earned. He was also active in Business Professionals of America, a national organization that fosters leadership and career skills. That combination of technical training and business exposure created a unique dilemma for his future studies: Should he major in computer science or business? It was an ambitious academic load, but Woetzel thrived on the challenge. “Bethel gave me space to take on a lot, and I loved it.” Throughout his time at Bethel, Woetzel found professors who not only taught him the material but also shaped his perspective on leadership, problem-solving, and integrity. In the Department of Business, Professor Brian Holland left a lasting impression. “Brian did an incredible job teaching us to love how businesses work,” Woetzel says. “Nathan built the technical foundation I rely on today to lead teams of computer scientists,” Woetzel says. He also worked as a computer science tutor under Patrice Conrath. Intrigued, Woetzel began exploring the concept, reading everything he could find and taking detailed notes. ‘At some point I realized, maybe this is a book.” “[Bethel's humanities courses] taught me how to explain complex ideas in a way people can understand. That skill has been invaluable working in the tech industry.” That realization led to two and a half years of writing Building Confidence in Blockchain, which was published in the spring of 2020. Woetzel's goal was to create a resource that bridged the gap between highly technical blockchain literature and investment-focused material. It was humbling to have entire chapters sent back for rewrites,” Woetzel says. “It taught me to accept feedback and see writing as a team effort.” He credits Bethel's humanities courses for honing his communication skills. “They taught me how to explain complex ideas in a way people can understand. That skill has been invaluable working in the tech industry.” “I needed that internship to complete my business credits. Suddenly I was scrambling.” He found a short-term role in solar sales to meet the credit requirement, but the experience was far from ideal. “I was cold-calling people in the middle of a pandemic,” he says. With his hours completed by June, Woetzel faced two open months. “I was doing delivery jobs just to pay the bills,” he says. I was going to build something.” That decision set the stage for his next chapter. That summer, Woetzel began laying the groundwork for a blockchain infrastructure company. By late 2021—just months after graduating—he had raised $5 million in venture funding. At its peak, the team included eight Bethel alumni. “That shared foundation made a huge difference in how we worked together.” “Business doesn't just happen in your backyard—it happens everywhere. Bethel prepared me to think globally and serve people from all cultures.” “Business doesn't just happen in your backyard—it happens everywhere. Bethel prepared me to think globally and serve people from all cultures.” Woetzel sees blockchain as a technology that will shape the future of finance by making transactions faster, more transparent, and less expensive. “But through it all, God has been faithful.” He points to his Bethel experience as a key source of resilience. “At Bethel, I was surrounded by people who encouraged me to live out my faith in every part of life,” he says. “That doesn't just go away after graduation—it's something I carry into every decision.” When asked what he would say to current Bethel students, Woetzel's answer is immediate: “Go create value for free. Find something you care about and start solving problems. The world rewards people who take initiative.” He emphasizes that opportunities often come from unexpected places. But when you stay curious and take action, amazing things can happen.” Looking back, Woetzel sees Bethel as the place that integrated all the elements of his journey—academic rigor, faith formation, mentorship, and a supportive community. Woetzel's journey—from driven student to published author, startup founder, and global traveler—reflects the transformation Bethel seeks to inspire in graduates: leaders who step into a changing world with intelligence, integrity, and faith. “I'll be here, learning, building, and serving—because that's what Bethel prepared me to do.” In the Computer Science major, you'll become fluent in computing technology and build skills that set you up for graduate school and beyond.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Retailers everywhere are asking the same question: “Is it safe to accept crypto for gift cards?” While it eliminates costly disputes common with credit cards, it also means that if a fraudulent order slips through, the funds are gone for good. Retailers must be certain that the wallet address receiving payments is accurate and secure. Because crypto regulations differ by country, retailers expanding internationally face compliance challenges. Fake vendor sites or phishing schemes can damage brand trust if customers believe your marketplace is linked to fraudulent actors. When selecting a crypto-gift-card provider, retailers should evaluate the platform's security infrastructure. HTTPS encryption, two-factor authentication, and clear refund or replacement policies are non-negotiables. Retailers should look for platforms with verified operational history, industry recognition, and long-standing partnerships. A provider with consistent positive feedback and demonstrated resilience against breaches is more likely to protect your brand reputation. Retailers benefit from measured, well-documented partnerships, not rushed agreements that may expose them to fraud. Retailers should only integrate payment wallets or gateways that have a proven track record of security. Features such as biometric authentication, hardware storage, and multi-signature approvals not only protect transactions but also reassure customers that payments are being processed safely. Private keys and recovery phrases must never be shared or stored insecurely within a retail organisation. Internal protocols, such as role-based access, hardware wallets, and mandatory two-factor authentication, help ensure that even internal threats or errors don't compromise business funds. Expanding beyond Bitcoin to include Ethereum, stablecoins, and other widely used cryptocurrencies provides customers with flexibility. For retailers, this diversification also spreads risk across multiple payment channels, minimising dependence on a single coin's volatility. For retailers considering partnerships with crypto-gift-card providers, trust and reputation should be essential. ●      Has years of operation without major breaches or security lapses; Reliability isn't just about getting a working code - it's about safeguarding transactions, building customer confidence, and ensuring crypto payments remain a safe and convenient option. Retailers should communicate openly about risks, security tips, and how customers can verify transactions. Automated monitoring can flag unusual purchasing patterns, such as bulk high value gift card buys, which are often linked to fraud attempts. Setting daily or transaction limits reduces exposure to large scale fraud and ensures compliance with anti-money-laundering regulations. Retailers should document transaction details, including crypto value at the time of purchase. This helps with customer support, tax obligations, and regulatory reporting. By focusing on trusted platforms, strong payment policies, and proactive customer education, retailers can turn potential risks into opportunities. By applying clear safeguards, businesses can confidently embrace crypto as part of their gift card strategy. Done right, this approach not only protects their operations but also positions their brand as forward-thinking, innovative, and ready to meet customers where they already are.

Authorities in Hunan province have suggested China's digital currency could be employed to clear opaque ‘chain debts' more easily

China is mulling the application of its digital yuan – the central bank-backed currency also known as the e-CNY – to tackle persistent payment defaults, a move that would broaden the asset's scope beyond the set of use cases explored by Beijing since the currency's launch in 2019.

Authorities in the central province of Hunan touched upon the subject when detailing plans to expand the digital currency's application scenarios and scale, according to a document published last month.

Hunan will “explore using the digital yuan to clear chain debts” through a model where funds can reach the end of the payment chain directly, the document said.

While details at the moment are sparse, analysts suggested the digital currency could be used to ensure the often opaque relationships between payers and payees are more traceable and transparent.

“This could potentially help enhance real-time visibility and control over transactions within the economy,” said Tan Junyu, an economist at global trade credit insurer Coface.</p>
