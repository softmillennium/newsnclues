                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jorma Taccone is on the mend after a frightening accident that happened while celebrating his daughter's fifth birthday. The TV comedian, actor, and writer, best known for his nine-year run on “Saturday Night Live” as part of The Lonely Island alongside Andy Samberg and Akiva Schaffer, updated fans on his health during the latest episode of “The Lonely Island and Seth Meyers Podcast.” Phoning in from his hospital bed, Taccone joined Samberg, Schaffer, and Seth Meyers to share what happened. A post shared by The Lonely Island and Seth Meyers Podcast (@lonelymeyerspod) “We've had an incident with one of our members that we're gonna address right off the top,” Meyers said before handing it over to Taccone, who began recounting the ordeal with humor despite his pain. Taccone explained that the accident took place in August as he was painting a mural on the side of a barn for his daughter's birthday celebration. “Then I do a lot of screaming and cursing. Keep in mind, it's my daughter's fifth birthday party, so it wasn't the coolest way to start the day. “It takes a while to schedule the surgery because they wanted to do the front part and back part as well,” he explained. “So we shall see,” Taccone said, noting that he currently requires assistance to stand. He is undergoing acute rehab and physical therapy as part of his recovery. “It's definitely no joke, and it's not the funniest way to start a podcast,” he said with a laugh. His friends and co-hosts responded with heartfelt support. Taccone, who shares two children with wife Marielle Heller, said the experience has been life-changing, but he is grateful to be surrounded by love, humor, and encouragement as he heals.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The sum, disclosed in a court filing on Friday, “will be the largest publicly reported copyright recovery in history, larger than any other copyright class action settlement or any individual copyright case litigated to final judgment,” the attorneys for the authors wrote. The settlement also includes a provision that releases Anthropic only for its conduct up the August 25, meaning that new claims could be filed over future conduct, according to the filing. Anthropic also has agreed to destroy the datasets used in its models. AI Is "Possibly The End Of Human Creativity," Predicts CEO Of Amazon-Backed Firm Helping Rescue Lost 'Magnificent Ambersons' Footage A hearing in the case is scheduled for Sept. 8. Last month, Anthropic and the authors' group said that they had reached a “settlement in principle” of the creators' lawsuit. In June, U.S. District Judge William Alsup ruled that Anthropic's use of the books in training models was “exceedingly transformative,” one of the factors courts have used in determining whether the use of protected works without authorization was a legal “fair use.” His decision was the first major decision that weighed the fair use question in generative AI systems. Yet Alsup also ruled that Anthropic had to face a trial on the question of whether it is liable for downloading millions of pirated books in digital form off the internet, something it had to do in order to train its models for its AI service Claude. Alsup's summary judgment ruling came in a case brought by a group of authors, including Andrea Bartz, author of The Lost Night: A Novel, The Herd, We Were Never Here, and The Spare Room. They argued that the use of their works to train Claude violated copyright law. Anthropic's deputy general counsel, Aparna Sridhar, said in a statement, “In June, the District Court issued a landmark ruling on AI development and copyright law, finding that Anthropic's approach to training AI models constitutes fair use. Today's settlement, if approved, will resolve the plaintiffs' remaining legacy claims. We remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery, and solve complex problems.” Despite the huge pay out, Anthropic still sees the judge's earlier ruling as a victory, as he determined that their use of copyrighted material in training models was a “fair use.” With it unlikely that Congress will pass any kind of legislation at this point to address such use, and President Donald Trump siding with tech firms, courts have been left to resolve such disputes. Anthropic faced the risk of prolonged litigation and losing on that point. Discovery sued Midjourney, claiming that an AI image-generation service resulted in AI outputs of characters from Superman to Tweety Bird. WBD was joining two other legacy studios, NBCUniversal and The Walt Disney Co., in seeking court judgments against the company. The authors' legal team, led by Justin Nelson of Susman Godfrey, wrote in the filing that on “a per-work basis, the settlement amount is 4 times larger than $750 statutory damages amount that a jury could award and 15 times larger than the $200 amount if Anthropic were to prevail on its defense of innocent infringement.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein once said that “if a lion could speak, we could not understand him.” That our references and experiences of the world are so different that even a shared language could not allow humans to commune with an animal. In Ildikó Enyedi's “Silent Friend,” communication between plants and people lies far beyond words, but it is perhaps possible to connect with them more profoundly than we previously assumed. Her cinema has never been content with surfaces, instead preferring to peer beneath the everyday Never a filmmaker content with surfaces, her Enyedi has always been about peering underneath the everyday and finding something curious. Her 2017 Golden Bear winner “On Body and Soul” married tenderness with surrealism in a love story set around, of all places, a slaughterhouse, while “The Story of My Wife” wrestled with love blossoming out of initial callous indifference. Her latest, “Silent Friend,” premiering in competition at Venice 2025 before moving on to Toronto, extends this fascination with the invisible — this time, through the unlikely vantage point of a ginkgo tree. Related Stories ‘Palestine 36' Review: Epic Historical Drama Overreaches in Its Ambition but Resonates with Today You've Never Seen Saoirse Ronan Quite Like This Before This tripartite structure gives “Silent Friend” a rigor that makes time itself another character. The giant ginkgo doesn't change much, but everything around it does, and Enyedi seems determined to show us how fragile, and culturally contingent our idea of reality, really is. Yet for all of its conceptual richness, “Silent Friend” is also a film prone to indulgence. Enyedi has often made meditative cinema, but here her restraint in some sequences verges on suffocating. Entire passages seem content to let us watch leaves rustle, characters linger, or silence stretch far beyond narrative necessity. She clearly wants us to sink into the slowness of “tree-time,” but there's a thin line between contemplative and inert. At 147 minutes, the film occasionally crosses it, settling into rhythms more punishing than profound. At this point in his career, Leung doesn't need to prove anything, but he proves everything anyway. Enyedi reportedly wrote the role specifically for him, and it shows. With barely a handful of lines, roaming around the pandemic-emptied university halls, Leung communicates galaxies. Few performers embody the old-school charisma of international art cinema quite like him. He recalls the aloof elegance of Alain Delon or the masculine grace of Marcello Mastroianni, but with a warmth and melancholy that are uniquely his. Luna Wedler makes Grete a formidable and fiercely intelligent character, particularly in one sharp-witted confrontation against a panel of sneering professors who want to belittle and humiliate her; her black-and-white sequences, inspired by the photography of Karl Blossfeldt, are also the most striking in the film. There's a compelling shift in power dynamics over the 112 years the film covers, where women are valued only for their chastity, only to become subversive, sexually empowered scientists performing cutting-edge experiments, or delivering TED Talks and mentoring other scientists at the top of their game. Still, no matter how much Seydoux sparkles or Wedler steadies, this is Leung's film. His performance transforms the movie from an intellectual exercise into a work of genuine feeling. Without him, “Silent Friend” would risk being remembered as a handsome, cerebral curio. Enyedi's direction remains admirable for its ambition, drawing inspiration from Thomas Nagel's famous essay “What Is It Like to Be a Bat?” and neuroscientist Anil Seth's work on consciousness, framing human life as a shared hallucination that nature quietly resists. But whether these ideas resonate will depend largely on one's tolerance for the subdued. In the end, “Silent Friend” is a film of contradictions, profound, complex, and beautiful, but occasionally interminably boring. And while that ginkgo will hopefully live for another 112 years, legacies like his have the power to extend even further.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) audiences hosted the world premiere of Christy, a new biopic from director David Michôd. Guests on the red carpet included Sweeney, Foster, Christy Martin, Katy O'Brian, David Michôd, Chad L. Coleman, Jess Gabor, Marvin LaViolette, Shailene Woodley, and more. RELATED: Black Bear Sets Sydney Sweeney ‘Christy' As Its First U.S. The film chronicles the life of “Cole Miner's Daughter” Christy (Sweeney), raised in West Virginia, earned herself a basketball scholarship to college. After dominating “Toughwoman” contests in the late 1980s, she began training with coach Jim Martin (Foster) and launched a highly successful professional boxing career in the sport's early days. Just as Christy is making historic strides in her sport, she's forced to contend with a horrendous private life — climaxing in an act that nearly kills her. Black Bear will release the film theatrically in the US and will hit screens on Nov. 7 in time for awards season.

In a new video for Architectural Digest's YouTube page, the ACM Entertainer of the Year opens her front door to AD's camera, saying “Welcome to my house here in Nashville. You don't even have to kick your boots off.” “I've always been a sucker for leopard,” Lainey explains. “My first pair of bell bottoms were blue leopard print, and so I had to have leopard carpet on the stairs.” Viewers are also introduced to artwork featuring her 31-year-old horse Tex. And they meet her real life dog French bulldog. This is her house and I'm just living in it.” In the living room, she shows off curtains made of fabric she had shipped overseas, revealing, “Three different times, the ship had pirates. “So, the pirates, they got some good fabric.” When Lainey Wilson takes Architectural Digest into her kitchen, she reveals that it's the hub of the home, where she and fiancé Devlin “Duck” Hodges not only prepare food but where she writes songs and where they entertain some pretty high profile friends. And right before they got here, I was like ‘is Miranda Lambert really coming to our house?' The 15-minute YouTube video even takes us inside Lainey Wilson's closet. And they are full of her signature bellbottoms! “I've always been a sucker for bellbottoms,” Lainey tells AD. As a recent guest on Taste of Country Nights, Wilson admitted she likely owns well over one-thousand pairs of bellbottoms, saying, “I have completely lost count, but, I've worn a new pair on stage each time for the past 15 years, so..” And she recently released a single by the same name recorded at London's Abbey Road Studios.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a contentious first, second, third, and fourth round, The A.V. Club‘s Action Franchise Tournament enters into its final fight with two all-timers ascending towards the throne: It's Police Story vs. Mad Max. It's not surprising that neither of these last two action franchises are American. Hollywood has always been a pioneer in the realm of blockbusters and franchises, but its abilities with and interest in adding action to that mix have always come second to what that action serves: A perpetual-motion machine whose replicable formula of set pieces, heroic quips, and boilerplate plots consistently prints money and fill the molds of action figures. So many American action franchises bury their stunts in other genre elements, or shoehorn action sequences into otherwise unrelated intellectual properties in order to give them a four-quadrant summer-flick zing, that the relatively recent resurgence of more action-forward fare has been greeted with a renewed popular and professional appreciation for stunt performance as a discipline. These films aren't named for him, but so vaguely titled they're almost anonymous: Their star is simply an incredible cop who gets disgraced, maintains his personal dignity and devotion, then redeems himself through incredible feats of individual effort for the greater good. Similarly, even if Tom Hardy didn't replace Mel Gibson as Max Rockatansky, the internal timeline of the franchise makes him being a single person living through the films' desiccated nightmare nigh impossible. And yet, through this purity, the franchises approach different thematic philosophies. Officer Rockatansky, beaten-down nihilist highway patrolman, gives way to Max, semi-hopeful wanderer. He faces down gang leaders and self-appointed dictators alike as he searches for the remnants of his humanity, this pattern culminating in Furiosa's (Charlize Theron) revenge mission against Immortan Joe. “As the world falls around us, how must we brave its cruelties?” asks Furiosa. For Miller's ecologically devastated world, reinvention, adaptability, and unfussy collaboration is key in order to survive, and to confront the unflinching despots at the top. Police Story, though, is mostly about a single supercop's superior coppage, and all the jokers around him who get in his way with their “rules” and “laws.” It's unsurprising that a series named Police Story, a franchise that is the baby of an increasingly conservative director/star in Chan, has always had a regressive streak—one that gets more grim and personal as the series goes on. (It's not a coincidence that Police Story: Lockdown involves the lead's estranged relationship with his gay daughter.) It would actually prevent that series from being the platonic cop franchise ideal, though, if it had any bigger ideas or a more progressive perspective. It is a power fantasy, plain and simple, one of personal injustices being overcome through singular feats of physical prowess—of might quite literally making right. It's just silly enough, in most of its films at least, that the pricklier parts of its subgenre go down smooth. The two-and-a-half-minute credit sequence of behind-the-scenes action from the first movie is better than most full action films, and probably contains more broken glass: If Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd have a direct modern descendent, it's Jackie Chan. When Michelle Yeoh joins in for Supercop, and is so good in it that she gets her own spin-off, it's the only kind of step forward the series needs: A miraculous new addition who can actually hang with Chan's energy and elegance, expanding a virtuoso performance into a double act. Apart from Yeoh's freak-matching, though, Police Story finds itself running out of ways to one-up itself over the course of its run—and its increasingly sour repetitions are less enjoyable than those of Mad Max, which iterates in imaginative new directions even as the chases and fights and fascists blur into one another. As George Miller expounds upon humanity's cartoonish id, positing that the end of the world will in fact be dumb as hell and full of silly names (a prediction that clocked some recent governmental developments from decades away), his movies only become more impressive and more mythic. The flame-spitting, guitar-swinging, Cirque du Soleil chases that eventually grow from the early Outback muscle-car grit feed into an industry's desire for sequel extravagance, but they also reflect that when times become dire, the fables we tell ourselves only get bigger and more urgent. Just as Police Story has some of the jumps and crashes to end all jumps and crashes, Mad Max has chases to end all chases featuring vehicles to end all vehicles. Fury Road, a perfect there-and-back film Frankensteined from two epic chases welded together, uses every filmmaking trick in the book (and the dedication of a massive group of technicians suffering in the desert) to capture speed, distance, and danger with a clear eye and a full heart. And that means Fury Road, the best film of its decade, can't lose. They ground the legend, show how a person can become something greater than themselves, while goosing our heart rates so that they beat in rapid unison.

Josh O'Connor and Paul Mescal have been wanting to make “The History of Sound” (out September 12, from Mubi) for five years. But the two actors were both in such demand that it kept being pushed back until they finally became available at the same time. Now, O'Connor finds himself in the odd position of having to promote four movies coming out this fall. “Yeah, I am,” he said on Zoom just after the Telluride Film Festival. The two actors met during the pandemic, on Zoom, after O'Connor watched “Normal People” and like many of us, believed he was discovering an exciting young talent. He emailed his American agent: “You have to see this kid. He's amazing.” His agent had already signed him. It turns out Mescal had been watching O'Connor, as well. The two got on famously, and have been chums ever since. (Check out their hilarious recent appearance on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”) Related Stories You've Never Seen Saoirse Ronan Quite Like This Before The Sound Design of ‘KPop Demon Hunters' Uses Kpop, Billie Eilish, and Imogen Heap to Protect the Honmoon “The History of Sound” director Oliver Hermanus went ahead with essentially the first draft of the script about two folk music collectors in love, Lionel (Mescal) and David (O'Connor) who travel the South trawling for cool songs to record for posterity. “It's the first script that Ben Shattuck had ever written,” said O'Connor. So we would get a date in, and then we kick it down the road, and then someone else would get another job. So we kick it down the road. And in the end, there was this three week gap between me going off to do ‘Challengers' press and ‘La Chimera' press. The script was so good; it felt like one of those projects where you could lead with instinct, in the knowledge that I was playing opposite Paul, who's so gifted. The two men reunited at Telluride over Labor Day. It was O'Connor's second time at the festival, after “La Chimera” two years ago. Then he was able to attend because he had been shooting Max Walker-Silverman's “Rebuilding” (Bleecker Street, November 7) nearby. The micro-budget indie (Sundance 2025) about a farm community recovering from wildfires had wangled a permit to shoot during the Actors Strike. “‘Rebuilding‘ was one of the most moving filmmaking experiences I've ever had,” said O'Connor. “The History of Sound,” while it involves a romance, is not overtly sexy. The two men fall in love for a time, but it's an intellectual relationship, a shared love of music. Mescal's Lionel is more comfortable with his sexuality than O'Connor's David. “At one point David says, ‘Do you worry about this? We later find out that he's married. He's contending with his sexuality at times. David feels shame for a number of reasons. O'Connor had lost someone he cared deeply about the year before. “The last few years, ‘La Chimera,' a lot of the work I've been doing, has been trying to compute that. Paul and I would often talk about the scenes we were doing. And are they therefore influenced by what he knows now? In both “The History of Sound” and “The Mastermind” (October 17, Mubi) O'Connor, who grew up in the West of England, had to maneuver his mouth around an American accent, “with great difficulty,” he said. You do some gymnastics in your mouth to say the letter R. It's drawn out, whereas the American accent is a relaxed R, and so it's difficult for me to move my mouth in the way that it's supposed to for an American accent. “She makes the movies I want to watch,” he said. And there's often tragedy, and there's often mundane elements and sometimes, even, like in our movie, when I'm putting the pictures up in that barn, that shot is completely ridiculous. “The Mastermind” was filmed on 35mm in long takes and immersed O'Connor, who was born in 1990, into the '70s. But the wheel, it takes about three full turns to take a slight right turn. Mooney is the father of young boys dealing (poorly) with male responsibility, as he's not fulfilling his role as breadwinner nor is he going off to war. “There's this post-60s political, problematic idea about our responsibility to peace and the Vietnam War,” said O'Connor. “He's too old to be called up. He's got a huge ego and low self esteem. That period did something to someone like Mooney.” “Arthur Dove is a great artist, but at the time, his work wasn't worth anything,” said O'Connor. “You're not going to get rich quick from some Arthur Doves, particularly at that time. Mooney wouldn't steal a Picasso, because that's mainstream, he's full of ego. I didn't steal any old artist. So it's a point of pride for him. Next up: The cast for the untitled Steven Spielberg science-fiction movie (Universal, June 12, 2026) written by David Koepp includes Henry Lloyd-Hughes, Emily Blunt and Colman Domingo, as well as O'Connor. “There couldn't be a more Spielberg movie. On my first day on set with him, I stood in a nondescript place, and there was rain, drips coming off the ceiling of this place, and a big beam of light from a car headlight. He is everything that you dream him to be.” O'Connor plays a priest in “Wake Up Dead Man” (November 26, Netflix), the third installment of Rian Johnson's “Knives Out” series, alongside Daniel Craig, Kerry Washington, Glenn Close, Josh Brolin, and Andrew Scott. Joel Coen's second solo outing “Jack of Spades” is halfway through shooting in Scotland. “The energy on set is focused,” said O'Connor. There is a world where O'Connor would run away and go missing, get back to his garden in the West of England, make pots, and not do any acting for a long time. “What that does to you is, whenever a job finishes, you genuinely think this could be the last, and if you have imposter syndrome, like I do, and like most actors do, you're going, this next one will be the one where they go ‘Ah, we were wrong. So, you've always got that needling away in the back of your mind, which makes it difficult.” He admits he may have overextended himself in one sense: “there's an element of mystery, which maybe we've lost, and that idea of an event movie coming out feels like a distant thing,” he said. He is going back to theater in Clifford Odets' “Golden Boy” on the West End. “You won't be seeing four films come out at the same time for a little while.

Last Rites is being billed as the ninth and final title in Phase One of The Conjuring Universe, which has become the top-grossing horror franchise in box office history after collecting more than $2.3 billion in global ticket sales. 'The Conjuring: Last Rites' Review: Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson Return for a Concluding Chapter Full of Stale Scares Studio-By-Studio Summer Market Share: The Box Office Haves and Have Nots Last Rites is headed for a domestic debut that could approach or cross $50 million, although New Line and parent studio Warners are being more cautious and sticking with $35 million. In 2013, the very first Conjuring movie opened to $41 million domestically. No subsequent franchise title has been able to topple that record, although many are betting on Last Rites to do just that. Overseas, the movie is expected to open to another $50 million from more than 60 markets against a net production budget of $55 million before marketing. Critics haven't been so kind to the new Conjuring movie — the same could be said for most installments — but early audience reaction is promising.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PinkPantheress radically reimagined her own songs and stuffed a full band into a cubicle for her Tiny Desk Concert, which NPR Music shared Friday. The British singer managed to cram eight tracks (and six band members) into the space of 23 minutes, delivering unique spins on tracks like “Pain,” “Illegal,” and “Girl Like Me.” “So these are obviously very different renditions from the originals of the songs I have,” PinkPantheress said before shouting out her backing band, which helped breathe new life into the tracks with their live instrumentation.

Republican Candidate Takes Credit for Trump Immigration Raid at Hyundai Plant The Tiny Desk concert boasted three tracks — “Girl Like Me,” “Illegal,” and the closing “Tonight” — from PinkPantheress' recent mixtape Fancy That, which was named one of Rolling Stone's Best Albums of 2025 So Far. The gig also gave fans a preview of the singer's upcoming An Evening With PinkPantheress tour that kicks off next month in Brooklyn.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But as Joni Mitchell would be the first to tell you, no one made a fan base engage in more collective head-scratching and exasperation than she did nearly 50 years ago. studio cats, Mitchell spent several years discarding the daily-journal lyric writing and folkish melodies of her early work and wandering into more musically lyrically abstract territory on albums like Mingus and Don Juan's Reckless Daughter. As she told Cameron Crowe in Rolling Stone in 1979, “It's just that at a certain point, my poetry began to spill out of the form and into something more relative to a jazz sense of melody, which was restating the melody in variation.” At an equally certain point, her fans and many of her critic champions bailed, at least for many years. In retrospect, a sprawling album like Don Juan's Reckless Daughter has held up better than anyone might have thought in a year when L.A. rock was embodied by Hotel California and Running on Empty. But right up through her take on “Summertime” from her startling 2023 comeback at the Newport Folk Festival, Mitchell's love of jazz has never wavered. Joni's Jazz picks up that theme and runs with it. Spanning decades, albums, and cohorts, the set attempts to make the case that Mitchell's jazz period wasn't a fluke, that she was, in fact, a jazz singer of sorts all along. Druski Went Viral for Turning Into a White NASCAR Fan. RFK Jr. Claims mRNA Vaccines Kill People in Heated Senate Hearing Alone along her peers, Mitchell was blessed with a limber soprano that could navigate vocalese, jazz melodies, and less predictable rhythms with a fluid ease, as a return visit to “Blue Hotel Room” from Hejira reminds you. Her version of “You're My Thrill” (from 2000's covers-heavy Both Sides Now) uncannily conjures Billie Holiday's original, and she and her collaborators wove horn arrangements into her work in a far more sophisticated and subtle way than what we encountered on jazz-rock albums of the Seventies. During an era when some of her troubadour friends were steering toward yacht rock, “You Dream Flat Tires,” from 1982's uneven Wild Things Run Fast, now sounds even more like a brave attempt at fusion. It's not just a vocal showcase for her but actually more alluring in this form. But in a sign that Mitchell is perhaps still sensitive to the criticism that she wandered too far afield, Joni's Jazz can feel like a jazz improv that goes on a bit too long. Spread out over four CDs or eight LPs, the 61-track box feels at least one batch of songs too long. To reinforce the notion that she was thinking and sounding like a jazz singer from day one, Mitchell has dipped into her catalog for examples that prove her point (“Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire” from For the Roses) and some that really don't (“The Jungle Line” from Don Juan). In its determination to make its point, Joni's Jazz is a labor of love that still feels a little labored. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

Kestrin Pantera (Pretty Problems) is set to direct the film from a script by Shelby Enlow. Principal photography is set to begin in the first quarter of next year. Zero Gravity's Mark Williams and Allie Loh with Orien Richman will produce alongside Greenstein, with Thayer Juergens executive producing and Rebecca Raichek overseeing development on behalf of A Higher Standard. “I couldn't be more excited about this film, this incredible team, and my first collaboration with Zero Gravity on what promises to be a fun-filled ride,” said Greenstein. “The combination of humor and explosions, what could be better,” added Williams. Fisher was last seen in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, and in Netflix's George Clooney-starrer Jay Kelly, which celebrated its world premiere at the Venice film festival last week before heading to Telluride.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Discovery announced today that it's joining its fellow major Hollywood studios in attempting to sue the shit out of AI image and video company Midjourney. Earning a little “Hey, welcome to the fight” message from Disney—which, along with Universal, has been suing “bottomless pit of plagiarism” Midjourney for a few months now—WBD is seeking massive damages against the generative AI service. And we'll say this for the lawsuit, publicly available here: It certainly makes a hell of a pitch for Midjourney's ability to spit out images of Warner Bros. WBD's lawyers absolutely filled their filing with pictures of DC Comics characters, Looney Tunes characters, Rick And Morty, and more; the whole crux of their case rests on arguing that the technology in question is a credible threat to Warner Bros. Discovery's business model, granted, but some employee really filled up their “credible Tweety Bird copies” folder in the process. (For instance: WBD notes that it has a thriving business in poster sales and other officially licensed images, which Midjourney is directly competing with by letting users crap out as many copies of Rick Sanchez—who, somewhat hilariously, is legally defined here as “an animated eccentric mad scientist with spiky, baby-blue hair, and a unibrow of the same color”—as they'd like.) WBD might get slightly more traction by focusing on the ways Midjourney's AI is trained, which it intends to delve into deeply through discovery on the lawsuit. It'll be helped along by a few public statements Midjourney's execs made before they got slightly more lawyer savvy, apparently, including a 2022 quote from company founder David Holz that the team training the system “grabs everything they can, they dump it in a huge file, and they kind of set it on fire to train some huge thing.” At least one recent legal ruling has suggested that training on other people's material might fall under fair use—but that things can get a lot more murky if the plaintiff can prove that copyrighted material was used (and duplicated) in order to feed into the machine. The upshot of all this is that there are now three major Hollywood studios targeting this one firm in particular, making it increasingly likely that the Midjourney fight will end up setting some kind of precedent for how courts handle AI going forward.
