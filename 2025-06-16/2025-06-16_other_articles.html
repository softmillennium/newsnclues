                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sam and Dean Winchester hunted monsters across the country, saving people from things that go bump in the night. Five years after Supernatural ended, creator Eric Kripke talked about the story he never got to tell and the one he would never tell. Inspired by Roald Dahl's The Gremlins, Kripke wanted to do a story about mischievous creatures that messed with technology. But Kripke purposefully steered clear of one particular religious figure when writing Supernatural. Richard Speight Jr. asked Eric Kripke if there was any story he wanted to do but didn't get to. Kripke said, "The one story that I always really wanted to do under my watch that I never got a chance to do was Gremlins. ‘Cause Gremlins are a real mythology that long predated the movie." The furry creatures wreaked havoc on a small town, blowing up washing machines and movie theaters. While there are a few instances of gremlins affecting technology, those mischievous little creatures weren't based on the gremlins to which Kripke was referring. Gremlins are fictional creatures created to explain otherwise inexplicable malfunctions in aircrafts and other machinery. The idea of gremlins became popular among the Royal Air Force pilots and crew during World War II. Both sides experienced unexplained accidents, so the gremlins were thought to be unbiased tricksters, causing mischief and mayhem wherever they liked. Posters warning of the invisible mischief-makers depicting gremlins greasing floors and throwing things in people's eyes were made during the war. When describing his idea for the episode, Kripke said, "And so my notion was, okay, turns out gremlins are so small, you can't see them. So I don't have to make, like, a bunch of puppets. But like all the other cars and electronics, and whatever, the rule was going to be: the only way to stop them was to destroy them totally." "And so now Dean's like, ‘I can't destroy it. How Dean saves Baby is still a mystery, but he discussed some of the visual gags he had in mind. Like it wasn't like an impossible story to pull off ... It—you know, the only monsters you ever saw would have been like the blender that someone's hand was in or the car." When thinking back to why Kripke never made an episode about gremlins, he couldn't quite pinpoint the reason, but he said, "You know, I don't know why we never ended up doing it. But I think at the time, the feeling was like we don't have enough days in the schedule to do, like, a real Impala-centric episode … It's basically all car gags all day." While Supernatural never had a gremlin episode, something similar did happen in "Mannequin 3: The Reckoning." While it wasn't about imperceptible creatures, Baby was possessed by a ghost, and the Winchesters had to fight their Impala. Kripke's gremlins episode would've probably fallen somewhere in between the two. When on Supernatural Then and Now, Richard Speight Jr. asked Eric Kripke if he'd ever considered including Jesus in the Supernatural mythology. “I wasn't going to touch that with a 10-foot pole, man,” Kripke responded. “You know, the, the comic book sources that a lot of that stuff came from, like Preacher, you know, and Garth Ennis. And they were all—I mean—yes, there is sort of like a whacked-out Jesus character in that. You know, so that there're a lot of religions it could play under rather than, you know, being with any one particular religion.” I wasn't going to touch that with a 10-foot pole, man. It turned out the hotel was magically renovated to welcome several gods and deities from other faiths. It ended in a slaughter at the hands of Lucifer. Supernatural's "Swan Song" is hailed as Eric Kripke's perfect finale to the series, but his ending is actually much darker and unsatisfying. The episode was well-received, but inserting deities from belief systems currently being practiced by millions of people didn't go over well with some viewers—namely the representation of Ganesh and Kali. In addition to poorly portraying the gods and what they represent, they made them appear weak, like the pagan gods that are no longer worshiped—although there are over a billion practicing Hindus worldwide. We wanted to be provocative without being, you know, firebombed. Kripke also joked about finding the line in their storytelling, saying, “And, you know, we wanted to be provocative without being, you know, firebombed, I think.” The decision not to portray the Christian messiah was probably a good call, as the mythology was already limited to Abrahamic religions. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Supernatural's "Destiel" fans got a treat when Jensen Ackles confirmed that one of his band's songs was inspired by the Dean and Castiel relationship. Sitcoms are the backbone of television, but some classic ones have not aged as well as many fans would like them to. The latest round of casting for HBO's Harry Potter series suggests there will be some changes from the source material. These TV shows delivered unforgettable finales, ending their stories with grace, impact, and lasting emotional resonance that still holds up today.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the hours after Vance Boelter was named as the suspect in the fatal shooting of Melissa Hortman, a Democratic Minnesota state representative, and her husband Mark Hortman, far-right conspiracists and Republican influencers claimed he was a violent, leftist Democrat. The alleged shooter was reappointed to a Workforce Development Board by Walz in 2019. But there is no evidence to suggest a closer link between the pair. This did not stop the term “Walz appointee” from trending on X on Saturday, with right-wing influencers declaring confidently that the alleged shooter was a Democrat. “Did Walz have her executed?” right-wing commentator Mike Cernovich wrote on X, quoting a post from a well-known conspiracy theory account that highlighted Hortman had voted with Republicans. YouTuber Benny Johnson, who has almost 5 million followers on the video-sharing site and more than 3 million followers on X, positioned the shooting as part of a growing trend of left-wing violence in a long screed on X that described the alleged shooter as “a left-wing Tim Walz appointee.“ “Everyone talks about Minnesota, but they don't talk about the guy seems to be a leftist,” Donald Trump Jr. said in an an interview with News Nation. “The guy who committed those atrocities this weekend was a Democrat who worked for Tim Walz.” When pressed by the interviewer, who replied, “he voted for your Dad,” Trump Jr. said, “I'll believe that when I see it.” This did not stop Jones from weighing in: “Evidence mounts that the reported Minnesota assassin Vance Luther Boelter is a patsy who is being framed to cover up a larger false flag deep state operation,” Jones wrote on X. Arizona state senator Wendy Rogers, who has pushed numerous wild conspiracy theories in the past, added to the confusion by quoting a post on X about the suspected shooter's arrest and writing: “Something(s) don't add up. Others pointed to Carlson's interviews as further proof that this was all a set-up: “This is the most lazy psyop false flag crisis actor I've ever seen,” one conspiracy-focused X account wrote above a picture of Carlson. “When someone on the far-right commits a violent act, [right-wing conspiracy theorists] have to deflect the blame elsewhere, and do it by constructing convoluted conspiracies about the deep state being involved or the left wanting to ‘distract' from something else—because they've convinced themselves and their followers that nobody in their movement could possibly carry out any act of violence,” says Rothschild.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>[NoHo Arts District, CA] – A NoHo Arts theatre review of Tiffany Caputo: A Psychic Evening with Long Island's Other Medium at the Hollywood Fringe Festival 2025. Vegas has come to the Hollywood Fringe. Tiffany Caputo: A Psychic Evening with Long Island's Other Medium deserves to have a residency at the Aladdin or Stardust Hotels in the city that never sleeps. Charlotte Moroz brings Tiffany Caputo to life in the most extravagant way. I enjoyed every minute of this ‘experimental solo.' Ms. Moroz's character work is exemplary and absolutely hilarious. Several folks were called up to get a psychic reading, of sorts, from Ms. Caputo. Even though the character of Tiffany Caputo does seems a little familiar, Ms. Moroz keeps it fresh and has our full attention every single minute of this brilliant show and her improv skills are top notch. Attention to detail is Ms. Moroz's' secret ingredient that elevates Tiffany Caputo: A Psychic Evening with Long Island's Other Medium. At one point, the folks who were lucky enough to get readings with her were having so much fun, as were we, the audience, that I secretly wished my name would be called next. I really loved Tiffany Caputo: A Psychic Evening with Long Island's Other Medium and I am looking forward to more from Charlotte Moroz. I must mention that this was my fourth Hollywood Fringe show on this day and what a great way to end the evening. ****Check out more Hollywood Fringe Festival 2025 show reviews>> The NoHo Arts District is a one-square-mile community in North Hollywood that is home to more than 20 live, professional theatres, dance studios, art galleries, public art, music recording venues, acting and art workshops, international dining options, clothing and specialty shops, and businesses that create a myriad of art forms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kevin Bacon and Jennifer Nettles have released a new music video for their song "Our Highway," a driving country-rock track that originated from their collaboration on The Bondsman, a supernatural horror series now streaming on Amazon Prime. The show follows Bacon's character, Hub Halloran, a resurrected bounty hunter tasked with capturing escaped demons, and features Nettles as Maryanne Dice, his ex-wife, and a struggling country musician. It was fun to go back and write songs from my character, Hub Halloran's, point of view when he was a young man. It's a great driving tune about escaping with the one you love and sticking together." Nettles adds, "Kevin Bacon is a dream collaborator. Everyone knows he's an iconic storyteller, but his gifts extend far beyond the camera. We wrote these songs for The Bondsman but quickly came to realize they stood firmly on their own as a studio project. We had a ball bringing these songs to life in the studio, in the way we heard them as musicians (to live outside of and beyond the show)." The series blends horror, action, and heartfelt drama, grounded in themes of redemption, family, and musical roots. As Nettles hints, "'Our Highway" is the story of two people heading out on the road in search of a dream. We just may head out on the road to share it!!"

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inspired by a lifelong fascination with the paranormal and a love for filmmaking, Gavin Webb is bringing ghost stories from across Arkansas to the screen in a new 10-part series, “Haunted Arkansas,” set to debut on Amazon Prime this fall. Webb, who lives in Alma, said the idea grew from watching shows like “Ghost Adventures” and movies like “Ghostbusters.” However, he noticed that most paranormal shows visiting Arkansas focused on the same few locations, such as the Crescent Hotel in Eureka Springs or Fort Chaffee. “I wanted to do something on my own,” Webb said. Some sites, like the Collins Theatre in Paragould and Cosmic Caverns in Berryville, have rarely — if ever — been investigated on camera. Mickayla Carreker and Emily Ruckman join Webb as they explore each location. “For me, it's about building trust, being nice and respecting boundaries,” he said. Webb's first documentary, which focused on the King Opera House in Van Buren, already is available on Amazon Prime and Tubi. He hopes “Haunted Arkansas” will find a wider audience and be available on other streaming services. “I'm hoping that it gets picked up and we can do another season,” Webb said. “There are a lot of other places that would be good to investigate.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Red Sox fans were not prepared for this rollercoaster of emotions and lambasted the franchise for being  cheap once again. “How the f–k do you trade Rafael Devers?” Carrabis said. “For A: That return and B: the moment in which you did it.” Liverpool reportedly paid his former club $100 million for the midfielder. Devers is in the third season of a 10-year, $313 million contract and had been at odds with the team this spring training, after he was moved from third base to DH for the newly signed Alex Bregman. It is not the first time ownership has traded one of its star players, much to the frustration of its fan base. Betts was in the final year of his contract and would sign a 12-year, $365 million deal with Los Angeles — and he has since helped the franchise win two World Series. “I woke up still mad [about] the Devers trade,” Barstool founder Dave Portnoy wrote on X. “If you are trying to win you just don't trade your best hitter for nothing in the middle of the season. It seems like history has repeated itself yet again in Boston.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The British VarEVolt battery has been granted the certification needed so it can be manufactured on a large scale, meaning more EV makers can use them in their cars. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A British firm has received approval to mass-produce an ultra-high-power-density electric vehicle (EV) battery that can be fully recharged in just 18 seconds. The RML Group was granted Conformity of Production certification for its VarEVolt battery on June 2. The certification "underlines our readiness to move from prototyping and niche volumes to supporting larger production contracts," James Arkell, the head of powertrain at RML Group, said in a statement. RML's battery can deliver lots of power in a short span. The VarEVolt battery can supply 6 kilowatts per kilogram, and it's capable of "dumping all its power really, really quickly," RML board member Michael Mallock told Autocar. The VarEVolt's modular design lets manufacturers tune it for different applications. "We can focus on range, we can focus on power, or we can balance the two," depending on the type of vehicle it will be deployed in, RML Group CEO Paul Dickinson told Autocar. Some small-scale manufacturers are already using the VarEVolt battery; it helps power the futuristic Czinger 21C hybrid hypercar, which relies on a combination of an electric motor that uses energy stored in the battery and an internal combustion engine that burns gasoline.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The search for alien life remains inconclusive, but sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) continue to stir public interest - often without verifiable evidence. Now, a former US Air Force pilot has shared what he calls his "wildest experience" involving two mysterious objects during his time in service.

"It looked like a futuristic fighter jet - too advanced, almost machine-welded," he said, adding that neither he nor his superiors picked up anything on radar. The second incident, he said, occurred at a similar altitude when a rectangular object slowly approached from the front left. Bodenheimer reported the sighting to Air Traffic Control, though no radar confirmation followed. According to the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), there were 757 new UFO reports between May 2023 and June 2024. Most occurred in controlled airspace, with no underwater sightings. Roughly 300 cases have been explained, while the rest remain unresolved.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rushall, Norfolk: It's not an uncommon insect to find in your trap, but its design – and place in the world – is worthy of close consideration I've long likened opening every moth trap to Christmas morning: a moment when you have no idea what joy will be there. Nowadays there is as much fulfilment in seeing first responses from friends as there is in the magic of the insects themselves. How extraordinary, I thought, that it may have been in Belgium or Holland the week before. It's a journey that vastly expands our idea of what an insect might be. My friend, however, was more taken with an everyday miracle: the poplar hawk-moth, which is expected in most springtime moth traps. It is, in truth, more extraterrestrial than earthling, and most moth novices respond accordingly. The latter are often no more than 5mm in size (and far less inspiring to our gross human senses), but in total our entire moth fauna is at the heart of most British landscapes. Their four-stage life cycle – egg, caterpillar, pupa, imago – also means that moths are perfect to convey the idea that nature is essentially a fabric of complex interrelationships. The living world cannot be understood only as a collection of separate “things” – birds, plants, moths and so on; it is an indivisible whole. Think of bats, I suggested, as little more than moths further along the living web.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Conspiracy theorists and senators alike are baselessly speculating about the brutal shooting spree that left two dead and two injured, Josh Marcus reports At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. In regards to Hortman, right-wing conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich wondered aloud on X, “Did [Minnesota Governor] Tim Walz have her executed to send a message?” Fellow fabulist Alex Jones, meanwhile, used a Saturday broadcast to make a variety of unfounded implications, including that Hortman was killed because she was considering switching parties and joining Republicans, and that suspect Boelter was a “high-level” Walz appointee and “No Kings” protest organizer. Such claims reached thousands of people, even as they defied common sense and all evidence that eventually became available about the shootings. Hortman was not planning on switching parties, though she did help broker a controversial compromise with Republicans this year to scale back undocumented immigrants' access to a state health program in order to keep the government open. Evidence found in Boelter's vehicle reportedly contained a hit list of prominent state Democrats and abortion rights supporters. State officials were worried about safety threats to the protests after finding papers marked “No Kings,” rather than the alleged gunman being a protest leader. The man's roommate also described him as a Trump voter. Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, less than a day after saying he condemned all “political violence” in America after a fatal shooting at a protest in his home state, appeared to mock the Minnesota tragedy, calling it the “Nightmare on Waltz Street” in an X post, an apparent misspelling of the governor's name. He also suggested that left-wing ideology had caused the shooting. “This is what happens,” he wrote in a caption for a photograph of the alleged Minnesota shooter, “When Marxists don't get their way.” Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio took a similar tack, writing on X: “The degree to which the extreme left has become radical, violent, and intolerant is both stunning and terrifying.” “The FBI is fully engaged on the ground in Minnesota and is working in collaboration with our local and state partners,” he said Saturday. “In a different, saner world, they would be humiliated and slink away,” wroteJ. Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, called on those engaging in such speculation to remember that “we have families that continue to grieve.” “While everybody wants an easy answer, I would encourage everybody online and in our communities to not speculate on what occurred and what the motivation was for this,” he said during a press conference on Sunday. “We often want easy answers for complex problems,” he said. “We must truly focus on what matters beneath all of our differences — political, personal or otherwise,” Mayor Ryan Sabas of Champlin, Minnesota, told reporters at the briefing.
