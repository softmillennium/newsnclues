A published research paper is the result of an extensive conversation between authors and reviewers, guided by editors.Credit: Getty Until now, Nature authors could opt in to this process of transparent peer review. From 16 June, however, new submissions of manuscripts that are published as research articles in Nature will automatically include a link to the reviewers' reports and author responses. It means that, over time, more Nature papers will include a peer-review file. Our aim in doing so is to open up what many see as the ‘black box' of science, shedding light on how a research paper is made. As we have written previously, a published research paper is the result of an extensive conversation between authors and reviewers, guided by editors. These discussions, which can last for months, aim to improve a study's clarity and the robustness of its conclusions. It is a hugely important process that should receive increased recognition, including acknowledgement of the reviewers involved, if they choose to be named. But scientific knowledge evolves as new or more-nuanced evidence comes to light. They were debating treatments and prevention methods, constantly adjusting everyone's knowledge as fresh evidence came to light. We hope that publishing the peer-reviewer reports of all newly submitted Nature papers shows, in a small way, that this doesn't need to remain the case. Nature started mandating peer review for all published research articles only in 1973 (M. Baldwin Notes Rec. The exchanges between authors and referees should be seen as a crucial part of the scientific record, just as they are a key part of doing and disseminating research.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By the final hour of excavations, researchers uncovered an entire intact side of the sarcophagus that depicted Hercules lounging on his lion skin, chalice in hand. After hours of cleaning and reassembling the broken sarcophagus, a scene depicting Dionysus surrounded by a party of mythological characters—including Maenads (female followers of Dionysus), satyrs, the gods Hermes and Pan, lions, and tigers—was revealed. This isn't the first time this motif has appeared in Roman art, according to IAA archeologist Nohar Shahar. He explained in the press release that Dionysus often appears on second and third century B.C. sarcophagi, though the “wine competition” imagery primarily occurs in mosaics. “In this case, it seems that the figures are not only celebrating—they are in fact accompanying the dead on his last journey, when drinking and dancing are transformed into a symbol of liberation and transition to life in the next world,” Shahar explained. History lesson aside, there's one glaring question that can't be ignored: who won this “battle of the beers,” Hercules or Dionysus? According to Shahar, the answer is quite obvious. “This is a thought-provoking discovery reflecting how life and faith were perceived in the Roman world,” he said in the press release. “The sarcophagus is undergoing a meticulous conservation process, which upon completion will enable it to be presented to the general public as part of our commitment to making the country's past heritage accessible.” Her work appears in several publications including Biography.com and Popular Mechanics.

Nature Astronomy (2025)Cite this article Approximately half of the Universe's dark matter resides in collapsed halos; significantly less than half of the baryonic matter (protons and neutrons) remains confined to halos. A small fraction of baryons are in stars and the interstellar medium within galaxies. The majority are diffuse (<10−3 cm−3) and ionized (neutral fraction <10−4), located in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and in the halos of galaxy clusters, groups and galaxies. This diffuse ionized gas is notoriously difficult to measure, but has wide implications for galaxy formation, astrophysical feedback and precision cosmology. Recently, the dispersion of extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been used to measure the total content of cosmic baryons. Here we present a large cosmological sample of FRB sources localized to their host galaxies. We have robustly partitioned the missing baryons into the IGM, galaxy clusters and galaxies, providing a late-Universe measurement of the cosmic baryon abundance, \({\varOmega }_{{\mathrm{b}}}{h}_{70}=0.05{1}_{-0.006}^{+0.006}\), where Ωb is the baryon density parameter and h70 is the scaled Hubble constant. Our results indicate efficient feedback processes that can deplete galaxy halos and enrich the IGM (total baryon fraction in the IGM is \({f}_{{\rm{IGM}}}=0.7{6}_{-0.11}^{+0.10}\)), agreeing with the baryon-rich cosmic web scenario seen in cosmological simulations. Our results may reduce the ‘S8 tension' in cosmology, as strong feedback leads to suppression of the matter power spectrum.

This subset of sources are the FRBs that did not make it into our companion paper's host galaxy analysis, either because they were discovered after November 2023 or because their host did not meet the r ~ 23.5 mag criteria. Each image is centred on the host galaxy candidate preferred by PATH, identified by cyan cross-hairs6. The 90% confidence FRB localization regions are marked as red ellipses. All images were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of σ = 0″. 4 to improve visibility. Panels a-d show Macquart Relations for different components of diffuse cosmic gas from a mock FRB survey10. We plot \({{\rm{DM}}}_{{\rm{ex}}/{z}_{\rm s}}\) for intervening halos (green, panel a), the IGM (grey, b), and total DM (black, c). The solid curves are the mean extragalactic DM at that redshift. Panel d shows the total extragalactic DM distribution after including a log-normal host DM distribution, where the heatmap is the log probability and the redpoints are the actual samples. Panel e is a radial treemap showing the partition of baryons in TNG300-1. The two upper rows show the 2D P(DMIGM, DMX) distribution, which is the relative probability in DMIGM and DMX for FRBs at zs = 0.5 (top) and zs = 1.0 (middle) for increasing values of the halo gas fraction, fX. We use a bivariate log-normal distribution that has been calibrated to mock FRB surveys in the Illustris TNG300-1 simulation. The distribution ensures that DMIGM and DMX are correlated, since sightlines that pass through halos are more likely to pass through overdensities in the cosmic web and have large DMIGM. In order to compute our final likelihood function, the 2D distribution shown in the top two rows must be integrated along curves of constant cosmic DM, \({{\rm{DM}}}_{\cos }={{\rm{DM}}}_{{\rm{IGM}}}+{{\rm{DM}}}_{{\rm{X}}}\). The resulting \(P({{\rm{DM}}}_{{\rm{ex}}}| {z}_{\rm s},\overrightarrow{\theta })\) are show in the bottom row, with μhost = 4.5 and σhost = 0.7. The bottom left and bottom right likelihoods are not supported by our data. The value of \({{\rm{DM}}}_{\cos }={{\rm{DM}}}_{{\rm{IGM}}}+{{\rm{DM}}}_{{\rm{X}}}\) averaged over a large number of sightlines is a direct measure of the cosmic density of diffuse, ionized baryonic matter, fd Ωb. We show the results from two different methods for estimating the ionized fraction of baryons, fd. The corner plot in panel a shows pairwise posteriors from an MCMC fit, which produces \({f}_{d}=0.9{3}_{-0.05}^{+0.04}\) after marginalizing over the host DM parameters. In panel b we plot the diffuse fraction of baryons as a function of redshift for our sample of localized FRBs with 1σ error bars (red markers). Over-plotted as black points are the zs > 0.2 sample we use to compute a weighted average of fd. The right side shows the probability P(fd) from kernel density estimation (KDE), where the red distribution is for the whole sample. We plot the fraction of matter bound in massive groups and galaxy clusters above a given mass, defined here as M500. The left vertical axis shows the fraction of cosmic baryons within r500 of halos with mass greater than M500. The right vertical axis shows the total matter bound in halos. The divergence at low masses is due to the apparent scarcity of baryons in smaller halos.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Truly Intelligent AI Could Play by the Rules, No Matter How Strange A proposed game-playing challenge would evaluate AIs on how well they can adapt to and follow new rules. They range from “reverse” games—where the first player to make three in a row loses—to three-dimensional versions played on cubes and beyond. Gardner's games, even if they boggle a typical human mind, might point us to a way to make artificial intelligence more humanlike. Navigating rules is also a key challenge for AI models as they start to approximate human thought. And as things stand, it's a challenge where most of these models fall short. That's a big deal because if there's a path to artificial general intelligence, the ultimate goal of machine-learning and AI research, it can only come through building AIs that are capable of interpreting, adapting to and rigidly following the rules we set for them. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. To drive the development of such AI, we must develop a new test—let's call it the Gardner test—in which an AI is surprised with the rules of a game and is then expected to play by those rules without human intervention. The Gardner test, with apologies to the Turing test, is inspired by and builds on the pioneering work in AI on general game playing (GGP), a field largely shaped by Stanford University professor Michael Genesereth. Once a distant goal, this is now within reach of modern AIs because of the recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) such as those that power ChatGPT and that fall within the families of Claude and Llama. The proposed challenge should include a battery of tests that could be initially focused on games that have been staples of GGP competitions such as Connect Four, Hex and Pentago. It should also leverage an impressive array of games that Gardner wrote about. But to pass the new test, it isn't enough to create an AI system that's good at playing one specific predetermined game or even many. Instead, an AI must be designed to master any strategy game on the fly. That's a big leap from today's top game-playing AI models, which rely on knowing the rules in advance to train their algorithms. Consider, for instance, AlphaZero, the revolutionary AI model that's capable of playing three games—chess, Go and shogi (Japanese chess)—at a superhuman level. AlphaZero learns through a technique known as “self-play”—it repeatedly plays against a copy of itself, and from that experience, it gets better over time. Self-play, however, requires the rules of each game to be set before training. In contrast, an AI model performing well on the proposed new test would be capable of adapting to new rules, even in the absence of data; it would play any game and follow any novel rule set with power and precision. You can prompt many generative AI systems to execute variants on simple games, and they'll play along: ChatGPT can play a 4×4 or 5×5 variant of tic-tac-toe, for instance. But an LLM prompt is best thought of as a suggestion rather than a concrete set of rules—that's why we often have to coax, wheedle and prompt tune LLMs into doing exactly what we want. It's easy to imagine real-world scenarios in which such errors could be catastrophic: in a national security context, for instance, AI capabilities are needed that can accurately apply rules of engagement dynamically or negotiate subtle but crucial differences in legal and command authorities. In finance, programmable money is emerging as a new form of currency that can obey rules of ownership and transferability—and misapplying these rules could lead to financial disaster. When we think of human game players, we tend to think of specialists: Magnus Carlsen is a great chess player but might not be so hot at Texas Hold'Em. Game playing with a novel set of rules is crucial to the next evolution of AI because it will potentially let us create AIs that will be capable of anything—but that will also meticulously and reliably follow the rules we set for them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have discovered a unique class of small antibodies that are strongly protective against a wide range of SARS coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1 and numerous early and recent SARS-CoV-2 variants. The findings, published in Nature Communications, offer a promising route to developing broad-spectrum antiviral treatments that could remain effective against future viral variants. SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19, continues to be a potential threat as it evolves into newer variants that are resistant to currently approved antibody therapies. Resistance largely emerges because antibodies typically target virus regions, such as the receptor binding domain of the spike protein, that also frequently mutate, enabling escape from antibody recognition. To address this, a research team led by Prof. Xavier Saelens and Dr. Bert Schepens at the VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology explored a different strategy by focusing on one of the more stable subunits of the spike protein. The so-called S2 subunit is critical for the virus's ability to fuse with host cells, a process essential for infection, and it is more conserved across different coronaviruses. The team turned to llamas (more specifically a llama called Winter). Llamas generate so-called single-domain antibodies, also known as VHHs or nanobodies, that are much smaller than the antibodies generated by most animals, including humans. The researchers identified several llama antibodies that strongly neutralize a broad panel of SARS coronaviruses. What makes these antibodies particularly promising is their unique mode of action: they act like a molecular clamp. The antibodies showed strong protection against infection in lab animals, even at low doses. And when researchers attempted to force the virus to evolve resistance, the virus struggled, producing only rare escape variants that were much less infectious. This discovery marks a significant advancement in the quest for durable and broadly effective antiviral therapies, offering hope for treatments that can keep pace with viral evolution. "This work provides a strong foundation for developing next-generation antibodies that could be vital in combating not only current but also future coronavirus threats."

Nature Synthesis (2025)Cite this article Metrics details Precision engineering of semiconductor nanomaterials remains difficult. Here we present a programmable approach to synthesizing a library of atomically precise semiconductor nanoclusters via cation exchange. Using a universal metal–ligand coordination complex to program cations and surface ligands, and a Cu26Se13 template cluster to control the anion lattice, we synthesize a homologous series of Zn14Se13, Cd14Se13 and Hg14Se13 clusters, all featuring a pair of prominent absorption peaks. The shared A14B13 framework with icosahedral anion packing and tetrahedral cation bonding serves as a blueprint for constructing chiral semiconductor nanostructures. Theoretical calculations reveal atom-like frontier orbitals, including triply degenerate P-type orbitals for holes and singlet S-type orbitals for electrons. The doublet absorptions originate from the spin–orbit splitting of the P → S transition. The precise and programmable synthesis is expected to enable atomic-level control over the optical, electronic and spin properties of semiconductor artificial atoms and their assemblies.

Nature Chemistry (2025)Cite this article Metrics details Due to the structural complexity of natural products, their target-oriented syntheses usually require the design of individualized routes that are tailor-made for the specific targets. As such, route redesign is needed when targets of different skeletal connectivities are considered. Here we report a versatile synthetic strategy that runs counter to this conventional wisdom and allows access to a range of terpenoids with distinct skeletal frameworks from the sesquiterpene lactone sclareolide as the starting material. By viewing a biocatalytically installed alcohol as an exploitable motif rather than a structural endpoint, a number of abiotic skeletal rearrangements were designed, resulting in substantial structural divergence from the original drimane ring system of sclareolide. Using this approach, the syntheses of four terpenoid natural products, namely, merosterolic acid B, cochlioquinone B, (+)-daucene and dolasta-1(15),8-diene, were achieved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mathematicians Come Up with ‘Mind-Blowing' Method for Defining Prime Numbers Using a notion called integer partitions, mathematicians have discovered a new way to detect prime numbers while also connecting two areas of math in an unexpected way For centuries, prime numbers have captured the imaginations of mathematicians, who continue to search for new patterns that help identify them and the way they're distributed among other numbers. When mathematicians consider large numbers, however, the task of discerning which ones are prime quickly mushrooms in difficulty. Given that there are infinitely many positive integers of all different sizes, however, this number is minuscule compared with even larger primes. “We're interested in the prime numbers because there are infinitely many of them, but it's very difficult to identify any patterns in them,” says Ken Ono, a mathematician at the University of Virginia. Recently, Ono and two of his colleagues—William Craig, a mathematician at the U.S. “We have described infinitely many new kinds of criteria for exactly determining the set of prime numbers, all of which are very different from ‘If you can't factor it, it must be prime,'” Ono says. He and his colleagues' paper, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, was runner-up for a physical science prize that recognizes scientific excellence and originality. In some sense, the finding offers an infinite number of new definitions for what it means for numbers to be prime, Ono notes.

It dates back to the 18th-century Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, and it has continued to be expanded and refined by mathematicians over time. “Partitions, at first glance, seem to be the stuff of child's play,” Ono says. Yet the concept turns out to be powerful as a hidden key that unlocks new ways of detecting primes. “It is remarkable that such a classical combinatorial object—the partition function—can be used to detect primes in this novel way,” says Kathrin Bringmann, a mathematician at the University of Cologne. (Bringmann has worked with Ono and Craig before, and she's currently van Ittersum's postdoctoral adviser, but she wasn't involved with this research.) Ono notes that the idea for this approach originated in a question posed by one of his former students, Robert Schneider, who's now a mathematician at Michigan Technological University. Named Diophantine equations after third-century mathematician Diophantus of Alexandria (and studied long before him), these expressions can have integer solutions or rational ones (meaning they can be written as a fraction). George Andrews, a mathematician at Pennsylvania State University, who edited the PNAS paper but wasn't involved with the research, describes the finding as “something that's brand new” and “not something that was anticipated,” making it difficult to predict “where it will lead.” In this method, you can plug an integer that is 2 or larger into particular equations, and if they are true, then the integer is prime. “More generally,” for a particular type of partition function, “we prove that there are infinitely many such prime detecting equations with constant coefficients,” the researchers wrote in their PNAS paper. Put more simply, “it's almost like our work gives you infinitely many new definitions for prime,” Ono says. The team's findings could lead to many new discoveries, Bringmann notes. “Beyond its intrinsic mathematical interest, this work may inspire further investigations into the surprising algebraic or analytic properties hidden in combinatorial functions,” she says. “More broadly, it shows the richness of connections in mathematics,” she adds. “These kinds of results often stimulate fresh thinking across subfields.” Bringmann suggests some potential ways that mathematicians could build on the research. “Ken Ono is, in my opinion, one of the most exciting mathematicians around today,” Andrews says. "This isn't the first time that he has seen into a classic problem and brought really new things to light.” Goldbach's conjecture states that “every even number bigger than 2 is a sum of two primes in at least one way,” Ono says. But no one has proven this conjecture to be true. Although his team's recent finding doesn't solve those problems, he says, it's a profound example of how mathematicians are pushing boundaries to better understand the mysterious nature of prime numbers.

For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. First, I've got a quick dispatch from Lauren Young, associate editor for health and medicine at Scientific American. Here's Lauren now to tell us more about the situation. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. Lauren Young: So a little rundown of what ACIP does: the committee's recommendations help guide doctors, health practitioners and the general public on whether or not various groups of people should get access to vaccines and when. So for instance, they help shape immunization schedules for adults, kids, pregnant people and those with preexisting health conditions that may make them more vulnerable to severe illness. The ACIP members review all sorts of different types of data: evidence from government scientists, studies from vaccine manufacturers, independent studies, etcetera. And that upcoming meeting is a big one: votes for the upcoming fall COVID vaccines as well as guidance for flu and RSV vaccines are all on the table. I spoke with Brown University epidemiologist Jennifer Nuzzo, and she says that without ACIP's nonpartisan expert guidance, access to vaccines can easily become interrupted. She also points out that the HHS secretary makes final approvals of new members, giving a potential opportunity for Kennedy, who has a history being an anti-vaccine advocate, to potentially stack the committee with new members who may support anti-vaccine views. And this can have larger consequences on access to all vaccines in the United States. That's a concern scientists are wrestling with right now with the anticipated reductions in access for the next COVID shots. But Nuzzo is worried that COVID shots may only be the beginning. We're gonna have to wait and see what potentially happens at the next ACIP meeting for more information. Feltman: On Wednesday afternoon Kennedy announced eight people he'd chosen to replace the 17 dismissed advisory panel members. His picks are already raising red flags among public health experts, with the list including several individuals who have expressed skepticism or spread misinformation about vaccine safety and efficacy. We'll keep you updated on this situation as it evolves further. You've heard of climate change, but what about its “evil twin”? That's what some experts have dubbed ocean acidification, according to the Guardian. Until now ocean acidification was one of the few Earth system processes thought to still be within its “planetary boundary”—the safe operating limits for keeping the planet stable. But a study published last Monday in Global Change Biology suggests this isn't the case. That's because when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels go up, global warming isn't the only consequence; the ocean absorbs a lot of the atmosphere's carbon dioxide, and CO2 sets off a series of chemical reactions that leads to a lower pH. The first organisms to fall victim to ocean acidification are typically ones with skeletons and hard shells because a lower pH makes it more difficult for animals to build and maintain those structures. The new study combined existing ice core data with computer models to get a better picture of how the ocean's pH is changing. We'll wrap up with a couple of animal stories. Unfortunately, pangolin scales are highly sought after for use in traditional medicine, and these adorable critters are considered to be the most highly trafficked mammal on the planet. What's worse is that they react to danger by curling up into little scaly balls—that's where the pine cone resemblance gets really uncanny—which is a great way to ward off a hungry predator but also a great way to make them easy pickings for a human hunter. A study published last Friday in Nature Ecology & Evolution confirms another inconvenient truth about pangolins: apparently they're delicious. It's not actually news that lots of people eat the eight pangolin species found in Africa and Asia. The researchers surveyed 809 hunters and meat vendors in Nigeria—which has become a major hub for pangolin trafficking, thanks to the creature's dwindling populations in Asia—about how and why they acquire pangolins. It turns out that 97 percent of pangolins are captured not by dedicated pangolin hunters but by people in the right place at the right time and largely to be eaten. More often than not, the scales are actually discarded. Another survey the researchers ran—this one focused on hunters, meat vendors, and household members of each—also ranked pangolin meat higher than any other wild game or domesticated animal in terms of taste. First, the researchers point out, their data suggests that our estimates of pangolin exploitation, which largely rely on the number of scales found on the trafficking market, are probably way too low. This also suggests that conservation efforts are putting their resources in the wrong place. The authors note that implementing programs to improve food security for local people, combined with efforts to educate hunters about the importance of pangolin conservation, could have a bigger impact than aggressive policing of scale traffickers. In a study published last Wednesday in Nature Ecology and Evolution, scientists report that more than 200 million years ago, archosauromorphs—reptiles from the evolutionary branch upon which dinosaurs and crocodiles would later emerge—may have migrated across vast distances that were previously thought to be inhospitable to life. Scientists already knew that these reptiles survived a brutal mass extinction, which opened the door for dinosaurs to evolve. It was previously assumed that archosauromorphs were stuck living in a few specific spots because of extreme heat throughout the tropics. I guess it really is true that life finds a way.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>World's Biggest Digital Camera Will Release Its First Photos of the Night Sky. Here's how to watch the action live On June 23 the observatory will unveil a first look at ultrahigh-definition images and videos of the cosmos taken from a mountaintop in Chile. And you can participate by joining a public livestream (in English and Spanish) or one of the in-person watch parties at planetariums, universities and museums around the globe. Space enthusiasts who can get to a watch party at a planetarium will be rewarded with immersive full-dome images of the horizon-to-horizon Southern Hemisphere night sky. A full list can be found at the Rubin Observatory Watch Party website. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. It will be sky watching in high definition: the observatory is designed to show very detailed views of the universe in crisp detail over wide areas, so viewers will get a glimpse of distant galaxies, galaxy clusters and stars. One goal is to map the Milky Way and look for streams of stars that are the remnants of galaxies that were torn apart by their neighbors eons ago. These remnants can help scientists understand how the Milky Way formed. Finally astronomers want to use the Rubin Observatory to understand dark matter, which has mass but doesn't release or reflect light. So while you won't get a glimpse of this pervasive matter, astronomers can study it through its gravitational effects on visible matter, such as the galaxies and galaxy clusters that the LSST camera will photograph night after night. Anyone can sign up to host a watch party at the Rubin Observatory website. Hosts will receive access to a virtual 3D model of the observatory and a virtual tour of Cerro Pachón. They'll also have access to a planetarium-dome-sized feed of the livestream, as well as other planetarium content. Home viewers will be able to see the livestream and images at rubinobservatory.org.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A cosmic particle detector in Antarctica has emitted a series of bizarre signals that defy the current understanding of particle physics, according to an international research group that includes scientists from Penn State. The unusual radio pulses were detected by the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) experiment, a range of instruments flown on balloons high above Antarctica that are designed to detect radio waves from cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere. "It's an interesting problem because we still don't actually have an explanation for what those anomalies are, but what we do know is that they're most likely not representing neutrinos," Wissel said. Neutrinos, a type of particle with no charge and the smallest mass of all subatomic particles, are abundant in the universe. Usually emitted by high-energy sources like the sun or major cosmic events like supernovas or even the Big Bang, there are neutrino signals everywhere. The problem with these particles, though, is that they are notoriously difficult to detect, Wissel explained. If we detect them, it means they have traveled all this way without interacting with anything else. Once detected and traced to their source, these particles can reveal more about cosmic events than even the most high-powered telescopes, Wissel added, as the particles can travel undisturbed and almost as fast as the speed of light, giving clues about cosmic events that happened lightyears away. Wissel and teams of researchers around the world have been working to design and build special detectors to capture sensitive neutrino signals, even in relatively small amounts. "We use radio detectors to try to build really, really large neutrino telescopes so that we can go after a pretty low expected event rate," said Wissel, who has designed experiments to spot neutrinos in Antarctica and South America. ANITA is one of these detectors, and it was placed in Antarctica because there is little chance of interference from other signals. To capture the emission signals, the balloon-borne radio detector is sent to fly over stretches of ice, capturing what are called ice showers. "We have these radio antennas on a balloon that flies 40 kilometers above the ice in Antarctica," Wissel said. "We point our antennas down at the ice and look for neutrinos that interact in the ice, producing radio emissions that we can then sense on our detectors." These special ice-interacting neutrinos, called tau neutrinos, produce a secondary particle called a tau lepton that is released out of the ice and decays, the physics term referring to how the particle loses energy as it travels over space and breaks down into its constituents. If they were visible to the naked eye, air showers might look like a sparkler waved in one direction, with sparks trailing it, Wissel explained. These signals can then be traced back to their origin, similar to how a ball thrown at an angle will predictably bounce back at the same angle, Wissel said. The recent anomalous findings, though, cannot be traced back in such a manner as the angle is much sharper than existing models predict. The researchers then cross-referenced signals from other independent detectors like the IceCube Experiment and the Pierre Auger Observatory to see if data from upward-going air showers, similar to those found by ANITA, were captured by other experiments. The new detector, called PUEO, will be larger and better at detecting neutrino signals, Wissel said, and it will hopefully shed light on what exactly the anomalous signal is. "My guess is that some interesting radio propagation effect occurs near ice and also near the horizon that I don't fully understand, but we certainly explored several of those, and we haven't been able to find any of those yet either," Wissel said. "So, right now, it's one of these long-standing mysteries, and I'm excited that when we fly PUEO, we'll have better sensitivity. We also might detect neutrinos, which would in some ways be a lot more exciting." The other Penn State co-author is Andrew Zeolla, a doctoral candidate in physics.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dr Lyndal Hulse from UQ's School of the Environment said the standardized koala genetic marker panel provides a consistent method for researchers nationwide to capture and share koala genetic variation, enabling improved collaboration and data integration across studies. "Koalas in the wild are under increasing pressure from habitat loss, disease and vehicle strikes, forcing them to live in increasingly smaller and more isolated pockets with limited access to breeding mates outside their group," Dr Hulse said. "Population inbreeding can mean detrimental effects on their health. "A standardized panel for directly comparing genetic markers enables researchers, conservationists and government agencies to better understand the genetic diversity of koala populations, allowing for greater collaboration to ensure their survival." Saurabh Shrivastava, Senior Account Manager at project partner the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF Ltd), said the new screening tool was a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array that used next-generation sequencing technologies. Dr Hulse said ideally the tool could help guide targeted koala relocations across regions. "There are very strict rules about relocating koalas, but this could be key to improving and increasing the genetics of populations under threat," she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dr Rebecca Boulton, from the University of Stirling, has shown, for the first time, that Lysiphlebus fabarum - a tiny species of wasp - can reproduce with or without a mate. This discovery challenges the previous assumption that asexual females could not mate and produce offspring sexually. Significantly, the wasps lay their eggs inside small sap-sucking insects called aphids before consuming their host from the inside out -- meaning that they are natural pest controllers. Lysiphlebus fabarum is known to have both sexual and asexual populations but, until now, it was not known whether asexual females could reproduce sexually with males. The discovery opens up new possibilities for improving biological pest control. Many species of parasitoid wasps are mass-reared and released as a natural alternative to pesticides because they lay their eggs on or in other species, many of which are pests, before the developing wasp larvae consumes their host, killing it in the process. Currently, Lysiphlebus fabarum is not used commercially despite being found worldwide and naturally targeting aphids. Developing an understanding of how the species reproduce could help boost genetic diversity in commercially reared lines, making future biocontrol agents more resilient and better adapted. She said: "In an evolutionary sense, facultative sex seems like a perfect strategy - asexual reproduction is highly efficient, and takes away the costs of finding a mate as well as the risks of failing to find one. When females reproduce asexually they don't mix their genes up with any others which limits the potential for evolution to happen. "The results of my study show that there might be hidden costs to facultative sex though as it reduces female wasps' reproductive success, and this might limit how frequently it occurs in nature. Dr Boulton reared the wasps in a Controlled Environment Facility (CEF) at the University and had initially planned to put asexual and sexual wasps together, in direct competition, to see which parasitized the most aphids. This led to a change in strategy, as she started to record this behavior in more detail, before carrying out wasp paternity testing to see whether the asexual females were just mating or actually fertilizing eggs. Once it confirmed that the asexual wasps were engaging in facultative sex, Dr Boulton carried out an experiment where asexual females either mated or didn't, before examining how successful these females, and their daughters, were at parasitizing aphids. The study involved putting around 300 wasps, each around 1mm long, in their own petri dish with a colony of sap-sucking aphids and counting how many were parasitized. Lysiphlebus fabarum wasps only live a few days but spend two weeks developing as larvae on their hosts. The entire experiment, which was carried out across two generations of wasps, took six weeks to run. On completion Dr Boulton extracted DNA from the wasps and sent it to be paternity tested. Professor Anne Ferguson-Smith, Executive Chair of BBSRC, said: "This is an exciting example of how BBSRC's Discovery Fellowships are helping talented early career researchers explore fundamental questions in bioscience with real-world relevance. "Dr Boulton's work, which measures the costs of sex in this predominantly asexual parasitoid wasp, opens up promising avenues for more sustainable pest control. Supporting curiosity-driven research like this not only strengthens the UK's research base, but helps drive innovation that benefits the environment, food systems and society at large."
