                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If there was a telling recent moment when it comes to how ugly our political discourse has become, it might well have been the brutal 2022 hammer attack on Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul. But it wasn't just right-wing influencers leading the charge; it was also the likes of then-former President Donald Trump, Elon Musk and a coterie of prominent Republicans. These theories generally held or winked at the idea that the attack was a “false flag,” and/or that Paul Pelosi had been engaged in a gay lover's quarrel – even as he was recovering from nearly being killed. But that episode did nothing to dissuade some observers from doing it again. The lure of quickly politicizing a violent attack with misinformation and speculation has proven more tempting than being circumspect and sensitive about a tragedy. Some on the modern right apparently can't allow that someone on their side could be responsible for such violence, so they've again leapt to link the attacker to the other side with innuendo and falsehoods. Today's example deals with the shootings of two Democratic Minnesota state lawmakers. Authorities are still piecing together evidence on a possible motive, but Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has said the attack was a “politically motivated assassination.” The suspect who has now been detained after a manhunt, Vance Boelter, had an apparent hit list of nearly 70 targets. So much remains to be learned about what spurred the attack, and it's important to wait for more information before drawing definitive conclusions. These incidents are often carried out by disturbed individuals with no neat and tidy political motivation. They pointed to the fact that Walz in 2019 had appointed Boelter to the state's Workforce Development Board – a group of business owners who consult lawmakers. Others suggested Hortman had been targeted because she in May spearheaded a compromise with Republicans under which undocumented adults would no longer be eligible for a state health care program. Hortman last week tearfully recounted voting for that compromise. But the other lawmaker victim this weekend, Hoffman, didn't vote for it. Still others pointed to flyers for the anti-Trump “No Kings” protests this weekend that were allegedly found in Boelter's car, as if he supported those protests. Protest organizers canceled their events out of fear the protesters could be targeted. Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah repeatedly suggested Boelter is not just a leftist but a “Marxist” and linked him to Walz in an X post: “Nightmare on Waltz Street.” Lee also wrote: “This is what happens when Marxists don't get their way.” Influencers went even further, with some of the most prominent and recognizable ones suggesting without any evidence that Walz was somehow involved in the attack. “Did Tim Walz have her executed to send a message?,” asked right-wing figure Mike Cernovich on X. Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said Sunday that the shooter “appears to be a hate-filled right winger” and urged his side not to dance around “MAGA's legitimization of political violence.” As noted, there is more evidence for this view than the inverse, but we still don't know a lot. To be clear, these Republican lawmakers and conservative influencers aren't just suggestively raising questions – as their ilk often did with Paul Pelosi's attackers – they're suggesting this is a settled issue. After the assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year, Republicans including Trump suggested a link to Democrats' rhetoric, despite the still-opaque picture of Thomas Matthew Crooks' politics and motivations. Some congressional Republicans suggested law enforcement deliberately jeopardized Trump – something that would be a massive scandal – without evidence. Many noted Crooks had once donated a small amount to a Democratic-leaning group, but that group has been criticized for misleading fundraising appeals. A report by the Justice Department's inspector general last year found no undercover FBI employees were present on January 6 and that none of the FBI's confidential human sources present had been “directed by the FBI to encourage others to commit illegal acts on January 6.” There's a real question here about how much of this leaping to conclusions is about prominent people getting caught up in fast-spreading misinformation, or whether there's a deliberate political strategy. Should we one day learn Boelter was indeed a MAGA supporter who targeted Democrats for political reasons, the seeds of doubt about that conclusion will have been planted and fertilized on the right at a crucial, very early stage. And there is evidence that Americans are viewing these incidents more through the lens of politics. When then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, a Democrat from Arizona, was shot in 2011, 71% of people in an NBC News poll said the attack was mostly about a “disturbed person” rather than political “rhetoric.” But the total picture is one of a country that instantly searches for political answers. And at this moment, one side of the aisle is particularly anxious to provide them – no matter how true they are.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kyiv on June 13 expressed concern over the security situation in the Middle East after Israeli air strikes against Iran, but stressed that Tehran remains a "source of problems" in the region "and beyond." The statement follows what Israel called a "preemptive" strike against Iran overnight on June 13, targeting the country's nuclear program and reportedly killing top military officials. "We would like to remind you that the Iranian regime supports Russia in its illegal war of aggression against Ukraine and provides Moscow with weapons to kill Ukrainians," the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Along with North Korea, Iran has been a key ally to Russia during its full-scale war against Ukraine, providing thousands of Shahed strike drones and short-range ballistic missiles. Kyiv nevertheless also warned that further hostilities could destabilize the region with "negative consequences for international security and global financial stability, especially in oil markets." Israeli strikes were quickly followed by a surge in oil prices, Russia's key export commodity, with Brent and Nymex crude prices jumping by more than 10%. Iran has pledged a response to Israeli air strikes and accused the United States of "also being responsible for the dangerous consequences of this reckless escalation." The attacks took place amid escalating tensions in the Middle East and U.S. President Donald Trump's push to find a diplomatic solution to Iran's nuclear aspirations. A round of indirect U.S.-Iranian negotiations in Oman was scheduled for June 15. Russia has condemned Israel's attacks as "unprovoked aggression" and a violation of the U.N. Charter.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Warning against “another endless conflict” in the Middle East, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine on Monday introduced a war powers resolution aimed at preventing President Donald Trump from attacking Iran without congressional debate and authorization. Given its status as a privileged resolution, the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate will be forced to swiftly consider and vote on the measure, which would require “any hostilities with Iran” to be “explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force.” “It is not in our national security interest to get into a war with Iran unless that war is absolutely necessary to defend the United States,” Kaine said in a statement. “This resolution will ensure that if we decide to place our nation's men and women in uniform into harm's way, we will have a debate and vote on it in Congress.” Erik Sperling, executive director of Just Foreign Policy, welcomed the Democratic senator's resolution, writing on social media that “American voters can thank Tim Kaine for forcing every Senator to have to choose a side: diplomacy or more endless war.” The Israeli government, led by far-right Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is reportedly urging Trump to wade into the war to help Israel destroy Iran's nuclear energy infrastructure. “Israel doesn't need U.S. taxpayers' money for defense if it already has enough to start offensive wars,” Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) wrote on social media last Friday. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) said in a statement after Israel launched its illegal attack on Iran that “the president cannot circumvent congressional war powers and unilaterally send U.S. troops to war with Iran.” In 2020, Kaine led a virtually identical Iran war powers resolution that passed both the House and Senate with bipartisan support. “A key question is how many Senate Dems will still oppose unauthorized U.S. war on Iran, and how many will betray Americans and support Netanyahu,” Just Foreign Policy said Monday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The now-former ABC News correspondent sat down for a pair of interviews on Monday, speaking out for the first time about losing his job at the network after he posted a social media missive last week against President Donald Trump and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. “I don't think you should ever regret telling the truth. And I don't,” Moran told The New York Times. He echoed that sentiment during a live-streamed interview with The Bulwark's Tim Miller. Moran, who interviewed Trump in the Oval Office in late April, wrote in the now-deleted X post that Miller, a “world-class hater,” is “richly endowed with the capacity for hatred” and that “hatreds are his spiritual nourishment.” The post shocked Moran's own ABC News colleagues and drew public outrage from White House officials, including Miller, Vice President JD Vance and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. The network initially suspended Moran and, two days later, announced it would not renew his contract. Moran, 65, a long-time news correspondent for ABC who has never been one to publicly share his opinions, styled himself as a “proud centrist” in his interview with The Bulwark. “I used very strong language deliberately,” he told The Bulwark, admitting the post was “very hot” but nevertheless “accurate and true.” Regarding his ABC ouster, Moran told the Bulwark, “From my perspective, it looked like a business decision. In his Times interview, Moran pushed back against the ABC News framing that he was let go ahead of his contract's expiration, instead alleging the outlet was “bailing” on an “oral agreement” to renew his contract for three years. ABC News did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Related article ABC News drops Terry Moran over late-night post attacking Trump and Stephen Miller Moran also resisted the notion that journalists should strive to be objective. He told The Bulwark that “there is no Mount Olympus of objectivity where a mandarin class of wise people have no feelings about their society.” “What you have to be is fair and accurate,” Moran said. Shortly after being dropped by ABC News, Moran launched a Substack newsletter, joining the growing ranks of TV news stars going independent with their reporting and analysis. Moran seemed assured in his move, telling the Bulwark, a fellow Substack-hosted publication, “We are free to speak our minds here.” US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The government is using “transparent delay tactics” to continue detaining Khalil, his legal team said. If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation. A federal judge has refused to order pro-Palestine activist Mahmoud Khalil's release after a last-minute response from Trump administration officials arguing for his continued imprisonment based on “false and pretextual allegations,” the activists' legal team has said. U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz in New Jersey sided with the government's argument that it can continue holding Khalil based on a charge that Khalil committed fraud when he applied for his green card. The same judge, however, in an order last week had acknowledged that it would be a stretch for the government to apply this charge to his detainment. Khalil and his legal team had been hoping that the activist would be released on Friday after Farbiarz had said that the government couldn't hold him on their primary charge. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. Last week, Farbiarz ruled that the government cannot hold Khalil based on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's claims that Khalil's continued presence in the U.S. threatens U.S. foreign policy interests. The government failed to appeal on time, and Khalil's legal team submitted a letter asking for his immediate release. Khalil's lawyers have slammed the decision, saying that his detention is “arbitrary” and that the green card application allegations are “false and pretextual,” meaning that they were effectively put forth to justify Khalil's detainment separately from the government's primary charges against him. Indeed, when the administration was initially pressed for their reasoning for seeking Khalil's detention and deportation in April, the administration only provided a two-page memo from Rubio citing his beliefs — and admitting that Khalil's participation in Columbia University student protests were “otherwise lawful.” The government is now using cruel, transparent delay tactics to keep him away from his wife and newborn son ahead of their first Father's Day as a family,” said Amy Greer, one of Khalil's lawyers, in a statement. “Deen, my love for you is deeper than anything I have ever known,” Khalil went on. “Loving you is not separate from the struggle for liberation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When John Denton first visited Ukraine weeks into Russia's full-scale invasion, he knew that for the country to survive, businesses needed to stay alive. Active in 170 countries, the organization enables $17.5 trillion worth of economic activity every year, accounting for 22% of the world's gross domestic product (GDP).Denton has been a vocal supporter of Ukraine's businesses and the country's economic recovery, which is crawling back from the massive 29.1% fall in 2022. The International Chamber of Commerce will attend the upcoming Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC) in Rome on July 10-11, alongside governments and major players in the global private sector. In a sit-down interview at the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) on June 12, Denton told the Kyiv Independent how the International Chamber of Commerce has supported businesses in Ukraine, how investors can mitigate risks, and why doing business in Ukraine is worth it despite the wartime challenges. “There needs to be a more nuanced understanding of risk in Ukraine. It helps people understand that there are investable opportunities,” Denton said. The International Chamber of Commerce has been active in supporting Ukraine's economic front in partnership with the Ukrainian Chambers of Commerce. This includes the Center of Entrepreneurship, which supports small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) as well as refugees. Denton believes Ukraine's recovery needs a strong private sector and access to global markets. To help build up trust and encourage foreign investors, he announced that the International Chamber of Commerce will cut arbitration costs for foreign investors involved in reconstruction-related disputes in Ukraine during his last trip to Ukraine in November 2024. What is your current assessment of Ukraine's business climate? I drove from Warsaw through western Ukraine, and you can sense that there's a level of vibrancy in the economy there. At the same time, people are there, paying taxes, keeping businesses running, even in complex places. One dimension is just keeping tax flows moving and businesses running. It's devastating if you have a collapsed economy plus military challenges. The Kyiv Independent: What would you say to investors who are standing by on the sidelines, waiting for the war to end before putting their money into Ukraine? John Denton: They've got to make commercial decisions in the best interests. Existing businesses here tend to understand that a little better. They're reinvesting in the economy, and those investments are often very successful. That's going to be one of the challenges. There's a lot more that can be done to facilitate de-risking. We can help export agencies understand that their participation is really important to allow companies to close deals here. Some of them can only provide coverage up to 97%. At the URC, we're helping export agencies understand this and problem solve risk coverage. Kyiv Independent: What are the barriers to foreign and domestic investment in Ukraine, and how are you helping break those down? It inhibits one's decision-making, but it doesn't mean you don't make the decision.The other is that there are issues with the application of the rule of law here. We've come up with a solution which I know the Ukrainian government is very happy with – if people are worried that that's an inhibitor, we will use the International Chamber of Commerce Court of Arbitration. You can be 100% sure of the independence. The other thing is, do we actually have clear investment frameworks? Do you want to attract investment only into the most complex areas of Ukraine, or are you neutral as to where it is? There is a risk of mixed messages.I think the government and the private sector here are working on all those areas. Kyiv Independent: Have we seen any results yet from the decreased arbitration costs? John Denton: It's too early to tell. There's certainly a lot of interest in it. It's creating an ecosystem of confidence around settling disputes. Kyiv Independent: The Ukraine Recovery Conference is taking place in Rome next month. And that's why we're involved.There is a particular challenge with export finance that needs to be thought through. We will be using the URC as a great convening space to do that. The other is more broadly around identifying the inhibitors to private sector engagement in this process and coming up with a roadmap to actually remove those barriers.The URC creates space for these discussions. To rebuild on a broken system is much harder than if we have a functioning private sector and economy now. Hi, it's Dominic, thank you for reading this story. Investment and the role of the private sector in rebuilding Ukraine is going to be a hot topic at the upcoming Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome this July.

After her performance Hernández posted a video to TikTok, with the caption “Watch the Dodgers tell me I can't sing the Spanish Star Spangled Banner that Roosevelt literally commissioned in 1945 – so I did it anyway.” The video shows an apparent conversation with the Dodgers staff member. “We are going to do the song in English today, so I don't know if that wasn't translated – er, communicated,” the employee says. She explained her decision in another social media video. “I didn't think I would be met with any sort of ‘No,' especially because we're in LA with everything happening,” said Hernández whose parents are from the Dominican Republic. I just could not believe, when she walked in and told me ‘No,' but I just felt like I needed to do it, para mi gente [for my people]. They've been citizens my whole life at this point, they got documented really early, but I just can't imagine them being ripped away from me, even at this age, let alone a little kid.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oil producer MEG Energy Corp. MEG-T on Monday urged its shareholders to reject a nearly $6-billion hostile takeover offer from Strathcona Resources Ltd. SCR-T, calling the bid inadequate and not in their best interest. The board also launched a strategic review to explore alternatives that could lead to a better offer than MEG's current plan to be a standalone company. In May, oil and gas producer Strathcona Resources said it planned to launch a hostile takeover bid for MEG Energy, valuing its rival's stock at $23.27 per share. Later, MEG advised its shareholders to not take action on the unsolicited takeover bid. Since 2020, Strathcona, owned by Calgary-based private equity firm Waterous Energy Fund, has become one of the fastest-growing oil companies in North America through a series of acquisitions. If the takeover were to go through, WEF would own 51-per-cent stake in the combined company, making it a vehicle for WEF and its investors to sell their material ownership over time, MEG Energy said. “This selling pressure, or even the perceived risk of such selling pressure, will place immediate and significant downward burden on the share price of the combined company for a prolonged period of time,” the company said in a statement. Strathcona Resources did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Concerns raised that section 899 could backfire and also undermine dollar's safe haven status Foreign investment into the US could be threatened by Donald Trump's new “revenge” taxes, analysts have warned. A provision within the president's One Big Beautiful Bill Act will allow the US to apply higher taxes on foreign individuals, businesses and investors connected to jurisdictions that impose “unfair foreign taxes” on US individuals and companies. Max Yoeli, a senior research fellow in the US and the Americas programme at Chatham House, says section 899 “threatens to further alienate foreign investors”. The Italian bank UniCredit agrees that section 899 could further damage foreign investor sentiment towards US dollar-denominated assets. “The list of countries that would fall into this category is long and encompasses most European countries, including Italy and Germany,” UniCredit told clients, saying that foreign investors had more than doubled their holdings of US assets over the past decade. “Not only would this additional tax serve to finance corporate tax reductions, but it would also likely be used as a negotiating tool for the US in trade deals, especially as Republicans seem willing to withdraw from the global minimum tax framework.” UniCredit also fears the dollar's safe haven status could be undermined if there are fresh tax disputes between the US and other countries. George Saravelos, the global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, warned last month that section 899 could allow the US administration to transform its trade war into a capital war by “explicitly using taxation on foreign holdings of US assets as leverage to further US economic goals”. However, as companies that are majority-owned by US shareholders are exempt, City bosses may consider moving their stock market listing to New York, to dodge section 899. “This ownership dynamic not only mitigates tax risk but also reinforces the strategic case for relisting in the US, where investor bases are deeper and more aligned with US revenue exposure,” the Goldman Sachs analysts said. Ashtead Group, Compass and Melrose also generate a large proportion of their sales stateside, but as they have majority US ownership they should be exempt from section 899. French companies could also be at risk, as Paris operates a digital services tax on the revenues that large tech companies generate in France.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MOSCOW, June 16. A reaction from the international community regarding Israel's attack on Iran that divided the global response into two camps was "a good lesson for everyone," Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday. "We have certainly paid attention to this, and continue monitoring the situation in this regard," Peskov said at a news briefing in response to a question whether the Kremlin had noticed that the incident did not entail any sanctions against Israel and that only limited condemnation was voiced on behalf of the international community. "We see that the international community in general is now split in terms of its assessments of the current developments into the camp of those who condemned the beginning of what is happening, and those who supported and tried to justify it," he continued. "This is our statement. This is definitely a very good lesson for everyone," Peskov added. Overnight into June 13, Israel kicked off Operation Rising Lion aimed against Iran's nuclear program. The Israel Defense Forces said that 200 fighter jets attacked more than 100 targets in Iran, including nuclear facilities. On the evening of June 13, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps announced that Iran retaliated by attacking dozens of targets in Israel with missiles, including military facilities and air bases, striking, in particular, the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv. Israel said some targets were hit but most of the missiles were intercepted.</p>

It takes one phone call from Washington to muzzle someone like Netanyahu. That may pave the way for a return to diplomacy.” Iran fired a new wave of missile attacks on Israel early Monday, killing at least eight people, while Israel said it had gained 'aerial superiority' over Iran's capital. “We are on the path to victory,” he said. An Iranian state television reporter had to stop a live broadcast Monday when an explosion occurred an hour after Israel issued a warning to evacuate the area of Tehran where the TV studios are located. Anchor Sahar Emami rushed off-camera as the screen behind her cut out, and people were heard saying “Allahu akbar,” the Arabic phrase for God is great. Israel's defense minister took credit for the attack. An hour earlier, the Israeli military had issued an evacuation warning affecting up to 330,000 people in a part of central Tehran that includes the country's state TV and police headquarters, as well as three large hospitals.

Iran says more than 224 Iranians have been killed, most of them civilians. State TV broadcast scenes of collapsed presidential buildings, burned-out cars, and shattered streets in Tehran.

Trump has consistently said that the Israeli assault could end quickly if Iran agrees to U.S. demands that it accept strict curbs to its nuclear program. Talks between the United States and Iran, hosted by Oman, had been scheduled for Sunday but were scrapped, with Tehran saying it could not negotiate while under attack. On Monday, Iranian lawmakers floated the idea of quitting the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, a move bound to be seen as a setback for any negotiations.

Iran's Revolutionary Guards said the latest attack employed a new method that caused Israel's multi-layered defence systems to target each other so missiles could get through.

Iran's network of regional allies who could once have been expected to rain rockets on Israel – Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon – have been decimated by Israeli forces since the start of the Gaza war. Netanyahu has said that, while toppling the Iranian government is not Israel's primary aim, it believes that could be the outcome. Iran's currency has lost at least 10 per cent of its value against the U.S. dollar since the start of Israel's attack.

TEHRAN, June 16. /TASS/. At least ten Iranian air defense personnel were killed while repelling Israeli strikes in the northwestern city of Urmia, the YJC news agency reported.

According to its information, the deceased were serving in the third division of the air defense forces, stationed in the province of West Azerbaijan.

Overnight into June 13, Israel kicked off Operation Rising Lion aimed against Iran's nuclear program. Less than 24 hours later, Iran launched a retaliatory attack. In the following days, Tel Aviv and Tehran exchanged strikes again. Both sides reported casualties resulting from these attacks and acknowledged hits on several targets within their territories, though they claimed the damage was limited.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Dubbed Operation Rising Lion, this sophisticated and multilayered campaign followed days of speculation about an impending assault. Israelis, meanwhile, have found themselves rushing to shelters as their own cities come under attack. Right now, there is no indication that the fighting will stop. Both Iran and Israel have signaled that they are willing to keep striking each other. Israel's defense minister even promised that “Tehran will burn” if the attacks don't end. Instead, U.S. President Donald Trump has sent mixed signals about whether he wants the fighting to cease. His administration has positioned military assets in the area, and according to multiple news reports, U.S. forces are helping Israel shoot down Iranian drones and missiles. Despite his equivocations, however, Trump has said he still wants to reach a nuclear deal with Iran, and Tehran has left the door open to talks—provided that Israel lets up. The U.S. administration, then, may still have space to forge an agreement. If Trump wants to avoid a U.S. war with Iran, he should seize it. So far, Israel has inflicted significant but not total damage on Iran's nuclear program. Even then, to truly assure that the threat has been curtailed, the United States would need either a presence on the ground or sustained rounds of military strikes carried out with exhaustive knowledge of Iran's nuclear operations. In fact, it may be the only way to avert an unacceptable outcome. Israel has made clear its preference for a military solution, however, unless Iran completely capitulates over the program. Tehran's defensive capabilities did not recover after a series of pinpoint strikes that Israel carried out last October. Iran's proxies, including Hezbollah, are still on their knees after months of Israeli attacks. The Israeli government thus saw a golden opportunity to debilitate its nemesis. Israel's current campaign against Iran is far broader than its previous ones. Approximately 200 Israeli aircraft targeted around 100 sites, including nuclear facilities and military bases, in the initial wave of strikes last week. As the exchanges between the two countries have grown more severe, and Iran has retaliated with drones and missiles, both sides have broadened their targets. Given the breadth of Israel's assault, Iranian leaders likely concluded that Israel wants to wipe out not just their nuclear program but also their regime itself. Although Iran lacks the capabilities of its enemy—its intelligence is no match for Israel's, and its airpower is nonexistent—Tehran felt it had no choice but to retaliate as forcefully as possible. So far, at least in the opening days, this has largely been confined to a bilateral conflict. But if the war expands, Iran and the United States might find themselves fighting directly, especially if American assets and interests come under fire. In repeated statements, U.S. officials have warned Tehran against such attacks, lest American forces, in the words of Trump, “come down on you at levels never seen before.” Should Iranian attacks or attacks by Iran's nonstate partners lead to American casualties, the pressure on the U.S. president to act decisively and enter the war would increase dramatically. Israeli military operations over the past year have logged successes against Hezbollah and against Iran itself, degrading many of its enemies' air defenses. And depending on how Iran has structured its program, stopping a bomb may require no less than a toppling of the Islamic Republic. That is why Israeli officials are more explicitly sounding the call for regime change. Yet they have paid little heed to what would actually replace the current system. For an American president who has sought to position himself as a peacemaker rather than a belligerent, the present situation ought to be ringing loud alarm bells. Many of Trump's constituents oppose renewed U.S. military involvement in the Middle East. A massive war would also cause oil prices to spike, further burdening American consumers struggling with inflation. But an all-or-nothing offer from the United States is unlikely to resonate with a regime that has rejected such terms for more than two decades—including in five rounds of negotiations with Trump's administration. The only thing Iranian leaders view as more perilous for their self-preservation than the suffering wreaked by Israeli bombs is surrendering to American terms. Instead, the current onslaught will probably prompt Iran to keep responding with aggression until it can have at least a semblance of an acceptable off-ramp. He must first persuade Iran that he is not just a front for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by pressing Israel to stop fighting. This is the most crucial source of leverage that Washington has; it would be extremely difficult for Israel to carry out military campaigns without it. Previous U.S. presidents, including Joe Biden, have been reluctant to use it. But now, American lives and Trump's legacy may be at stake. More important, it needs to save face.The White House should warn Tehran that further escalation could result in American casualties and suck the United States into the conflict. Yet it should also offer Iran a reasonable nuclear deal that includes significant and sustainable sanctions relief. Trump could, for example, promise to roll back nuclear-related U.S. sanctions and end the primary U.S. trade embargo if Iran wraps its uranium enrichment program into a multinational consortium with Saudi Arabia for that purpose—as Tehran expressed an openness to doing before Israel's attacks. Such a consortium would provide fuel for nuclear reactors across the region while depriving Iran of the fissile material it could use for a weapon. There is precedent for this kind of American pressure. In 1982, U.S. President Ronald Reagan twisted Israel's arm to end its bombing of Beirut. Such a course will not be easy for Trump. It would require the president to commit to difficult diplomacy while staring down fierce opposition in Washington from politicians and interest groups who see Israel's campaign as an overdue comeuppance for one of the United States' most bitter adversaries. Without a deal, Iran's frightened government seems more likely than not to sprint for nuclear weapons as conditions allow. Then Trump would have to either accept a nuclear Iran or join another Israeli assault on the country, risking precisely the kind of catastrophic Middle East entanglement he promised to avoid.

Rural landowners say America's farms have become dumping grounds for sludge from the wastewater treatment plants of larger cities. They complain of foul odors, contaminated soil, health problems, and stormwater runoff contaminating streams, lakes, and groundwater with possibly dangerous chemicals.

The treated sewage sludge—known as “biosolids”— is the solid matter left from the wastewater treatment process. The sludge is removed from the bottom of the sewage plant tanks then treated to reduce pathogens for use as a soil amendment or fertilizer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The intelligence chief of Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has been killed in an Israeli strike. Brigadier General Mohammad Kazemi, head of the IRGC's Intelligence Organization, was assassinated along with two other intelligence officers, Hassan Mohaghdeh and Mohsen Bagheri, the Guards confirmed in a statement on Sunday evening. The IRGC said it responded by launching missiles at Israeli “intelligence centers” as part of the third wave of its ongoing barrage, dubbed Operation True Promise III. The killing of Kazemi was first announced by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in an interview with Fox News on Sunday. “I think we've set them back quite a bit,” Netanyahu told journalist Bret Baier. Open hostilities erupted on Friday morning when IDF jets bombed military and nuclear sites across Iran in what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described as an operation to prevent the Islamic Republic from acquiring nuclear weapons. Tehran responded with a barrage of missiles, some of which struck residential areas in Tel Aviv and Bat Yam. Israel also carried out targeted assassinations of senior Iranian commanders and veteran nuclear scientists after reportedly smuggling kamikaze drones into the country. Iranian security officials said they discovered Israeli drones and explosives hidden in Tehran following the attacks. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>
