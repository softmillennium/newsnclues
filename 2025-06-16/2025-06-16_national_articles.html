Milwaukee Bucks head coach Doc Rivers spoke up about what Democrats need to do in order to take back the White House after President Donald Trump defeated Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. Rivers, who is a staunch opponent of Trump going back to the president's first term in office, said Democrats need to make a change and try to get everyone on the same side of issues. "Well, the first thing we have to point towards is getting out of our comfort zone and thinking if we keep doing the same thing we are going to get different results," Rivers told MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace on her podcast. "That doesn't happen, there needs to be change from the Democratic side. I don't know what that change is, but I know the norm has not worked. "We are a party of being [inclusive], everybody is included, right? But I remember Cory Booker, we are at a function, and I ask him why can't the Democrats all agree on something, because the Republicans do that well. You have to look at some of the things they do well. If you listen to some of the things these guys said about Trump and then when you hear them speak now, all they do is praise, they are falling in line. He said we have so many groups on our side, we don't just have the White male. Rivers said one of the things Democrats need to get away from is the "Trump won because" debate. He made an analogy to how he would go about coaching a game if the team was coming off a loss. Milwaukee Bucks head coach Doc Rivers (Stephen Lew-Imagn Images) Trump won and start there, not ‘because.' You have to take ownership of things. We do it in sports all the time," he told Wallace. "Yeah, I come in after a game we lost ‘because.' We can't just say we lost because ‘they just made a lot of shots.' It is so strange we are blaming the people who voted for Trump for why he won. It makes no sense to me. Rivers said the bottom line was the Democrats didn't get enough people to actually go out and vote. "We didn't get enough people out to vote," he said. We have to figure out, first start with ourselves, how can we ignite ourselves, our side to vote more, because we have more people to vote. Milwaukee Bucks head coach Doc Rivers (Benny Sieu-Imagn Images) You know, the majority of Black men did vote for Kamala, as it turns out. There is a feel of hopelessness in our community. I think a lot of Black men are saying now it does not matter, either side, we are not being helped, we are still being incarcerated. So there has got to be an answer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Speaker Destin Hall, R-Caldwell, spoke about the acts by Wake County Democratic Rep. Julie von Haefen in a statement Sunday evening. “Her disgraceful behavior fails to meet the standards expected from House members and sets a dangerous precedent in an already volatile political climate,” Hall said in part. “I am examining next steps with our legislative attorneys to ensure this behavior does not continue.” Increasing calls for her resignation followed, including the House speaker's statement about three hours later. Using his personal account and not that tied to his U.S. Senate seat, Republican Utah Sen. Mike Lee said, “Calling for the president of the United States to be beheaded is un-democratic. The post by von Haefen was made Saturday morning. “Deleting your public profile isn't accountability – it's hiding,” said state Rep. Brenden Jones, R-Columbus. On social media, von Haefen is accused of posting an image of a woman holding signage with the image of a bloody, used guillotine; the words “In these difficult times, some cuts may be necessary”; and a prop on one end of the handle representing a beheaded Trump. Minutes after The Center Square sought authentication from her office, she posted to Facebook, “Yesterday, I posted a video on social media containing crowd photos from the No Kings protest in Raleigh. “Let me be clear: I condemn political violence in all forms. My focus remains on bringing people together and fighting for the values that matter to North Carolinians. Like so many, I was horrified by the violence in Minnesota. Her caption on Saturday morning said, “No Kings Protest in Raleigh. Amazing turnout all across the Triangle today, including this event at the Capitol hosted by Wake Democrats and North Carolina Democrats.” There were hashtags for an expletive, no kings and Raleigh. Some was on von Haefen's act itself, others said it was the timing of the shootings in Minnesota which took the lives of a state representative and her husband, and injured a state senator and his wife. State Rep. Mike Schietzelt, R-Wake, called von Haefen's actions “unconscionable.” Trump survived an assassination attempt on July 13 of last year in Butler, Pa. On Sept. 15, he was golfing in Florida when a man with a rifle was found hiding adjacent to the property in what many believe was to be a second attempt on his life.</p>

Nezza, whose full name is Vanessa Hernández, went on TikTok after the game, clipping together videos of a Dodgers representative telling her the song would be sung in English and her performing the anthem in Spanish. “Watch the Dodgers tell me I can't sing the Spanish ‘Star Spangled Banner' that Roosevelt literally commissioned in 1945,” showing her smile fading as the representative tells her, “We are going to be singing it in English today. I don't know if that was communicated.” She got emotional and said that she could not sing it in English that day, “out of all days,” referring to the anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement riots that started in Los Angeles and the No Kings protests taking place nationwide. i love you guys stay safe out there She ended the video by saying, “Safe to say I am never allowed in that stadium ever again.” However, a team official told the Los Angeles Times there were no consequences being perpetrated and that she is welcome back at the stadium. Nezza explained in her TikTok video that her parents are immigrants and longtime American citizens who, she said, she can't imagine being taken from her. Manager Dave Roberts said on Friday that he hasn't “dug enough and can't speak intelligently on it” but added last Monday that he hopes they are a “positive distraction” right now.Nezza is not the first singer to face backlash in performing the national anthem.

Kīlauea Volcano in Hawaii experienced dramatic lava fountaining over the weekend, with eruptions reaching 1,000 feet. A tourist is lucky to be alive after plunging nearly 30 feet off a cliff and toward an erupting volcano while visiting a popular Hawaiian hot spot last week. In an attempt to get a better view of the Kīlauea volcanic eruption, the 30-year-old man from Boston wandered from the park's Byron Ledge Trail, but "got too close to the sheer cliff edge" on Wednesday, according to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Luckily, a tree broke the man's fall, saving him from plunging "another hundred feet or so to the caldera floor, which could have resulted in his death." Search and rescue teams that were already in the area to manage traffic began searching for the man at approximately 9 p.m., after receiving reports that an individual had plunged 30 feet below the cliff. The man – who was not carrying a flashlight or headlamp – was pulled to safety in a high-angle rescue by officials rappelling down the cliff and only suffered minor facial injuries, according to the park. Kīlauea began its latest activity in December 2024, "with eruptions separated by pauses lasting several days or more," Hawaii's National Park Service said. The incident comes after the park previously warned visitors to remain vigilant after a small child nearly plummeted into the active volcano just days after it began erupting. People watch as Hawaii's Kilauea Volcano erupts for the 21st time on May 11, 2025, in Kailua Kona, Hawaii. "A toddler wandered off from his family and in a split second, ran straight toward the 400-foot cliff edge," the park said in a press release. "His mother, screaming, managed to grab him in the nick of time just a foot or so away from a fatal fall. Disaster was averted, and the shaken family departed." In addition to spewing hot lava, the volcano can also emit toxic gasses and "glassy volcanic particulates," called tephra, making close encounters with the natural phenomenon highly dangerous.

"The hazards that coincide with an eruption are dangerous, and we have safety measures in place including closed areas, barriers, closure signs, and traffic management," Park Superintendent Rhonda Loh previously said in a statement. "Your safety is our utmost concern, but we rely on everyone to recreate responsibility. National parks showcase nature's splendor but they are not playgrounds." The National Park Service did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. You can follow her at @juliabonavita13 on all platforms and send story tips to julia.bonavita@fox.com.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump called for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to expand deportation efforts in Democratic cities and “do all in their power” to achieve mass deportations in a social media post Sunday. “ICE Officers are herewith ordered, by notice of this TRUTH, to do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History,” the president posted on Truth Social as he traveled on Air Force One to Canada for the G7 summit. The president's post comes as CNN has reported that ICE has been racing to meet White House arrest quotas and on the heels of Trump acknowledging that his immigration policies have impacted farmworkers and those in the hospitality industry. But while the Trump administration has publicly touted its enforcement efforts, officials have privately faced criticism for failing to meet that quota, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions. Trump also directed ICE in his social media post on Sunday to “expand efforts” in “the Democrat Power Center” while claiming without evidence that his political opponents are using “Illegal Aliens” to “cheat in Elections, and grow the Welfare State.” “We must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America's largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside,” Trump said. As long as quotas remain in place, ICE will likely have to ramp up arrests in communities, particularly if guardrails are set up around certain workplaces, according to multiple sources familiar with discussions. “We will follow the President's direction and continue to work to get the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens off of America's streets,” Homeland Security Department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN. An anticipated months long immigration enforcement operation has already been underway targeting around two dozen Democratic-led cities, according to a source familiar with the planning. Agents from various federal agencies, including from US Customs and Border Protection, have been assigned to fan out to those cities as the administration pushes to increase interior arrests, the source said. We've increased targeting, so we expect those numbers to increase,” White House border czar Tom Homan previously told CNN, referring to migrant arrests. Related article Less than 10% of immigrants taken into ICE custody since October had serious criminal convictions, internal data shows The administration's immigration crackdown sparked protests in Los Angeles earlier this month, which prompted the president to mobilize both National Guard troops and Marines to deal with demonstrations over federal raids in the city. Since Trump took office, ICE, which had previously been operating with a set of guidelines focused on public safety and national security threats, has had to pivot as the key agency at the core of the president's campaign promise to carry out mass deportations. Immigration-enforcement operations have created a chilling effect on some industries heavily reliant on immigrant workforces, including farms and hotels, and as ICE races to fulfill Trump's goal to increase deportations. The president appeared to acknowledge Thursday that his immigration policies are straining those sectors. “Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,” Trump said on Truth Social.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran's state-run news agency said Monday that its governmental television station abruptly stopped a live broadcast after an Israeli strike. Afterwards, a fire could be seen at the state TV building. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Israeli strikes have set Iran's nuclear program back a “very, very long time.” He added that Israel is not attempting to topple the Iranian government, but said he would not be surprised if that happened as a result of the strikes. “The regime is very weak,” Netanyahu said at a news conference. As he spoke, large numbers of explosions were heard in Tehran. He described Iran's air defenses as a “hodgepodge” of Russian, Chinese, Iranian and outdated American systems. Russia, once a key supplier, is unlikely to sell Iran more systems amid its war in Ukraine and because Moscow doesn't want to hurt its “working relationship” with Israel, Hinz said. Any Russian air defense deliveries to Iran would likely be attacked by Israel, he said, and wouldn't offer an immediate fix because training and setup take time. China has sold Iran short-range air defense systems, anti-drone lasers, and missile-related chemicals in the past, he said. But future sales are uncertain, since Beijing may be unwilling to risk diplomatic fallout with the West or Israel. Iran has few viable options for striking back at Israel, largely because its key regional proxy Hezbollah has been “decapitated,” according to Fabian Hinz of the International Institute of Strategic Studies. The Houthi rebels in Yemen, another of Iran's allies, depend on long-range Iranian missiles but supplies are limited, Hinz said. Following the attack, live programs have been transferred to another studio that resembles those used for radio broadcasts. Iran's state-run news agency said Monday that its governmental television station abruptly stopped a live broadcast after an Israeli strike. Afterwards, a fire could be seen at the state TV building. It started when British Prime Minister Keir Starmer bumped into German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in a restaurant-bar area of the venue in the resort of Kananaskis. The images captured Saturday by Planet Labs PBC show multiple buildings damaged or destroyed.

U.N. nuclear chief Rafael Grossi has said Iran's main underground enrichment site at Natanz was untouched by Israeli strikes. U.N. atomic energy chief Rafael Mariano Grossi speaks to Associated Press before visiting Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant during an interview in Dnipro, Ukraine, on March 28, 2023. The main centrifuge facility underground didn't appear to be hit, but the loss of power could have damaged infrastructure there, he said. Grossi said Monday that radiation levels outside the complex are presently normal. Journalists at the United Nations are pressing Israel's ambassador on why Iran's state television was attacked. His reply: “Whoever is cooperating with this terror regime should be considering steps,” adding that Israel now has “very good control over the skies of Tehran.” Ambassador Danny Dannon sidestepped questions about U.N. nuclear chief Rafael Grossi's claim that Iran's underground Natanz facility was untouched by Israeli strikes, but said Israel had “pushed back the nuclear program” and stressed the current operation is more complex than past strikes on reactors in Iraq or Syria. As for peace talks, Danon said Iran must prove it's serious about dismantling its “machine of terror” before Israel would engage. A significant number of explosions have been ringing out in Tehran for minutes on end. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during a press conference in Jerusalem, May 21, 2025. Netanyahu added that Israel was not attempting to topple the Iranian government, but said he would not be surprised if that happened as a result of the strikes. Netanyahu also said he is in daily touch with U.S. President Donald Trump. Roughly 24 hours before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu launched a blistering assault on Iran, Israel's opposition was scheming to bring down his government. It's a sharp about-face for a constellation of parties that have criticized Netanyahu throughout the war for what they have charged is his politically motivated decision-making. The website for Iranian state TV, iribnews.ir, which was targeted by an Israeli strike hours ago, is currently inaccessible. Still, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his country's ongoing strikes on Iran could result in the government's overthrow, and on Friday urged Iranians to rise up against their leaders. Anchor Sahar Emami came back on-air from another studio soon after rushing off-camera when Israel struck the state-run Iranian TV station. Human rights groups say deliberately targeting journalists is a war crime. “The world is watching: targeting Iran's news agency #IRIB‘s office during live broadcast is a wicked act of war crime,” Esmaeil Baqaei wrote on X. Throughout the war in Gaza, Israel has struck hospitals, U.N. facilities and schools, accusing Palestinian militants of operating from within civilian infrastructure, often without providing visual evidence. Firefighters tried to extinguish the fire and rescue them, but were too late. In this photo released by the Lebanese Presidency press office, Lebanese president Joseph Aoun, right, shakes hands with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Baabda, east of Beirut, Lebanon, Tuesday, June 3, 2025. Lebanon's president and prime minister say any engagement would be detrimental to the small nation, which is already engulfed in an economic crisis and struggling to recover from the latest war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Hezbollah, funded and armed by Iran, has long been considered Tehran's most powerful ally in the region but its latest war with Israel also saw much of Hezbollah's political and military leadership killed in Israeli airstrikes. Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul says Iran must make a “credible renunciation” of any military use of nuclear technology in order to bring its conflict with Israel to an end. Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul speaks with the media as he arrives for a meeting of EU foreign ministers at the European Council building in Brussels, Belgium, Tuesday, May 20, 2025. Wadephul said there's no justification for Iran to enrich uranium to such high levels for civilian use, as the international nuclear watchdog agency IAEA recently confirmed. He added that Iran would be further marginalized if it withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and urged Tehran to “refrain from such ideas.” The refueling tankers are vital to supporting any major U.S. air operation, whether it would be evacuations or a potential strike by U.S. fighter jets. “About a week or 10 days ago, there would be between three and five people (Iranians) who would come for shopping or tourism,” said bus driver Ferit Aktas. “But now, I can say, that there are at least 30 Iranians in my vehicle per day.” Shirin Talebi, who crossed with her family, said they are planning to stay for a month or two in Turkey. “Hopefully, it is over in one or two months so we can return to our country,” she said. Turkey, which shares a 569 kilometer-long (348 miles) border with Iran, has expressed deep concern over the escalating armed conflict, though Turkish officials have dismissed social media reports of a large-scale refugee influx. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney on the sidelines of the G7 Summit, Monday, June 16, 2025, in Kananaskis, Canada. “They should talk, and they should talk immediately,” Trump said during a bilateral meeting with the Canadian prime minister during the G7 summit. Trump added: “I'd say Iran is not winning this war.” In a post on X, the website formerly known as Twitter, Araghchi wrote that if Trump is “genuine about diplomacy and interested in stopping this war, next steps are consequential.” “It takes one phone call from Washington to muzzle someone like Netanyahu,” Iran's top diplomat continued. “That may pave the way for a return to diplomacy.” Suddenly, an explosion occurred, cutting out the screen behind her as she hurried off camera amid dust and debris wafting in the air, and sounds of “Allahu Akbar” (God is great) were heard from off-screen. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing operations. Britain's Labour Party Prime Minister Kier Starmer makes speech 10 Downing Street in London, Friday, July 5, 2024. Labour leader Stammer won the general election on July 4, and was appointed Prime Minster by King Charles III at Buckingham Palace, after the party won a landslide victory. As the conflict with Iran threatens to escalate, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday that “we're giving advice today to register their presence, so there will be a portal for that.” The online portal is expected to be up and running later Monday. Starmer said he'd spoken to President Donald Trump “and to pretty well all of the G7 leaders yesterday, and I do think there's a consensus for de-escalation. He spoke to reporters Monday at the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Alberta. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told reporters Monday ahead of the G7 summit in Canada that together with his European colleagues at the summit, Germany is planning to draw up a final communique proposal on the Israel-Iran conflict in which the European will stress that “Iran must under no circumstances be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons-capable material.” Merz rejected the idea that Russian President Vladimir Putin could be involved in mediating a diplomatic solution for the hostilities between Israel and Iran and said that instead “it would be good if Russia ended its war in Ukraine.” Smoke rises from an oil storage facility after it appeared to have been struck by an Israeli strike on Saturday, in Tehran, Iran, Monday, June 16, 2025. Israel's military issued the evacuation warning for a part of central Tehran that includes the country's state TV and police headquarters, as well as three large hospitals, including one owned by Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. U.S. stocks are rallying Monday, while oil prices are giving back some of their initial spurts following Israel's attack on Iran at the end of last week. The S&P 500 climbed 1.1% and was on track to reclaim nearly all of its drop from Friday. They joined a worldwide rise in stock prices, stretching from Asia to Europe. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and other Democrats speak to reporters about President Donald Trump's tariffs on foreign countries, at the Capitol, in Washington, Wednesday, April 2, 2025. Congress passed a similar resolution in 2020 during Trump's first term. “It is not in our national security interest to get into a war with Iran unless that war is absolutely necessary to defend the United States. I am deeply concerned that the recent escalation of hostilities between Israel and Iran could quickly pull the United States into another endless conflict,” Kaine said. The resolution requires that any hostilities with Iran must be explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force, but would not prevent the United States from defending itself from imminent attack. But the indirect talks between American and Iranian diplomats have hit a stalemate. Iran said last Thursday that it had built and would activate a third nuclear enrichment facility. The announcement came less than two weeks after the IAEA censured Iran for failing to comply with nonproliferation obligations meant to prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon. Russia will not likely come to Iran's aid, said Lina Khatib, a Middle East expert at the Chatham House think tank in London. She pointed out that Russia did not help Iran last year when Israel destroyed Russian-supplied air defenses or when Iran's ally, former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, was ousted.

Rescue team work at the site where a missile launched from Iran struck Tel Aviv, Israel, Monday, June 16, 2025. Israel's blistering attack with warplanes and drones against Iran's nuclear and military structure has sparked an open conflict between the two long-time foes that threatens to spiral into a wider, more dangerous regional war. Since Friday, Israeli strikes have killed more than 200 people in Iran, including top generals and scientists but also civilians. Iran has retaliated by launching hundreds of drones and missiles against Israel, some of which have penetrated Israel's vaunted aerial defense system, killing two dozen people so far. ▶ Read more about the now four-day-old conflict between Israel and Iran Israel said Monday it planned to strike military sites in the city.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Like maple syrup and lakeside lounging, an annual influx of Canadians tourists has long been a part of life for the border-hugging New York region known as “North Country.” But Kennedy, now vice president of marketing and business development for the North Country Chamber of Commerce, has seen (and heard) far fewer Canadian visitors in recent months, as travel has dipped amid international tensions. Reservations are down at hotels and campgrounds, she said; local marinas, which depend on Canadian boaters, have watched bookings slow. For the rural area, such losses could mean economic pain. “Our leisure travel market is about 70% Canadians — it's a very large part of what we do.” Business is down 30% this spring, said Paul Dame, owner of Bluff Point Golf Resort in Plattsburg, New York, in a recent interview with CBC, and pinned the “disheartening” decline on the political situation. New York business owners aren't alone in their concern about the tourism slowdown. On June 1, members of the North Country Chamber of Commerce launched a “Cross-Border Specials” campaign encouraging businesses to welcome Canadians by offering special pricing and perks. “Our partners were like, ‘Absolutely yes, let's make it affordable for those who still want to come,'” said Kennedy. The deals range from cheaper stays to free activities: At the boutique hotel Bluebird Lake Placid, Canadian residents get a 30% discount through the end of August, and Canadian players at Bluff Point Golf Resort get a free sleeve of Callaway Canada balls. In Plattsburg, New York, Adirondack ElliptiGO is giving away full-day rentals of their stand-up elliptical bicycles to anyone with a Canadian ID. He's partnering with the nearby Cabana Beach Bar, as well, with plans to give his Canadian visitors vouchers to use at the lakeside hangout. In neighboring Vermont, those working in northern communities echoed sentiments heard along the New York border, as well as their commitment to bringing Canadians back. “All the businesses surrounding our trail network that depend on those visitor numbers are also being impacted,” Long said. Jay Peak Resort, which is just a few miles south of the international border, has seen similar fallout. “I think people are maybe ‘under-seeing' the impacts it's having on border communities and border economies up here, that rely on Canadians for their top and bottom line,” said Wright, who also spoke at a June 11 forum on tariff impacts hosted by US Senators Ben Ray Luján and Catherine Cortez Masto. “About 50% of our traffic is Canadian, and 60% in the summer,” Wright said. “There will almost certainly be a reduction in workforce if we don't get this turned around.” Jay Peak Resort has long offered “at-par” pricing for Canadians, allowing them to use Canadian dollars to pay the USD list price for lift tickets and more — a substantial savings as the US dollar remains strong. Emma Arian, the executive director of Vermont Brewers Festival, decided to roll out at-par pricing for their two-day craft beer event in July, which brings together some of the state's 77 breweries for tastings on the Burlington, Vermont, waterfront. In addition to the Canadian-only discount, Arian also recruited a trio of Quebec breweries — including Dieu du Ciel! and Messorem — to participate in the event, serving craft brews alongside their American counterparts. “We hope to capture the spirit of collaboration — and gratitude.” Last month, Maine Governor Janet Mills unveiled new signs reading “Bienvenue Canadiens,” which are currently being installed along interstates and at ports of entry. New, bilingual signage is cropping up in the Adirondacks region, too. One hotel group based in Portland, Maine, has a “Canadian special” at its five properties, with discounts ranging from 10% to 15%. In Washington State, a group of tourism businesses launched an “Open Arms for Canada” campaign, in which participating locations — from Seattle's Pacific Science Center to the seaside Semiahmoo Resort that's just shy of the international border — offered a weekend-long 30% discount to Canadian visitors in May. Car trips to the US by Canadian residents were down 35.2% in April when compared with 2024. It was the fourth consecutive month of year-on-year contraction, with effects that are touching red and blue states alike. North Dakota has lost an estimated $13.4 million in spending by Canadian visitors, said a representative for the state's tourism and marketing department. Hotel bookings across Montana by Canadians were down 73% in January through March, said Discover Kalispell executive director Diane Medler, who noted that visitors from Canada account for 90% of her own city's international guests. Hoteliers have told her cancellations are hurting their bottom lines, particularly in the cooler spring season. “Canadians help to boost our visitation year-round,” Medler told CNN. “That loss is especially hard during those slower months.” In an April radio address, Maine governor Mills described widespread cancellations by Canadian visitors calling off plans to visit the state's campgrounds and resorts. Tiny Point Roberts, Washington, which has long relied on majority-Canadian tourism, has gone eerily silent, said Wayne Lyle, president of the Point Roberts Chamber of Commerce. If Canadians opt out of US vacations this year, it will affect more than northern states — it will be a drag on the nationwide economy. Analysts from the travel industry website Skift have noted that even a relatively modest 10% decline in spending would translate to a $2 billion loss. Air travel by Canadian residents to the US was down nearly 20% in April when compared with the same month in 2024, according to Canada's national statistics office.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At Home, a popular home goods retailer with 260 stores across 40 US states, has filed for bankruptcy, citing the backdrop of tariff increases and a slowdown in consumer spending. The Dallas-based company announced Monday that it had entered an agreement with its lenders that “will eliminate substantially all” of its roughly $2 billion in debt and provide $200 million in fresh funding to keep At Home operating while it navigates the Chapter 11 process. Businesses across the United States are grappling with uncertainty about tariffs, including on the countries from which At Home sources its products, notably China. At one point, American tariffs on that country were as high as 145% before an agreement last month to temporarily lower that to 30%. A pullback in discretionary spending in the US in recent years has also spelled trouble for the home goods industry, with The Container Store, Bed Bath & Beyond and Big Lots all filing for bankruptcy. However, the main problem for At Home is its “extensive debt that the company had on its balance sheet,” according to Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData. “This was not sustainable and its elimination under Chapter 11 will provide a more stable basis on which the company can operate.” He added that At Home's proposition is “weak” and is “not sufficiently differentiated to compete against rivals like Ikea, Wayfair and others.” “There is way too little inspiration and not nearly enough excitement to draw people in to the stores, particularly in areas where competition is high,” Saunders wrote in a note. At Home, which sells a wide variety of items such as furniture, rugs and other home accessories, said it would continue to operate as usual, including fulfilling orders, paying vendors and maintaining its loyalty program during the Chapter 11 process. However, the privately held company hinted that it might close some locations, saying that a “majority of our stores will remain open.” The Wall Street Journal recently reported that around 20 At Home locations were set to shutter. Upon exiting Chapter 11, At Home “will move forward with new owners and a meaningfully strengthened balance sheet,” Weston said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this photo released by The Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, Faust's attorneys, Wisconsin dairy farmer Adam Faust, who is suing the Trump administration alleging discrimination against white farmers like him, poses inside his dairy barn in Chilton, Wisconsin, in 2021. (The Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty via AP) MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin dairy farmer alleged in a federal lawsuit filed Monday that the Trump administration is illegally denying financial assistance to white farmers by continuing programs that favor minorities. Faust was among several farmers who successfully sued the Biden administration in 2021 for race discrimination in the USDA's Farmer Loan Forgiveness Plan. The new lawsuit alleges the government has continued to implement diversity, equity and inclusion programs that were instituted under former President Joe Biden. “After being ignored by a federal agency that's meant to support agriculture, I hope my lawsuit brings answers, accountability, and results from USDA.” Trump administration spokesperson Anna Kelly did not immediately respond to an email Monday seeking comment. The lawsuit contends that Faust is one of 2 million white male American farmers who are subject to discriminatory race-based policies at the USDA. Faust participates in one program designed to offset the gap between milk prices and the cost of feed, but the lawsuit alleges he is charged a $100 administrative fee that minority and female farmers do not have to pay. Faust also participates in a USDA program that guarantees 90% of the value of loans to white farmers, but 95% to women and racial minorities. That puts Faust at a disadvantage, the lawsuit alleges. Faust has also begun work on a new manure storage system that could qualify for reimbursement under a USDA environmental conservation program, but 75% of his costs are eligible while 90% of the costs of minority farmers qualify, the lawsuit contends. A federal court judge ruled in a similar 2021 case that granting loan forgiveness only to “socially disadvantaged farmers” amounts to unconstitutional race discrimination. In its April letter to the USDA, the law firm that has a long history of representing Republicans said it didn't want to sue “but there is no excuse for this continued discrimination.” Trump has been aggressive in trying to end the government's DEI efforts to fulfill a campaign promise and bring about a profound cultural shift across the U.S. from promoting diversity to an exclusive focus on merit.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>﻿The wild reason why bird advocates are releasing these reviled insects from the sky. But in Hawaii, this scenario is very much real. A remotely operated aircraft, about 8 feet long, is flying over remote forests in Maui and releasing cup-shaped capsules full of mosquitoes. As scary as it might sound, the project is a clever solution to a problem that has long plagued the Hawaiian islands. Hawaii faces an extinction crisis: It has lost hundreds of animals in the last two centuries, including dozens of land snails and birds, largely due to the spread of non-native species like stray cats and feral pigs. Many native animals found nowhere else on Earth are now gone for good. Scientists on the islands are quite literally racing to save what wildlife remains. For the state's avian species — its iconic forest birds, significant, too, to Indigenous Hawaiian culture — the main force of extinction is malaria, a mosquito-borne disease. There were once more than 50 species of these colorful songbirds across Hawaii, and today all but 17 are extinct. As I've observed firsthand, the forests here have grown silent. The few honeycreeper species that persist today have been able to evade malaria largely because they live in higher elevations that are too cold for mosquitoes. Saving these birds is quite literally a race against the clock. For more than a year now, a group of environmental organizations have been dropping biodegradable containers of mosquitoes into honeycreeper habitats on Maui and Kauai from helicopters. Now they're starting to do it with giant drones. They're all males, which don't bite, that have been reared in a lab. More importantly, they contain a strain of bacteria called wolbachia that interferes with reproduction: When those males mate with females in the area, their eggs fail to hatch. The approach has little ecological downside, said Chris Farmer, Hawaii program director at American Bird Conservancy, a conservation group that's leading the drone effort. Mosquitoes are not native, so local ecosystems and species don't rely on them. “What this does is it erects an invisible barrier so that these mosquitoes can't get up to the forests where these birds remain,” Farmer told Vox. Nearly all of those were in containers tossed out of helicopters, which allow scientists to deliver the insects to remote forest regions where the birds remain. The group is now testing drones as an alternative. They're also easier to fly on demand, says Adam Knox, the drone pilot and project manager for aerial deployment of mosquitoes at American Bird Conservancy. Dropping mosquitoes out of drones and choppers may sound unreal, but it's the best idea out there to help Hawaii's honeycreepers, said Marm Kilpatrick, an avian malaria expert at the University of California Santa Cruz. Scientists don't yet know if unleashing reproductively challenged mosquitoes is working and causing the resident mosquito population to crash. But the same approach has worked elsewhere — to stem mosquitoes that spread diseases among humans. Global health advocates have released mosquitoes with wolbachia strains that disrupt reproduction in other parts of the world and seen a massive decline in the incidence of, for example, dengue fever. “It sounds weird to say, but we're standing on the shoulders of human disease,” Farmer said. Ultimately, the goal is not total elimination of mosquitoes that carry avian malaria in Hawaii. That's likely impossible, Kilpatrick said, unless scientists could release millions or even billions of lab-grown insects all at once. Barring any regulatory or technical problems, drone deployments will soon be a regular part of that effort. “This is the last chance to save most of our remaining songbirds,” Farmer said. You may not know about it either, but the program helps keep people — and animals — in good health. What most of us get wrong about animal instincts. This is what happens when you put a clownfish in hot water. Now they're earning thousands of dollars to help save them.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Children's Defense Fund Program Director Graciela Camarena assists Lucia Salazar with filling out Medicaid and SNAP application forms for her family in Pharr, Texas, Nov. 13, 2023. Activists with the Poor People's Campaign protest against spending reductions across Medicaid, food stamps and federal aid in President Donald Trump's spending and tax bill being worked on by Senate Republicans this week, outside the Supreme Court in Washington, Monday, June 2, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — As Republican senators consider President Donald Trump's big bill that could slash federal spending and extend tax cuts, a new survey shows most U.S. adults don't think the government is overspending on the programs the GOP has focused on cutting, like Medicaid and food stamps. Americans broadly support increasing or maintaining existing levels of funding for popular safety net programs, including Social Security and Medicare, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. They're more divided on spending around the military and border security, and most think the government is spending too much on foreign aid. Here's the latest polling data on how Americans view federal funding: About half of U.S. adults say “too little” funding goes to Medicaid, which is a government health care coverage program for low-income people and people with certain disabilities. Nearly half, 45%, say food and nutrition assistance programs like food stamps, SNAP or EBT cards are underfunded, according to the poll. About 3 in 10 U.S. adults in each case say those programs are receiving “about the right amount” of funding, indicating that most Americans likely do not want to see significant cuts to the two programs. Republicans are especially likely to say “too much” is spent on food and nutrition assistance programs when compared with Democrats and independents — 46% of Republicans say this, compared with about 1 in 10 Democrats and independents. When it comes to Medicaid, fewer Republicans, about one-third, say the government is spending “too much.” About 6 in 10 Americans say there is not enough government money going toward Social Security, Medicare or education broadly. But Democrats overwhelmingly think “too little” money is allocated to these areas, while Republicans are happier with the status quo. Very few think Medicare, Social Security and education are getting “too much” funding. Roughly one-quarter of Republicans say too much is spent on education. When it comes to Social Security, about half of Republicans say “too little” is spent, compared with about 7 in 10 Democrats. Republicans are much less likely to say “too little” is being spent on border security than they were before Trump took office again in January. Now, 45% of Republicans say “too little” is being spent, down from 79% in a January AP-NORC poll. The Trump administration has asked Congress for deep reductions to foreign aid programs, including cuts to global health programs and refugee resettlement initiatives. Most U.S. adults, 56%, say the U.S. government is spending too much on assistance to other countries, which is down from 69% in an AP-NORC poll from March 2023. There is a deep partisan divide on the issue, though. The AP-NORC poll of 1,158 adults was conducted June 5-9, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 4 percentage points.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BANFF, Canada – President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will face off on Monday during the 2025 Group of Seven leaders summit in Canada, with their second meeting carrying higher stakes than their first. Months after mocking former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as governor of the 51st U.S. state and relishing in the negotiating pressure caused by his tariffs, Trump and Trudeau's successor will convene on Carney's home turf. Carney needs to be careful about bending the knee,” Jeremy Ghio, a senior director at Montreal-based public affairs firm TACT and a Canadian political analyst, told the Washington Examiner. Although Canada is in a “better position” with the U.S. than under Trudeau, “nobody is safe” from Trump's “temperament,” according to the former Trudeau government official. As host of the G7, Carney now has a tougher task of not only making progress on his relationship with Trump on issues such as trade, but also making sure Trump gets along with everyone else, too. That 2018 Charlevoix meeting is remembered for being the one during which Trump was photographed with his arms crossed across from former German Chancellor Angela Merkel before he decided to unendorse the leaders' communique. Trump's decision was prompted by Trudeau promising during his post-summit press conference to retaliate against the president's tariffs. That communique was the first in G7 history not to be endorsed by all leaders at a summit. “They don't want this feeling of it's a G6 plus one, and that image that came out of the 2018 G7 summit is in everyone's mind and everyone wants to avoid it,” Lipsky told reporters in a pre-summit briefing. For Caitlin Welsh, who was part of Trump's White House National Security Council and National Economic Council before becoming a director at the CSIS, the 2018 summit has cast a “long shadow” over its 2025 counterpart. “If it [Canada] wants a unified outcome of this year's G7 leaders' summit, then it should stick close to traditional G7 values while avoiding controversial topics,” Welsh told reporters during a CSIS pre-meeting briefing. Canadians are concerned that Trump will continue to weaponize tariffs against them as he did early during his second administration, particularly with auto and lumber industry duties. And that is before the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal, which Trump negotiated during his first administration, will be reviewed next year. “While a detente between North American neighbors will be too tall an order [this] week, bilateral discussions on an off-ramp would send a strong signal to North American supply chain partners, investors, and workers.” In an interview with the Washington Examiner, Lipsky underscored how Canada has received some tariff relief under Trump's exemptions, especially with USMCA-compliant products, but that the residual steel, aluminum, and auto duties are “still a factor.” “Entrepreneurs in Canada are looking towards new markets – Europe, France, Asia, even India,” he said. But Noonan, a Toronto businessman, criticized Canada's news media for undercovering how the government has permitted “China to dump steel into our market for years, hence the tariffs.” “Canada's only viable future rests with being the 51st state, provided we keep our cultural heritage and traditions, as well as our treaties with First Nations,” the 59-year-old said. “Debt levels, negative growth, and faulting [gross domestic product], coupled with out-of-control corruption, spending, and [Chinese Communist Party] influence, our country risks collapse in the near future. “Trump is a politician who will say the same thing at home as he does abroad.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The suspected shooter of two Minnesota state legislators was arrested on Sunday evening in a wooded area near his home in Green Isle, Minnesota. Vance Boelter is believed to have shot Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman, her husband, state Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife in two separate incidents on Saturday. “It cannot be the norm; it cannot be the way that we deal with our political differences,” Walz said. “That was taken from us in Minnesota with the murder of Speaker Hortman.” Walz condemned inflammatory rhetoric and suggested it was linked to political violence, but the former vice presidential candidate has a history of making incendiary comments as well. “Donald Trump's got this big rally going at Madison Square Garden,” Walz said. “And I'm going to start with the flashing red light. Donald Trump's modern-day Gestapo is scooping folks up off the streets.” Walz's comments drew criticism from Republicans and Department of Homeland Security employees. “While politicians like Walz fight to protect criminal illegal aliens, our ICE officers will continue putting their lives and safety on the line to arrest murderers, kidnappers, and pedophiles that were let into our country by the previous administration's open border policies,” she added.</p>
