GOP Tax Bill:

The Senate's version of President Donald Trump's tax bill calls for a $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction — a placeholder figure as Republicans remain divided over the valuable tax break.

The draft bill — slated to be released later on Monday — includes the current $10,000 SALT cap, according to a person familiar with the matter. But the Senate will continue to negotiate the deduction as it aims to pass the legislation by a self-imposed July 4 deadline.</p>

Michael Saylor during the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas.

Michael Saylor's Strategy bought $1.05 billion in Bitcoin in the last seven days, the third consecutive week in which the cryptocurrency treasury company has used preferred shares exclusively instead of common stock to fund purchases. 

The company formerly known as MicroStrategy Inc. purchased 10,100 Bitcoin from June 9 to June 15 at an average price of $104,080, according to a filing Monday. The haul was the largest by Strategy in five weeks, raising its total holdings to roughly $63.4 billion. </p>

The ETF market has hit a symbolic turning point: active funds now outnumber passive ones for the first time, marking a sharp break from the industry's index-tracking origins — even if actively managed assets still account for just a tenth of assets.

Roughly 51% of the nearly 4,300 US-listed exchange-traded funds are ones overseen by fund managers who have more discretion to pick stocks or other securities, eclipsing index-following products for the first time, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. The number of active ETFs has more than doubled in the past five years, from just 23% in 2020. </p>

Justin Sun, the China-born crypto entrepreneur with ties to the Trump family who saw a federal investigation of his business interests paused earlier this year, is set to take his Tron blockchain platform public in the US through a reverse merger.   

SRM Entertainment Inc., a maker of toys and related projects, said in a statement Monday that it entered into a securities purchase agreement with a “private investor” for a $100 million equity investment. The name of Winter Park, Florida-based SRM will be changed to Tron Inc. and Sun will serve as an adviser. SRM said the investor is an affiliate of Sun, while Sun confirmed his involvement to Bloomberg News.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Global investors may be underpricing the impact of a conflict between Israel and Iran, market watchers warned on Monday, as stocks rallied despite escalating warfare in the Middle East. The two regional powers continued trading fire on Monday, marking the fourth consecutive day of fighting since Israel launched airstrikes against Iran last week. Despite the continued fighting — with hundreds reported dead — global stock markets sustained a positive momentum on Monday, seemingly shrugging off broader concerns about the conflict. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, warned on Monday that there was a risk markets were underpricing "the risk of a major conflagration in the Middle East," particularly when it comes to the energy market. European shares opened broadly higher on Monday, with Asia-Pacific stocks and U.S. stock futures also trading in the green. Even Middle Eastern indexes saw gains on Monday, with the Tel Aviv 35 index last seen trading 1% higher after falling 1.5% last week. "This is partly because there are so many moving parts and geopolitical considerations, and partly because the potential outcomes are so unthinkable," Mould said. "In a worst case, oil and share prices would be the least of our worries." Torbjorn Soltvedtp, principal Middle East analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, agreed, saying an escalation remained of "huge concern." "What we have now is very different, and what we're seeing is effectively a war and an open-ended one," he told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe." "And of course, that is something that has huge implications, not just for the region, but also for energy markets and how they interpret what is happening. While Friday marked the biggest single-day gain for crude since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, however, global benchmark Brent crude futures — last seen at $73.75 a barrel — were still far below the prices seen in the aftermath of Moscow's incursion into Ukrainian territory. "A lull is the most likely outcome before later escalation when Iran rejects US Trump's overtures," Roche said. I would use the lull to buy into energy assets as a safe haven." Some market watchers are taking a somewhat less pessimistic view, however. In a note on Monday, Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid noted that while both Iran and Israel had traded retaliatory blows, they had so far avoided "the most extreme escalatory steps." "As geopolitical shocks are becoming more frequent it seems it's now at least a yearly occurrence that we refer to our equity strategists' work on the impact of such shocks and how long it takes for the market to recover from them," he said. "[Our strategists] believe this incident will likely be milder than this unless we get notable escalation as they highlight that equity positioning is already underweight … and a -6% selloff would need it to fall all the way to the bottom of its usual range." "Still, the market reaction has been very modest, so there is room for disappointment if things were to escalate," Gijsels conceded on Monday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The stands of at least two major Israeli defense firms were blocked off to attendees at the Paris Air Show on Monday, in a move Israel said was ordered by the French government following a dispute over the displays. Boards were placed around the pavilions of firms including Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), which were showcasing examples of military hardware. The booths of Rafael and Uvision were also shuttered, according to Reuters. CNBC has not independently verified this report. "Last night, just one day before the Paris Air Show opened in Le Bourget Airport, exhibition organizers acting on behalf of the French government ordered the removal of offensive weapons systems from Israeli defense industry pavilions — breaking with standard practice at defense exhibitions worldwide," Israel's Defense Ministry said in a statement. The French are hiding behind supposedly political considerations to exclude Israeli offensive weapons from an international exhibition - weapons that compete with French industries," it said. Israeli defense firms have been promoting new products set to unveil at the Paris event — one of the biggest in the aviation world — such as Elbit's PAWS-2 (HR) infrared missile warning system. Defense is a major focus in Paris this year amid geopolitical tensions and pledges for higher European security spending, along with relatively subdued demand by commercial airlines to place major new orders given existing backlogs. Other defense firms present at the show include the U.S.'s Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, European missile manufacturer MBDA and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, while hundreds of military delegations are set to attend. "Last night, after our booth was set up and ready for the show, we were asked to remove some of our systems from the booth," IAI's President and CEO Boaz Levy said in a statement. "We tried to negotiate with them, but it seems these orders came from the highest levels in Paris," Levy said, adding the company had received authorization to participate in the show and complied with organizers' requests. Levy said he was "shocked" by the decision and alleged discrimination. The move comes amid escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, with deadly air strikes between the countries continuing for a fourth day on Monday. Israel launched a series of strikes Friday targeting locations it said were related to Iran's nuclear program, killing several senior military officials. France's government and President Emmanuel Macron have meanwhile increased their criticism of Israel over its ongoing military operation in Gaza in recent months, with a joint statement from the United Kingdom, France and Canada in May calling the level of human suffering there "intolerable." — CNBC's Charlotte Reed contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Steel shares jumped Monday after President Donald Trump approved its controversial merger with Japan's Nippon Steel. U.S. Steel shares closed about 5% higher at $54.85. Trump issued an executive order on Friday that allowed U.S. Steel and Nippon to finalize their merger so long as they signed a national security agreement with the U.S. government. U.S. Steel said Friday that the national security agreement includes a golden share for the U.S government, without specifying what powers the government would wield with its share. Republican Pennsylvania Sen. Dave McCormick told CNBC in May that the share gives the U.S. government control of several board seats. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick detailed the rights that the U.S. government has with its golden share in a social media post Saturday. Trump has avoided calling the U.S. Steel-Nippon transaction a merger, describing the deal instead as a "partnership." U.S. Steel confirmed in a regulatory filing Monday that the company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America. "All regulatory approvals required for the completion of the Transaction have been received," U.S. Steel said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. "The Transaction remains subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, and is expected to be completed promptly." We want to hear from you.

An investigation into the complexity of the global telecom system shows weaknesses in the transmission of secret codes sent via SMS.

Every day, millions of people sign in to their email, banking app or social media accounts with both their password and a one-time login code they receive by text message. The codes often arrive with a warning: “Do not share this with anyone.” The recipients of those warnings, though, have no way of knowing who saw it before it got to them.

When companies generate messages with one of these so-called two-factor authentication codes, they almost never send them directly. Instead they outsource the job, passing the codes through a thicket of intermediaries before they arrive at their destinations. Because of inherent weaknesses in SMS—the decades-old technology standard used for text messages—it's possible for entities that handle such messages to see their content. But the complexity of the system means neither the sender nor the recipient can be sure exactly who's handled them along the way.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That may not be the case for much longer. The robotaxi dealt with everything London's chaotic driving environment could throw at it, with Wayve CEO Alex Kendall, who joined for the ride, saying it was one of the more eventful trips he'd taken. After a quick look around Wayve's Kings Cross base, we hopped in a Ford Mach-E equipped with the company's "AI driver" self-driving system. Wayve's upcoming robotaxi service with Uber will be fully driverless, but for now, the company is testing with safety drivers who take over if the robotaxi runs into problems. London's streets are famously complex, so much so that taxi drivers are required to learn thousands of them off by heart in a 150-year-old exam known as "The Knowledge." The city's hodgepodge of Roman and Victorian roads are a mess of cycle lanes and pedestrian crossings, with complex road layouts that often serve more as a rough guide than a rulebook for the millions of drivers passing through the city each day. The company says its AI driver — which runs on an end-to-end AI model, an approach also adopted by Tesla — is capable of generalizing and reacting to the physical world in the same way a human would, unlike rivals like Waymo, which rely on high-definition maps and sensors. Kendall said that this allows Wayve's software to drive anywhere, even places it hasn't seen before, and deal with the kind of unexpected encounters that are an everyday occurrence on the streets of a major city like London. "I can't wait to see another autonomy company come into London because I think it's extremely challenging," said Kendall. "The advantage of starting in London is that we've been forced to develop a system that can operate on complex roads and deal with all of these unexpected scenarios," he added. We also had to inch through narrow gaps between rows of parked cars. Perhaps understandably, Wayve's robotaxi was more cautious than your average Uber driver. On one occasion, the robotaxi came to a jerky stop at an amber light when it may have had enough time to go through. Sometimes, that caution was too much for London's impatient commuters. One maneuver that saw the car slowly navigate a tight gap between a set of roadworks and a row of traffic drew an irate honk from the car behind, which was clearly keen for us to hurry up. Wayve has been testing its autonomous vehicles on the streets of London for years, but they still run into the odd surprise. Around halfway into our drive, we came across a roadblock as a team of workers trimmed an overhanging tree. Working out the safe moment to move forward would be daunting even for a human driver, but the car spotted an opening and moved through the zebra crossing quickly, avoiding traffic building up behind us. "Lots of autonomy systems, I think, would be stuck here for hours," said Kendall, explaining that moments like this required the robotaxi's AI software to track and predict the activity of dozens of pedestrians. While coming to a stop at a red light, we narrowly avoided being hit by a small piece of metal that fell off the truck in front as it accelerated away. Kendall said for some of those places, Wayve had little to no training data, demonstrating the ability of its software to apply what it has learnt to completely new cities and driving environments. "If robotaxis are just going to be in affluent areas like the Bay Area, then we've failed as an industry. We've got to make sure this technology is rolled out globally," Kendall said. The launch of a driverless ride-hailing service with Uber in London, which will be the first time Wayve has taken the safety driver out of its vehicles, is a big step toward that vision. Over 99% of road accidents are due to human error, and this technology can eliminate those," he said. My ride in Wayve's robotaxi ended with the car smoothly negotiating a double roundabout, a fairly common feature on UK roads that is rare in the US. While self-driving cars are now a reality, the history of the industry is littered with broken promises, high-profile failures, and impressive tech demos that have failed to pan out. Saber Fallah, professor of safe AI and autonomy at the University of Surrey, told BI that while Wayve's AI-focused approach to self-driving was "bold and innovative," he was skeptical about how soon the company would be able to build a robotaxi network in a city as complex as London. "Unlike cities like Phoenix, where many Level 4 trials have taken place, London presents an extremely dynamic and unpredictable environment," said Fallah, adding that the vehicles would need to understand informal social cues and context between drivers and reason about their intent. Fallah said that one issue with Wayve's approach is that the "black box" nature of end-to-end AI systems might make it difficult to understand why robotaxis based on this tech make decisions, potentially undermining public trust. Despite calling the planned robotaxi pilot an "exciting step" for self-driving cars in the UK, Fallah warned that Uber and Wayve would have to navigate challenging liability and regulatory issues while building public confidence in the frontier technology. "Achieving consistent, safe operation without fallback drivers in central London will be an enormous hurdle," he added. Whether Uber and Wayve can run rides like the one I experienced in London a hundred times a day, in rain, sun, fog, and hail, will be the ultimate test.
