                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dino Prizmic took a few weeks off after winning Zagreb, but had no issues finding that form in Bratislava to pick up his 10th win in a row. Tristan Schoolkate is nearing a Top 100 debut, while Joao Lucas Reis da Silva was flawless in his campaign for a maiden title in Santa Fe. While no singular upset was as huge as the one from last year, he posted wins over strong grass-courters like Mikhail Kukushkin, Billy Harris, and former Wimbledon junior champion Shintaro Mochizuki. His hyper-aggressive style of play led to some wild matches in Ilkley as well, but this time he was coming out on top in these encounters. That included coming back from 1-3 down in sets 2 and 3 against Harold Mayot and surviving a deciding set tie-break against Sho Shimabukuro to make his first grass Challenger final. The player putting on more pressure was Schoolkate, who eventually claimed his 3rd Challenger title 6-7(8) 6-4 6-3 and now finds himself just 40 points outside the Top 100. He came from the qualifying there before only losing to Jay Clarke and also had to work his way into the main draw in Perugia. The most important win of this run had him save 2 match points to fight his way back into the match against Oriol Roca Batalla from 3-6 2-5 down. Andrea Pellegrino had the best week of his career in Estoril about a month ago, defeating World No. The Italian had gone a bit quiet since, but was able to find his groove after a gritty win from 4-6 1-3 down against Gabriele Piraino. From Piraino it went to Federico Bondioli, then Francesco Passaro, and eventually Luca Nardi. Once Pellegrino catches fire, he gets very tough to stop. To make matters worse, the Bosnian cramped up in the second set and Pellegrino expertly erased a 0-40 deficit at 3-all to avoid getting in trouble. Soon after, he claimed his 4th Challenger title 6-2 6-4 and is now back to career-high No. Valentin Royer slowed down recently after his incredible achievements in March/April when he was in the semifinals of five consecutive Challengers, winning two of them and making a further final. Getting back on track took some impressive resilience as the Frenchman was down a set in three consecutive matches to begin the event. 1 seed Alexander Shevchenko to reach his 4th final of the season. Dino Prizmic was the champion in Zagreb recently and didn't play again until Bratislava. Despite being able to produce a high level sporadically over the past year or so, the Croat kept battling various physical issues and couldn't combine his good performances into runs. That situation might be handled now as Prizmic was in phenomenal form all week, not dropping more than four games in a set on the way to the final. That included quality wins over Henrique Rocha or Cristian Garin. The patterns of play weren't that different in this encounter, but this time the 19-year-old had more to stand up to his opponent with. A mammoth second set (around 80 minutes) decided the match as Royer blew a 6-3 lead in the tie-break with Prizmic taking his 3rd Challenger title 6-4 7-6(6). And that's despite Gakhov seemingly having him on the ropes at 6-2 3-1. But the Spanish youngster had long been considered a prospect and with two stacked ITF titles claimed this season, it was time to produce something at the higher level. Players like Kyrian Jacquet or Luca Van Assche had no answer to his game with only Henri Squire coming any close as Merida reached his first Challenger final. Trungelliti had a 3-11 record in Challenger finals and while he was dominating for 90% of the match on Sunday, these nerves presented themselves eventually. Merida was able to run away with the second set but was once more under pressure in the decider, miraculously keeping himself in it on a few occasions. Trungelliti finally converted his 12th match point to claim his 4th Challenger title 6-3 4-6 6-3 and took a special exempt for Nottingham (on grass), while Merida sticks to the dirt in Royan. Joao Lucas Reis da Silva recently won an M25 title in Coquimbo and entered this event with a lot of confidence. The Brazilian has been known for his yearly week of peak performance, losing all three Challenger finals previously contested at 2022 Ambato, 2023 Coquimbo, and 2024 Florianopolis. But his ceiling has always been very high and didn't drop more than four games in a set on the way to his 4th final at this level, including a strong win over defending champion Andrea Collarini. Lautaro Midon had been looking for a Challenger breakthrough himself, reaching three quarterfinals this season and losing to Matheus Pucinelli de Almeida in back-to-back wins in Brazil recently. His matches were a bit more competitive than Reis da Silva's, but he also didn't drop a set on the way to the Santa Fe final. Santiago Rodriguez Taverna took him to a tie-break in the quarterfinals, while Dali Blanch had absolutely nothing to say as Midon outfoxed him in the final four. Midon will have his shots at Challenger titles in the future, but this was simply the week of Reis da Silva and there was nothing anybody could do about that. The Brazilian kept up his incredible standard of play from the previous encounters and while he could have closed it out a bit more efficiently, he still claimed his 1st Challenger title 6-4 6-3. Both players will stay in South America to play Santa Cruz this week. 700 play a ferret if he could see it from the stands. Always pleased by a beautiful one-handed backhand or classic volleying technique. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Today, he is vying for a spot in the U.S. Open. Kim, who now competes for Ohio State University, will take on Michael Zheng of Columbia University at 5 p.m. June 16 in a wild card playoff at the USTA National Campus in Orlando, Florida, with the event streamed live from the USTA National Campus website. “At this level, it's hard with very small margins, every match is pretty close,” Kim said June 13, just hours before boarding a plane for Florida. “But I have known (Zheng) for a while, we've trained together. Ozan Baris of Okemos, who plays tennis at Michigan State University, earned a spot by reaching the final of the NCAA men's single tournament in November. At that time, Kim, who has been playing tennis “since I could hold a racket,” was coached by his father Andrew, a former professional tennis player. Nearly a decade later, Kim is almost a foot taller at 6'3, prefers hard courts, and is under the tutelage of Ohio State coaches after transferring from the University of Florida. “A main part of this is my college coaches,” said Kim, who is majoring in sports industry at OSU and entering his junior year this fall. They are constantly working with me and helping my game.” Even with a grueling schedule, he says he has always enjoyed tennis and his dreams remain the same — to be a professional tennis player, compete in the Olympics, and to play in the U.S. Open. He is now just a few steps, and perhaps aces, away from making the U.S. Open dream come true. “I play pretty aggressive from the baseline, but my serve is a main focus,” Kim said. “I'm more of an all-court type player, but the serve is a big aspect in my game. If Kim wins the June 16 match, he will be guaranteed a spot in the qualifying rounds of the U.S. Open and could secure a berth in the world's biggest tournament with a win on June 18.“The determination to win always comes with nerves, but in high pressure situations, I embrace it a little easier,” said Kim, whose parents, Andrew and Alice Kim, now Orlando residents, will be on hand to watch their son play.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rafael Nadal has opened up about his experience watching the thrilling French Open final as a spectator this month. The match, which saw Carlos Alcaraz triumph over Jannik Sinner in a nail-biting 4-6, 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 7-6 victory after fending off three match points, had fans worldwide on the edge of their seats, including Nadal. Fellow tennis legend John McEnroe, who recently named the only player he'd pay to watch, hit the headlines during the French Open for turning up late for live TV coverage. Known as the 'King of Clay' for his dominance at Roland Garros, where he won 14 of his 22 Grand Slam titles, Nadal observed the Paris tournament for the first time since hanging up his racket last year. "I watched the tournament like any other fan, excited to see a place that was so important during my career and simply enjoying the tennis. "This is my new reality, I don't look beyond that." While attending a charity golf event in Spain, Nadal acknowledged being captivated by Alcaraz's comeback from a two-set deficit. He praised his fellow Spaniard's fifth Grand Slam win but cautioned that it's not guaranteed that Alcaraz and Sinner will maintain their dominance in the sport. "It was a match for the ages," he said. Ending up with the cup after Sinner was so close to taking it for so long, I'm very happy for him. "New stars will always appear, and here we have two of them. This win cements Alcaraz and Sinner's dominance in the sport, as they have now taken home the last six Grand Slam tournaments between them, a streak that started in September 2023 when Novak Djokovic won the U.S. Open. Djokovic, who is chasing a record-extending 25th Grand Slam title, will look to end Alcaraz and Sinner's dominance at either Wimbledon or the U.S. Open later this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Fritz has only just won his first ATP title of the 2025 season at the BOSS Open in Stuttgart. Fritz beat Alexander Zverev to win the ATP 250 tournament in Stuttgart for the first time in his career. While this is a positive sign of where Fritz's game is heading, he has now admitted that he has some limitations. Before Fritz beat Zverev in the Stuttgart final, he spoke on WTA player Caroline Garcia's Tennis Insider Podcast. “Yeah, I think one of my best abilities on the court is my mind and thinking, and I think I think really well on the court,” said Fritz. I want to understand why they're saying that and then maybe some situations, once we like talk it through, I still decide that I think my way of thinking is the right way to do it.” Fritz will not have much time to celebrate his Stuttgart victory, as he is playing in both singles and doubles, with Jiri Lehecka, at the Queen's Club Championships. Fritz's first round opponent at the ATP 500 tournament will be qualifier Corentin Moutet, in a first-time meeting between the pair. If he is able to match his result at Queen's from last year, Fritz could potentially play fifth seed Alex de Minaur or his doubles partner Lehecka. Jack Draper is a potential semi-final opponent for Fritz, and he would only play Carlos Alcaraz if both players reach the final.</p>

The Pole has been struggling to find the desired consistency and has been dealing with back issues since Miami. This was the reason he had to withdraw from the competition last week in Den Bosch and has led to his last-minute withdrawal from ATP Halle 2025. Hurkacz, who was on the same side of the draw as Jannik Sinner (potentially meeting in the quarterfinals), will lose the runner-up points from last season and, most importantly, will arrive at Wimbledon 2025 without being a seeded player. This makes him (assuming he's physically fit) one of the opponents to avoid in the first round. One more tough opponent to face in the draw of the third Grand Slam of the year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>No one must be happier that the clay season is over than USA's Taylor Fritz. After enduring a torrid time on the red dirt and crashing out in the first round of the French Open to Germany's Daniel Altmaier, Taylor Fritz rediscovered his missing form to capture his fourth ATP Tour title on grass and ninth overall on Sunday at the BOSS Open in Stuttgart, where he defeated World No. Thanks to the win, Fritz, who has now won his past five meetings against Zverev, will return to No. 4 in the ATP Rankings on Monday, overtaking British lefty Jack Draper following his triumph. Fritz's performance in Stuttgart was so much more impressive, judging from the fact that he did not drop a set all week at the ATP 250 event in Germany and became the first player to lift a tour-level trophy without losing serve since Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in Basel last October. By winning in Stuttgart, Fritz recorded his fourth career title on grass, putting him level alongside Matteo Berrettini and Nicolas Mahut. Only Novak Djokovic has more titles on grass (8) among active players. At the Queen's Club in London, the 37-year-old Tatjana Maria proved that age is just a number for her as she became the oldest champion on tour since Serena Williams in 2020, when she blew away four top 20 players to capture her first WTA 500 title at the HSBC Championships. Maria even came through the qualification to earn her ticket for the tournament, but went from strength to strength and capped off an amazing week of upsets to capture the title on Sunday with a 6-3, 6-4 final victory over No. 8 seed Amanda Anisimova of the United States. Mertens, who enjoyed plenty of support from friends and family in the final as 's-Hertogenbosch is only about an hour-and-a-half by car from Mertens' Belgian hometown of Leuven, won 6-3, 7-6(4) to secure her 10th career WTA singles title. Czech tennis star Karolina Muchova is currently going through a challenging period in her career. Following a disappointing loss at Roland Garros where she was defeated by the USA's Alycia Parks, Muchova crashed out of the 1/8-finals at Queen's to the champion Maria. Muchova has revealed she might need to undergo another surgery due to persistent pain in her left wrist, a procedure that could sideline the world No. Wrist problems continue to be an everlasting problem on the ATP and WTA Tours and should certainly not be underestimated. Just look at former Grand Slam winner Dominic Thiem, who never recovered his form and chose to retire after persistent wrist problems. Injuries have continued to disrupt Muchova's momentum throughout the season, raising questions if she will be able to recover her consistency which saw her reach the French Open final in 2023 and propelled her to a career-high ranking of No. That is always the last option for me, I don't want to have it. I will try some alternative solutions, but if they don't work, I will have to go back to the operating room," says Muchova. Elise Mertens launched one of the most improbable comebacks in recent WTA history on Saturday at the Libéma Open in 's-Hertogenbosch, when she managed to save no less than 11 match points in her 2-6, 7-6(7), 6-4 victory over Ekaterina Alexandrova in the semi-final. "I didn't even know it was 11, after one or two I lost count," Mertens said, after her comeback. Especially in the third set, I felt like, ‘OK, this is maybe my opportunity.' Diallo sealed the win with a superb backhand cross-court winner after a spectacular rally with the Belgian. It's not easy to complete a lob over the 1.98 metres tall Alexander Zverev, but Brandon Nakashima still managed to accomplish the virtually impossible challenge when he faced the German during last week's tournament in Stuttgart. Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz will be back on grass for the first time this season at ATP 500 events in Halle and London, respectively. 1 Sinner leads an impressive field at the Terra Wortmann Open in Germany, where spectators will also enjoy the chance to see Alexander Zverev, Daniil Medvedev and Joao Fonseca in action. At the HSBC Championships in London, Alcaraz is the main attraction in a draw that also features British No.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis icon Rafael Nadal has made an honest admission after watching the epic French Open final as a fan this month. However, he's now insisted there were no cravings to be on court as he watched the epic drama unfold in the final. Refuting suggestions that he would have loved to have been in the shoes of Alcaraz on the Court Philippe-Chatrier, Nadal said: “I don't feel like I would have liked to be there. “I watched the tournament like any other fan, excited to see a place that was so important during my career and simply enjoying the tennis. This is my new reality, I don't look beyond that.” Speaking from a charity golf tournament in Spain, Nadal did admit to being gripped as Alcaraz fought back from two sets down. However, despite voicing his pleasure at his compatriot winning his fifth Grand Slam title, he also warned it was no formality that he and Sinner would continue to dominate at the top level. “It was a match for the ages,” he said. Ending up with the cup after Sinner was so close to taking it for so long, I'm very happy for him. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. New stars will always appear, and here we have two of them. Alcaraz and Sinner have now won the last six Slam tournaments between them. That run dates back to September 2023 when Novak Djokovic prevailed at the US Open.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Fritz, on Sunday, won his fourth ATP Tour title on grass and ninth overall, as he beat World No. While American produced a splendid show on serve in the rain-disrupted final to maintain his dominant recent record against the German, the result brought bad news for Novak Djokovic ahead of Wimbledon. Jack Draper, previously ranked fourth, failed to defend his crown in Stuttgart as he suffered an opening-round exit, and hence fell to the sixth position in the live rankings. Fritz's move, hence, left Djokovic in the fifth spot. His current ranking means that the 24-time Grand Slam winner could face either Jannik Sinner (No. 1), Carlos Alcaraz (2) or in-form Zverev (3) and Fritz (4) in the quarterfinal. Djokovic still has the edge over the German, who he defeated comfortably in the Roland Garros quarterfinals earlier this month, and against Fritz, to whom he has never lost, but a potential spot in Alcaraz or Sinner's quarter could leave the former champion in danger of an early exit. Djokovic is an eight-time Wimbledon champion and has reached the final in each of the seven times he has played in London since 2018—which includes four titles in a row and two consecutive defeats to Alcaraz. Djokovic heads to London on the back of a semifinal exit at the Roland Garros earlier this month, where he lost to Sinner. An injury in Melbourne forced him to retire during the semifinal against Zverev in the Australian Open.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WME and its IMG Tennis division worked with the Scottish star athlete to develop a very different kind of tour, bringing him to venues where fans will place their mobiles in lockable pouches for a VIP experience. Scottish tennis icon Andy Murray is used to touring and playing on many a center court, including the famous Centre Court of Wimbledon. Now, he is taking the spotlight on a very different tour, one that will bring his new show Centre Stage to four U.K. venues in the run-up to Wimbledon 2025. In them, the former world number 1 player will look back at his tennis career, sharing anecdotes and insights on life on tour, the circuit and beyond. “In conversation with sports broadcaster Andrew Cotter, they'll recount intimate and untold moments from Andy's career,” a description of the show promises. “Having decided to retire after his final professional tournament at the 2024 Paris Olympics, Andy is going to explore what life is like off the court.” Watch a trailer for Andy Murray: Centre Stage here. The WME and IMG team working on the show say that Murray didn't simply want to be a talking head or analyst for a TV network or move into a similar traditional role for athletes once he retired from tennis. And he has a great sense of humor and is very knowledgeable about many different topics,” Chris Helliar, agent at IMG Tennis, tells THR. When Murray and the agents first brainstormed ideas when he was still an active player, they came up with all sorts of opportunities. We thought about the tour idea then, but it was after Andy retired that we sat down with him and went through a bunch of different ideas, and this was one that really stood out to him. Chris Payne, personal appearance agent at WME, shares that Murray needed some convincing that his fans would come out for a stage show. “We had to overcome Andy being so humble,” he tells THR. “And show business is so showy that there was a conversation we had about how to present this in a way that is very Andy Murray. “The concept of the tour and its announcement had to be such that fans knew straight away what they were going to watch, because for a tour, especially one that's not music-based, you don't really know what you're going to see,” she explains. There is a special twist to the stage show. “He likes to step out of the comfort zone, which this is, and it's something that hasn't really been done before by a tennis player.” Keeping away mobile phones is also part of the special fan club access feeling and experience that the stage show wants to provide. “This is such a unicorn that the idea of locking it off from the digital world is very exciting,” Payne tells THR. The stage show will have a rough structure but “it definitely won't be scripted,” Helliar tells THR. Murray also wanted to make sure his hard-core fans had an early chance to get tickets, but how do you organize presales opportunities when you don't have a music star-like fan mailing list? “We decided to work with Wimbledon LTA, which is the Lawn Tennis Association, and Andy's hotel in Scotland, Cromlix,” Patel shares. “We ran presales through them 48 hours before the general on-sale to give them the exclusivity that you would give music fans, and it worked really well. “Fan is just such a word thrown around, but if you are a fanatic about something, you will go to great lengths to see it,” Payne offers. “Chris and Meera have an idea of how shows sell, which I don't, but I know tennis and Andy,” he says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Born to tennis royalty, Draper's supreme work ethic and ascent up the rankings in the past 12 months have been astonishing. Here's why Kieran Jackson believes he poses a serious challenge to Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner for the Wimbledon title To pinpoint the exact moment where British No 1 Jack Draper launched his ascent to the upper echelons of men's tennis, you'd need only go back 12 months this very weekend. That week, as he has since acknowledged, something clicked in his big-hitting, flamboyant lefty game. A few days later, the Brit outgunned Carlos Alcaraz at Queen's. A career-high ranking of world No 4 for the 23-year-old from Sutton. Frustratingly, he will enter Queen's on Monday at No 5, behind Novak Djokovic, with his Stuttgart points dropping off. The summer of '24 was a huge turning point. Draper, the son of former LTA chief executive Roger and ex-British junior tennis champion Nicky, has struggled immensely with injuries and physical fitness since turning professional in 2021. Shoulder and hip issues – remember Andy Murray's issues with the latter – have plagued him, while he has regularly vomited on court in humid conditions. “Coming into last year, the only goal was to stay fit and healthy,” Draper's long-term coach, James Trotman, told the ATP website in March. Interestingly, Draper's short-term coaching trial with South African ex-pro Wayne Ferreira last summer did not last more than a few months, with the Brit ultimately placing complete trust in Trotman, who is double his age at 46. “We were at the point where it didn't matter how good he could be, or was going to be, our focus was to keep him fit. It's challenging to build up trust in your body again. ‘What are we going to do here, Jack? Who are the people we're going to put around you?' Sporting a backwards cap at all times – Lleyton Hewitt-esque – Draper emits something of a braggadocio persona; yet that could not be further from the truth. His heart in the heat of battle has never wavered. “He was very small until the age of 15 or 16. He grew up as a smaller player, having to compete against bigger guys, having to defend and find ways of being competitive against the stronger players who could hit him off the court. All of a sudden, he grows to 6' 4” and he's serving out of a tree and hitting the ball big. A big part of that coaching journey that we're still on today is to try and impose his weapons on the court and take the racquet out of his opponent's hand.” Draper was also able to learn from Murray during the latter stages of his career as part of the Davis Cup team, while showcasing his personality. In fact, not unlike the early stages of Murray's career. Pleasingly, Draper dedicated his most recent off-season, when nursing a hip injury, to his physical conditioning and notably employed a breathing coach. “I had a lot of problems with my sinuses when I was younger so I breathe a lot through my mouth,” explained Draper, having come through three back-to-back five-set matches at the Australian Open in January. “When you are anxious or have long points and you have to recover quickly, it's not efficient to breathe through your mouth. Fast-forward six months, Draper is one of the fittest athletes on tour. The Putney resident was back on court at Queen's ahead of the tournament, hitting with former world No 14 Kyle Edmund, who knows a thing or two about career-impacting injuries. Draper will play just one warm-up tournament, at Queen's, before Wimbledon. While still a step short of Sinner and Alcaraz's insane level of consistency, as shown by their magnificent five-hour-plus Roland-Garros final, the Briton has the potential to cause an upset if either player has an off day. His hard-hitting game is well-suited to the quick nature of grass-court tennis. Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jack Draper is back in Queen's this week, and will be hoping to enjoy a solid run ahead of Wimbledon later this month. However, any hopes of winning this upcoming Grand Slam will certainly have been reduced somewhat after watching the Roland Garros final just a few weeks ago. There, Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner put on the most magnificent display, battling through a five-set epic that left the tennis world, and many beyond it, stunned. Jack Draper has since sought to review the action. Speaking to the press ahead of his return to Queen's this week, one reporter wondered if Draper had made the time to watch that historic recent French Open final between Alcaraz and Sinner. I watched the last three sets, unbelievable tennis. ‘I think it inspired all the players and I think it captured the attention of all the spectators, all the people around the world, even people who aren't into tennis, it was one of those sporting moments I think everyone was embraced by, so I think Jannik and Carlos did an unbelievable show there. Asked if he felt like he could reach that level soon, Draper then continued: ‘Yeah, I mean, I think so. ‘I think, you know, the tennis they were playing that was, I think the combination of them two together, I think it was the moment they were in. ‘My friend said to me when we were watching them play, like, “How are they playing this way in this moment in this after five hours or something like that?” And I said, “I don't think they're thinking about anything. Jack Draper's relationship with Andy Murray was analysed by Jamie Murray over the weekend, and perhaps the 22-year-old can seek some counsel from the legendary Scotsman on how he can compete with such forces of nature. Draper has troubled Alcaraz in the past when they have played, beating him at Queen's this time last year, and on his way to his Indian Wells title earlier in 2025. However, much like the rest of the tour, Sinner proposes a wholly different challenge that he cannot seem to overcome. If he is to challenge for the Wimbledon title, he'll need to follow in Alcaraz's footsteps and try and unsettle Sinner with a variety of shots on this unique surface.</p>
